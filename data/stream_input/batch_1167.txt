B004WJRF6C|5.0|I love Paul McCartney and like Lennon and I consider him one of the greatest songwriters of ALL TIME. Having said that, I had a chance to listen to this entire album via AOL free and my immediate impression is that this album stinks. I am glad I did not buy it. The only saving grace on the album is the classic \\"Every Night\\" and the overplayed but still tunesy \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\". There are several instrumentals here but let's face it, The Beatles did not make it because they were the next coming of The Ventures. The instrumentals stink too! The Beatles/Mccartney/Lennon/Harrison are true tunesmiths who had the uncanny ability to piece together timeless melodies with great production.<br />Save your money (espcially in this time of great economic uncertainty) unless of course you are a banker with access to the bottomless pit of taxpayer money at your disposal.....but that is a review for another time and place........
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Basically Highschool of the dead is series that is very well animated, looks amazing in HD, has a rather excellent dub and a gripping story.    If you're a fan of zombies and emotional drama and fanservice this show mixes them together perfectly, the story basically starts off at a school where a teacher gets bitten and turned into a zombie, and then goes on to bite others until the school is swarmed with Zombies, several characters survive and form a group that through seemingly impossible situations, just wants to survive and find their loved ones.    There is a lot of fanservice in this show, but its good, and well animated, and refreshing even, the English audio is good, has a fair amount of swear words, and cultural references, by this I mean they added random lines like a reference to Palin in a certain scene.    Buy this awesome series now if you're a zombie fan, a fanservice fan, and a fan of action, and someone who is wondering what all 3 mixed together would look like.    I hope you enjoyed my non spoilerific review, that if you're lazy like me, and wondering if the show is worth buying, should answer your questions.    And if you live outside of America, Section 23/Sentai Filmworks locks their Blu Rays to A, Europe is Region B, so don't buy the Blu Ray if you're not American/Canadian or anyone who lives in the Region A area.
B0012GMZMW|4.0|I understand that Steve Perry wasn't on this album so a little something is missing but I think Jack Blades song writing is great (though the guitar solo on \\"World gone wild\\" is a bit too long).  I love his tunes.  I put this one in a stack of old and new Journey (six disc set on random) and nothing poked out as hey this isn't Journey.  I think they should invite Jack to write more often.  I like Augeri's singing and wish he hadn't been too ill to continue.  I previously was only familar with his voice from \\"Red 13\\" and \\"Armageddon.\\" After hearing this album, I like it much better.  One of my husband's co-workers saw him in concert and said it was just like being at a Steve Perry Journey concert so he was obviously good.  Though I think getting Steve Perry back would ultimately be better songwriting-wise he just added something to Jon Cain and Neal Schon who are great tune-smiths and I love \\"Bad English\\" songs but I think somehow John Waite must have motivated them to make their songs better just like I think Steve Perry did.  No great hits but a really solid album worth adding to your stack for the price they are selling it at.  \\"Kiss me softly\\" is definitely worth a listen if you want a nice romantic tune to set a mood for a romantic dinner.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|Stargate Universe killed Stargate on a whole, and with the recent sale of every known Stargate prop taking place in Vancouver, there is simply no hope for Stargate ever coming back, anytime soon.    Now lets take a look at this series in some detail.    In Season 1 we had a story about a group of people who were forced to board the Destiny to escape a Lucian Alliance attack on Icarus.    Now we know that they didn't choose to be aboard Destiny, this part is mentioned no end of times, the series takes a basic structure of what they wanted, and what they had to get, they needed CO2 scrubers, food, water etc.     It then took on a life of its own, exploring the relationships between the characters, all mostly unlikable, with some forced drama that would make most people cringe.    Despite having the Stargate name in its title, the gate was rarely used, although some aliens, and random situations were randomly pulled out the writers arse to make the show *deep* to the viewers, such as Eli and Chloe and Matt getting lost, and the attack on Destiny by Lucian Alliance.    Now how far have we come since Season 1? Well quite far but still not quite far enough.    The series contains many unlikable characters, and many 1 dimensional characters with little to no depth to them. You'l be watching this not really caring about the characters, and at the same time thinking why did they call this Stargate?    The new dynamic for this Season being The Lucian Alliance being aboard Destiny for a little while, and a little more into this *Cosmic Background Radiation* thing, and by a little more, absolutely nothing ever gets revealed by the end of the season.    What is your reason to watch this show?    - Unlikable characters  - Unrealistic situations  - Lack of Gate being used  - None of the bright peppy spirit the previous 2 shows had.    Although the series does eventually take a more action packed tone, I believe this is because the creators predicted, if not saw the decline of theshows ratings, basically they knew the audience didn't want a show like this and were trying to re invent it mid way through.    This could of been a good Season, but unfortunately you had moments in episodes where you simply think this could be really good, then suddenly you're presented with some quite ridiculus drama, or at the very most some scenes that completely ruin the episode.    Not wanting to spoil, but one of the episodes *Seizure* has Earth acting out of character to secure a supply line to Destiny by hijacking bodies of key leaders of Langara. The *Destiny* story being a certain character has trapped Rush without realising in a virtual Destiny so they can have sex together, and you guessed it, a somewhat out of character but still mildly interesting Langara story, is ruined by pointless drama from a certain female character thats acting all HAL(Remember that episode from the Simpsons with the house?).    The writing is just so shockingly bad that you find little reason to keep watching, Its like the writers were either out of ideas, or had no idea what direction to take the show.    Brad Wright made a statement saying fans will watch this show if it was good, and they won't if its bad, and as shown, the fans have spoken, in huge numbers.    Sadly this series has killed the Stargate francise, like Star Trek(well series wise) it will drift into an eternal slumber until someone with talent can come along and right the injustice done to the name.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|This album made me a Journey fan and relistening to it after all these years leaves me wondering why I ever took a break from listening.  Steve Perry is at the top of his game vocally.  Jonathan Cain brought a powerful new sound with him from his experience including the Babys.  Neal Schon is just never given enough credit as a great guitar player.  From the moment you hear the first notes of \\"Who's Crying Now,\\" \\"Open Arms,\\" or \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" and you know you are in for a treat.  While my favorite song is \\"Separate Ways\\" which is on \\"Frontiers,\\" I think they have some really simple and sweet songs (the above three and \\"Mother, Father\\" or \\"Still They Ride\\") on this album along with the harder songs that kick it up. The bonus live tracks sound fabulous for live.  The extra \\"La Raza del Sol\\" is a fun rather funky song that you'd expect on a Steve Perry Solo album more than a Journey album (it is more a kick-back to old Journey).
B00402FGE4|2.0|Bitter Angry Stargate Atlantis fan here(Well apparently you're this is you hate the show to the producers).    Lets begin.    Starting with a promising setup Stargate Universe begins at an offworld military base called Icarus, this is a base with personal researching the Ninth Chevron and the mysterys behind it, mostly a scientific outpost with a military presence. We have several characters introduced, including the randy Matt Scott who begins his life on the show in a closet with Vanessa James making love. The show also introduces characters such as Everett Young, Doctor Rush(Played by Robert Carlyle) and other promising faces that lure you into the belief that this could be a good Stargate series.    Unfortunately, it wasn't to be.    At first the show takes on a basic premise, such as them needing to fix the air supply, them needing water, food, power issues, things like that, okay you can forgive them for covering this, most of which could of been done in few episodes, if not one if done in the old Stargate style, however these are dragged out for most of the first 10 episodes, and comes across as really, really slow.    The fans of this show don't mind the slow as it sets the tone, however when a series has the name Stargate attached to it, you somewhat expect the show to move up a notice and get out of the dull Zzzzz area, however for most of this series, its stuck firmly in snooze and very rarely reawakes.    Before I begin with the characters, let me just remind you that this series contains no humor, and is very angsty, very aggressive, very angry, very dark, but very very flawed. The drama is forced, and borderline ridiculus.    The characters are one of the biggest flaws in the show.    - Unlikable Characters    None of the characters have any real personality, they come accross as one dimensional with little to no depth to them, throughout the whole series you'l be watching not caring if someone dies, or wanting to cringe because of the absurdness of their lines, I call this bad writing more than anything else.    - Sexist Portrayel of women    Basically the females in this Season have no depth to them, Chloe is miss horny who sleeps with Matthew Scott any chance she gets, she basically becomes so one dimensional you might think a 0 dimension exists, she is not likable and is rather bratty.    Another female being Vanessa James, with her overly large chest, is often wearing tight tanktops that sexualise her character, she again is another one dimensional character that lusts after Matthew Scott, she has no redeeming qualities, and comes accross sometimes as a really butch male with breasts(moobs).    The other female being TJ, the ships medic, she starts off very whiny, saying she cant do this, or that and what not and has issues with the angry commander Young, she is written to be very single minded, and without much of a mind of her own.    And lastly Camile Wray, the ships lesbian, somewhat boring, narrow minded self proclaimed second in command lady, her character is so dull that the writers have nothing much to focus her character on but to show her either conflicting with Young for no real reason, or to show the audience her relationship with her partner on Earth via the stones. She is more the angry Lesbian lady with no humor.    I could go into detail about the male characters but honestly, Young is the angsty somewhat psychotic commander that has fits of punch people in the face syndrome, Greer is the angry soldier that without restraint would of killed several characters, he is prone to punching people too, and Matt, Eli and others are just so ridicusly dull and unlikable.    For a show that is advertises drama as its core selling point it fails miserably.    Not to mention the Gate is rarely used, and the ship is so ridiculusly dark, you could mistake the show for something out of the Doom 3 videogame.    Make no mistake, this is not a family show, its not much of anything really, just a mess that trysto be deep but utterly fails, which is why no one watched it on the Syfy channel.    This series killed the Stargate name in America, there will be no SG1 or SGA movies, nothing, all the props are gone, sold, MGM have rid themselves of this series for now, and simply said the show has joined Star Trek in an eternal slumber, after being brutally destroyed by producers who have simply ran out of ideas and tried to reinvent a francise that didnt need to be.    Rest of peace Stargate, killed by SGU. Never forgotten, always in the hearts of true Stargate fans.
1439107955|5.0|The book describes a history of human encountering with cancer, from ancient Egypt to present days. The author's intention was to write a biography of cancer, probably the most feared disease. Human struggle to understand and cure the disease is portrayed. The author, an oncologist, did an excellent job in researching and putting together this cancer \\"biography\\" into a very readable book for lay person. For medical professionals, the emperor of all maladies gives a face to the disease.   Unlike reading scientific articles or medical textbooks, this book gives an interesting account of cancer, creates a personality rather than merely describing the facts. The readers feel engaged in the global movement to understand and treat cancer.  As a medical educator, I think this book is an example of how the diseases should be taught to health professional students. Mechanistic or biological approach is not good enough if it does not also include how the diseases influence human and their societies.
B004KD5TQI|3.0|I really enjoyed the film and I was excited for the soundtrack but there are only a handful of songs that really make this cd worth the purchase. The Bjork remix is extremely good!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Good movie. Worth your time to watch. Kind of weird filming, but I liked it. The whole movie is filmed from the vantage point of one person, kind of like if it was happening to you.
B004PR71JC|5.0|All of the tracks in this soundtrack are really good, and they completely capture the sound and feel of Brazil and Carnivale from the film. I especially like the Jamie Foxx love song he sings!
B000OP1M6M|4.0|Purchased 5/2011 from Amazon. Product arrived as advertised - on time (actually 1 day early); best price I saw; new with all stickers, instructions, box, etc.  Watched looked and worked as expected: a few seconds fast at first, then settled into ontime time keeping after normal combination of heavy activity, light activity, and sleeping.  No complaints.
0316056863|5.0|This book really was a fun read. I'm a 13 year old boy, but I still loved it. Tina Fey tells her story well and with a great sense of humor. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
6304712944|5.0|great classic movie. liked it when I was a kid, and like it now that I'm a young adult. When I become a father, I'm gonna have my kids watch it too.
0811875040|5.0|I love Miette Patisserie. When I found out they were coming out with a cookbook I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I just received it Friday and by Saturday morning I was already baking from it! The book is stunning. Gorgeous photos, adorable scalloped edges, easy to follow recipes. I made the caramel corn and peanut butter cookies and they are the best I have made! My daughter is also named Miette so I love having a keepsake cookbook with her name!
0897500482|5.0|A fantastic paperback book by the master himself. One thing you realize when reading this book is that Jeet Kune Do wasn't just a martial art it was a philosophy. Bruce lee has a philosophy that he turned into a martial art and vice versa. The book covers everything from training your body to your mind.     This book is the most widely known of the books published about Bruce Lees martial arts style but there was a series of smaller books that also covered his fighting style as well. I believe they may have been written by his wife. The first few books before even speaking about fighting talk about exercising and go over Bruce's training regiment. I started reading those books which later lead me to the book he wrote himself \\"Tao of Jeet Kune Do\\".     It's really an interesting approach to training martial arts. Even if you're not trying to become the next master this is still an excellent book to read if you're a fan of the man himself.
B001OGLPZI|5.0|Had this album for two years but first listened to it all the way through just 2 days ago. Surprised at how many of the songs I was already familiar with, and had no idea that John Prine had done them. This is one hell of an album. A true classic/masterpiece, whatever other hosannas you want to say. WOW!!!
0385737955|5.0|This is probably my favorite book I've read so far this year. It's so different than recent books I've read and I love that the protagonist is a guy and yet I still really identify with him. Sometimes I think there are less YA books out there that capture the attention of both male and female audiences but The Maze Runner really nails it.    This book is all about mystery and the psychological effects of not knowing anything - who you are or where you are and which one is worse?. In many cases in fiction, the main character doesn't know exactly what's going on, but the reader is given hints and we can predict a little of what can happen next. James Dashner doesn't do this at all, and it's amazing. I was kept in the dark just like Thomas and was just as confused by all the unhelpful answers he received when he asked the boys in the Glade the questions I also wanted to ask.     Another great thing about this book is that all the characters are so unique - they all have completely different personalities and quirks that made each one stand out so even though there are many, I was never confused about who was speaking. Each character had his own tone and dialect that I could pick out as being definably theirs. (By the way, the made-up slang James Dashner created for these characters is hilarious!)    This book was like a puzzle and I was desperately reading so I could find the next piece. I barely put this book down and read until the wee hours of the morning just to finish it. This book is a great ride full of psychological twists and turns and I recommend it to everyone!
1586487981|2.0|Authors Banerjee and Duflo purport to purvey 'radical rethinking of the way to fight global poverty.' Personally, I wish they'd studied physics before writing the book, especially the chapter on 'leverage.'<br /><br />Archimedes famously said 'Give me a lever and I can move the world;' I seriously doubt he would try to move major economies without one. Stated from other perspectives, the material is far too 'India-driven,' and not enough 'China-based, too Adam Smith (front-line) oriented and very weak at the national-level.<br /><br />Example: 'Poor Economics' reports on various parental efforts to overcome ineffectual Indian schools. Those fighting poverty in China, on the other hand, would be more prone to just fix the problem, rather than go around or compensate for it. India also has a reputation for poor infrastructure - extremely crowded, dangerous, and slow road travel, unrelible power, public health problems, etc. These are not amenable to solution via individuals, and preclude manufacturing in large areas of the nation. China, on the other hand, has made the provision of standout infrastructure a priority.<br /><br />Years ago I, like millions of others, was enthralled by the 'Total Quality Management' (TQM) and incremental improvement fads then sweeping America. However, digging deeper, I soon found that organizations that 'fell from financial grace' rarely succumbed to either quality problems or competitors superior in mobilizing their masses to make minor improvements. The most frequent causes of their failures was the lack of a sustainable, substantial competitive advantage, and financial foolishness (excess debt/financial leverage, grossly-high costs). Neither problem was amenable to front-line solutions.<br /><br />China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea have similarly demonstrated that solving mass poverty is not best addressed by individuals. It also requires data-driven decision-making unimpeded by ideology that is fed by competing self-interests.
0061726826|4.0|I was really excited to read this because not only did the premise interest me, but it is set sometime in the future in the town where I now live - Portland, Maine. Lauren Oliver's tale of the heartbreak and excitement that love can provoke painted a picture of an eerie dystopian Portland which to be honest, unsettled me a bit, especially because I could picture it so well in my head.­ While reading it, I really felt Lena's fear as she constantly looked over her shoulder as she walked through the streets of my town.    I love books like this because even though the assertion that the government could \\"ban\\" love and treat it as a disease sounds farfetched, it truly makes you reflect on history and you realize the crazy things some governments have already done in the name of protecting its people. The quotes from the Book of Shhh (The Safety, Health and Happiness Handbook which serves as a kind of new bible for society) at the beginning of each chapter really gave me insight into the ways the government has really brainwashed the minds of Lena and her family.    The great thing about Delirium is that you can see how this decision has changed society and Lena is a product of her environment. But even though Lena has never known a world any different, she somehow senses something isn't right and deep down she pines for something more. I, as the reader, wanted so desperately for her to understand and have that epiphany with Alex so she could break out of her world and I ended up really caring about the characters.    Overall, Delirium was a great dystopian love story and after the exciting ending, I'm really looking forward to the next in the series.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is one of my favorite books of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and it helped me out of a reading funk I'd been having for a while so I suggest it if you're having one, too. I wasn't too sure about it when it was recommended to me, but I took a chance and I'm glad I did.    Ender is a great character, and even though he's a young child, he's more like a little adult. He's a genius, but not because he spews scientific equations or anything. He's more like a creative thinker: a sensitive strategist in every situation he's in whether it's figuring out how to handle school bullies or figuring out how to keep his brother from killing him. For most of the book he's a loner though not exactly by choice and I think we can all identify with that at some point in our lives.    Both Valentine and Peter are great characters as well, and I love that Orson Scott Card goes back and forth between what Ender is doing at school and the shenanigans his siblings are conjuring at home. Peter, by the way, is the perfect villain because not only is he a genius, but also seems to sometimes be evil and sometimes alright and as Ender's brother, you're never sure if you can trust him.    This is a great book for lovers of science fiction but I would also recommend it to readers who haven't reach much sci-fi before. Some of the space gravity lingo is difficult to understand but it's usually explained very well. The aliens are not a main feature - they are mostly just referred to, so if you're squeamish about things like that, no problem. And finally, if you love deep character development, I know you'll love Ender, too.      [Note: Ender's Game is the first of a series, but it's also a great standalone book as well. The books that follow are completely different (example: the next one is set 3,000 years after this one), but of course you can indulge if you want!]
B004WJRF6C|4.0|I remember the hype surrounding the release of this album very well. I was 16 at the time. This is what McCartney sounds like without Lennon immediately after The Beatles. I, of course, had the 33 1/3 long player originally,then the the original CD, and now this.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed on the reissue is how loud it is. The album is still as comfortable as an old pair of blue jeans, but I still feel like it's compressed to make it louder, as many albums are these days. Not much dynamic range. I even sense distortion. And I am playing this with a decent receiver/speakers.<br /><br />Anyone else notice this?<br /><br />As far as the music, it is still my favorite McCartney/Wings album (followed close by Ram). I think because of the circumstances at the time of it's release.<br /><br />I remember having a few bootleg Beatles albums at the time of the long delayed and hyped Let It Be/Get Back album, and Teddy Boy is still a great song that would have fit on any later Beatles album.<br /><br />Every Night is still a great tune as well, as is That Would Be Something, and of course, the way overplayed Maybe I'm Amazed.<br /><br />The additional Linda McCartney images are fun to look at. This was such a different time than today.<br /><br />I haven't listened to the bonus CD as of yet, and I guess I need to compare the original CD, and maybe even pull out the long play album, to really compare the sound.<br /><br />Overall a nice album, and to quote a much overused saying; \\"it is what it is.\\"<br /><br />Update: Had the CD in my Blu-Ray player which has some kind of music doo-dad to make music sound better. NOT! Now have it in my CD player, and there is no compression. Sounds great with the bass jumping out of the speakers. Great re-issue. Finally listened to the bonus disc and love the Every Night version. Still like an old friend to listen to.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie fires on all cylinders, capturing the majesty and power of Thor yet making him relatable and lovable. The story is well paced, the cinematography is beautiful and the actors all do a great job, especially Hemsworth, Alexander, Elba, Dennings and Portman. You owe it yourself to see it.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|The story follows partialy the Spartacus story told by Howard Fast.   Blood is everywhere. Nudity too. A voyers delight.  The extras will let you know that this is a made-up tale.  [[ASIN:B003PIUBZS Spartacus: Blood and Sand - The Complete First Season]]
B004IQMXD4|5.0|When I heard the album for the first time , I was not blown away. The tunes weren't all that instantly catchy and I wasn't really getting it with the lyrics.  Well like some other Amazon reviewers, I listened to it again the next day (for quite a few times when I was relaxed and I could pay more attention), and I was then blown away. Sure there were a couple titles that weren't my favorite (like the singsong-y, weak lyric \\"Cheaper Than Free\\", with Stewart's very mediocre backup vocals), but for the most part, I would say this is a great return album for her.<br /><br />The lyrics are still very \\"Stevie\\" and therefore quite intriguing if you listen to the words she is singing (as in rhyming tribute to Edgar Allen Poe's \\"Annabel Lee\\", with the haunting drumbeat of \\"Soldier's Angel\\" or the spiritually awakening \\"New Orleans\\"), the songs become even more enjoyable.  Most of the tunes are amazing...the rising and falling of \\"Italian Summer\\" is really beautiful.  And the story of revenge and the repetition of words and phrases in \\"Wild Sargasso Sea\\" is haunting and fun at the same time....the way she ends the song is chilling (\\"...but you'll never forget that...kiss\\").  \\"Ghosts are Gone\\" and \\"In Your Dreams\\" both rock (actually, \\"In Your Dreams\\" sounds like it could have been one of the hits off of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours album).  And unlike other 70's/80's artists who can no longer hit their original notes (or are simply trying to ride on the latest musical genre), Stevie still sounds great and sticks with what she knows.....her kind of pop-country-rock-synth-ballads....and with the exact same sexy, throaty deep voice with no straining vocals. Her harmonizing and backup vocals are still very good as well.<br /><br />I can't get enough of the album now.
0143039431|5.0|Of course, this is a classic and required reading for many high school students. I read it in preparation for taking a tour of Route 66, The Mother Road, and it added a lot of color to my tour.
0307593495|3.0|This book has a lot of good points including an engrossing plot--UNTIL THE END, then the trouble is evident.  I feel Mankell did a lot of fascinating research into the historical period of the cold war and used it well as part of his plot.  He got me involved in Wallander's life all over again. I had a hard time putting the book down.  Then, I got to the last 50 pages or so of the book and couldn't believe the choices the author made for completing this book.  The plot fell apart as far as I am concerned.  I also was irritated that the author sidestepped so many clues that he didn't feel like wrapping up by simply saying there were things Wallander would never know the answer to. There were some other weaknesses to the book, but they weren't glaring compared to the plot wrapup.<br /><br />And yet I am glad to have read the book.  It was good to spend some time with Kurt Wallander again, even if he is one of the gloomiest character in any of the mysteries I have read.  Only the Patricia Cornwell characters are as grim as Wallander. But Kurt is a man looking for meaning and for purpose and for love.  It is too bad he is always so thwarted in his efforts to make his personal life more meaningful.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I really like about Mankell's writing in this book.  I like the way he almost makes a journal out of Kurt's daily life.  Wallander gets up, he eats, he takes the dog for a walk, etc.  It might be boring for some people, but I think it gives us a picture of Wallander's life.  And we get to be party to his thoughts while he does his daily activities.  I like that side of Kurt Wallander better than the panicky side when he is sweating and worrying and running around like a madman.<br /><br />The other thing I really liked about this book was the description of the Wallander's house and its location near the sea.  The author does a great job of describing the view.  It makes me want to live there.<br /><br />Finally, the very final ending telling us about the rest of Wallander's life isn't right.  It is in afterthought form, which doesn't fit the writing style of the book.  Anyway, it would be better not to know what happens to Wallander, the way we never find out what happens to Rebus in the Ian Rankin books.<br /><br />For more mystery series that may entertain you, check out my website describing and reviewing many series (see my Amazon profile for the URL).
0316098329|4.0|Very interesting book and difficult to put down. I thought it was a very creative idea and a lot of the details in the book are quite original. But the author is not quite as original as I first thought. There is a real-life case in Austria that spawned the idea for this book. You can read more about the family involved, The Fritzl's, at wikipedia by typing in Fritzl.
1451626657|5.0|I'll start by saying I STRUGGLED through this book, but it was worth every minute.  The book is so masterfully written, that at times, I was just in awe of what I had read.  The characters are memoorable, the language incredible, and the concepts universal.   I'm 50 years old, and wish I had read this in High School. Its one of those books that been on my shelf for years as one of those \\"I'll read it someday books.\\"  All I can say is that I'm glad I finally got around to it.  How many books can you say have the ability to change you as a person? This is one of them.
B004ZGYEKC|5.0|I am not going to make any remarks about how great this album, although indeed great it was, and still is. What I am going to talk about is the fact that FINALLY this album has been in true stereo, every song, for the first time ever - coming off the original multi-track recordings. If you think you know what the Sunshine Superman album sounds like, think again. As much as you may love this album, and may have even heard it hundreds of times, like I have, until you hear this in true stereo, you haven't really \\"heard\\" it. In addition to having a much cleaner, richer sound, this new stereo mix brings out many, many little intricate sounds that are buried, or way in the background in the mono mix. Also, Donovan's voice is much, much clearer, situated right in the center, with very nice natural studio echo (which you can't hear on the mono mix) and the instruments are surrounding him in perfect soundstage presence. I always thought a few of the songs on Sunshine Superman, particularly Celeste, had a slight sort of distorted sound. Not now. Perfectly clear as can be. Even all the bonus tracks on disc one are in true stereo. The ones that were issued on the 2005 EMI remaster were in semi-distorted mono, especially Breezes of Patchuli. Now, here in stereo, they too really open up. This is truly an amazingly pleasing listen. [Unfortunately, it seems back in the 60's, EPIC Records, on which both the Sunshine Superman and Mellow Yellow albums were issued were not the only ones that were never released back then in true stereo. Their (EPIC's) stereo was that fake stereo that actually sounds much worse than the mono versions. If you listen to U.S. albums on EPIC by the Yardbirds, the Dave Clark Five, and other original EPIC \\"stereo\\" pressings, you find that none of them were issued in true stereo.] Getting back to this new release...When you listen to disc 2, after you listen to the stereo disc 1, the songs on disc 2, in the original UK mono mix, sound dead in comparison. Afterso many lack-luster reissues of this album over the years, finally it has been released the way it should have been released in the beginning. Hopefully the original U.S. Mellow Yellow album will likewise be issued in true stereo, coming off the original multi-track tapes, like this was. I'm not holding my breath, but I am hoping. Let's get with it Donovan, and make that happen. Really, now is the time for a true stereo Mellow Yellow, while we are all riding high (naturally) on this way-overdue beautiful reissue of Sunshine Superman. Listen to this release of the REAL Sunshine Superman album LOUD.
B002BGFUPQ|4.0|This chapter in the Fast & Furious series is often considered the least favorite as main stars Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were pretty much absent aside from a last minute cameo.  I have come back to this film a few times for my memories of the very exciting race through the housing development and ended up staying for the balance of the picture.  Taken for what it is, the film is very enjoyable with good cars and action.  My heart still belongs to the old Detroit muscle cars, so I love a few of the other entries in the series, but still found this one enjoyable enough to add to my collection.  Recommended to fans of this genre, regardless of interest in the Vin Diesel F&F films.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|Love this series, it was one of MTV's last great shows before it became the Reality TV show channel.    Every episode is great, I love Daria's and Jane's sense of humor.    I didn't mind the lack of licensed music in the series with the exception of two.  In the episode \\"Road Worrier\\" the replacement of REM's song \\"Everybody Hurts\\" just doesn't find the scene when they're in a traffic jam similar to the music video for \\"Everybody Hurts\\".    The same can be said for the episode \\"Quinn the brain\\" where the song that replaced \\"What do you want from me\\" didn't fit.  The original song was perfect to convey Daria's feeling of losing her identity for being a brain to Quinn who manages to be a popular brain.  This plays while Daria is about to give Quinn a taste of her own medicine as Daria has a montage of changing into an similar to Quinn's normal look.    Aside from these two scenes this was a perfect collection of a hilarious series.

0446195529|4.0|This book was once again one of those that I couldn't put down once I started. The ending was a little strange and anti-climatic, but I guess it's just because I was a little surprised. Some of the areas dragged a little (like the \\"Murder Mountain\\" portion), but I know it was necessary in order to completely develop the story and the characters. Well worth the time to read. For anyone just looking at the review for this book, I recommend you read all of the Camel Club novels IN ORDER! This will help you fully understand the relationships between the characters.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|My Middle School son and younger daughter really enjoyed the first movie in this series.  My son has read all the books and we really enjoyed the second movie at the theatre so we pre-ordered this blu-ray and just received it today.  We're all very excited to watch it as a family tonight.  There may be a few bad habits for kids to pick up if, so watch for that if you're concerned and give proper guidance.  However, the movie does seem to provide good, sometimes realistic lessons about family and friendship.  Highly recommended.

B0036TGSR6|3.0|Mitch Ryiter  6/5/11  LA II p6  Movie Review Essay (Submitted to Amazon.com)     The Ghost Writer, directed by Roman Polanski, hit the big screen on March 19th, 2010. Starring Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan, this edge-of-your-seat thriller was received by the public with some controversy at first. Disregarding the thoughts of the public, people involved in the film all claim that the film is entirely fictional, however, it has been speculated that the character of Pierce Brosnan is similar to Tony Blair, the British prime minister. This created controversy due to the fact that the character of Pierce Brosnan was arrested for war crimes and eventually died at the end of the movie. Legendary writers Robert Harris and Roman Polanski cleverly wove this sub plot into a movie with an even stronger main plot and good acting contributions from the stars as well as assisting cast members Olivia Williams and Jim Belushi. Predictably, this led to the movie doing well in the box office; collecting over $15 million dollars domestically and $60 million worldwide.      Strongly casted, the focal characters of this engaging movie comprise of \\"The Ghost\\" (Ewan McGregor), Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) and Ruth Lang (Olivia Williams). Supporting the stars, the assisting characters include John Maddox (Jim Belushi), Sidney Croll (Timothy Hutton) and Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh). While this movie is fictional, it is set in modern day England, post-retirement of former, and fictional, Prime Minister Adam Lang.      Engaging from the opening scene, The Ghost Writer begins with \\"The Ghost\\", a prolific ghost writer who has written for many political figures, being offered to write for Adam Lang, former Prime Minister of England. Eagerly, he is immediately whisked away to one of Mr. Lang's summer homes in America. The ambiance of this island is foggy and mysterious and it leaves \\"The Ghost\\" with a sense of apprehension as due to the strange events that occur in his first days there. \\"The Ghost\\" is first informed that his predecessor recently died on the ferry to the island. With no worry, expecting this to be a relatively normal job, \\"The Ghost\\" is shocked when, the day that he arrives, a former British minister named Richard Rycart comes out with information of war crimes that Adam Lang committed.       When Mr. Lang leaves to try to clear his name of the accused crimes, \\"The Ghost\\" scours the island for clues of his predecessor's mysterious death and learns that it was murder. Sneakily, he also discovers the previous writer's car because of Mrs. Lang's help and follows its GPS to the place where the writer last was. Leading him to the house of Paul Emmet, the GPS and previous writer are correct. Emmet clearly hides his knowledge of Adam Lang and the previous ghost writer. He is then followed from Mr. Emmet's house to the ferry that the previous writer died on. However, he abandons the cursed ferry and stays in a Motel outside of it, avoiding assassination. With apprehension, he then contacts Richard Rycart, telling him of what he has experienced. Rycart tells him to go with Lang and act as a spy for him.       Lang and his associates pick up \\"The Ghost\\" that night and take him to an airport. While they are on the plane, \\"The Ghost\\" accuses Mr. Lang of being a CIA agent based on information that he found and that Rycart gave him. Lang disregards the accusation with a chuckle because he isn't a CIA agent and they continue on with the flight. Upon departing the plane, Lang is shot and killed by a war protestor. Ignoring his untimely death, \\"The Ghost\\" is asked to make a posthumous publication of his biography of Adam Lang and does.       Confused, at the publication party, \\"The Ghost\\" converses to people attending and discovers that Ruth Lang, the wife of Adam Lang, is in fact the CIA agent who has been cleverly influencing the political decisions of the Prime Minister throughout the years. Sneakily, \\"The Ghost\\" leaves Ruth a note proclaiming his discovery and is then hit by a car in the street upon leaving because of his discovery. Marking the end of his investigation, \\"The Ghost\\" is not able to show his discovery, which is vital to the discovery of the reasons behind Lang's decision.       The message that this movie controversially sent was that no matter what there will always be corruption and no one is powerful enough to stop it. This is true, firstly, because of the untimely demise of the first ghost writer. Finding important clues, \\"The Ghost\\" knew that his predecessor had found sensitive information, which led to his predecessor's killing via the CIA. Secondly, when \\"The Ghost\\" was mysteriously killed by a car in the street after finding Ruth's secret, it was clear that he was killed as a result of his discovery. Without fail, people in power will always make decisions for their own personal gain and no matter what we do to stop this, it will never end. It's simply human and societal nature.     Personally, I found this movie to be very enjoyable. While it is sometimes fun to watch mind-numbing movies, if you like movies that engage your mind and make you think then this is definitely the right movie for you. What I liked about this captivating movie is that it is much easier to comprehend than most heady movies similar to it. Gladly, I could still have a discussion with my sister about it when it was over, rather than it going way over her head.

Installed the Alfa Adapter and now I'm' connected at a steady 150 Mbps with an Excellent signal strength. Just what I needed to set up my wireless network for my house. I'm also picking up other signals. Only had it for a few hours but I am very impressed. I wish the cable was a little longer and there are no step by step instructions but I was able to set it up myself in a few minutes on my own. If you are not getting a steady signal with your wireless network but this to solve your problems.    Update  The Atheros software or device created Havok on my PC shortly after install (and my original post above). The network adapter will not work without the Atheros client utility. Shortly after install my system BIOS did not recognize my drives and caused a failure on my main Hard drive loosing all information. I did a complete reinstall on Windows XP, loaded the drivers and software again, and it caused a different error where I was unable to validate my Windows XP after install. Installed it on another PC and BAM caused same errors on my system BIOS and 2 drives are down. Reinstalled Windows XP again and did not install the drivers and no problems. Either the software or device was flawed. Either way it did not work and I am returning the product. Stay away if you are using Windows XP (Home and Professional) as this caused 2 PC's to crash for me. I am still trying to configure my older PC and that one may never be back up thanks to this device.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Good book with a story line that was quite unique and different from my usual read.  I had a bit of a struggle keeping track of all the characters from the Vanger family, but it really pulled at me to keep reading to find out what happened to Harriet!  It was a bit distracting with all of the English (not American English) spelling and Swedish words, but once I made the adjustment, it was a good story. I ended up enjoying it so much, I bought the next book in the series.

B002NXOQF2|5.0|The definition of a classic book, to me, is one in which you can pick it up and read it at various points in life and gain new meaning from the book. \\"Watership Down\\" fits that description.    I first read this book one summer when I was about 12. My older sister and I both owned pet rabbits, so I was first drawn to this book because it revolved around rabbits. I loved the book then, and I love the book now. At that time, the book was an amazing adventure tale, one not to be easily forgotten. Now that I am an adult, I see so many other things in this book besides an amazing adventure tale. I see a changing world of politics; I see the lesson in learning to adapt and change in order to survive; I see the bravery of facing the unknown but forging ahead anyway; I see the force of hope that propels us towards an uncertain, but hopefully better, future, working as a team to get there.    I will be interested to see what I pick up from this book a couple of decades from now.

B004H4XI5O|5.0|Thanks Amazon, Thanks Kindle department to bring this class of Books. I used some of this techniques at work with amazing results...
0143116738|1.0|I ordered this book because I like the author; I should have read the reviews first.<br />This book is 200+ pages of mini-biographies of successful people.  That's it, except a final few chapters talking about school reform/transformation/what's wrong with education (most of which is completely accurate).<br />The ELEMENT of which he speaks is the confluence of \\"features\\" (aptitude and passion) and \\"conditions\\" (attitude and opportunity).  He states:  \\"The sequence goes something like this:  I get it; I love it; I want it; Where is it?\\"  There is no further explanation, plan, steps, or information.  It is bio after bio after bio.  A few are interesting, but it very rapidly becomes tedious as you wonder if there is anything more to this book than bios.  As I said, there is - the final pages discussing the educational system, which has NOTHING to do with you finding YOUR element.  It simply says that the system doesn't support children thriving in their elements.

After all the hype, I found it to be very slow, the plot was dull and I kept waiting for more to happen. I did enjoy seeing Tim McGraw in a movie again.   I loved the music but expected more numbers by Paltrow.  She is fantastic on Glee and I was looking forward to seeing more from her. I would not recommend this movie to a friend.

0307593495|1.0|I eagerly read most of the K Wallender series of books and it introduced me to many other Scandinavian authors of mysteries.  This novel starts promisingly enough with the strange disappearance of a senior retired naval officer and then the later disappearance of his wife, and the intimation that this may be related to Russian spies and submarine shenanigans in the 1980's . The middle part of the novel is largely about Kurt's problems and angst; he turned 60, he has insulin dependent diabetes and takes poor care of himself, he has a nagging and annoying daughter, a former lover dying of cancer, an ex wife crazy and alcoholic and institutionalized, he gets mugged by teenagers, his boss is a problem and he has only one friend now in the department.  The novel spends considerable space documenting when he comes and goes and when he eats and where and what he does with his dog Jussi, and I'm surprised there isn't information about his bowel habits. He has intermittent brief total memory lapses that are  very transient and that do not sound like Alzheimer's but suggest the author is about to jettison this fellow.  The last portion of the novel is an absolutely ridiculous scenario that the elderly former naval officer is hiding because of stolen spy documents many and I mean many years ago and that his wife is killed to protect his identity as a spy. So who are the actual spies, well of course The Great Satan  the USA, not the Russians. Of course, the USA would be vitally interested Swedish secrets?!  This is lousy and inane  novel and seems to me mostly a diatribe  about the coarsening of Swedish culture and resentment about America's influence.    Nelson Miller

0143039431|5.0|The chapters were interspersed such that one tells of the general conditions of the Great Depression, then the other one would relate the details of the events in the life of the Joad family.  The narratives describing a place, an event, a feeling or emotion were so well written that the reader would feel transported back in time, to the place, made to see the event as it happened, made to feel the emotions.  This, no matter if one has to struggle to understand some of the spoken words in context.<br /><br />A lot can be learned from this book, not only about history and the appreciation of what we have in the present day, but also more about the human strength, tenacity and innate goodness in the face of a seeming insurmountable adversity.  I really wish it has a happier ending, say a reunion of the Joad family, or better times...but really, what happier ending could it have than one's giving of self to a stranger in dire need?  Somehow, the reader knows, as Mama Joad had known, that all will be alright in the end.

030745455X|5.0|There is always, at least for me, a feeling of uncertainty in the pit of my stomach when I pick up the sequel to a brilliantly crafted premiere novel. That being said, I fully appreciate this novel's value. It was a fitting sequel by all means, yet I do not compare it to \\"Dragon Tattoo,\\" as I view it in a completely different light.<br /><br />Blomkvist and Salander are again the main characters in this sequel, yet the entire book is shook from all expectations when Salander is haunted, once again, by events from her past and is accused of a brutal triple murder. When her fingerprints are found on the murder weapon, Blomkvist, whom Salander has been ignoring for over a year, is forced to come to her rescue, as her face is plastered all over Sweden and newspapers begin to portray her in hardly positive, hardly fair lights. As a former committed patient, Salander not only has to face down the evidence against her but also the discrimination against her because of her past.<br /><br />As the investigation unfolds however, Blomkvist finds out that the murders have a more sinister motive than the police believe, exposing a sex-trafficking business that ultimately implicates individuals from Salander's past who are only too willing to have her implicated. Failing this, they also seek to finish her off themselves. In the end, lives are on the line as Blomkvist races against time to clear Salander before it is too late.<br /><br />This book is just as good of a thriller as Larsson's first, yet the feeling is completely different. The past again plays a role, yet the danger feels more real, more current, than in \\"Dragon Tattoo.\\" This is not to say that this novel is more engrossing, because, personally, I preferred the chilling feeling I experienced while reading \\"Dragon Tattoo,\\" which was of a slower pace, to this work. Yet this novel is excellent in its own right due to its fast-paced nature. What I will mention, however, is that it is a tad slow at the beginning as the groundwork is laid, but this does not largely detract from enjoyment.<br /><br />So, wrapping up, this is a fitting sequel. Personally, I preferred Larsson's opening to the trilogy better, yet I can see the verdict being passed either way as to preference between the two!is does not largely detract from enjoyment.

0307716511|3.0|I accept that I am in the minority on rating this book.  I was sucked in by all the fabulous reviews, but I was quite disappointed.  I wavered between 2 and 3 stars, but in the end decided on 3 stars because I did read it to the end because I wanted to know what happened.  To me, this book was not all that clever as others suggest. I will admit that you do spend 3/4 of the book wondering \\"who did it?\\" because the author makes you suspicious of every single person that Beatrice comes in contact with.  That being said, I wasn't shocked at all at the ending that everyone found to be \\"SO SHOCKING\\".  I don't know why anyone would find it that shocking when you suspect everyone?!? Or maybe they aren't necessarily referring to that person, maybe they are referring to the way the ending plays out...? If so, I wasn't shocked there either, I was more upset that the author didn't give us closure.  I was highly annoyed that I had invested my whole weekend in reading this book, to not get a clear-cut ending.    Overall, it was definitely NOT a book that I \\"couldn't put down\\".  I just read a few chapters at a time because it was on the boring side.  In the words of other reviewers, the book was just too long.  Almost to the point of making it wordy just to have a big book.  I, too, was able to scan through the last 1/4 of the book instead of reading it word by word because it was just too boring and you know deep down that anything the author put in there wasn't going to be all that crucial.  All in all, I probably could have read the first couple chapters, a few middle chapters and the last couple chapters and had the same end result, I just wouldn't have wasted so much of my time.

0062060554|5.0|So the story goes that S. J. Watson was employed with the British National Health Service but dreamed of writing. Accordingly, he cut back on his work hours, took a very demanding writing course or two, and honed his craft. BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is the first of what is hopefully many manifestations of these. Anyone who reads this book will not soon forget it. Unless, of course, you are afflicted with the condition so dramatically presented here.    Christine Lucas, the narrator, suffers from a very unusual form of amnesia that robs her of her memory when she goes into a deep sleep. As a result, she wakes up each morning not knowing who or where she is. Her husband, Ben, is to all appearances attentive, loving and patient. He has decorated the bathroom mirror, and on the walls are labeled pictures to reacquaint her with her surroundings --- and with herself. He leaves her notes on a board telling her about the day and making suggestions for her activities. And he answers her questions about herself, and patiently so, even as it is obvious that he has answered them numerous times before.    BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP begins today, actually, with Christine awakening and going through a routine of confusion leading to a slow and incomplete awareness. During the course of this day, she receives a telephone call from Dr. Nash, a physician who is secretly attempting to treat her for her amnesia. At his prompting, Christine goes into her closet where she finds a journal that she has been keeping on a daily basis, following a pattern of writing each day's events in the journal, hiding it, and then forgetting about it until the following day, when Dr. Nash reminds her of its existence. At the front of the journal, written in block letters, is a cryptic warning: DON'T TRUST BEN. It is this journal that constitutes well over two-thirds of BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP, covering what is approximately two weeks of Christine's life, and revealing what may or may not be inconsistencies in what Benhas been saying about Christine and her condition.    As it develops, everything she knows, and much of what she has forgotten, is wrong --- from the etiology of her condition to the most basic elements of her existence. Revealing this does not give anything away; for there is a dark mystery to what is occurring, one that is slowly revealed piecemeal, even as it is demonstrated that Nash's therapy may well be working. Or may not be. For someone is lying, and maybe everyone is, just not about the same thing. An atmosphere of dread and deceit, with bad intent and otherwise, permeates BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP. Sorting it out, or at least attempting to do so, is all a part of the process that makes this debut work a one-sit reading exercise from beginning to end.    You will be looking for the extra pages even as you re-read the last one, which is just one reason why it's a great, jaw-dropping ending. It's no surprise that BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is scheduled for publication in over 35 countries, or that the film rights have been snatched up. Shoot it in black and white, with a Vaseline glaze over the lens. That's how it reads.        --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

I must agree with the reviewer who said that the lighting was a little dark.  I have the blu-ray, which is crystal clear, but I can understand why a conventional DVD might not be.  Regarding the \\"sets\\", or lack thereof, I prefer a little more than a few chairs, etc, in what was otherwise a lavish production; but, as I said, this is really nitpicking when you look at the whole product.  Singing A++, Orchestra A++, Casting A++, Acting A++, Costumes A+, Directing A, Lighting C, Sets D.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't know why I waited to read this. I should have jumped on the band wagon with this book when it first got hype because it is fantastic! I only began reading it when my fiance did because she just picks books at random and we were talking about it and I just had to pick it up.     I'm very happy that this book doesn't cut back to extensive back stories and sticks with likable characters and a fantastic plot that doesn't stop. It makes the book non-put-downable. And it has been a while since I've had a book like this. I can't wait to dive into the next of this series.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Perhaps my experience with this film benefited from low expectations. After having seen reviews that clustered somewhere between \\"eh\\" and \\"so-so,\\" I was surprised to find myself enjoying it. It may even be a rare movie that works better on a home screen than in the theater. (It was released opposite \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" which is definitely a big screen movie.) \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is no blockbuster, but if you're a person who unapologetically enjoys the sort of movie typically shown on the Syfy or Chiller channels, you'll probably like this, too - and the production values are 10 times better than the usual stuff there. Amanda Seyfried is as good a pick for the title part as is possible, and the rest of the casting is solid, too.    As for the central werewolf mystery, I've heard a few complaints (boasts?) to the effect of \\"I saw it coming.\\" Well, I didn't exactly. To be sure, it's a logical suspect, but only one of a bunch. It's supposed to be a logical suspect. Fans of mysteries consider it cheating when an author offers no proper clues (amid red herrings); they hate it when, in the final chapter, the killer turns out to be some obscure person with no previously disclosed motive. The film works fine on this level.    All in all, this is a moody and interesting take on an old tale of a young woman and a big bad wolf.
B000W93CXQ|2.0|Like nearly everyone here, I agree that this book deals with a very serious subject. Suicide, unlike some believe, is NOT an easy way out. It takes a lot of courage and unendurable pain to make such a decision and see it through. There isn't a person I know personally who hasn't allowed the act to at least cross their minds at some point in life. I certainly have, so I don't shy away from the subject, but I had several problems with this book.    My chief stumbling block is that Hannah is not a sympathetic heroine. While it's often impossible to quantify someone else's pain, she went to a great deal of trouble to paint herself into a corner and then blame others for what happened. The couple of times that people tried to reach out to her, she shut them out or didn't know what she needed from them to feel better, so she walked away. (Kids can be insufferable monsters, selecting a victim in the herd and isolating them for special torment. Their peers are not the only game they hunt. Five years ago, I was in a grocery story and was followed around by four teenage boys who called me horrible names and harassed me enough so that I was in tears by the time I got to check-out. I was in my forties, and they were bored and did it just for fun. I'd never seen them before.)    I also had trouble with the structure of this book. It was intriguing and clever, getting Clay's reactions but they were so frequent as to be intrusive. I often had to keep checking which were his thoughts (in regular type) and which were Hannah's (in italics). Tony, the keeper of Hannah's duplicate set of tapes, is a two-dimensional, convenient walk-on.    I downloaded a sample of this book before I bought it, but it was very short, only tantalizing enough to make me want to buy the book. Since it was priced by the publisher (ouch!), I wish I had made a different decision.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Just got a kindle for my birthday - super excited to get the 4-book series for Game of Thrones - have been enthralled by the HBO series so even though the digital version was more expensive than the paper-version was willing to give it a go.  So many issues - Can't jump from book to book - always takes me back to book one Table of Contents... can't jump to a specific page because it merged all pages so have no idea what book page 13896 is in... furthermore read that folks were missing pages in some of the books... is this what the kindle/Amazon is really all about... not only did I get a refund for the book bundle - am seriously thinking about getting a refund for the kindle itself. Very disappointing Amazon that you wouldn't proof all digitized versions - surely there are automated technologies that can do that for you - would think with the price gauging that would be included.
0393338827|5.0|I think most of the 1-star reviewers are probably Wall Street bond traders who were suckered into CDOs.  I thought this book gave us excellent insights into how and why Wall Street continues to play us for fools.  John Paulson came much later in this game, but took all the credit because he knows how to use the media to evangelize himself.  The \\"real heroes\\" are the Michael Burry, Steve Eisman, Cornhole Capital bunch of misfits and junkies.  The little story about Wing Chau is very mind-boggling though.  His clients are the real suckers and he made multi-millions.  I wonder what is Wing Chau doing these days, in hiding or glorifying himself in the media?  The Vegas shooting rampage is also very interesting to read.  I enjoyed this book very much and will be reading Liar's Poker next.
B001PBRCVI|4.0|I'm fourteen years old and just recently read this. One part that stood out to me was how the woman decided to keep her baby even though her husband said he would leave her. A true husband would stay by your side no matter what. It is a very delicate story that tells of peace, horror and love that never stops. This book portrays the modern and past. It was an enjoyable read, but should be read by 14 and older, other whys it would be very inappropriate.
0062060554|4.0|A woman wakes up. She doesn't recognize the room she's in or the man in bed next to her. Her first thought? Another one-night stand, this time with a married man. But in the bathroom she finds photos of herself and the man, some carefully labeled \\"Ben, your husband\\" and \\"Christine\\" pointing to a photo of herself. And the face that looks back at her from the mirror isn't her own, or, rather, it's her own face but much older than she thinks it should be.    This is how Christine Wheeler starts every day since an accident took away her memories and her ability to form new ones. A blank slate, dependent on her husband's patience as he answers questions he must have answered thousands of times before.    As Christine begins to cope with that day's discoveries, a cell phone rings. It's her doctor, who tells her she's been keeping a journal to help her remember.    Finding the journal, Christine begins to read about what her therapy uncovered and what few memories have come back, triggered by another photo or a visit to a place she used to live. The journal raises more questions than it answers. Is Ben lying to her about her past? If he is, is it to protect her from sudden grief over events long past or does he have another agenda? What led to Christine's accident? Why did she write \\"Don't trust Ben\\" on the front of the journal?    Told exclusively from Christine's point of view, Before I Sleep by S.J. Watson pulls the reader into the disorienting world of amnesia. It's generally considered difficult for a male author to write a female character well, but Watson's Christine doesn't suffer from a gender disconnect between author and character. Her mistakes and flaws build a picture of a real person, albeit one who has to build her own self-picture anew every morning.    After a protracted prologue (which serves mainly as an info dump - this is Christine; this is her condition), the story unfolds slowly, teasing the reader with glimpses of Christine's past.    Christine's struggles to put the clues together ground Before I Sleep in an immediate sense of \\"now.\\" Repetitions of her routine could be off-putting, but Watson adds just enough new information to keep interest high. And not all of the information is accurate. A reader looking to figure out the puzzle before Christine may be disappointed: Christine's returning memories aren't always real. Her doctor explains to her (and the reader) that \\"confabulation\\" describes the mind's attempts to invent details to make sense of things, to fill gaps in memory.    As the book progresses, the stakes for Christine get higher. Her struggle is no longer just about recovering her memory. Her life may be in danger. Watson's pacing is almost pitch perfect as Christine connects more pieces of her past and events move toward a surprisingly action-packed conclusion. The ending may strike some as a little too perfect, a little too reminiscent of a Lifetime movie, but Watson's last paragraphs put the story back on track and the novel satisfyingly concludes in the only way it could.

0307454541|2.0|I had been told that this was a \\"you can't put it down\\" read.  I will admit the first couple of chapters were difficult, especially getting used to Sweden names etc...  The overall idea for the story was good but man I wasn't expecting such BRUTAL crimes.  Multiple rapes and 2 serial killers??  I don't think I will be reading the other books or watch the movies.  I skipped over parts because there are some things I read that are difficult to shake.

B001EYU1VO|1.0|Took it out, set it up, installed drivers, and programmed it for use with Star Wars Galaxies. Everything seemed to be working fine until I started getting into some space fights. Half the time the trigger button simply wouldn't register a connection. On closer inspection, most of the buttons seemed loose and flimsy. All the adjustments aren't even necessary. I had an X52 and it worked great for me for years, but this thing is a piece of cheap trash. Maybe it has to do with those wires sticking out the sides. Saitek needs to focus on quality instead of gimmicks. Keep in mind, this was right out of the box. Those who had it last up to two weeks should consider themselves lucky.
B004UXUSIM|4.0|As much as my wife and I have been enjoying a lot of the big summer movies these past weeks (films like \\"X-Men: First Class\\", \\"Super 8\\", etc.), we started craving a movie that perhaps wasn't so adventure and special effects oriented. So we recently headed out of the quiet suburbs to an art-house theater in the city to catch Woody Allen's latest film, \\"Midnight in Paris\\".<br /><br />Funny, whimsical, and moving, \\"Midnight in Paris\\" turned out to be the great adult treat I thought it would be. My wife even liked it, and she's not exactly the biggest Woody Allen fan in the world, usually just seeing his movies because I like them. But we both got caught up in this tale of an American writer in Paris (Owen Wilson) being transported each night at the stroke of midnight to the Paris of the 1920's, where he pretty much meets up with every major literary and artistic figure- Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Salvatore Dali, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, to name a few- who was hanging around the City of Lights during that period.<br /><br />Do deep, introspective scenes result from Owen's character, Gil Prender, meeting all these artistic geniuses? Nah, Woody mainly keeps things light and funny, an approach that mostly works just fine. While the movie could have benefitted from a little more complexity with its plot and characters, it was always a lot of fun to watch Gil make excuses each night to break away from his increasingly shrill fiancee and her stuffy parents to return to that stylish earlier time, to eat, drink and cavort with his idols.<br /><br />There's no big, original lesson Woody is trying to impart with his story, just a few small truths that we all sometimes forget. But even those were secondary to the simple joys of spending time in both present-day and 1920's Paris, both quite beautiful, and both more than ample reason to see this engaging, charming movie.
0790731452|1.0|When I went to see this movie, I expected some laughs based on nothing more than the trailers.  Unfortunately, the trailers contained every funny scene in the film.  All of us in the audience that night wanted to laugh, but none of us could.  It was just plain awful.  Don't waste your money.  Please.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|If you want to see an exciting summer movie with a little heart, check out \\"Super 8\\". My wife and I saw it the Saturday after the film opened and liked it. It's basically about a couple of sad and troubled kids, Joe (nicely played by newcomer Joel Courtney) and Alice (the increasingly impressive Elle Fanning) who, along with their friends, get caught up in a dangerous adventure involving a scary monster from outer space.<br /><br />During the course of the movie, what happens with the monster (mild spoiler here) has the happy side effect of helping Joe and Alice become less sad and troubled, as well as improve their relationships with the people important to them. At first I thought the movie's plot was a little too neat, but now I'm coming to appreciate the elegance and craft that went into the movie's screenplay.<br /><br />The film also functions, visually and thematically, as a kind of tribute to the types of movies Steven Spielberg used to produce and/or direct in the 1980's, movies like \\"E.T.\\", \\"Poltergeist\\", \\"The Goonies\\", etc. You know, \\"kids in danger, but we're pretty sure they'll be okay in the end\\" movies. \\"Super 8\\" was produced by Mr. Spielberg and directed by J.J. Abrams.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good film and worth a trip to the multiplex to see.
B0030HAJA6|4.0|This book is a transmedia part of the show Castle on ABC and I really can't discuss one without discussing the other. The premise of the show is that Richard Castle, a famous mystery novelist, follows around Detective Kate Beckett of NYPD homicide as research for a new series he's writing after having helped her solve a copy-cat murder based on one of his novels. The book is the first installment of Castle's new series with the lead character, Nikki Heat, based on Beckett.<br /><br />Obviously, I like the show or I wouldn't have picked up the book. The dialogue is quick and witty and the characters are likable ~ in that way, it's almost like a Bones-lite. Also, as with Bones, I like the fact that the viewer doesn't figure out the whodunit ahead of time (I usually pick them out within the first 5 minutes of Mentalist, but not so here). I love the cameos by actual authors too such as Michael Connelly, James Patterson (\\"Only one book a year, Rick?!?\\"), and the late Stephen J. Cannell who all play poker with Richard Castle. Actually in the beginning of Season 1 they used to do this really awesome cinematography of the crime scenes to start each show and I kind of miss that... but I digress.<br /><br />The book is supposed to be Castle's novel based on his exploits with Beckett and the NYPD homicide division, so it is loosely references several episodes of Castle. In that way, it was a lot like reading an episode of the show with the luxury afforded of being able to go into greater detail. It was a little strange at times because the reader is immersed in a fictional character's work of fiction. I could really 'hear' Castle's voice as the author... which is Nathan Fillion, but not because it's actually that the writer's of the show. So you can see how it could be a little mindboggling to me at times due the fact that it was a story in a story in a story, so to speak, not to mention the dejavu moments ('Oh, I remember this scene!') from different episodes of the show. Although, that means the show writers have voiced a solid character and that the continuity between book and show is flawless.<br /><br />I thought it was a great addition to the Castle franchise and a winning idea from ABC (believe me, you don't hear me say -or read me type, in this case- that very often). It's a nice tie in and aussuaged the post-television-season blues. The second installment, [[ASIN:B004X8W4A4 Naked Heat (Nikki Heat)]], is out and I've added it to my  summer reading list. Would you enjoy it if you haven't seen the show? Perhaps. Perhaps not. I don't know how much I would appreciate the voice of Castle-the-author if I didn't know the character. Then again, it's not quite 200 pages and a great plot with lots of twists and turns. It might just be a perfect summer read.<br /><br />[...]s the show writers have voiced a solid character and that the continuity between book and show is flawless.

B001POX73C|4.0|I normally don't read romance books.  I like suspense- thriller etc....but it was free and I read it on my kindle and truly enjoyed reading it. I will read anything for free but normally don't enjoy all of them not sure if I would pay more than $5 to read it though unless you really like romantic time period pieces.
B004DK5CW4|2.0|I knew it would be \\"Disneyed\\" I knew they'd play fast and loose with the facts but didn't think it they'd go as far as they did. The truth is exciting and dramatic enough to carry a movie. There was no reason to make an idiot out of Lucien Lauren and an ass out of Ogden Phipps or make a villain out of poor Sham.     The birth scene was a joke; not only was the foal the wrong color but owners, trainers and jockeys are not in the foaling barns in the middle of the night when the mares foal....the line about the foal getting up right away has no basis in equine fact either. They all do or try, it is their instinct to get on their feet as soon as possible.     The Belmont scene was the worst of all. Secretariat's Belmont Stakes is one of the most spectacular moments in all of horse racing and to film it anywhere but Belmont Park was an epic fail. Ditto the awful music at the end instead of using Chic Anderson's best race call ever. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it on YouTube. The picture quality is terrible but it should be seen by anyone interested in Secretariat. There is an extended version with a great shot of Mrs. Tweedy waving her arms in the air after the win. I did love seeing her in the stands in the movie. That was a nice Disney touch. :)    I love Disney and I love Secretariat but I wish they would have stuck closer to the facts, a lot closer. They aren't telling a story from a hundred or more years ago and horse racing fans know the facts too well to suspend belief for a movie.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|HBO out did itself with the production of this series. A great buy for any fan of good films, teachers, or anyone who loves the quality that HBO puts into their work.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I have used this for about a week with my 360 and ps3. It works great. The sound is amazing. There is a slight hiss, but I should not even mention it. I am an audio nut and it is minor. It is only when there is no audio and you turn down the volume during that or use these headphones open ear bud feature so you don't have to wear the headset while waiting for the game lobby to finish. You hear it like in game lobbies and out of 10 being noticable it is like a 1-2 depending on the volume. Once the game gets started, the music alone stops the static and you add gunfire, sound effects, and chat you hear notice no hiss. Minor. I've heard worse static. Once the audio kicks in it really pops. It has a sound has atmosphere where it seems to go about 8-15 feet around you. Chat sound is great. Talking is clear both when you hear it and when you talk. Ps3 setup was a breeze. Just watch the video on youtube or the video on here that is the last picture. If you have a nicer hd tv or a surround sound system do not buy the processor to get 5.1 sound. It is not needed. This headset can receive pro logic 2 virtual surround sound and extremely close to the real thing. You just lose a little bit of the dead center front and rear sound so if someone is running around you in a circle you might hear a tiny bit of an audio jump from one speaker to the other minor. Typically in the heat of fps battle all you really need to know is the guy coming from front right, rear right, front left, or rear left and boy can you tell it. I have the full audio setup. A ps3 and 360 going to my 3d tv via hdmi and it supports hd audio as well as all dolby digital and dts. I have my tv send audio to my surround sound system, but I made my surround sound system idiot proof since my dad is remote challenged. (awful!) I have my tv do the conversions and it has a headphone jack than can send pro logic ii which is simulated surround sound and this headphone support it. If you are copying my setup you will want to buy something. Buy a little 6 foot headphone extension cable. I have mine connected to the back of my tv and comes out by my cable box with over 3 feet of slack. The end of the cable has to connect to usb and the headphone jack (or included stereo to white and red rca audio cables). Having the extension cable will allow you to connect to your tv and your system at the same time.  The headphone and usb cables can only be about 6-8 inches apart so your connections have to be extremely close and that is why I need the extension. I wanted to avoid going to the back of the tv or receiver every time I wanted to use the headphones. Having that kind of setup will make you use these less. That way you can store these headphones in another location instead of having them always connected. With a little sister and rough housing friends of hers I want these headphones hidden away. These headphones have great sound quality, but there is a complaint I have about them. First, you can't hear the phone ring. Minor, but some people get mad when you don't answer. My solution, put mr. cordless next to the tv and when the phone lights up when it is ringing you can see it. Second complaint, with the way the little adapter clips to your shirt and the headset itself it is a little tricky to quickly put it away if someone knocks on the door or someone calls, minor. Third, the product feels extremely fragile. It feels like if I dropped it, put it away wrong, twisted the ear pieces a little too much it might break. Product is great, just wish it had heavier quality plastics around the headset. I've had no problems, but this is one product that I might have to re-purchase due to how fragile it is.    For the average joe I would look into getting an extension cable so you can put these away unless you live by yourself. I would consider finding a storage case or a good location to store these headphones so no one drops them or sits on them. Finally, if you have a receiver or newer tv I would seriously consider getting these and saving your money from buying a 5.1 headset or the 5.1 ear force processor. I have a high end tv, speaker, and surround sound setup and the sound quality and surround sound features seem to 85-92% similar to a regular 5.1 dts or dolby digital game surround sound with my setup and these stereo headphones. That will probably get some boo's from audio fans, but it does come seriously close. With the bass feature and the surround sound boost feature on these headphones the virtual surround sound is awesome. Only on rare situations can I turn the volume up in games and my gaming chair is not dead center of my tv so the left audio is stronger than the right. Not a problem with the headphones since you are getting the full experience and at a higher volume. I was playing Halo reach and I was doing better than I normally do since I could hear where the enemies were coming from. Works awesome with both ps3 and 360. A huge plus so you don't have to buy multiple headsets. I know I am not the only one who jumps around between systems. Hard to stick with one system with games like Uncharted, Resistance, Gears of War, and Halo.    Off topic. Look up \\"fps freaks\\" on amazon. The combination of those controller modifications and these headphones doubled if not tripled my gaming performance online. I don't work for them. Just bought them with the headphones and it was a blast!
1439102724|5.0|I bought this book for my wife for Mother's Day (her first) because I know, based on her book shelf, she is a huge fan. She read it in two days.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|*spoilers* It just suddenly hit me out of the blue today that this movie is a great movie for normal people to understand a paranoid schizophrenic in general. The intense looks and the delusions suffered by Leonardo DiCaprio with a trauma in his life taking center stage over and over again. From my personal experience, traumas resurface during schizophrenic episodes. While lost in your own deluded world, hearing voices and possibly seeing things, you do notice things in the real world as you walk about and encounter people and places. He was able to notice things like his \\"partner\\" not being able to handle a gun in its holster properly and men's shoes in the room that was supposed to be the female patient's room. If this was a real life situation, while already crazy, things like that would be driving the character mad as he tried to figure it out and was exploring possible explanations. I love the ending where he is alright and does know what is going on, but chooses to fool the doctors so that they give him the lobotomy (if I remember that correctly as being the procedure they would give him if this radical attempt to fix his sanity failed). I know firsthand when I am in one of those paranoid schizophrenic episodes and start getting better, I would choose to be given a procedure if it would take away the schizophrenia forever. I would not choose a lobotomy as I have read things about them since the time frame this story took place in and they are not often given anymore, I believe. If there was a procedure, however, where I could be myself, but not remember any of the schizophrenic episodes and have the schizophrenia taken away forever, I would choose it. No normal person can begin to understand the schizophrenic experience and how hard it truly is. I believe it is the most difficult illness in the world as it takes away your mental sanity and can radically change even your firm, long held beliefs in the blink of an eye. You change overnight into someone else yetto everyone, you are still you. Then, if you recover and regain sanity, it is so very difficult having to relive over and over again things you did when you were in a schizophrenic episode when your memories recall them. This movie is a way for normal people to get an idea of hard a schizophrenic episode can be and how they can recur over and over again. Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect in this role. I cannot even comprehend another schizophrenic's experience as they are each so highly individual even though they may share some commonalities. Intense emotions sometimes, isolation as you are the only one who can hear what is going on nonstop in your mind, delusions that feel so real and seem to make sense until you become sane if you become sane again. If you don't care to know, it's just one heck on an entertaining movie. I upgraded my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|Even if this film isn't totally based on true events, The Social Network is a great tale of what it takes to create a powerful business.<br /><br />When you have Aaron Sorkin as your screenwriter, you know the dialogue will be rhythmic and quick. The opening scene offers the skill at which these actors can deliver a Sorkin script.<br /><br />Luckily things slow down just a tad for the rest of the film so that we can actually enjoy what's being said.<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield do a fantastic job portraying the guys behind the creation of Facebook. Eisenberg's portrayal is one that you can't decide if you want to cheer for him or despise him.<br /><br />Garfield is the perfect friend. I can't wait to see his version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the upcoming superhero movie.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake gives us the man behind Napster and you can pretty much place the blame on his shoulders for how Facebook exploded out West as well as the destruction of the friendship between Garfield and Eisenberg.<br /><br />The Social Network could be a great tool to inspire people to create their own business. As long as they don't forget the friends who made it possible.

B000002KE2|5.0|Black Sabbath Vol. 4 is unimpressive in a superficial sense. It has a bland album cover, and a boring album title. However, it's filled with some diverse material that's heavy, dark, deep, and powerful. I've always liked Sabbath's rawer, heavier sound, and this album continues where Master of Reality left off in this aspect. There is nothing upbeat about this album; it's all doom and gloom, which is their trademark. The opening track, WHEELS OF CONFUSION/THE STRAIGHTENER is a perfect starter, and is around 8 minutes. The riffs in this song are terrific, as are the riffs on the rest of the album, which has such standouts as SNOWBLIND, CHANGES, CORNUCOPIA, ST. VITUS' DANCE, and the instrumental, LAGUNA SUNRISE. CHANGES is probably the most depressing Sabbath song ever, but is clear in its message. It also shows a different side to the band, and Ozzy in particular. I've heard that the Vol. 4 sessions occurred during some very turbulent times for the band, and I think it's reflected in the finished product. All told, this is a classic Sabbath album, and a must-have. You can't go wrong with this one.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Two attractive people in a screwed up sexy relationship equals a great movie. anyone that is a fan of Portman or Kutcher should own this movie.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I haven't finished the book (although I don't like what I've read so far), but I wanted to comment on the ridiculous pricing Random House set for the Kindle edition. As of 6/20/2011, it's $2 more than the mass market paperback price. I don't understand the publisher's antipathy toward the environment or toward a format with no resale ability. I wish people would wait to purchase this book until the publisher fixes their pricing models.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I loved this movie. Portman is excellent. My only wish is that there was more Mila Kunis. Mila does play a large role and is extremely sexy therefore there should have been more scenes with her. overall I would highly recommend this film.
0192802372|4.0|I don't know what it is about Jane Austen's novels, but I've read two of them now and I find that I really do enjoy them. The characters that she creates come alive on the page and even though nothing terribly exciting happens besides the usual day to day, I find myself drawn into the lives and events anyway.     In the introduction to my version of Emma, there is a comment that Emma is basically a book about nothing. While this is true in a way, Emma is about a lot more than nothing and gives the reader a fascinating glimpse into the world of Emma's England. There is also the great intrigue (insert tongue into cheek a bit) of whom will be matched up with whom and when these courtships will commence, etc.     Ms. Austen's easy to read style and sense of humor really do make this an enjoyable book to read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lighthearted frolic through classic literature in old England.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I didn't know much about the show other than it had recieved good reviews, being an avid movie collector it seemed like a good add. from the first episode I was in love. this could possibly be one of the best tv shows of the decade. from the beginning it has you hooked. this is a must own for anyone.
0143038583|5.0|Reading Mr. Pollan's book was truly a life-changing event.  He has an amazing ability to open your eyes to an entire world going on behind our food.  And he does so in an entertaining way.  Many nights I thought I would just read \\"this one quick chapter\\", only to find that two chapters later I was struggling to put it down.  His chapters on grass-fed pastured meat and eggs changed the way I eat.  I've since gone on to read Joel Salatain's books and explored the content on  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B00009R86L|5.0|I bought this pad to use on my carry-on travel bag, which features an over-the-shoulder style strap. The original strap that came with it had a cheap rubber pad on it, and after a couple of hours getting through security and waiting at the gate, the 25 lbs bag on my shoulder was really starting to get uncomfortable. I picked up one of these pads and it made a world of difference. The product material seems to be of high quality, and the dense rubber material does a great job of angling the pressure on your shoulder to spread the weight a bit more evenly. As others have mentioned, its pretty flexible and is not as rigid as it appears in the images.    While it isn't as if I put this pad on and said \\"oh it feels like I'm magically carrying a feather now,\\" it is a great improvement for me. I still feel all of the weight and pull of my heavy bag, but this pad takes the edge off of it, and eliminates that cutting, burning feeling I would get from my bag strap digging into my shoulder muscles after a while. I highly recommend it, and am buying a second one for my wife!

B0056BMK6K|5.0|John Locke is THE most successful indi-author out there. With 8 books to his name, one of which is bought somewhere in the world every 7-seconds (according to his figures)and a fan-base that numbers in the millions, Locke is a self-publishing powerhouse and a hero to many independent authors. As an author myself, I've followed his tweets, his blogs and his interviews trying to glean some kind of inkling into how he achieved his phenomenal success, but there was very little real information to be found -- until now.<br /><br />How I sold 1 million eBooks in 5 Months! outlines precisely how John achieved his success using his self-developed, step-by-step marketing system that shows you what worked for him, how to implement his strategy for yourself and, in my opinion just as importantly, what didn't work, so you don't waste your valuable time.<br /><br />The book is only 65-pages long but it is packed to the gills with the kind of priceless marketing information and insight that a self-published author could only ever dream of. While there are aspects of his system that you will have read elsewhere (build a website, get a blog etc.) it's the added detail that makes this book shine over other ebook-marketing books, and unlike other e-marketing books, John presents us with a plan, rather than just a list of suggestions. Each section lists the specific process and actions to follow that have helped John achieve his success. For instance, in the section covering interviews he recommends that you develop quotable sound bites (such as his now famous quote: \\"I no longer have to prove my books are as good as the world's most famous authors'. Now they have to prove their books are ten times better than mine\\"). He simply could not make it any easier for us, the rest is up to us.<br /><br />If you're an indie-author, do yourself a favor, spend the $5 on this book. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Paul Antony Jones
B004SBB0LU|4.0|Queen has been my favorite group since 1976. I saw them live in 1982 and own pretty much every recording of theirs that's been put on the market. So, of course, I had to have this collection. The sound quality of this package is excellent. (There have been some releases in the past (Nuce) that weren't up to par.)    I find the instrumental only tracks and live tracks interesting, but believe that there's a limited number of us for whom this is true. If you have most every Queen album, including Pre Ordained, you have everything you need. This set is excellent for Completists, but most others will find it redundant, because it's a collection of alternative and live versions.    I hate to rate anything that Queen produced lower than five stars, but I realize that everyone isn't as big of a fan as I am, so this rating is with the general public in mind. After all, what value is a rating of five stars if it only applies the the uber-fan? They already own a copy.    This package was released in the UK slightly before it appeared on Amazon, but I believe that the poster is an Amazon exclusive. If not, it was definitely less expensive through Amazon.

B00024I2Z4|3.0|The DVD was sent very quickly, arriving before the expected date. When I watched the movie, certain lines in the film could not be heard...you would not even know a person was speaking until the closed captioning was on. Very disappointing.

After reading this I went to visit the Nanjing Massacre Museum and I could hear her words echoing inside my head.  She has done her research and I respected what she was able to share despite how painful it must have been to tell.  She cut her life too short, I wish she could have contributed more on this subject.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Is it really that hard for Lucas to swallow his ego and let the fans get the versions they know and love? It is a sad thing that someone who stood against the evils of the industry not only became that evil, but actually ended up as something worse. Purely capitalistic money-grubbing studios would at least recognize what their fan-base would love to spend cash on and accommodate. Here we have a man who can't publicly admit that he made a mistake. At least Spielberg released the original E.T. after he realized the idiocy of the \\"guns v. walkie-talkies\\" mess. So we joke about that, but Spielberg is forgiven. He's not derided as much.... At least until Indy 4, but that's another topic.<br /><br />Lucas just can't get off of his high-horse. The original versions were demanded enough to get to be released on DVDs, and that was a massive teeth-pulling session just to get them there. (Notice how they were only considered \\"Bonus Features\\" on par with Making-Of shorts. *sigh*)<br /><br />I am not interested in this collection. Just give me the original three movies, remastered audio and video for Blu-Ray, and I'll be happy. I think that's what most people would be pleased with. At this point, I have to say the best collection of Star Wars I've seen is still the THX enhanced VHS set put out in the mid-1990s.<br /><br />Come on, George. Swallow your pride. Give the audience what they want. Embrace your original works, and most of your critics will suddenly go silent. Until then, you're just the Hollywood equivalent of the cranky old man screaming at kids to get off his lawn.
0062060554|5.0|If you enjoy psychological suspense, don't miss this superb debut novel that's been receiving rave reviews, first in the U.K. and now here in the States. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so I'll just say that it's about a woman, Christine, who has lost her memory after an accident years earlier and wakes up every morning not knowing who she is and not recognizing her husband, Ben, who has to explain things to her every day. On the recommendation of a neuropsychiatrist she is seeing, she starts keeping a journal that he hopes will help unlock her memory, and she begins to suspect Ben of deceiving her.<br /><br />This thriller is packed with fascinating twists and turns that made it almost impossible for this reader to put it down. And if I hadn't found out beforehand that the author is a man, I would have pretty much assumed that the story, which is told in first person from Christine's point of view, was written by a woman. It's a real page turner, and S.J. Watson is definitely an author to watch.
0061537969|4.0|My aunt, who is also a big dog lover, recommended this book to me.  I ordered it, and ended up reading it in two nights!  It was very easy to read, and so inspiring.  I have to admit, you will probably cry at least once, if not many times throughout this book.  There are many references to racing, which sometimes left me a tiny bit bored, but the story overall was so good! It really touches the heart.  If you have a dog and love him/her like I do, you will finish this book and hug that little puppy as much as you can!
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Fenix lights are always good in my opinion and my only complaint with the previous model - the TK40 - was the too-wide beam pattern.

This charger charges the batteries properly without overheating them and will give you long battery life.  If you need to charge C and D NiMh batteries, get the MH-808M charger.

0345505387|3.0|I love Diana Gabaldon books.  However, this was a little disappointing.  You have to be into comic books to like this one.  I would rather form my own mental pictures of the characters.  This is better for someone who doesn't know the story.
0439023513|3.0|The first 2 books were my favorite.  The last book while good was very dark.  It focused on a lot of emotional and physical pain.  I felt a little cheated at the end with the wrap up of the love story.  I guess since it was a story about society and dystopia not a young adult romance book, it does make sense.  But I was still disappointed with the paragraph ending.  I started to get a little confused with all the new characters in the war, but it was griping and chilling at times as well.<br /><br />I loved the series. Highly recommend to both young and old adults.
0385335997|5.0|You must start at the beginning to read this series.  It is one of the best series I have ever read, but you MUST start at the beginning.  There are a LOT of characters.. so you will need the outlandish companion.  But if you want an entwined story with factual historical events... this is for you.  I always had to read just one more chapter before bed...hence was going to sleep much later than planned.  Great set of books!
0439023491|4.0|I loved Hunger Games and didn't think I could like the sequel better.  I was wrong.  The story was exciting, captivating and I loved the introduction of the new characters.  It's often hard for me to remember that these characters are so young.  The book is for younger readers but story of new love, strength, and courage are timeless.  I highly recommend this book.
B003JBHQP4|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo35JKOYUM77GFE]]The Amazon Basics 21-in-1 Flash Memory Card reader is in the same ballpark as the  [[ASIN:B00109Y2DQ Kingston 19-in-1 USB 2.0 Flash Memory Card Reader FCR-HS219/1]]. Although the Amazon Basics accepts a couple additional form factors, essentially you can view them as similar.

The USB 2.0 is fairly quick and although the included USB cable is a bit short, it will probably suffice for most people, particularly if you are using it with a laptop computer.<br /><br />My biggest concern with this reader is that the Compact Flash Card slot is very shallow which means the pins are very close to the front face of the reader. Consequently a Compact Flash card is not being \\"guided\\" very far before the pins begin to connect with the card. The bottom line is that you may inadvertently bend or possibly break a pin if you force a compact flash card into the slot without using some caution. As compared to the Kingston device, which has a much deeper slot, the likelihood of damaging the pins is much less with the Kingston since the card is being guided for a longer distance which reduces the chances of pin breakage or bending.<br /><br />This is a little less expensive than the Kingston and works as well as the Kingston with the caveats that I have mentioned. It will get the job done.<br /><br />Pros: Versatile in that it can read 21 different flash memory devices (including micro drives which technically are not flash memory devices)<br />USB 2.0 is fairly speedy<br />Compact in size<br /><br />Cons:Compact Flash slot is shallow and could possibly create some issues of broken/bent pins if caution is not used.<br />Included USB cable is a bit on the short side.<br /><br />I rate this as OK.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|My wife was always complaining about the noise while she was watching tv downstairs, so I checked out a few reviews and decided on the PX21 headset. After a few tense moments, when I couldn't find the multi-output connector for my PS3, I got sorted out, loaded up Demon's Souls...and nearly jumped out of my skin!    The clarity of sound is superb and everything about the game becomes so much more sinister! There is a slight hiss from the earphones when all is quiet, but as that is virtually never, it is almost not worth a mention.    I now have a sore neck, as I am constantly straining to identify what is around the next corner, but its a price I am willing to pay for a whole new gaming experience! Why I haven't tried gaming in this manner before, I can only put down to stupidity....
B0007TKNII|5.0|Phantom of the Opera is a true story based on facts, and legends, it is a beautiful and powerful movie that has ever been protrayed by first Lon Chaney an soo many others. Gerard Butler protrays  \\"Erik\\" the phantoms role spectaculerly, for one who has never had a singing lession, his voice is soo spellbinding its scary. Emmy Rossum, the beautiful Christine Daae simply glows in her role, her outstanding singing for an 18, year old, really shows. she is soo mature and lovely, any man would want to fall in love with her. Patrick Wilson really brings out raouls charactor, he is handsome and dashing its no wonder all the girls want him.    The whole story is beautiful and scary and soo full of passion, the costumes, the set designes, are all increaible, erik and christines tragic love brings out how much you can learn to love those who are different an not ugly. its whats inside that counts.       i recommand that everyone who is anyone to pick this outstanding movie up, based on Gaston Leroux's beloved tragic  novel, after you hear this movie, i garantee you will be hearing Erik's music forever. an if you read the book the spirit of the real phantom will guide you an protect you like he was your guardian angel.     In 19O1 a hidden chamber was discovered  under Paris and in that chamber was a fernished room, and in the middle if it was the skeleton of the phantom of the opera Erik himself wearing a simple gold ring. what happand after that is a mystery.  This is a true event i am not joking.    to close off this is a real tale, facts and all based on the real phantom of the opera who lived many years ago in paris under the real opera house. if you want to find erik's lair go to Paris and start the search! adeiu!
B004289ZW0|1.0|This product was only marginally acceptable when I got it, enough so that I didn't return it. The power switch was flaky, as others have said. I had problems with sporadic communication between the device and my iPod touch, but it was annoying, not a deal-breaker.<br /><br />Now, after eight months, it has started malfunctioning so that it only sends a signal to the iPod touch about every minute or so. I've tried it with my iPad, and it does the same thing. I'll get no location for a minute or so, then it will zoom off to somewhere I haven't been.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend that nobody buys one of these. It's just more trouble than it's worth, and the unit didn't last very long. I'm looking elsewhere for a GPS unit.<br /><br />My $0.02 worth. YMMV.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey, you are one talented lady. I laughed throughout the entire book and not just chuckles but belly laughing. It is by far one of the best memoirs I have ever read. Anyone, male or female, will enjoy this read; I especially loved the fact that I could relate to Fey's adolescent woes as well as the hardships of being a working mother. A pleasant \\"behind the scenes pass\\" of SNL and 30 Rock vividly describes how hard the entire cast and crew work to entertain us. Only those with no sense of humor give this book a bad rating. Pure genius.

While many can \\"sing\\" only a handful can write and express themselves the way Adele does. I do think that is really what makes a \\"timeless\\" project Vs just a good singer who lucked into a hit song. This is the type of music that whatever \\"American Idol\\" show they have 2040 they will be singing songs from Adele.    Can't wait for the award season, \\"21\\" is going to be hot!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I love animated films. I suppose I've never really grown up. Or maybe it's just that I want a guaranteed happy ending.<br /><br />Rio opens in a South American jungle with a baby blue macaw who falls from his nest and is immediately snatched by poachers, who take him to the US--Minnesota, to be precise. When his crate falls off a truck in the snow, the frightened, shivering little guy is found by a young girl, Linda, who takes him home with her.<br /><br />Fast forward fifteen years: Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann), now an adult, owns a bookstore. The macaw, Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg, whose sister, Hallie, coincidentally, shared the screen with another talking bird, Paulie), is her constant companion. All is well in their lives until the arrival of Tulio, an ornithologist from Brazil. He explains that Blu is the last male of his species, and he's needed in Brazil to mate with the last female to perpetuate the species. Linda initially refuses, in spite of Tulio's insistence that the future of the blue macaw is at stake. Finally, she changes her mind and they're en route to Rio.<br /><br />They arrive as the city is preparing for Carnivale. It's not love at first sight for Blu and the female macaw, Jewel (voice of Anne Hathaway, one of my favorite actresses). She's a beautiful but feisty creature bent on regaining her freedom. Left alone to get acquainted, she's focused on her jailbreak--until they're both snatched by a young boy, Fernando, working for a smuggler.<br /><br />Being forced to work together to escape isn't easy for the wild Jewel and domesticated Blu, who can't fly! I love the way she refers to him as \\"pet,\\" as if it's a dirty word. Jewel has quite a temper.<br /><br />Blu and Jewel manage to escape their captors--but chained together, they initially find themselves bickering most of the time. As you might expect, however, they soon begin to warm to each other. Assisted by several other birds and a bulldog (voice of George Lopez), they no sooner are freed from the chain that's held them together than Jewel is again captured.<br /><br />Meanwhile, as they search frantically for the missing birds, bookish Linda and hopelessly nerdy Tulio bond. Helped by the guilt-ridden orphan boy who stole them to start with, they end up chasing the smugglers into the big Carnivale parade. There, Linda and Blu see each other...but Blu chooses to go after the smugglers' truck, to rescue Jewel.<br /><br />Linda and Tulio race to the airstrip but are too late.

0307946711|2.0|I liked parts of this book, but as a whole, it was too long and too melodramatic for me.  My first reaction at the start was that I should probably put it down due to the seemingly romantic formula and protagonist Dexter's obnoxious behavior.  I should have followed my gut.    Nicholls is a really good writer.  He has a deceptively simple style with a very good flow.  But the book is just too long with too much heated drama.  Ok, Dexter's a bad boy, Emma's a cool girl and why can't they get together - over and over and over.    I'd recommend this as a beach read, but it's 200 pages too long (at about 430) for that.  I'm surprised Nick Hornby gave the book high marks.  Maybe friend or same publisher?  Similar styles but Hornby's funnier and either has a better editor or better self-editing sense.

B003WUYOQ6|1.0|I read all of the raving reviews for this book, and was shocked when I began reading it. I am very disappointed in this book, and I cannot recommend it. While trying to impress, Taubes has truly missed the mark in communicating the essence of why we get fat. Basically foods which cause insulin levels to rise, increases the amount of fats the body holds onto. Foods which which allow insulin levels to remain low and within a normal range, increases the amount of fats the body releases. Skip this book, read a book by Ori Hofmekler.

0316069485|3.0|Just finished reading this book over the weekend. I enjoyed seeing Bosch-Haller team up, but was once again somewhat disappointed by the rather predictable plot. The pacing of the story was brisk enough to keep me interested, but 90% of the story centered around court procedural (think Matlock or Perry Mason) - but it's something I'd expect from a John Grisham novel rather than from Michael Connelly. Further, having read so many of his novels, it was rather expected that some kind of violent conclusion to the story would occur. It was just a matter of when, where, and which character(s) will end up getting killed that's up in the air.     WARNING - Plot revelation ahead!  Also, I thought the degree of violence at the end of the story was somewhat incongruous with the kind of murderer the central antagonist was. Jessup was a child abductor/murderer, he's a coward who preys on innocent and helpless victims, not someone who'd purchase a handgun and plot revenge murder of his defense team. It just seemed so unlikely, but then again there was very little character back story given to Jessup in the story anyhow.

B004UXUXGE|5.0|The thing about the sublime as an aesthetic (or religious) emotion is that you can only take it in small doses before it turns into unease and even fear. At one point in Werner Herzog's new, amazing documentary about the astonishingly realistic Paleolithic paintings in Chauvet Cave in France, the filmmaker notes that he and his film crew--as well as those who had first discovered and explored the cave--experienced an uncomfortable and uncanny sense of being watched by those who had painted the wild animals on its contoured walls some 32,000 years ago. Despite the beauty of what they were filming, all of the crew felt relief upon exiting. The way looking at light from millions- and billions- year-old stars evokes a sublime rapture of infinite space, appreciation of art made by incredibly distant ancestors who clearly were just like us--with our same talents and abilities and imaginations--evokes the sublime vertigo of history. The mind fills that vertigo with ghosts.<br /><br />The people who first ventured into the bowels of Chauvet cave with flickering torches to create those animal images clearly felt a profound connection with the natural world and affinity with its creatures. As with most \\"premodern\\" cultures, they probably believed in the ability of humans to transform into animals and vice versa. The only possibly \\"human\\" representation in the cave is what appears to be the lower body of a woman (resembling the various \\"Venus\\" figurines uncovered throughout Paleolithic Europe) and the upper body of a bull. But that image is the single exception--every other image in the cave is of an animal--horses, lions, rhinoceri, mammoths, aurochs, even a butterfly. What did those animals galloping across the walls and out of its recesses represent?<br /><br />Herzog suggests that the paintings in Chauvet are a sort of \\"proto-cinema.\\" The metaphor is clearly more than apt. Not only do the animal figures seem to move under shifting light such as would have been provided by torches (or, in the filmmakers' case, the few safe cold film lights they could bring with them into the cave), but some of the animals are \\"multilegged\\" in what is evidently a deliberate attempt to depict motion.<br /><br />The illusion of movement depends on a prior, more fundamental illusion, though: the illusion of stasis. The cave was as much a camera obscura as it was a cinema. So I'd add to Herzog's metaphor and suggest that this Paleolithic cinema was not just a theater but also a philosophical tool--and its animals, object lessons--for examining permanence versus impermanence, the mystery of Time.<br /><br />The arrested image is always dazzling and awe-inspiring for people who haven't seen it before or who don't see it everyday. In the 19th Century, people reacted to the first Daguerrotypes with surprise and delight. Viewers in the Renaissance reacted the same way to realistic pictures painted with the newly discovered techniques for showing space in perspective. We can readily imagine the mixture of joy, astonishment, and slight unease that a small Paleolithic community would have felt when their brilliant and eccentric cousin led them into a dark, sort of scary cave by torchlight to gaze on what he had been busy creating there on the walls. (\\"So this is what cousin White Bear has been up to!\\")<br /><br />The best indication that the above reactions were part of the intended reaction of the Chauvet images is that the latter are specifically and entirely (with the part-exception of the Venus-bull) of animals--the things in the painters' world that were most constantly in motion. No vegetable life was depicted, no people (who have the power to stand still), and no natural or celestial features (the sun, moon, and stars, move only slowly). And this idea of stasis manifests itself on two levels. Amid the growth and motion, birth and death, of everything in those people's environment, and of everything that they created, the paintings themselves were permanent,and this must have been a large part of their appeal and mystery. The world outside changed but in the depths of the cave was a sanctuary where things stayed the same, where Time stopped.<br /><br />(In creating something permanent, the painters outdid themselves: The interior of the cave has changed \\"geologically\\" over the 32,000 years since the paintings were made--dripping mineral-rich water has sculpted the interior with stalagmites, stalactites, sparkling ribbon-like formations--but the images remain unchanged. Just try and wrap your head around art that has survived that long!)<br /><br />But in this sanctuary of permanence, those fixed images, as Herzog notes, could be reanimated under flickering torchlight. Was this proto-cinema art for art's sake--purely for aesthetic enjoyment or dazzlement--or did these still/moving images have, as archaeologists are always quick to say, some kind of `ritual function'? When you look at a Renaissance painting of the Virgin, it's impossible to separate aesthetic enjoyment from religious sentiment--and certainly every individual viewer brings his/her own unique mix of these to the experience--so there's probably no point in trying to make a definitive answer.<br /><br />But maybe \\"religious\\" isn't the best term--nor \\"aesthetic.\\" I think that if there is some content or purpose of the Chauvet images--beyond just \\"pretty pictures\\"--that it is philosophical. I don't think it is coincidence that these cave images seem designed to walk a tightrope between stasis and motion and that the earliest philosophies of which we have written record are devoted precisely to understanding that very dichotomy, suggesting a continuity with prehistoric thought.<br /><br />The sixth-century BC Chinese philosopher Lao Tze wrote of the flow of things, or the Tao. In fifth-century BC Greece, Heraclitus compared the constant flow of Time to a river; he is most famous for his aphorism that you can't step in the same river twice. His main metaphor for the constant energy and motion of things, however, was \\"fire.\\" It's tempting to link this philosophical and primordial fire to the firelight cast by Paleolithic torches on cavern walls, providing the illusion of motion to the creatures painted there.<br /><br />Famously in opposition to Heraclitus was Parmenides (same period), who tried to convince his students that motion is an illusion, that the reality behind the appearances is stasis. His position would later be upheld and \\"proved\\" through the famous thought experiments of Zeno--for instance the arrow that, once shot, has to pass halfway to its target, but first halfway to halfway, and first halfway to halfway to halfway, and so on--so that in fact, it can never even start on its path let alone ever get to the end.<br /><br />The notion that all movement is an illusion might seem silly, but consider memory, which despite the apparent flux of experience seems to hold snapshots, to preserve experience in amber. Art is a reflection of memory and depends on it. Part of what is so astonishing about the paintings in Chauvet is how incredibly realistic, lifelike they are despite the fact that they cannot have been painted from life, only from the artist's memory. I assume that cave artists of the caliber represented in Chauvet would have to have honed their skills outside in the light--I suppose with a stick in dirt when watching their subjects up close, perhaps over many years.<br /><br />It takes art to remove us from what we take for granted and show it to us in a new way, as a mystery. That separation and return can provide the sublime rapture that occurs when we push our thoughts to infinities. Time has always been one of the fundamental mysteries, because humans are not cognitively capable of understanding it. I can't help but think that the awe of viewers of these painted bison, horses, rhinoceri, mammoths, and lions, or even just the awe of the artist, arose from amazement at Time itself. And in a different way and for different reasons, it's Time that is amazing about Chauvet cave, and Herzog's film.'s tempting to link this philosophical and primordial fire to the firelight cast by Paleolithic torches on cavern walls, providing the illusion of motion to the creatures painted there.

B000FCKGPC|2.0|I really hate to say this but I think that this book was written for a TV series. How else does it make sense that it is so lame? It really does read like a soap-opera  and I am sad that such a promising series is whimpering out. Slogging through pages and pages to get to the meat of the matter is not fun.  When I find myself \\"speed-reading\\" instead of \\"re-reading\\" chapters I know something has gone amiss with the author.  In spite of the (what one review called sadistic)awful treatment the most likeable characters get I was entrenched in finding out the history of this fantasy world.  Now I feel meh....why bother....I will just be disappointed. Read if you must.
0062060554|4.0|This book is a great character study, has great mystery/suspense and constantly has you thinking of all of the possible scenarios and outcomes. With such a small cast of characters and some that are rarely studied very much, it's amazing the way the author makes you think you know those characters and guess what their motives may be. As a woman, it made me think about the extent to which we rely on other people for what we think about ourselves. The pacing in general was very, very good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the pacing became slow at the end of the second part but otherwise the pacing was excellent and I could not put it down. I immediately looked to see what other books this author has published and I'm amazed to see this is his very first book. It's a great fast read even though it's 385 pages and perfect for book club. Our book club was taking the summer off but I scheduled an impromptu book club while I was half way through. You won't be disappointed!
0618918248|5.0|If you are a person that likes to think about the world and what you read (I never agree with all of it), the book approaches a very important subject. As an atheist, it is often hard to know how to interact with religious people without offending them. Dawkins offers a different perspective than Hitchens. Worth reading

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria is a show which revolves around a sarcastic and somewhat cynical look at teenage life.  It also provides witty commentary about how the generalizations and stereotypes that surround teenage life also extend past it into adult life.  Daria uses a deadpan voice to deliver the punchlines that we were all thinking, resulting in smart comedy that requires... well ... thought.  Frankly the comedy of modern times relies on shock value and random cut away scenes unrealated to plot for a quick, non-sensical laugh, sort of like a court-jester.  Daria will challenge you to see the things in your own daily life in a different light as well, and perhaps will provide you with a coping mechanism for tough days at work or school.    Some will complain that the MTV music from the 90's is removed, but I don't think that was the point of the show's production in the first place, so I enjoyed the show anyway.  Five Stars!
0062060554|5.0|You might have heard about Before I Go To Sleep - the debut novel of S. J. Watson. You might have heard that it's an addicting, incredibly well crafted, finely honed suspenseful tale that will leave you turning pages long into the night.<br /><br />Everything you've heard? All that and more! What an amazing debut! Rights have been sold in thirty countries already and the film rights are sold as well.<br /><br />Christine wakes up early and finds herself in bed with a middle aged man. One she doesn't know and can't quite remember how she got there.<br /><br />\\"Usually I can remember how I get into situations like this, but not today. There must have been a party, or a trip to a bar or a club. I must have been pretty wasted. Wasted enough that I don't remember anything at all. Wasted enough to have gone home with a man with a wedding ring and hairs on his back.\\"<br /><br />She creeps into the bathroom, but the hand that flushes the toilet looks wrong. And when she looks into the mirror, there's a middle aged woman looking back. That can't be her - she's twenty five, that woman is at least 45... And then the man wakes up and tells her who she is - his wife. His wife who had a bad accident that left her with head injuries and severe amnesia. She literally cannot remember anything from day to day.<br /><br />\\"You've had amnesia for a long time. You can't retain new memories, so you 've forgotten much of what happened to you for your entire adult life. Every day you wake up as if you are a young woman. Some days you wake as if you are a child.\\"<br /><br />Ben her husband goes off to work. The phone rings and she answers it - it's a man who says he is a doctor treating her and tells her to look in her closet for her journal. And along with Christine, we read what she remembers. Until she goes to sleep and forgets it all again.....<br /><br />Can you just imagine waking up with no memory and reading a journal you've written with what you've learned or remembered about yourself? Every day. As we get further and further into her journal everyday, the questions arise - should Christine trust the doctor  - or her husband?<br /><br />S. J. Watson has done a phenomonal job at intensifying the suspense and building on it in subtle layers. I was reminded of classic Alfred Hitchcock films. The ratcheting tension is thoroughly delicious. The cover art is great too, with the fogged mirror and the woman peering through.

B004EQAVHI|2.0|I finished watching this movie half an hour ago, and I'm still depressed.  When I got it, a friend said it was very sad, so I immediately figured out what it was about.  The acting by Mulligan was superb.  I really felt her scenes.  The production values were first class.  But I asked myself repeatedly as I watched the film, why did the protagonists not run away?  It makes no sense to me why they stayed under those conditions.  So it depressed me, and I'm still depressed.  Give me \\"Independence Day\\" or \\"The Fugitive\\" or \\"Die Hard\\" any day where the protagonists fight back.
B003UESJHO|1.0|I have met Mickey Ward several times at the International Boxing Hall of Fame, and this year he and Dick Ecklund were both in attendance. They seemed to be fine men, a far cry from the drug-addled trash depicted in the movie. The movie's plot hopscotched all over the place, making it impossible to follow, and the dialogue was largely unintelligible -- except for profuse use of the \\"F\\" word. In short, a piece of trash, not worth the film it's made on.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I felt compelled to share how good this album is. I did not have the highest expectations for the Foo crew after so many years together and so many releases. For example, Audioslave (which I know is a super group) eventually peetered out and got stale. Anyway, Foo Fighters - Wasting Light has got to be my favorite album from them in 10 years (since There Is Nothing Left to Lose). Yes, most bands operate according to a formula and get stale. There are the typical Foo sounds on this album but man, they definitely added the hot sauce. There are NO slow ballads or acoustic hippy songs. Just hard rock. Amen brother. The album starts off with Bridge Burning. Fast and strong. A familiar Foo chorus but definitely good guitar rock. Then moves on to, Rope. You will like this if you are a long time Foo fan. Dear Rosemary adds some new Foo flavor. Good layering of vocals and a catchy chorus (and of course it is rocking). Then comes White Limo. Holy punk rock! Man, the Foo Fighters sound like the Suicidal Tendencies or something here. I love it. Then comes Alrandia. This should be their most commercially popular song. Very well crafted. These Days is another hard rocking Foo song. On Back & Forth, Dave sounds a bit different. I like it. Again, it brings the hard-driving rock sound. At the risk of continually repeating myself, I will just say the rest of the songs are ROCK N ROLL delicious. If you love rock, you NEED to buy this album. Period.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I actally love the movie, I waited a long time for this one to come out, I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, however what I will say it dors stay close to the red riding hood image however it is different... If you love horror you will love this one and this actress is great.

B00005OAE6|5.0|Detroit singer/songwriter/rocker Bob Seger released his eleventh album Stranger in Town in May of 1978.<br />By 1977, Bob had become a superstar thanks to the back to back successes of the albums Live Bullet and Night Moves. Then, as Bob finished the Night Moves Tour in late 1977, he and The Silver Bullet Band (which featured bass player Chris Campbell, sax player Alto Reed, guitarist Drew Abbott and the first album with drummer David Teegarden (who replaced Charlie Allen Martin) and the last with keyboard player Robyn Robbins (who would leave in 1979)) (tracks 1, 2, 5 and 8) plus help by The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (drummer Roger Hawkins, guitarists Jimmy Johnson and Pete Carr, bass player David Hood and the late keyboard player Barry Beckett) (tracks 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9) and numerous female backing singers (on many of the tracks) to record arguably his best studio album. All of the tracks (except noted) were written by Bob Seger.<br />We begin with the stellar rocker \\"Hollywood Nights\\" which featured Little Feat keyboard player Bill Payne on keyboards. This rocker still burns today and talked of the shallowness of L.A. and Hollywood. This rocker peaked at #12 in 1978. Next is the mid-tempo number \\"Still the Same\\" which talks of the ill-fated gamble on a relationship. This track would peak at #4 in the summer of 1978. Next is the album's most famous track \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" (which was written by George Jackson, Thomas Earl Jones with lyrics by Bob Seger) and has one of Alto Reed's best sax solos and this rocker is still a jukebox and karaoke favorite today although it barely hit the US Top 30 in 1979. But, thanks to Tom Cruise's infamous lip synching scene of the track in Risky Business, has become a classic on all radio stations. Next is the mid tempo rocker \\"Till It Shines\\" which is one of Bob's best tracks with excellent lyrics and features Bob's friend Glenn Frey of The Eagles playing the lead guitar solo and sharing the lead with Pete Carr at the intro and outro. The first half ends with the rocker \\"Feel Like a Number\\" which just rocks and is still a rock radio staple today. This track makes one want to drive at 100 MPH on the freeway when hearing. It rocks!<br />The second half of the album begins with a rocking cover of Frankie Miller's \\"Ain't Got No Money\\" which rocks and featured Pete Carr on ripping slide guitar and a soaring guitar solo from Don Felder of The Eagles. Next is the beautiful ballad \\"We've Got Tonight\\" which is one of Bob's best ballads. Originally called \\"This Old House\\", the lyrics were re-written after Bob saw the movie The Sting. The track featured beautiful string arrangements by Jim Ed Norman. This excellent ballad reached #13 in late 1978. \\"Brave Strangers\\" is next and a great song about two innocent lovers who tried to get it right the first time but wound up as the title says. We close the album with my favorite Seger ballad \\"The Famous Final Scene\\" which features Pete Carr's superb guitar work, the haunting string arrangements of Jim Ed Norman and lyrically talks about how all good things don't last and everything has an ending.<br />Stranger in Town would hit #4 in 1978 (that damn soundtrack to Grease was hard to dethrone from #1 at the time) and has consistently sold well and to date has sold six million copies in the US alone. The remastered version from 2001 sounds much better than the flat sounding CD which came out in the 1980s.<br />RECOMMENDED!ro.

0316098329|2.0|Being interested in child development, I thought this book would be different, showing Jack's point of view. Instead his character was not consistent. It also seemed to mirror some of the more recent abduction stories, which is what annoyed me the most. The escape was almost unbelievable. The ending happens too quick with the author writing weeks worth of info in a page with almost no follow up. Usually I want a sequel because I feel like i'm missing out, with this one, I was happy to close it & not have to read anymore.

Although kid leo and wmms had been pushing \\"the boss\\" train I hadn't felt compelled! Then friends coaxed me into giving \\"born to run\\" a spin. What a surprise, it was cinematic... truly a work of art. This anniversary edition won't disappoint. The album still stands out and for the casual fan the live dvd is a nice touch. The making of disc hasn't made it to my player, but for devoted fans it would have to be icing. I promise I'll watch it, just enjoying the album so much I haven't got to it yet.

B002S8AGZG|5.0|The new kid in school falls in love with the most innocent looking girl in school, but when he discovers that the only way to go out with her is if her sister is also dating. So decides to trick the stupidest rich boy in school into paying a guy (who is know for being rebellious) to go out with her harsh sister. But in the end, they all end up with something and that something maybe true love.<br />I loved this movie. I watched the beginning and wasn't very interested it had a slow beginning and I was waiting for something to happen. But I decided to give the movie a full run and I absolutely loved it. It was hilarious, excellent, and cute. It was an amazing teen movie that is just as good as recent teen movies like Easy A. This movie is a must see! You won't regret it, its just so good!<br />The 1st release DVD has terrible quality, grainy and the format is fullscreen but with the bars, so on a widescreen tv, it looks very long and stretched. I highly recommend the blu-ray, the picture is full and bright, except I noticed the tops of their heads are slightly cut off, I don't know if it's my tv or the blu-ray or the playing doing but it can be distracting at times, but in the end it's better than having that terrible grainy picture.<br />[HIGHLY RECOMMENDED]
B004GUSG4M|4.0|If you read the other reviews, I'd say they were spot on.  This book captured my interest by reading the intro and I bought it.  I started reading it in the car last night and finished it today; it truly is a page turner.  The story is completely captivating and intriguing; it keeps you guessing throughout the book.  So why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?, the ending; the last several pages seemed almost too rushed, an afterthought if I may say so and the ending itself? left me wanting more.  That, some may say, is the sign of a great story, but for me..not so.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|I was pretty impressed with their first EP and album but the latest from Fleet Foxes is nothing less than an audible masterpiece.  What I love about this beautiful journey is that there is only one captain amongst a sea of sounds crashing waves of harmonies and acoustic instruments - and he is awesome.  Vulnerable, insightful, and unpredictable, Robin Pecknold sits and sings comfortably around the table as players and listeners are all welcome to explore an incredible soundscape that seems to bridge fragile moments you may have had in high-school with the spirit of a hundred men on horses bolting to the castle to wage war or rescue a princess.     If you like strong storytelling, incredible songwriting, beautiful harmonies and timeless tunes - get it.

B004RSCWZ2|5.0|OK so no one else is going to say it, I will. Susan sounds a LOT like a young(er) Bonnie Raitt... she sounds eerily close in not only tone but style. Given that I personally love Bonnie Raitt, listening to Tedeschi is pure joy. Since she's not exactly like Raitt and in some ways a better singer - I say this with some caution - every song on this CD was extremely entertaining.<br /><br />I am a keyboardist in a local Blues band and I really appreciate exactly how recorded music is produced. I felt that, given the punch that Tedeschi's voice has and the searing slide of Trucks (Tedeschi's no slouch as a guitarist either) it would be difficult to balance both of them along with a full blues band (horns and all.) I would say whomever produced and engineered these tracks is nothing short of a genius. Clearly, the whole exceeds the sum of its parts.<br /><br />I haven't bought a CD in a while, but this one is well worth it.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise.  I have been a fan since 1965 (in the beginning) and this collection is by far the best.  There are hours of pure enjoyment and excitement in these four seasons. It is truly unfortunate that the show ended so soon.  There are many parallel social and moral issues from the future and our time that are explored in Star Trek: Enterprise.  I love all the main characters from the show and I think they all developed their roles with credible insights. I highly recommended the product from Amazon to anyone who has the slightest interest in science fiction, space exploration and/or just good entertainment--you will not be disappointed!
0316010669|4.0|This is a great book for anyone trying to understand how people make decisions. You'll learn when it is appropriate to trust your gut and instincts and when it is appropriate to use other tools help raise your situational awareness.     This book also goes in depth as to why experience plays such an important role in decision making at the last minute. Gladwell uses some pretty compelling case studies like Chicago's Cook County Hospital and how Orchestra choose brass players.  VERY interesting!    I listened to it as an audio book, and it was perfect for a 12 hour drive.
1400079144|2.0|I received this book as a Mother's Day gift.   Brown's books all follow the same formula and structure.  Read one and you have read them all.   I agree with other reviewers - the books is too long, not very well-written, and predictable.   The last 50-100 pages could have been deleted with no major effect on the plot.  Buy this book used or borrow it from a friend.  It is not worth having it in your library.
0345455681|3.0|The main problem with London is the repetitive, almost formulaic construction of characters and their personal crises. In the latter half of the book it becomes clear that both the protagonists and plot have been written to fit neatly into a historical context. Rather than the historical period being a backdrop to to the action, it becomes the action. A succesion of text-book puritans and courtiers, doctors and preachers are paraded like carboard cut-outs on the stage to act out the reformation of the English church, the Civil War, the Fire of London and rebuilding of St.Pauls. At times the chapters are so superficial and brief, that it seems the author lacked interest in certain historical periods, and only wrote about about them for form's sake (because they were central to London's history).    In the first few chapters, admittedly the action has some suspense. The characters, if not well rounded, at least inspire some interest due to their personal challenges. But after the end of the Middle Ages, around the era of Henry VIII, the plot becomes stale. Rutherford is much better at story-telling in early history, in a pagan/medieval setting. Perhaps because less is know about these periods, he did not feel constrained to fit his plot and characters around a list of historical events. And in this context, he can truly entertain. If only he had stuck at this, otherwise the book should have ended 700 years earlier.

B0006IIKS0|4.0|Regardless of your personal opinion of the album St-Anger the 2004 documentary Some Kind of Monster which chronicles the events leading up to the recording of the album and the following tour gives a detailed look at Metallica during this period. Some Kind of Monster begins in the early 2000's with the events following the Load and Reload albums; Jason leaving Metallica, the band's lawsuit against Napster among others. It's really interesting to see all the time, effort, emotions, frustration and just everything that the band went through. It made me understand the album St-Anger much more and it made me understand the band as a whole much more as well. It's clear to me that the band worked hard on the album and was pleased with the result at the time.<br /><br />Losing Jason Newsted was surprising and a shock to the band as the loss of a longtime member is always hard to deal with. Then having James go through rehab and then being gone for months without knowing if he was ever going to come back to Metallica must have been hard on Lars and Kirk. There's also the element of \\"who's going to replace Jason?\\" that arises when the band is confronted with the search of a new bassist which is a great part of this documentary (watching the band jam with different bassists was a nice experience). One of the highlights of Some Kind of Monster is the discussion between Megadeth frontman (and ex-Metallica guitarist) Dave Mustaine and Lars Ulrich. For years Dave has lived with a Metallica sized chip on his shoulder and he finally get to express his frustrations and feelings to Lars and give him his perspective on what he's been through after his departure from the band. The interviews with Jason Newsted aren't too flattering for the band, you really feel sorry for Jason that things could not work out between him and the and the band as he was obviously very proud to be part of Metallica.  Jason is the only band member who comes off this documentary as a truly decent guy (oh and Kirk, but he's in the shadow of Lars and James fighting constantly like he's been since seemingly forever!) unfortunately, not that the rest of the band are bad person it's just that the documentary doesn't make them look all that great (although James attending his girl's ballet class was a touching moment). Some Kind of Monster captures what is certainly not the best but nonetheless an important chapter of the band's career and lives.<br /><br />The display of emotions, good or bad allows the viewers to really connect with the band and those involved because it shows these \\"Rock Gods\\" on a more human angle. Some Kind of Monster received praises for its honest portrayal of Metallica, it's also received its fair share of criticism from fans who thought certain aspects like the band getting help from a psychologist, complaining and whining were lame (and they probably were). Seeing the band go through therapy is very un-metal of them, so much for a macho image! Watching Metallica doing therapy and arguing about every little thing is perhaps not what fans want to see of their idols but it makes them seem more human. The recording for St-Anger was a very long and uneasy one and this documentary does a good job of showing just that. There's even a scene where the band questions doing the documentary and are seriously considering stopping the actual filming. One of my favorite parts is when the remaining Metallica member discuss solos with producer Bob Rock. Lars feels that they should do a more current approach and not have any solos on this new alum whereas Kirk feels that this so called \\"rule\\" dates the album to that particular period in time. It's fascinating to see the and argue over whether or not to include solos on the album as Metallica are known for their trademark guitar work and solos in their music among other things.<br /><br />I think Metallica fans owe it to themselves to see Some Kind of Monster, especially those who hated St-Anger because this documentary sheds some light on the whole recording process and the events surrounding that album. That's what I like about Some Kind of Monster, its brutally honest and shows Metallica simply being Metallica and sometimes it's not pretty (James and Lars exchanging harsh words and comments). I'm glad that fans were allowed to see this when the band could've easily said \\"No, we don't want the fans to see this or that part because it makes us look bad etc.\\" but they didn't, Metallica lets us into their lives and see the recording process for ourselves. I'm not a huge fan of St-Anger I have to admit, but watching this documentary made me understand it much more and even if I wasn't a fan of the album I loved the documentary and watching these guys interact and create music together. Some Kind of Monster is not a flattering documentary on one of the biggest bands of all time; rather it shows the band being themselves and allows the viewers the ultimate experience of being in the studio with Metallica. As a documentary Some Kind of Monster works because its subjects are interesting and there are plenty of conflicts and obstacles for the Metallica to overcome. Yes it's not the band's best era and all but I find this to be interesting as a fan even if it's not perfect by any means. I'll give the movie 4/5 stars, a very good look at Metallica at their lowest point.the whole recording process and the events surrounding that album.

8862937148|5.0|2012 will be my third year using this planner. It is perfect for me. I love the pocket in it! The pocket usually tears for me because I use it so much, but I tape it and it's good to go. I write classes, birthdays, holidays, etc. on the left side and my weekly to-do lists, weekly bills and other notes on the right each week. I write important info on the notes pages in the back. I never go without this essential planner!  Edit:  I have given this to my husband in the hopes he'll use it. I THOUGHT this was the NORMAL sized one, my mistake.

0439023521|5.0|I had seen a review of this series in the New Yorker and a few friends recommended reading these books.  This is a series meant for kids, but it is also a nice quick read for adults.  There is a strong female character here, which is nice for kids to see.  The story is well-told and fast moving.  I recommend it.
B00004R99F|5.0|I have a 16 year old son, and I have watched this movie at least 25 times with him since it came out. It is the moving epoch of a man whose only aim in life is to make his son happy, but he does it without regard to what his son sees as happiness. Goofy cannot see the opposition that his son gives to his plans for them, but what else would you expect from a man whose name is Goofy? In a world that treats fatherhood as an afterthought, this is a refreshing look at a man's unyielding love for his son. It ranks as one of the best all-time father-son movies.
0670022411|4.0|I don't see why more people aren't raving about this book.  From the very first page the book had me and didn't let me go.  It moved from England to France to the USA.  The events changed and exciting, romantic and scary things happened at regular intervals.  Reading this book made me want more and the author left you hanging for a reason.  There is going to be a future for Diana and Matthew.  I can't wait for book 2.  Some of the reviewers are just downers.  Why finish the book if you aren't happy by page 100.  Get over yourself and go on to another book, for heaven's sake.  I loved the book and I recommend it to readers everywhere.
0439023513|3.0|The first 2 books were amazing. The third book, I felt Katniss should have stepped up her game a bit. My biggest disappointment was anytime something interesting was about to happen, Katniss almost always blacks out or gets hysterical and has to be sedated. It gets annoying. I liked the ending though. My least favorite of the 3 for sure.

0425242099|4.0|Overall a very good addition to the series. Very interesting characters but a few places could have moved along a bit faster. I didn't find the romance as compelling as some of those in the first books of the series, but as always Nalini Singh's fine writing made this one I couldn't put down. This book is only 4 1/2 stars in comparison to the best of this series - it is better than most other books of this type.

B004P96WJ0|5.0|As a dedicated classical music listener and audiophile for decades, I can say that this set has totally changed my view about the future of home entertainment.  I was somewhat burned out on Mahler given the plethora of releases of his symphonies and numbers of live performances I have seen.  I was also somewhat indifferent to Maestro Abbado, not having included much of his output previously in my collection.  I knew him to be a great conductor, but there were plenty of other great ones, too, I thought.<br /><br />All that changed dramatically upon obtaining this set.  This is a definite \\"must have\\" among all other renditions of Mahler's  symphonies.  I doubt I will ever seek any other performances of these works after traversing this absolutely magnificent set.  They are  superbly and movingly performed by wonderful artists with superb sonics.  But, the beautifully done video component adds a whole new dimension of insight into the passion, the sensitivity and the artistry of Mahler's music and of the musicians who perform it.  I have been an SACD multichannel music lover, but this is in a class by itself.<br /><br />After being dazzled by opera on Blu-ray, I have now come to realize how live concert performances in this medium can offer even more listener involvement in the music and the performance than audio-only.  It is totally engrossing, totally enjoyable.  Not only does it exceed the hi rez audio-only listening experience, but in some ways, it exceeds even live performance because of the deftly done, intimate close-ups of conductor and performers.  It gets us closer to live performance than anything in any medium to date.<br /><br />And, what can one say about Maestro Abbado himself?  One gets to know him musically and on an emotional level that is unparalleled.  If I was indifferent to him before, I now consider myself an ardent fan of the highest order.  Not only do we hear, but we see why he is at the pinnacle of Mahler conductors today.  This is something very, very special, indeed.<br /><br />I have only some minor technical quibbles with the set.  First, the box is erroneous is saying that Disc 3, containing the Symponies #5 & 6, is in LPCM 2.0 only.  It is not.  That disc is also in DTS - HD Master Audio 5.0, as is the rest of the set.<br /><br />The series goes back to Lucerne Festival performances beginning in 2004.  It seems some of the earlier releases have a minor touch of brightness here and there that has been rebalanced to perfection to my ears on my system on later releases.  Indeed, the separately available disc of the Symphony #9 in a searing, incandescent performance from the 2010 Festival is at least as good sonically as anything I know of on SACD.  Can the mighty Symphony #8 be far behind?  I expect it will be performed at the Festival this year and released thereafter.<br /><br />I was less taken by the \\"bonus\\" Rueckert Lieder performance by soprano Magdalena Kozena.  But, she is wonderful in the Symphony #4.  The added Prokofiev Piano Concert #3 with the beautiful Juja Wang is delightful in every way.<br /><br />This set has smitten me to an absolutely unprecedented degree.  And, I will be seeking out and collecting concert Blu-rays from here on in.  It is truly a fantastic new dimension in classical music enjoyment in the home.eed.

1594744769|2.0|I have had it with books that spend 300+ pages to set up the sequel while not redeeming the first edition. While the language used here was often creative, the story moved along at the rate of arctic drift. Note to Mr. Riggs: Write twice the story using the same number of words and I will buy your next book. As it is, this book was simply a long hike for a non-existent payoff.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|On July 9, 2010, Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment released Despicable Me in theaters across the United States. Starring a plethora of well-known actors and actresses, including Steve Carrel and Julie Andrews, the movie was a success, raking in close to $57,000,000 on just the opening weekend. The person who wrote the storyline was Sergio Pablos, who was also one of the executive producers for this film.   The main characters for Despicable Me are Dr. Gru, Vector, Margo, Edith and Agnes. Doctor Gru is an evil villain, Vector is Dr. Gru's \\"evil\\" nemesis, and Margo, Edith and Agnes are three orphan sisters. Taking place in a suburban neighborhood that is surrounded by white-picket fences, flower gardens and beautiful green lawns sits a house that sticks out like a sore thumb. Characterized by the dead lawn and towering structure, Dr. Gru's house is definitely the most recognizable. Also very identifiable is his car, which is a massive car/airship. Vector also lives in a unique house and drives a car/airship; however they seem more futuristic, while Gru's seems very villain-like. While Vector and Gru live by themselves, Margo, Edith and Agnes live with a terrible warden named Miss Hattie. While other children have the mother-figure in their lives, these three helpless girls are stuck with a cynical lady who gets her laughs from making little girls sleep in the Box of Shame. These are just a few of the characters and settings throughout the movie.   After hearing news that a super-villain has stolen a pyramid, Gru and his minions have decided to pull off the biggest heist the world has ever seen: stealing the moon. However, there is one thing that he needs to pull it off: the shrink ray. The only problem is that his nemesis, Vector, has the shrink ray and is not willing to give it up because he, too, wants to steal the moon. While Gru was trying to break into Vector's lair, three orphaned girls named Margo, Edith and Agnes sell Vector cookie dough. Being the mastermind that he is, he adopts the three girls and  uses them to capture the shrink ray. As he spends more quality time, he starts becoming more of a father-figure and losing focus of stealing the moon. Will he become the ultimate super-villain? Or become the father-figure these girls need?   Despicable Me has many underlying themes, but the one that I think that stands out the most is that no matter how \\"evil\\" you are, there's always a good side to people. For example, Gru is arguably the \\"baddest\\" villain on the block, with his demeaning and condescending attitude throughout the movie. As soon as he adopts the children though, his attitude slowly starts turning around. Now the person who was once the most feared villain in town is now softening up into a role model for Margo, Edith and Agnes. Showing that he cared about them and not about stealing the moon shows that he has changed into the father-figure the girls needed.    I love this movie! Seeing that this movie is an animated movie, I can understand that most people would recommend this for young children. However, I would recommend this movie to people of all ages. Although this movie might seem childish, it has lessons that everyone can learn from. This movie is hilarious, with mild, but not crude or distasteful humor. Whether you're watching it with your friends or family, this movie is perfect for just about any time.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I just watched this movie Saturday and it has the best story line and content I have ever seen in a gay genres movie. I the main charter Zack was so believable for me and the pressure that he was getting from his sister about helping out and always being available to take care of his nephew was heart wrenching. The way Zack stayed cool with how his sister was not taking care of her and then stepping in as the father figure was the part that put this movie on a whole other level. The way Shaun and Zack relationship evolves is one of the most believable I have ever seen and the way  Shaun GENTLY pushes Zach to better himself by giving him an application to the school that he wants to go to is how I would think a boyfriend that love his man to act.   The ending showing how  Shaun and Zach take in Zach's nephew and then how the last part moves to the beach seen closes out the movie very well.

0553103547|5.0|In a similar vein as most of the other recent reviews to this book, I first heard from Game of Thrones from the HBO special. Wanting to see what all the fuss was about and having read fantasy for many years, I decided to check it out. The world Martin has created is rich, detailed, and has a realism to it that differentiates it significantly from other \\"high fantasy\\" books such as Lord of the Rings, R.A. Salvatore's work or the Dragonlance novels.<br />The book (and by extension...the series) draws its strength from the following:<br /><br />1. Composition Style: Martin uses a writing convention where each chapter is presented (and titled) from the perspective of a specific character. I truly believe this approach is what permits the author to lay out the story and have it unfold in the remarkable way that it does because you experience an event occurring from multiple perspectives so rather than having a chief protaganist \\"discover\\" the events...the reader becomes repository for all current event knowledge. This presents interesting situations where you know what the facts are, but the main characters may not, so part of the fun is discovering how the characters experience the event.<br /><br />2. Characterization: Coupled with the style is Martin's superb ability craft very memorable and unique characters across a wide variety of traditional and unconventional archetypes. Where he particularly excels is through incorporating multiple traits (positive and negative) in such a combination that it makes the characters seem real. You quickly learn the driving motivations and principles of the characters and how much this shapes their perspective, their interactions, and their reactions to story plots.<br /><br />3. Environment: Martin has crafted a fantastic world that I almost compare to a post-apocalyptic fantasy...a world that was previously infused with magic and in some ways still retains vestiges of that time, but where such power now exists on the periphery of the world. It gives him license to use magic occassionally, but to ground the story and background within the gritty reality in which it resides.<br /><br />4. Political Factions: Definitely the overarching story elements concerning the various Houses dominates the story and it is this focus that puts this series on the map. The intricate backstory and history of Westeros, the history of the various houses that have controlled, or lost control, of the realm, and how that history shaped the present ranks up there with the best the genre has to offer.<br /><br />5. Realism: This characteristic is both a positive and a potential negative for those who may be looking for a high fantasy or a child friendly book. I'll be blunt...this is not a book for kids...at all. The story is extraordinarily dark at times with events such as rape, mutilation, and a casual disregard for life very common. That said, if you can stomach such things...these events, while terrible to read, did not seem gratuitous or, frankly, unnecessary. The world Martin has created is dark and, at times, chaotic and he pulls no punches. If a chaotic situation occurs then the violence and license taken by the characters seems possible and probable.<br /><br />As I finished the book and realized that I was in for the long haul, it surprised me how strongly your attachment to some of these characters can be. While dark....and trust me at times it is extremely dark...it is these events and how they are presented from multiple perspectives that make you feel extremely sympathic for some. I found myself genuinely rooting for some of the antagonists to die...something I rarely experience, but its because Martin does a fantastic job of making these bad guys particularly evil. It'll be a turnoff for some readers, but its also one of the books great strengths.nse to use magic occassionally, but to ground the story and background within the gritty reality in which it resides.    4.

B003CHNP50|5.0|Very seldom do I feel that a second season of any show is better than that first. In the case of Breaking Bad I am tempted to go against my tradition and clearly state 2 has it all. Throughout the entire season you are taken between anger, sadness, and the feeling of helplessness. Without giving a single thing away Breaking Bad season two will bring the world down right around you, one scrap at a time.
B00407PNY2|3.0|I am no spring chicken at 61 so I love and fondly remember the 60's but some movies just don't hold up. This is one of them. Movies now are faster, more exciting. This movie plods along and at near 2 hours is just plain boring now. Sure the car chase is still great, one of the best ever, but that does not justify sitting for 2 hours while this movie crawls along. It is now a mediocre movie at best. I might add, I absolutely admired and wanted so much to be like Steve McQueen. He is the ultimate cool guy but this movie is just not as exciting as it might have once been considered.

0811875040|5.0|This book is fabulous!!!  I cannot put it down!  I want to bake everything in it! Love the elegance of the recipes inside.  The cakes are beautiful and she gives great instructions on how to make the cakes come out wonderful, down to the nitty gritty like the temperature of the batter components.  Love the scalloped edges of the pages of the book; it's very posh and chic.   I think it's wonderful that an upscale pastry shop in San Francisco would publish a book and share the sugar. This is a MUST HAVE!!!
B004LQ1XBY|5.0|i love hugh laurie . his talent is without end. to be a brit and have such a love & feel for the real blues is past amazing. i love this cd as much as he did making it.
0811876373|3.0|This is a great book, if you have kids and want to make astounding treats for them.  The cake pop designs are amazing, but I thought the book would have more ideas that I could use to entertain guests. I guess I was expecting more simple and elegant ideas for \\"girls night out\\" parties to be included as well. Again, great book if you have kids.  Other than that, I would just stick to the blog.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This movie is not for the squeemish or feint of heart. However, if you consider yourself a hardcore slasher fan, one who thought the SAW movies provided some good cringe factor scenes, then this one is for you! The cringe factor in Martyrs is so horrific, you have to conscientiously will yourself to keep watching, it is that good! Actually, I've not seen anything like it before or after watching this French film. Now, the actors speak French  with English subtitles, but it doesn't take away anythig, as there is not much talking during most of the bloody carnage. The first half of the movie moves along at a fair pace with some pretty good violence, the when you think the movie is just about over, watch out, things kick into high gear and don't stop. This movie is a wild ride, the likes you may never see again in a movie. So, treat yourself while you still can. But, be prepared, after watching this film, all other movies of this type will fall far short in your mind!
B004NIFSRA|1.0|Since the book will be in your Kindle and you will be the only one to see it, the joke will be on you. A table book, nice concept. An ebook, not so much.
B00002DE2L|3.0|I'd hoped for an inspired performance (certainly the cover gave promise of a lively, if not lusty, rendition) of The Four Seasons by Anne-Sophie Mutter & the Trondheim Soloists.  What I got was a performance so mannered and restrained as to be soporific, utterly lacking in brio and verve.  Technically brilliant, the performance lacks the enthusiasm necessary to elevate it to top rank.
B003Y5H51K|5.0|Sanctum, is a brilliantly planned Movie. From the Genius who brought us the movie Avatar, James Cameron the Executive producer did it again. The back-story behind this Amazing story is one of the divers that escaped from this incident also happened to be one of the writers. By having one of the actual survivors of the event they could more accurately tell the story of what happened down in that cave. Although as in most movies to keep the viewer entertained they had to variate the movie from some actual events. The director was unknown for he had not made a movie since 2006 and he had also not made a feature length. So for his first full length movie in 2011 I'd say he did a fantastic job.     There were very few characters for the surprising budget spent which amounted to 30 million. For being a James Cameron film that is still relatively low though. There were only 13 cast member throughout the whole movie. yet only 7 were shown for more than 5 minutes of the 108 minute film. These talented cast member name in the film were, Frank, Carl, Josh, Victoria, George, J.D., and Luko.  The ever expanding cave was the setting for the movie.     The Thrilling plot for this movie was The members listed above spent thousands of dollars bringing equipment down to a cave to explore it. previously unexplored the group had no idea what they were getting into as they experience problems in the first dive. This causing Josh the son of Frank to start to doubt if his father the \\"supposed\\"  expert. As the plot continues a storm outside got stronger because of this the cave entrance flooded while they were all still inside. I will respectively leave you here as I don't want to ruin any of the events of the movie. But I will tell you the rest is them trying to escape as they fight the madness.       The themes of this movie besides drama and intensity would be mixed along so many ways. Although if there was one dominant them in this movie it would be an intensified sense of deception.Throughout most of the movie your on the edge of your seat wondering who's going to listen and who's going to freak out and go their own way. If this movie were an hour longer I would still be watching it's every step with anticipation.     I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone willing to watch a movie of this genre. The intensity packed into this movie with those slow dramatic pauses. Just to reel you back in with the next scene. Since this was such an excellent movie I'd see it again. Although if you have a weak stomache I must warn you might need to turn away.
B003I55BIA|5.0|When I first say this book in the store, I was attracted to the cover. After getting the sample on my kindle, I knew I was in trouble. Reading every chance I got (brezks from work and late into the night) I finished the book in two sittings!!!<br /><br />This book is a mix between a love story and action/ adventure. I am forcing myself not to start the sequel tonight, rather looking forward to sweet dreams filled with Alex and Britney
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Of course it's a given that cancelling this show was an outrage, but what can be expected of the  kind of people -- whether corporate bean counters or sponsors -- responsible for deciding whether  a series lives or dies. They receive outrageous sums of money, bonuses tied to the bottom line (not  to whether what they do is of any value) and live in grotesque mock houses in grotesque developments,  totally cut off from humanity. For them there's no good and bad, right and wrong, just performance packages,  bonuses, ratings and advertising. For a perfect insight into their mentality, which led to the murder of   Firefly -- episode for episode, Joss Whedon's best so far -- take a look at Aaron Sorkin's brilliant Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.  In the show, one of the corporate bigwigs even talks about some great new software he was investing in which analyses  the different components of a show and can tell the user whether a car chase is needed at a certain point  or some female flesh or whatever: any show can be fed into it and come out a \\"winner\\". Studio 60 itself  wasn't cancelled half way through: far worse, in a case of life imitating art, the corporates highjacked the show and completely transformed  it after about 10 episodes, changing it from The West Wing to a caricature of The Waltons, with sentimentality dripping  from everything in sight like molasses. At least Firefly's fate was a mercy killing and we got Serenity the film.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot, but I felt very confused a lot of the time. I expected not to understand a lot of the dialect due to it being told from a five year olds perspective, but other than that, I really really enjoyed the story of the book.
B000TETC6A|5.0|first listened to this album when i was 10. love it now, loved it then. i knew Bowie played guitar, but when i read he played piano and sax on Changes i was very impressed. first saw him when i was 15. truly a great artist and this album reflects his great songwriting talents as well as his musicianship.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|For years, I've been told to watch this movie since I teach natural perfumery. The movie is bizarre and intriguing. It captured my attention the entire time. A few scenes I walked out since I am very sensitive to violence. I enjoyed the mixing of essential oils into glass vials and bottles. Watching the perfumer. The movie portrays how profound scent is and its affect on us. My sense of smell heightened after watching the movie. If you are into natural perfume, you may enjoy this movie.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|In general it works well.  It could use a color palette and a text tool.  Importing pictures to doodle on would be nice also.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Amazon has really impressed me with their music store and system. Purchasing, downloading (and re-downloading, if you need to) are all simple. Playback is fairly simple, too.<br /><br />What will make this the best (it's not there yet; I am aware of the limitations):<br />- adjustable bit rate streaming<br />- enhanced flexibility in the player (playlists, tag editing, etc.)<br />- purchase streaming-only version for a fraction of the cost (enable upgrade later)<br />- mark previous purchases as purchased, and inaccessible for re-purchase<br /><br />Keep up the great work!

B000FC1AOI|5.0|This book is one of my favorites, Loved the story, her best one I have read. I laughed out loud ,and cried out loud. The premise was heartwarming, and the characters jumped out at you. read the book you won't be disappointed.

0060936223|5.0|If you enjoy art, music, poetry, a well turned phrase, or you want to re-live the 70s as they existed in NYC, Just Kids will take you back to the day.  Patti Smith shares her \\"moveable feast\\" through the mentorship of a variety of famous artists of the time, as Hemingway did in his Bohemian Paris years.  It is a story of love that grows and changes through time and struggle.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|This movie is good for all ages to see. Under Peter Weir's direction this film makes the voyage very real for the viewer of what it would have been like to be on a British ship battling the French and what it's like living on a ship during that era. The cinematography is gorgeous. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are very convincing as longtime friends. The rest of the cast especially the young boy were very good. I would love to see a sequel made based on another one of the series of M & C books with the same actors. It is a wonderful adventure at sea.
1593080719|5.0|There's a reason VANITY FAIR has been in print for a century and a half. Thackeray's depiction of early 19th century English life is a cross section cutting across all social lines, fulling displaying the feral indifference of an economic system with no safety net for the poor, and in which the wealthy were entitled to all merely by the fact of their existence.<br /><br />But despite his offhand jeers, it was obviously not Thackeray's intent merely to write some tell all diatribe assailing the foibles and inequities of the British class structure. He has accomplished a lush tableau filled with sharply delineated characters, and fueled by a sure knowledge of psychology and group dynamics.<br /><br />More to the point: this is pure STORY, I will not analyze plot specifics here as i have no wish to spoil things for the reader -- but I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Also interesting to me was how the style became more and more imbued with a tinge of pessimism as it progressed -- the transition is almost imperceptible, and I question whether it was deliberate. Still, if you compare the almost rollicking youthful enthusiasm of the book's opening chapters to the near despair of its later portions, you will clearly see what i mean.<br /><br />Also sweet is the final sentence, rated by the American Book Review as one of the 100 Best Last Lines: \\"Come children, let us shut up the box and the puppets, for our play is played out.\\"<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />Pearce Hansen is the author of STREET RAISED, available now for the Kindle
0811875040|4.0|This is such a beautiful book.  I love how the pages were cut into scalloped edges.  This book is quite unique that way.  I also like how it was put together.  I like how the recipes were divided into sections.  I thought this was just another baking book but there's so many other things included like how to make candy and creams. I was so excited to receive this book.  Well worth the wait.  I decided to celebrate the Fourth of July by baking a cake. I made the Hot Milk Cake and I must say that this is the best tasting cake that I have ever made.  I love the smaller portions.  I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting in the book. Delish!!!!  This will be my go to baking book and I own well over 200. Can't wait to try all the other recipes. I did find that some of the recipes were a bit off.  I printed out the errata but am not very happy with having to refer to it every time I want to make those particular recipes.  Other than that it is a good book.  Happy eating.  ***Updated 10/11/11  Just called Amazon to find out when the replacement 2nd edition book was going to be sent (as I received an email about a replacement) and they did not find any records of the email that was sent advising that a replacement was going to be sent.  I am very alarmed.  There are also two versions of the errata.  I am so confused.  So, now Amazon has advised that I should be patient and call back in a month because just because they do not have records of this does not mean that I will not get a second edition.  I will update this once I find out more information.  =(
0670022411|2.0|I started playing a game with myself about a quarter of the way through \\"A Discovery of Witches\\": How many pages can an author write without anything of significance happening to her characters? I was still playing most of the way through this tedious, amateurish addition to the \\"monster's ball\\" of the bestseller list. I'll give it to the author--some fascinating topics are brought up, if only superficially. I'd love to read a novel centered on alchemy or the history of Oxford, but only one by a real writer. Harkness never shows when she can tell, in indigestible globs of exposition. There's a glimmer of hope in the concept of a world teeming with \\"creatures\\" who live alongside and often in concert with humans. But the author's clumsy efforts at romance writing and abundant chick-lit cliché undermine everything time and again. If the best she can come up with in the first half of the book is a vampire-witch yoga class, she needs some emergency fiction-writing triage. Please, Ms. Harkness, close down Microsoft Word and go back to the lecture hall.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Very nice, clear iphone protector.  It stays on well and the rim doesn't cause the screen protector to peel off (I am using a Griffin Screen Protector that was already on).  I have dropped the iphone a few times and this was a good shock absorber.  It is smooth so it goes into my pocket without getting caught like some rubber cases do.  I also haven't noticed hazy interference with the camera that somethimes occurs. A Cool design on the back enhances the appearance there.

B004R6JG7Q|4.0|Le Mans is the greatest auto racing movie ever made! I would recommend for anyone with an interest in this area. Be aware that it is almost more a documentary, as the emphasis is on auto racing without much dialogue or plot. As I have previously found to be the case, Amazon's service was excellent, meeting all that they promised.
0609610570|2.0|At my previous employer, this book was required reading.  In fact, it was suggested that we read and reread it often.  I found myself needing to reread it because I would finish and ask myself:  What was the point, again?  I read the book twice and listened to the audio version at least 6 times.      I don't know much about the two authors, but I would imagine that they are two strongly willed people.  A reader could sense which chapter was written by a different author because it felt like they were doing battle to be more significant.  It just left me confused.      Did the editors actually read this book to make sure that it was consistent?  Every chapter seems to introduce a new superlative statement:  - absolutely essential...  - it is critical...  - nothing is more important than...  - the leader's most important job...  - most important...   - the single most important part...  - one of the most important things...    \\"Ok... what was the \\"important\\" thing, again?\\"      The book offers very little on the topic of execution - at least from the individual contributor's perspective.      In fairness, the book was created for those people who are capable of changing the strategy and structure of an organization.  (I believe the authors offer some sort of executive level coaching.  The book is probably a good complement tot hat service.)  But, if you're just part of the machine, the book will leave you frustrated.  It offers very little tangible guidance to make anyone - below the executive level - more effective.
B00009W0U4|2.0|This movie definitely did not live up to its hype.  Gimmicky plot devices, very unlikable characters.  Enter the Void was amazing, though.

0307595862|3.0|I bought the book as the reviews said the author was as good as Stieg Larsson-not true. It was not as suspenseful and the plot rather predictable at times.
0312600844|5.0|I'm not much of a reviewer but I felt the need to chime in on this apparently polarizing novel. How anyone cannot like this book is simply beyond me. If you've come of age any time in the last 40 years, if your life has had ups and downs, if you've experienced joy or failure, if you've questioned your identity, if you've LIVED this book has something for you. This is modern American life summed up in 600 pages and is nothing short of a masterpiece. The style is gracefully unpretentious and the characters are some of the most fully realized, flaws and all, of any recent novel. Bravo, Mr. Franzen! I'll be looking forward to more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a wonderful novel!!  Every plot twist was intriguing.  I especially love the heroine, Katniss.  She is such an unexpectant, reluctant heroine which makes her real.  I was so happy with this novel, I could not wait to finish the series.  A MUST READ!!
B0012CH350|5.0|I'm echoing a review posted previously regarding this cover.<br />It is not needed if you buy the Weber 721001 Smokey Mountain Cooker 18 1/2 Inch Smoker.

I am returning this item as I don't need it.<br /><br />5/5 stars for the product.  0/5 stars for me because I didn't read the other reviews saying the same thing.  I hope I saved you a few bucks if you're buying the WSM.

B001U6YI92|4.0|The high point of the Spaghetti Western sub-genre, Sergio Leone's dubiously-titled masterpiece is a living, breathing encapsulation of everything that made its peers so notorious. Whether you're after atmosphere as thick as smoke, tight-lipped anti-heroes, charmingly bad audio dubs or a cast of thousands, this grand adventure delivers in excess. With a run time of just under three hours, it should go without saying that the narrative sprawls at times, yet expert cinematography, intriguingly era-authentic landscapes, a variety of fresh, varied locations and rich characterization keep the picture from stagnating even when it's been ten minutes since the last line of dialog. Naturally, Leone regulars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef bring the goods as remotely feuding foils with a penchant for sharp, icy glares; though I preferred their dynamic in the preceding For a Few Dollars More, the two make for a stunning combination whenever they share the screen and it's a shame this marks the end of that brief partnership. It's a terrific picture if you've got the time to really pore over it, but works equally as well as simple background noise.
1882723007|4.0|This charming book will be a comfort to many dealing with grief from the death of a loved one. The picture of an afterlife of joy as revealed to the author during a near death experience will likely provide comfort to many of us, whether religious or not. The writing is charming and uplifting whether you are on the same wavelength as the author or not. Just the possibility that she is correct is uplifting.
B0000UJDLM|1.0|I haven't watched the movie yet, and my husband cannot enjoy it at all. He is DEAF, and it is supposed to have subtitles!

B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Wow! I've finished book four, Drums of Autumn, and I'll admit, I've got a love-hate relationship with Gabaldon's writing.  Talk about an ongoing saga, and the end isn't near...  First off, Gabaldon is a phenomenal writer: captivating, creative, humorous, passionate, but on the downside--extremely longwinded.  I find it a laborious task to read her writing in its entirety, and I often fail to do so.  It's obvious that she takes great pride in researching and accurately depicting the setting and historical information, but in my opinion, it's just too many details about insignificant things.  Trust me, I'm hooked into the world of Jaime and Claire.  Bree and Roger are proving just as intriguing; however, I find that I have to take breaks from her books to maintain my sanity.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Most \\"How-To\\" books tend to steer toward the obvious side of the road, but his one gave some very clear and unique instructions. It's written in a casual tone, as if you're sharing a beer with John and are just smart enough to keep quiet and listen.<br /><br />I found the book engaging and informative.  I am certainly the target audience for this and that's why I believe anyone with a passion to write for a living would certainly benefit from his story.
B00004X10B|2.0|I take a lot of photography trips on weekends.  One thing I like to do is to leave my 70-200mm or 100-400mm lens attached to the camera, on top of the photo bag in the passenger seat of the truck while I drive in rural areas.  If I see something of interest, I stop the truck grab the camera, get out and take some images.  That's what attracted me to this product.    The issue with this bag is that if you have a lens with a lens hood, the lens will not fit in the compartments of the bag, and still be functional as is advertised (and as I described above).  I have a 24-70 with lens hood, a 16-35 with lens hood, a 70-200 with lens hood, a 100-400 with lens hood, a 100mm macro with lens hood, etc.  These lenses don't fit in the bag, with the hood inverted, if you want to carry your camera across the top as pictured.    I tried to make it work, and ended up returning the bag.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Up     The adventurous, animated comedy, titled \\"Up\\", was released on May 29th, 2009 and it instantly captured peoples' hearts. Up was produced by Pixar Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Pete Docter. Since Up is animated, it doesn't necessarily have actors, but the main characters' voices are played by Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagal, and Bob Peterson. By the time this movie was in theaters for a few weeks and widely popular, it had already brought in a world wide income of $731 million. With all the popularity, Up won two Golden Globe Awards. Up is certainly a movie that all ages would enjoy. The characters are hilarious, the setting is unique, the plot is heartwarming, and the theme is one that everyone could use. It is rated \\"PG\\" and is a must see for everyone!     The setting revolves around the characters and what their individual mission is. Carl Fredricksen is a shy, grumpy old man, played by Edward Asner. Although he is portrayed as stubborn in the beginning, as the movie goes on, you begin to see that he is just sad about losing his wife and is lonely. Carl meets a little boy named Russell and thinks he is annoying at first but begins to love him in the end. Russell shows up at Carl's small, quiet home asking Carl to help him with one of his Wilderness Explorer Badges. Russell a clumsy yet caring boy who wants to help, but sometimes makes things worse on accident. His character is voiced by Jordan Nagai. When a serried of events happens and Carl's house floats away in the air, Russell tags along and the house lands in South America facing Paradise Falls. In the jungle on the way to Paradise Falls the two meet a bird which they name Kevin. They feed Kevin and the colorful bird sticks with them. Along the way, the group finds out that Kevin is actually a mom and is looking for her babies. On the adventure they find a talking dog named Dug, who is played by Bob Peterson. Dug is very loyal and sometimes a littlespacey. All in all he is a very comedic character and makes the feel of the movie a little less heavy. The characters in Up have personalities that you easily begin to care for and the setting is important to the story.     The plot of Up is very emotional and although it is sad in parts, it is also very funny in other parts. The beginning of the movie starts off with a flashback of Carl in his child hood. He meets a girl named Ellie and when they grow up they end up getting married. Ellie finds out she cannot have kids and so they make it their mission to save their money to go to Paradise Falls, which is their childhood dream place. They also shared the same childhood dream to meet the famed explorer Charles F. Muntz and that is where they hope to find him. Unfortunately, they must keep paying expense after expense and they never get to complete their dream. Ellie and Carl grow old together and eventually Ellie dies of old age. Carl is left and is very lonely. One day a construction worker comes to Carl's house demanding him to move. They get in a fight over his mailbox and Carl ends up hitting the worker with his cane. The police get involved and decide that Carl needs to go to a retirement home. Meanwhile, a little boy named Russell comes to Carl's door asking if Carl can help him with a badge for his Wilderness Explorer Troop. Carl says no and begins to work on a plan to move his entire house and all its belongings. He comes up with a plan to inflate thousands of balloons and tie them to his house. It works and right before the retirement home people come to get him, he floats away in his house. In the middle, Carl goes on the adventure to get to Paradise Falls and carry out the dream he promised his wife years ago. Suddenly, while in the air, Carl hears a knocking at his front door. He opens it and finds Russell. Carl reluctantly lets Russell in and the two float together. They end up getting caught in a storm and when the house lands, it lands facing Paradise Falls. Carl, who remembers his mission, sets off determined to get to the falls. Along the way they find a bird, in which Russell names Kevin. They also find a dog wearing a translating collar and they discover his name is Dug. Dugs owner turns out to be Charles F. Muntz's. As the group continues, they encounter Dug's pack and they try to take Dug back with them. Dug doesn't want to go though. The group leaves Dug to fend for himself and they are able to get the house to Paradise Falls. Carl sets it down in place and then realizes he needs to save Dug. Carl and Russell lighten the house so they can fly and catch Charles F. Muntz's aircraft. In the end, they save Dug and are able to get Kevin back to her babies. The house makes it back to Paradise Falls. The plot is emotional and may sound all sad, but in the movie there are lots of very funny parts that make it so you just want to keep watching.     Being a Disney movie, Up of course, would have a good theme. I think that the theme is that you can't accomplish anything unless you get out there and go for it. Ellie and Carl had the dream of moving their clubhouse to the gorgeous Paradise falls. When they were little this seemed possible. As they grew older they saved their money little by little in hopes that someday they would make it. They didn't just sit there and hope it would happen on its own. Carl and Ellie really tried to make it a possibility. Unfortunately things got in the way of their dream, but when Ellie passed away, Carl remade it his dream to accomplish the move. He didn't just sit there then either. Carl thought of a plan and because of his love for Ellie, he had the drive to accomplish it. He pushed through his obstacles and in the end was able to complete his mission. This movie really teaches that you can't be lazy if you want to make something out of your life, you need to get up and work towards it.     My opinion of this movie was a great one! Up is one of my favorite movies. I absolutely love the meaningful storyline and how the characters really touch you with their personalities. The plot was one that was very adventurous. It kept you wanting more. Although there were sad parts, I still thought this movie was good. The sad parts make it more memorable and you begin to feel for the characters. However, there was a great deal of funny parts as well. The pronounced theme helped make the story a good one for all ages. Anyone could learn from this movie. When I first watched this movie, I was instantly hooked. I can watch this movie over and over again. I would recommend Up to everyone!
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I just bought it from Target and I was little skeptical because of the spray that's included. Anyway, I applied it perfectly to the edges and then noticed the protector doesn't properly align with the speaker or the home button. It also looked terrible and not as good as other protectors. I ended up taking it off and threw it right away..load of garbage. Waste of money!!!
0452286751|5.0|I don't agree with 100% of what Ayn says about selfishness and capitalism--as we've seen recently in today's economy, there are always improprietous egomaniacs who hold their own gain higher than unspoken moral values of the planet.  But the light of integrity that Ayn shines on every human being's potential is enough to get you off your couch, pursuing your own happiness through productive achievement.  Her command of the English language is remarkable; just reading a few pages will get your hair standing on end.      To the critics that say Ayn should be more benevolent are missing the point.  To me, Ayn's point is that if everyone taps into their own productive achievement as a means of fulfillment, and took full responsibility for their lives instead of expecting the System to provide for them, then happiness would be widespread and we would all live in a healthy productive society.  And those that worked the hardest, would be justly rewarded proportionately.      But for the record, in my opinion, the corporate tycoons that have been polluting the environment and being disrespectful to Mother Earth in favor of shareholder profits have also missed the point.  Despite Ayn's aversion to any kind of mystic reality, I do believe those corporate decision makers will reap what they sow and the Mother will pay them back for the disrespect they have displayed.      So it is a delicate dance between motivation, reward, action and integrity.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks hit the Zombie nail on the head with World War Z.  Take a bundle of Zombie short stories that all work within the larger framework of a government report and set them along a timetable from outbreak to containment and you have the makings of a great read.<br /><br />Unlike some horror/apocalypse short stories that have no common thread, Brook's decision to stitch together a variety of stories along a common thread makes them feel connected while still retaining the quick reading feel of a short story.<br /><br />This decision allowed Brooks to explore any angle he so desired without having it detract in any way from the bigger picture of the book.  Honestly, I find this book to be the Zombie standard that all others hope to attain.<br /><br />Would I recommend this, in a heartbeat.
B00002ND77|5.0|I had been looking for this dvd for a while.  When I saw it, I immediately jumped on it.  It arrived within the time that was stated and I am very pleased.  Thanks!!
0920668372|5.0|I could not find this book anywhere, and had been looking for a very long time my husband and I have 5 children between us the youngest is 16 and the rest are grown with children so we have 10 grands and 1 more on the way! I wanted to let them all know how much I (we) loved them so I bought 5 books and gave the 1st to my 16 year old and 1 to each family. They all loved them and the 1 I gave to my 16 year old couldn't have come at a more perfect time in his life and even arrived a day earlier than was told at a time of crisis in his life, God I'm sure had a hand in that! Thank you Amazon for having this special little book!
B003N0XDT4|4.0|I'm using this as a DAC attached to my computer and really, it avoids the muddiness I didn't previously realize my on-board sound card had. It drives studio headphones (Grado) really, really well without having to turn up the volume much. The screen is sort of useless- just has volume indication and lights up to show it's on. I'm not using the equalization factor. I'd give it a five except: no optical or digital in/out and the hardware buttons are all identically shaped and you need to put your classes on to press the right one until you've memorized the button locations (they are not clearly marked or visually distinquished). The battery lasts for a very long time and is kept charged when you are using with your PC. It works with some portable players also although only a few have digital out (ipod and sansa are the only ones I'm aware of) and a special, player specific adaptor called an LOD is required which FiiO predictably rips you off for ($16 for a 6\\" cord).
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Two part review:  A) This review is for the shipment source of the DVD from CDwarehouseonline: 3stars  Pleased with fast shipment. The movie appears to have its own defect - throughout entire movie the screen goes from light to dark constantly. This doesn't interfere with the movie itself but only is annoying due to the irregularity of lighting. It's as though each scene is fading into a close.  [[ASIN:B0001HLVS2 Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World (Widescreen Edition)]]  B) This review is for the movie itself: 5stars  5 Stars!!!!! Exceptional Crowe. Excellent historical authenticity captured throughout entire movie.  I chose to use subtitle which helped in understanding the classic terminology used.
B003Y5H556|3.0|First things first.  I must address some accusations regarding this film that I just don't understand. What's with the comparisons to Twilight?  I found this film to have nothing in common with any of the Twilight films, and yes I've actually seen, well mostly, the Twilight films.  The only two things I could find was the romantic male lead had similar Edward-gel hair, and the director is Catherine Hardwicke(lest we forget she also directed the great films 13 and Lords of Dogtown) the director of the first Twilight film.  Yeah, otherwise, there's no real love triangle, no vampires, not set in modern times, it's got more of a horror movie and fairy tale vibe, and the focus on the story isn't the romance.  The romance is a side story to the impending doom and family dramas that surround Amanda Seyfried's character.  It's not there guys.  I know you think you're being clever, but you're not.  Secondly, there are a ton of comparisons to Neil Jordan's film In The Company of Wolves. Again, not really much in common.  Jordan's film was more surreal and visceral and had no real narrative.  It also only had one segment out of three that focused on the latter part of the classic Red Riding Hood fairy tale.  The both reference the fairy tale, but that's about it.  They're not similar in tone, story or style.  Again, by saying these things doesn't make you clever.....sorry.<br /><br />Okay, this movie has one major problem as far as what it merits.  It misses a great chance to update a fairy tale and make the original story's themes more modern or switch them.  It could've easily been about virgining sexuality and rebellion.  Instead we get no themes.  This is a straight whodunit with a werewolf in the center.  That's it.  No deep themes.  No real point beyond lite fluffy entertainment.  This is a real bummer.  I just keep asking myself, \\"why is this thing called Red Riding Hood\\"?  It references elements of the story, but that's it.  It's a completely different story.  It borrows from well known versions of the story and little known ones, but it only gives them lip service and doesn't really make them modern or relevant to a new generation.  It has no spin on the meaning of the story.  Why bother make this movie, why bother call it Red Riding Hood?  Like the review title states, a real missed opportunity.<br /><br />Now I'm not narrow minded, so I'm aware that this would be boring and simplistic to be a straight retelling of the fairy tale.  Which version would you pick?  The version where Red Riding Hood takes out the wolf herself, showing she can take care of herself, or the one where she is saved by a heroic woodsman giving her a second chance and allowing her to atone for her willful 'female' ways?  Yeah, this story was an aural experience and was only written down later.  Sorry folks, Brothers Grimm didn't event these stories, just like the monks weren't the real authors of Beowulf.  You can tell it anyway you want.  But this story doesn't tell it any way.  It's about an un-named village in an un-named universe that has made a peace treaty with a werewolf.  One day Amanda Seyfried's sister is murdered and the hunt is on for the werewolf.  Seyfriend is being married off to the local rich kid, who she doesn't love or care about, but she is in love with a logger who is dashing but as about as wooden as the trees he chops.  A local Holy man calls in Gary Oldman, expert in the occult-killing werewolves and witches, to slay the beast.  We get scenes of the wrong beast killed. Werewolf attacks.  Seyfriend being accused of being a witch.  Skeletons from characters' pasts coming back to haunt them.  Crazy crusader oppressing those he has been sent to protect.  An unrequited romance that has no sizzle.  And finally the werewolf's identity revealed, surprising but not earth shaking, and outcome of the romance.  That's it.  Not Red Riding Hood.<br /><br />A better title for this film would've been Blood Moon, as the wolf's powers of transformation and created cursed is based on the three days the moon is blood red.  Why is Seyfriend given the red hood?  What is the point?  It's not symbolic of anything and it just seems shoehorned into the story for no real reason.  Why is there a dream sequence where she has a very famous interchange with her grandmother-\\"Grandma, what big eyes you have\\"?  It all seems out of place.  Why not say something with the material.  Werewolves have an inherant primal theme regarding letting the wild side out of ones personality.  Why not do somthing with this.  This is instead a bug hunt with a werewolf at the center.<br /><br />The acting from Seyfried and Oldman are fine.  Seyfriend is a real original presence on the screen these days.  She holds the movie fine.  Oldman hams it up but keeps it roped in just enough to keep us from laughing.  He becomes a villain of sorts towards the end of the second act.  That's another thing, there's only about three werewolf attacks in the film.  Even the third act has our main werewolf appearing only in human form.  There's some stuff in here about Red Riding Hood being a witch due to her mental connection to the wolf, but it's really just there to muddle the plot, which as far as I could tell, was about finding and unmasking a werewolf.  The rest of the cast is forgettable.  Max Lions rich boy suitor barely registers.  He is written as a wet blanket.  At the end of the film there are explanations of him becoming the protector of the village and the leader of a werewolf hunt, but there's no build up or investment in this, so it barely matters.  The woodsman is wood, wood, WOODEN.  This guy is a decent looking but he has no chemistry with Seyfried, he isnt written very well, and he's not a good enough or charismatic enough actor to pull off wood lines or listless interaction.  Virginia Madsen is in this thing too....but wasted.<br /><br />Now the effects and set designs are amazing.  The set design here, mostly practical, are the best I've seen since Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow.  The werewolf is more of a large black wolf, and made totally of CGI.  It looks okay most of the time.  CGI animals still havea  tendancy to movie too fast through the screen make it more obvious that they are animated.  Looking at this film with the sound off would be okay it's so well shot and designed.  Also, I really liked the score and soundtrack.  It's modern sounding but not too much that it be distracting.  Considering this story takes place in a nondescript time period in a made up time and place, it really doesn't bother me that no one has an accent, people speak and act modern, and all looks a little too clean.  It's a fairy tale looking world without a fairy tale being told.  Okay.........<br /><br />The film is fine while on.  The love stuff is uninspired as written and performed.  The story is no allegory, but rather a straight monster movie with a whodunit in the mix.  It's nothing special but fluffy eye candy that you may love or just forget.  The people who hate it seem to have some vendetta against Twilight.  Although, I wonder why they talk so much about or even watch things like this or Twilight if they hate them so much.  Why not do something, you know, more productinve or that make you happy?  Then, what would they do on the internet all day?<br /><br />Blu ray looks beautiful to match the photography.  The special features are negligable.  The alternate ending actually makes more sense than the theatrical cut.  There's some added PG-13 steamy sex, and a final reveal in the final moments that really don't matter that much if you think about it.  But since the extended cut makes more sense in the edit(theatrical version has a montage of the never shown sex scene that is very confusing) actually showing the love making it's a better ending.  That's all.  The only other feature I was interested in was one about the making of the werewolf.  It's not a featurette.  It's a montage of wire frame CGI werewolves, some onset doubles with music playng in the background for about three minutes.  Some interviews with conceptual artists would've been nice.  Lame.

0553582038|4.0|George RR Martin's \\"Feast for Crows\\" is a bridge between Martin's \\"A Storm of Swords\\" and \\"A Dance With Dragons\\". Martin acknowledges that \\"Feast\\" doesn't have the conclusive endings of his earlier books, admitting in an epilogue that the book was becoming too long and unreadable with the direction it was taking, so he simply broke it into multiple components.     But let's face it, while each chapter in Martin's series is constructed to end in its own micro-cliffhanger, each book \\"concludes\\" with numerous larger scale cliffhangers as well. So what's new?    \\"Feast\\" is as formidable as each of its predecessors. The characters are big, bold and surprising, as they orbit each other in Martin's vast landscape. While Brienne, Jaime, Sam, Cersei, and Arya return as points of focus, new characters and lands are introduced. Some series-long mysteries are revealed but, as always, many new mysteries are introduced.    I've just recently picked up \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\". Fortunately for me, the fifth book in the series, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" will be released only a few weeks after I've completed \\"Feast\\". I can't imagine the tormented wait by Martin's fans who've been keeping their cool since \\"Feast\\" was released in 2005.     I saw the mixed reviews of this book and hesitated before I purchased. There's no reason to wait...jump in with both feet and immerse yourself in Martin's world. The read is well worth it.
B003A4IFGY|4.0|I have been following these guys for years and I am glad they are still making music.  I think this is still vintage Tom, but also different and up to date.  Enjoy it even if you are not an old Petty fan.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love this movie. Huge Firefly fan and this movie has both sad and happy parts. I did cry at one point.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|I haven't read a Green Lantern comic since the mid 90's, which is about the same time as I stopped reading comics.  You know, started liking girls, and films more.  The last exposure I have to the Green Lantern comes from the Justice League series and the animated films being put out by DC lately.  I always thought the concept would make an eye popping film, but at the same time the concept is so inherantly silly and goofy, who would one pull this off.  Well, they didn't quite.  The problem with this film is that it's YET ANOTHER tired origin movie. I figured as much going in.  This film has to set up and explain what this mythology is and how it works.  So, of course there's laborious scenes of people explaining things.  Sure, the plot is barely existant and less important than Hal Jordan becoming a great part of the Lantern Corps.  The movie isn't terrible but it's far from great.<br /><br />Now on the printed page this concept is a ton of fun and works somehow.  On the big screen it all seems as silly as it really is.  Yellow energy of fear?  Green energy of will, the most powerful force in the universe, that also gives the Lantern Corps their super powers?  Yeah, pretty stupid and really silly.  The biggest fault with this film is the fact that they have fantastical things happening every second, to people who are experiencing this stuff for the first time, and they barely acknowledge it.  The scene where Hal Jordan discovers a downed alien and is passed the ring is a great example.  He shows up and rushes over to the downed space craft.  He finds a purple alien and doesn't quite have a normal human reaction. He barely shudders.  This is a missed opportunity for the character to be, you know, characterized!  This could've been done with humor too, which is the weirdest thing about it considering the light tone of the whole film.  I know, I know, we have to move on to the big lights and effects show and get to stuff blowing up real good, but last time I checked, when films do that they turn out to be lame ducks in the vein of the odious Supergirl film.  Now Green Lantern isn't Supergirl bad but it came close once or twice.  Imagine, just for one second, that you found a downed alien space craft.  Imagine there was a dying alien that was inside.  How would you initially react?  What would be running through your mind?  Now class, write down those reactions filtered through any emotion of your choosing and you've just written a better scripted scene than the one appearing in this film.<br /><br />Also, nobody was happier than me to not have extenssive training and learning the ropes of outerspace sequences ala every other super hero movie(hell, the first X-Men was all setting up powers and characters and nothing else), but if there ever was a more convoluted, dense, GRANDER concept than the Green Lantern that really needed this tired form of storytelling I don't know what does.  Batman Begins took a good hour to set up the character and his journey to becoming the Dark Knight, and it was done well and was entertaining, but he's basically a damaged guy dressing like a bat and fighting crime.  Hal Jordan is a regular slacker with daddy issues who's been give an alien energy source and been charged with becoming a member of the an intergalactic police force!!!!!  This needs more set up and nuance not to be laughable, confusing or just plain stupid.  The movie gives lines of dialogue through a fish alien thingy that conveniently wrap the rules up as we enter the Lantern home planet.  That's it and Hal's off and flying, literally.  We get two combat training sequences in a row, both to display effects, and both to introduce major players in the Lantern mythology.  Hal gets bummed and decides to quit.  Faster than you can say contrivance a school chum of his, hired by secret government guys, has been dissecting the alien he got the ring from, and he gets infected, somehow, with a piece of the 'other' villain of the movie, Paralax.He becomes quite alien and insane, and of course has a crush on the female lead, who, what else, gets kidnapped and used to bring Hal out.  ALthough, the scene where this plan is formulated, and then when Hal finds out, seem to be missing.  Hal shows up somewhere, finds Hector infected and powerful, with his girl in tow, and then the climax starts pummeling forward with elaborate, if not too special, special effects.<br /><br />That's the other thing, Paralax is set up as this angry ex-Guardian, who wants nothing but revenge on the Corps.  He's on his way to their home base to destroy them, but decides to go to earth.  Why, besides that these films need earth to be in peril for anyone to give a crap?  Well, because he wants to destroy the one wearing the ring of his old enemy???  Huh?  That's really lame, contrived and totally shoehorned into the third act of the film.  Also, there's a moment where Hal reveals his powers up close and personal to a scientist friend of his.  The friend calls him a super hero.  Not good.  A film that is a super hero movie, unless sending it up or satirizing it, shouldn't call its main character a super hero.  This should feel new and wonderous.  Which is the film's main problem.  It just doesn't have a sense of wonder which one would think would come naturally to such an outlandish fantasy subject.  Just watch Richard Donner's first Superman film, it's loaded with wonder, and comparison to the Green Lantern, it's mythology is way easier to swallow.<br /><br />Anyway, I've complained enough.  The film isn't awful, despite what I've written.  Some of the effects are fun and neat, especially the alien designs for the other Lanterns.  Ryan Reynolds is better at the quips than he is at the heroics, but he never feels out of place.  Peter Sarsgard is wonderful as the super villain Hector.  His storyline, while tired, was more compelling than any of the Paralax stuff.  Why did Paralax need him to kill the Lantern, if he was on his way to earth anyway?  Paralax seemed to be very capable of killing Jordan himself, so why enlist the help of a demented human being?  Oh, wait, I'm complaining again.  He's good and I would love to see him in other movies, or a sequel to this.  Tim Robbins registers quickly with his limited scenes as Hector's overbearing father, a Senator.  Angela Bassett(where has she been?) also comes off  believable as some sort of shadow op for the government.  The love interest is fine.  Nothing special, like say Gweneth Paltrow in Iron Man and Natalie Portman in Thor, but good.  They at least give her the courtesy of helping Hal in the end AFTER he has been obligatorily kidnapped.  The realizations of Lantern home base is pretty cool.  Some more info on what the Guardians do when not floating atop pillars pondering, would've been nice.  And, yes, I know what they do due to actually having read the comics, but this is seperate from the films and one shouldn't be required to have read the comics to enjoy or understand the film.  Paralax is pretty cool too, but his visualization did remind me a bit of Galactis from Rise of the Silver Surfer.<br /><br />Martin Campbell directed this film, which is surprising to me.  He's nowhere to be seen in this film.  He is responsible for reinvigorating Bond TWICE(Goldeneye, Casino Royale) and he is a really solid storyteller and action director.  The action in this film are mostly done completely CGI.  Campbell has employed visual effects in his films before, but not on this level.  He seems to lose his visual style and flare among the completely digital scenes and action beats.  This film may have been his learning curve for his next venture, or a reason to never do a film as loaded with effects as this.  When the film mixed the real with the CGI it isn't always successful, and I'm not sure if that's the director's blocking or the visual effects lacking.<br /><br />The film is fun and breezy, but totally inconsequential and not a great representationof The Green Lantern.  The recent direct to video WB animated Green Lantern film has the vibe down better and is very enjoyable for those of you who haven't seen it.  The Green Lantern is no Dark Knight, Superman, Iron Man....or even Thor or X-Men: First Class(two better films that came out earlier this year).  It's more on the level of the first X-Men or Batman Forever.  It's passable fun, but nothing great.  I would like and hope, not that this origin and setting up crap has been done and blundered, that the sequel can tell a good story and let this silly concept shine in all of its unashamed glory.very capable of killing Jordan himself, so why enlist the help of a demented human being?

0756404738|3.0|This was my first exposure to Patrick Rothfuss (I listened to the 36 CD audio version).  Having not read the first book in the series, I was concerned that I might feel a bit lost, but happily I was able to move through the book easily.    I usually love long, epic fantasy tales and looked forward to The Wise Man's Fear. I found it fun and engaging at times, but I also found - on several occasions - that I was looking forward to the end. Other reviewers have noted WMF may not be up to the quality of the first book and I can't confirm that, but this book does have some problems. Notably WMF suffers from an overall lack of continuity and seems to be several sections/stories glommed together with very thin transitions. Its quasi-successful attempt to form a longer book frequently caused me to recall a line from the movie Amadeus, in which the Austrian Emperor critiqued Mozart's new opera by saying it had \\"too many notes\\". That sentiment reflects my feelings; it's a decent overall story, often with segments well written and rich in detail, but it's also disjointed, desultory, and bloated. The book often goes on too long, runs off the road, and gets lost in the weeds. I particularly found the \\"Faerlurian/Felurian\\" (not sure of the spelling since I listened to it) section mind numbing and clumsy, while the Adem(sp?) section was stretched and frankly boring. Rothfuss' words may be elegant at times, but do we really need so many to convey what we already know, or what is better left to the imagination? Perhaps we needed more sign language...     I thought the book had character problems. I'm not sure I'm a Kvothe fan, nor do I think much of Denna (sp?,) the girl he meets in locations across the world. She's largely irrelevant and while Kvothe is sometimes sympathetic (in the non-magical sense) some of the silliness stretched my willingness to suspend disbelief to the breaking point. Asking me to believe this character is a teenager (16 or 17?) is just too much, but perhapsthe book is aimed at a much younger audience and the mistake is mine.    My first reaction was to leave a two star review, but for now I'll give it three. It was entertaining at times, but it failed my read-it-again test and I also didn't find it compelling enough to come back for more until Rothfuss writes a much tighter tale. Judging from the first book's reviews, Rothfuss is competent with a loyal following so I'm sure many will enjoy this second installment irrespective of its faults. I'll cautiously recommend it to those that are already involved, but for first timers such as myself, I'd suggest either going elsewhere or perhaps reading the first book - which might be better - before attempting this one. Rothfuss needs help with plots, pacing, and editing. Skipping 30%-40% of this book won't really make a difference, and reflecting on the CD count, this book should have been at least 1/3 shorter or no more than 24 disks (about 650 pages).

B003LWN8F8|4.0|Marina & The Diamonds, otherwise known as Marina Diamandis, is a Greek pop singer whose album has gone gold in the UK and has earned three top 40 hits there. Here, however, 'The Family Jewels' reached 138 on Billboard, leaving her as a relative unknown. This is a shame, considering that she has released quite an exciting debut with this album.<br /><br />'Exciting', however, does not always equate to 'great.' Marina's biggest asset is her personality, equal parts Avril Lavigne without the teen angst and Lily Allen without the tongue-in-cheek vibe focused upon sex. Her vocal style is closest to Florence + The Machine, who only recently broke big. Marina's album isn't quite as brilliant as Florence's, but there are certainly some great moments.<br /><br />The album opens with a question: are you satisfied with an average life? It's a theme that's carried out through the thirteen tracks, paired with hollywood and fame, individuality, pain, and sometimes love. The fact that love is hardly the focus here, a rare occurrence with any record, is interesting enough to warrant the whole album a spin, but the other themes can feel too heavy-handed at times.<br /><br />Two songs in particular, 'Girls' and 'Hollywood', weigh the album down as Marina emphasizes her point over an entire song. The subject of not being a 'preppy' girl or the dysfunction of hollywood, respectively, could have been restrained to more subtle lyrics amongst an entire song, rather than given three to four minutes of what sometimes feels like ranting. Marina sounds best on 'Oh No!' when she matter-of-factly states 'TV taught me how to feel; now real life has no appeal.'<br /><br />Otherwise, though, Marina amounts to a tough girl who knows what she wants, unwilling to let her guard down for any prolonged time. When she does in full, as on the opening minute of 'Obsessions', it is all the more rewarding, almost jarring.<br /><br />The most interesting parts of the album are the ones that dissolve into complete camp. 'Hermit the Frog' is the finest example, with yelping and references to a glass balloon. The best moments, however, are reserved for when the right beat lines up with the most genuine form of Marina. This occurs on 'I Am Not a Robot', which makes fine use a auto-tune for the phrase, the aforementioned 'Obsessions', and paranoid 'The Outsider'.<br /><br />There isn't a downright bad song on 'The Family Jewels'. That being said, there could have been some fine-turning that would have only improved the record.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: With a few missteps and lots of personality, 'The Family Jewels' is a worthy listen for those mourning the end of Lily Allen's music career or awaiting a new Florence + The Machine record.
B002LFIZDG|5.0|Granted, in today's cultural milieu, music I would characterize as \\"gentle\\" and \\"contemplative\\" would likely be described as many others as \\"flaccid,\\" but that doesn't diminish the power of this remarkable album.  The compositions are subtle and introspective, delivered simply and intimately via softly-blended voices and effects-free nylon and steel string acoustic guitars.  No \\"beats\\" here.  This album only proves that artists with something to say can sometimes say it best in a near whisper.  And if you don't really care about the message and merely want to chill, you can't go wrong with this recording.     Other reviewers have likened the vocal delivery to Simon & Garfunkel, and the comparison is valid, but my first impression called to mind Peter and Gordon.  The compositions themselves reminded me of Everything But The Girl's Idlewild.

B004XZR63M|4.0|This is a hard book to rate as there is undeniably some real meat to this, but it's only to be found by wading through a lot of repetition. I really felt like this could've been a 20 page pamphlet and been just as educational, but clearly, after reading this book, Kiyosaki's plans to pad his retirement include writing books with a handful of good ideas, reword them a bajillion times (and even repeat sentences verbatim frequently), add some fluff and sit back and watch the money roll in. I can only imagine that his seminars probably amount to the same.<br /><br />However... that being said, I mustered the patience necessary, ignored the repetition and horrible writing to push through to the end, and I found myself inspired by this book. While nothing sophisticated or seemingly profound, it does spark that paradigm change to get the gears turning and I think that was all he was really going for. (Other than creating another form of passive income for himself, of course.)<br /><br />But be warned, there are no real specifics to be found here, and again, there needn't be any. I think the most important take-away of this book is that you will never escape the Rat Race expecting your income to outmatch your expenses; it is necessary to find the means to generate passive income. As for the hows on a lot of the suggestions here.... you're on your own. But I don't rate the book lower for not including them. As I said, I believe the intent is to simply make that paradig shift in the reader's mind and let them figure out the hows on their own.<br /><br />I would probably rate this a 3.5 if I could, very tempted to rate it a 3 simply because I felt like the writing style was awful. But... as I believe it accomplishes what it was intended to, it inspired me to push forward in my own enterprise and I could honestly say I'd recommend this book to someone else (with a warning about all the fluff) in need of that paradigm change, I'll be generous and give it a 4 (but just barely).
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Why should the Kindle version of this set cost $29.99 when the book set is only $19.77?      Folks who read electronically are making a real contribution to conserving resources and are apparantly to be charged for it for the privilege!  It's the same over at Barnes & Noble.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I wasn't sure about a live album - usually I don't like them, and it's true that just occasionally I could have done with a little less introduction of the people playing and singing along with Leonard and just occasinally Iwould have liked to simply listen to the music without the audiece.  And yet, and yet... in other ways, the delighted reaction of the audience, Leonard's humble and heartfelt words to them, and even knowing who was playing or singing what was part of the rich experience.<br /><br />This is just a superb album and I am so glad I overcame my bias against live and bought it.  Leonard's voice has aged like a really good wine.  I am amazed and awestruck at how he can breathe fresh new life into songs that have been around for literally years and covered by many different people.  How he can vary his phrasing, his intonation, his interpretion and re-interpretations... It encourages you to come to the songs afresh, almost like hearing them for the very first time. (And wasn't that a long time ago now!)<br /><br />Great value collection, jampacked with songs, many I knew, some I didn't. I'm playing it over and over in my car and find myself replaying sections in my head as I go about my daily activities.  Thank you, Leonard, than you everyone, it's almost as good as being at the concert.  What a show.
B004A8ZX2S|5.0|Certainly deserves, that is, must be seen on the large screen to be appreciated. Tree of Life is some two and a half hour of majestic, sumptuous pictures and images with a minimalist plot that can only be inferred. A movie almost entirely told through pictures. This is my take:<br /><br />One of if not the most difficult experiences for a parent to endure is when ones child dies before they do.  The death is off-screen and never explained. Why Why Why? If there is a God, why did this happen? If there is divine purpose directing our lives, what can be the purpose to violating the natural order and the child dying first. If God can create and order this vast universe and nature throughout history, why would he take my child, the fifties mother (Jessica Chastain) contemplates these questions. What is the plot here?<br /><br />We see beautiful glimpses of a very fifties family in Waco Texas. Father, stern, strict but ultimately loving, stay-at-home, dreamy mother plays with her three boys, makes meals and quietly supports the decisions of her husband, played by Brad Pitt.  Brad works in the factory but would have preferred a job playing organ or piano, his talent and interest. Life is tough and you have to be tough to survive, he tried to teach his sons.  Kids experience a world without media, cell phones, x-boxes, TV's (!) where they use their imaginations in play. The experiences of Waco effect the child Jack O'Brien who becomes the adult played by Sean Penn. What is the purpose of life? Why did his younger brother die and him live? Fights with his father, rebellion. From this idyllic fifties setting, Jack O'Brien grows to be an architect designing huge soulless glass and steel monstrosities. Fights with his father go on in his head. This movie offers a lot of questions and no answers.<br /><br />Much of this is seems autobiographical of director Terrence Malick.<br /><br />We see stunningly beautiful pictures of life, underwater, of earth from space, Pictures not seen since in movies \\"2001, a Space Odyssey\\". Pictures from the Hubble telescope. Perhaps heaven. A extremely visual movie. A movie of pictures from the perspective of God. The end of days when \\"the sea shall give up it's dead\\".<br /><br />Director Malick throws in a soundtrack with a lot of classical music, Bach etc. But repeatedly plays Francois Couperin's \\"Les Baricades Misterieuses\\" -the mysterious barricades - to underline his point...<br /><br />I think people with children and people who who have religion in their lives will marvel at this movie.

0312600844|4.0|I really cared about Walter primarily, later Connie, and then I cared more the more I understood of Patty, Richard and Joey.  Franzen reveals characters' past to allow us to understand the their motivations, reflexes and self-justifications.  Reviewers have criticized lost threads in the plot like Patty's rape and her parents' selfish reaction, or stock characters like Abigail, Joyce, Ray, Joey, etc.  Only Walter, Patty and Richard are fleshed out enough to allow identification with them.  However I really enjoyed the story and could not put it down.

0756405890|5.0|This novel has just about every trope and clich&eacute; there is in the world of fantasy literature. It has the required tavern, gypsies, feudal kings and nobles, precocious lad mentored by kindly old wizard, a school for wizards, dragons, evil shadowy villain, a quest, people from the land of Fae, legendary stories of the prior history and heroes of the world, and, of course, magic. But Mr. Rothfuss has taken all of these and subtlety warped and changed each and every one of them, to where they all seem fresh, different, and richly detailed, and wrapped them in pin-point characterization of both his main protagonist and all those who intersect with him.<br /><br />The result is a 700 page-turner, which kept me up long past my bedtime for multiple nights, as I simply did not want to put it down. There were several places that moved me to tears, a strong indication of the emotional involvement that drives this work. There is subtle satire and humor present, not overridingly obvious, but there to the point that I frequently quoted some lines of the work to my wife, which all caused quite a reaction. There is real, believable action and places where our hero thinks his way through problems. It's a world you can walk into and instantly feel at home. Not only one of the best first novels by any author that I've read, but this book should seriously be placed in the company of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Just be aware this is the first book of a series, and therefore everything doesn't get nicely tidied up by the end of this volume. Which will leave you screaming for more, right now! Happily, book two is already out, and continues in the same exemplary fashion as this volume.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)

B004A8ZX28|2.0|Here's the problem with UNKNOWN: it has nothing new to offer.  If you've seen any espionage film, you'll know the basic premise (including the \\"twist\\") from the trailer alone.  This knowledge of previous story lines ruins any of the film's suspense; you know how it's going to go, and all you can do is sit there and let director Jaume Collet-Serra drive you around for a couple hours.  (NOTE: I did not call this an \\"action\\" film, because there is very little action until the last two-thirds; this is not TAKEN, despite what the marketing campaign would have you believe, and if you go into it like that you will be even more disappointed than normal.)<br /><br />That's not to say the film is without any redeeming features (there are two stars in this review, after all).  The story is trite: man loses his identity, struggles to prove he is who he says he is.  Way too many plot-holes here; part of the fun in watching the film is picking all of them out.  Aside from January Jones, who gives an utterly wooden performance as (maybe/maybe not) Mrs. Liam Neeson, the performances are decently solid.  Neeson himself has done way, way better, but he's still a strong presence (he CAN give a bad performance, but he rarely does).  Aidan Quinn, as Neeson's possible replacement, is dangerously charming--is he hiding something or isn't he?  Diane Kruger is the anchor of the lead cast here; she seems to know what kind of film she's making, and decides to walk an even balance between hamming it up and keeping things serious.  As for the more supporting cast, kudos to Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz, who share a tremendously understated scene together; seriously, rent the movie for this one scene alone, and watch it repeatedly.  Especially for those of you wannabe actors who are curious as to how two older men can completely and thoroughly steal a movie in just five minutes.<br /><br />The script is predictable and the directing is inconsequential.  You've seen better espionage films; this is BOURNE-lite, so lite that it's pretty much water with a little sugar added.  If you go into it without any great expectations, perhaps you'll be okay; but as it is, this film is a C-grade thriller at best, passable but utterly forgettable.  Aside from that great Langella/Ganz scene, everything here is recycled from previous films, and will be recycled yet again somewhere down the line.o lite that it's pretty much water with a little sugar added.

B004G6009U|4.0|My daughter loves this show. She's only three so I wasn't sure she would understand it (it's a more complex story than say Cinderella) but she asks to watch it over and over again. I love it for the most part, but Mandy Moore's voice is simply not my style and the songs get stuck in my head and I feel I'm going to catch musical diabetes from the syrupy tunes. I do like the songs not sung my Miss Moore and I don't mind her voice acting.<br /><br />There are some scare moments in it, but I actually found this story helpful in bringing up the concept of kidnapping in a very gentle way with my daughter who tends to run away in stores and has never understood why I didn't want her too. When I explained that I didn't want her to get taken away from me like Rapunzel she seemed to get it without being too worried. Not exactly the most accurate way to describe stranger danger, I suppose, but for a three-year-old who I would rather not be afraid of the world, it seemed to work.
1416550550|1.0|I picked up this book when I was looking on-line for books similar to Fried Green Tomatoes by Fannie Flagg. Someone mentioned this book and I decided to see what this writer was like. Although I have not read anything else from this author, if The Forgotten Garden is any indication of her writing prowess, I don't think I would be a returning reader.    In the beginning, the story did interest me because the author left so much to be asked about the characters. But as the story progressed, I just felt that everything dragged out too long and with little information being divulged. Honestly, the book was quite boring to me and the ending was so disappointing. As mysterious as the beginning started out, the ending just felt rushed as if the author had hit her word quota and decided to wrap things up.    All in all, there were not many redeeming qualities about this book. From character development to writing style, I really feel like it was a waste of my time and wish I could get a refund.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|I got this case for organizational purposes only. At first i was afraid that it would be too small for what i wanted to use it for, but it was the perfect size. I store my Ipod Touch, Ipod nano, and apple ear buds in it.<br /><br />Before it was impossible to locate my iPods in my purse and if it was located most likely the ear buds were tangled up in my other belongings. This Case has not only helped me organize my iPods and made it easier for me to find them, but it also provides great protection. I was actually surprised at how nicely padded the case was without the bulk.<br /><br />I also tried the case out on a few of my other electronics and it fits most. So now its a back up case for my canon camera.
055357342X|4.0|I was never bothered by the deaths of seemingly key and important figures, but rather, the deaths are becoming less surprising. Especially with the good (or in the order v. chaos theory: order) characters. I may have started this review with the end...    I find GRRM's style to become extremely heavy, why describe the character to the glove he wears, I would rather imagine it myself, besides, ten pages down the road I forget that he wore thin wool gloves with worn black gloves over them, I just know he wore them. He leaves little to the imagination.     The methodical interchange of names is a bit exhausting as well. Beric to Lord Dandarion to the Lightning Lord back to Beric...why can't he stick to one. Or the Dany...Stormborn, the Unburned, Mother of Dragons, Last of the Targarians...that becomes cumbersome, and there are many others.    I think he better develops the good characters a little more, he makes them a bit more rounded and more human/multi-faceted, and the same goes for a few of the \\"bad\\" characters, Tyrion, Jamie...The Hound. Sansa is still ever the prim and proper Lady, but I think floats around within the story and rarely takes an active role. We shall see what is to become of the story, it seems to be thrown into confusion and chaos by the end.     All in all, with this book, I have either become better able to cope with GRRM's style of trying to remain unpredictable - or I just don't care anymore. I may just me more along for the ride, and turned off by Martin's antics and heavy hand. I will read, I am to caught up in the fantasy of it all; whether it be naturalist or not, I don't care, I just want a good story when it comes down to it.      Arya: I must say, pairing her with the Hound was a great bit of writing. His personality suits her very well, I'm slightly surprised he didn't help her with her sword play, he did, however, help her become less stupid and more thoughtful about her idealisms...what have you. But, his death and her escape, all slightly predictable. She has rarely stayed in the hands of one \\"capture\\" for longer than a few hundred pages. Her \\"good\\"/\\"order\\" seems to be degrading into a grayish morality. With each passing death she becomes less concerned with death. This seems to make her rather immune to the stupidity suffered by other \\"good/order\\" characters. I hate to say she is my favorite character, but she appears to be one of the few that are shifty enough to understand how to deal with the chaos of GRRM's world.    Lannisters: I was initially repulsed by their story lines, then intrigued. They drive the story in Westeros. The development of the relationship between Tyrion/Tywin/Cersei and Joff was extremely good. Though, I wasn't surprised to see Tyrion blamed for the death of Joff (a big \\"FINALLY\\" with his death, I knew it was coming; he was so stupid that all the cunning of Cersei and Tywin couldn't save him. It was only a matter of time). But Martin continues to keep Tyrion alive at all costs, and through many absurd turns of events. Tywin's death, I was slightly surprised by that. But, that it came at the hands of a kinslayer makes it slightly more believable, there was no way he could have otherwise died, except at the hands of a traitor. I'm excited for the continuation Jamie's point of view and the development of Cersei's point of view in the next book. Of Tyrion, I suppose I'll have to wait and see what happens to that cunning little bastard.    Red Wedding; Foreshadowed by the Frey's inability to be slighted in the least without retribution, and the death of Renly and Joff, and the dialogue between The Red Priestess, Stannis and Davos: two is not three... Speaking of Davos. What happened to him. I assume he died for sending away Robersts bastard....    The Wall: To me this seems to be one of the stronger story lines in the book. Jon, much like Tyrion seems to have the uncanny ability to stay alive in almost all situations. He should have died numerous times... The king-beyond-the-wall and the Crows seem to contradict the order v. chaos theory. The wildlings are the chaos and seem destined to victory, but at the last minute comes Stannis, I'm not sure who the greater villain is, Stannis or the Lannisters, we shall see.    ....blah blah blah, my review won't matter much, people will continue reading whether or not they read this.

Think of how Jimi Hendrix re-interpreted Bob Dylan's \\"All Along The Watchtower\\" back in the day and how Hendrix's version became the definitive version of that song; that's what Zakk has done here.

0307405095|5.0|This cookbook begins with classic pies so even a novice can try her hand at pie baking and then take off in a million directions using so many creative techniques. This really is the quintessential cookbook for making pies and tarts. I love the layout. Each recipe begins with an introductory paragraph about the recipe, the list of ingredients is clear and not too close to the spine and for the most part, the directions are clear and concise, although sometimes I did get very lost.<br /><br />There is a stunning and classic Martha-esque photo for every recipe that makes your mouth water and truly is eye candy. At the back you will find a ton of helpful techniques on making pies and tarts, plus so much information about ingredients. From poached apple roses to candied lemon slices, there is so much to explore even when it comes to garnishes.<br /><br />I do feel that if I was to keep just one book about pies and tarts on my bookcase of cookbooks, this is is the one I would choose. I do wish there was more visual instruction for some of the techniques within the recipes themselves because what I was supposed to do was not always clear but overall, I loved this cookbook and will cherish it.

There is no mind behind all this weak, silly babbling.  If a word somehow fires off a neuron she repeats this word many unconnected times, stream of consciousness style, interspersed with chirpy factoids right out of the travel guide. I can't understand why any sensible person at GQ actually paid her for writing anything.     It is truly frightening to have such a vapid mind revealed.  What makes it worse is blithe disregard for grubby stuff like earning a living or helping another human being.

I was certainly entertained, but I must say - and I can't believe no one else has said this - (SPOILER-ISH alert)  I was convinced that Freddy was gay.  It seemed that our heroine found a true and great friend in him (better than most of her contemporaries to be sure) but I don't see them as lovers.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke (animation, adventure, fantasy)<br />Directed by Hayao Miyazaki<br />Starring the voices of Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, Clare Danes and Minnie Driver<br /><br />Miramax   1999   133 min   Rated PG-13   Released Dec 19, 2000<br /><br />The Film 4.5/5<br /><br />Here's another film from Studio Ghibli that hasn't yet seen a Blu-ray release. If you read my recent review of My Neighbor Totoro, you'll know that I love Miyazaki's animation, themes and characterization. This film has a different feel to Totoro and is aimed at older audiences.<br /><br />The story lasts 133 minutes and is quite violent in places. The opening scene shows a boar possessed by a demon, which is an immediate threat to a village. Ashitaka (Crudup) tackles the beast and ultimately kills it, but injures his right arm in the process. The arm is essentially possessed and the infection is expected to spread throughout his body, killing him. He's a danger to his own people and reluctantly has to leave in search of a cure.<br /><br />Like most of Miyazaki's characters, Ashitaka is a good person. One clue to his character is the way he treats Yakul, the red elk that he rides. The two seem like partners and it's clear that he loves the animal.<br /><br />Further clues to Ashitaka's character can be seen when he saves another village from attack and rescues two drowning men from a river. We see that his infected arm seems to have additional strength and that enemies hit by his arrows can be decapitated. As I mentioned at the outset, the film is aimed at older audiences than those targeted by Totoro. It's bloody and violent in places and death is always a possibility.<br /><br />The first magical scene takes place in a forest. The locals fear it and the tree spirits that live there, but Ashitaka has no such fears. He sees the tree spirits as happy and childlike and willingly follows their directions. They lead him and the injured men to safety. He also catches a glimpse of the Forest Spirit, which is an altogether more powerful entity and has a big role to play in the story.<br /><br />Ashitaka returns the men to their town and is thanked by the town's ruler, Lady Eboshi (Driver). She's one of the most interesting characters in the story. She's capable of giving people a chance where others wouldn't and has taken in prostitutes and lepers and given them honorable roles in her town. But she's also fiercely ambitious and thinks she's powerful enough to kill gods to gain more wealth and power. She's a truly divided woman, but not definitely good or evil. She does seem to genuinely want to help the people under her care and protection. Her character changes significantly by the end of the story.<br /><br />Princess Mononoke has been raised by a wolf-god (Anderson) and regularly rides one of its two cubs. She hates humans because she only ever sees them harming the forest. Her character is wild and reckless and will attack the town in an attempt to stop the people causing further damage to her beloved forest. She feels that if she kills Lady Eboshi, the threat will cease to exist.<br /><br />Miyazaki's animation doesn't look modern. It has the look of a watercolor painting and is simply drawn; but with simple drawings, he's capable of expressing a lot of emotion. When Ashitaka looks at his elk, the animal looks friendly, loving and intelligent. Its gaze and simple expression conveys all kinds of positive feelings. The forest is also a beautiful place and you'll find that you want to see it protected and unharmed. The tree sprites project joy and innocence and that innocence is a common theme in Miyazaki's work. I'm not sure how he does it, but it's powerful and moving.<br /><br />The final act is full of action and a number of key characters suffer major wounds. It's not clear who will live and who will die, but not everyone survives. Some of the animals in the story are much more than dumb beasts and many are gods capable of mutual respect when they encounter souls who deserve it. There's a sense of that respect throughout the film and the characters live by their own honor code.<br /><br />Miyazaki places us right in the middle of the action and commonly uses a panning technique as if the frames were filmed instead of drawn. He also takes his time establishing scenes and it's common to see water ripple, grass wave in the wind or clouds move across the sky. He seems to revel in the beauty of his worlds and I find that it helps me appreciate it all the more.<br /><br />The conclusion of the story feels satisfying and right. It's not a contrived ending at all, but one which could actually happen given the personalities of the characters and their situation. It's interesting that Miyazaki's villains usually consist of misguided people rather than truly evil individuals. This is often the case in real life and it works better than having a stock villain like those found in most animated movies.<br /><br />The actors do a good job in the English version, but the Japanese dub is included with English subtitles for anyone wishing to experience the original version.<br /><br />I have only seen Princess Mononoke three times and found it a bit muddled the first time. It improved with each viewing and I now consider it just below Miyazaki's very best work. If you thought My Neighbor Totoro and Ponyo were too childish, give this a try.<br /><br />Let's hope that a Blu-ray release isn't too far away.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5cters live by their own honor code.

B004SBQGHS|1.0|Since the free version of Angry Birds was not getting the Mine and dine update, I bought the .99 ad free version. When I installed it, my game was over written and I have to start all over. So instead of just updating it and taking away the adds, it deleted all the progress I made. Gave it 1 star since i cant submit the review without a star. The game is great but the deleting of my progress sucks.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Vangelis has inspired me long before Blade Runner became one of the most important movies made in the last half century. That being said, this box set has satisfied me completely. Blade Runner fans may not  grasp It's musical concept, possibly dismissing some tracks as trite, but given Vangelis's musical history, I am more than satisfied!
0553386794|1.0|I was super-excited about reading this book considering it is my favorite genre, however, I was not prepared for the vulgar profanity and sex littered throughout the book. That might be your thing, I prefer a more tasteful approach. I did not finish the book and promptly returned it on my Kindle. Kudos to Amazon for allowing customers to return digital books within 7 days!<br /><br />If vulgar / profane content doesn't bother you, by all means ignore my review :)
B003QZ5222|2.0|Nice set but far from complete. If it was remastered and included Darkness, Promised Land, Badlands and more B-Sides like Jersey Girl it would be worth it. Trust me Born in the USA original release sounds better then the final disc in this compilation. If you already have Bruce's original studio releases from 74 to the Born In The USA Album. Don't bother wasting your money on this set. Nothing really special!
B00004CXYL|1.0|I was very unhappy with Movie Mars which is where the DVD came from. The DVD was not made for my area but it didn't say that anywhere on the order. They did let me send it back but I had to pay the postage both ways.  I doubt that I will use Amazon again to order.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|Well I have just watched the alternate ending to this wonderful insperational film starring the wonderful James Franco. And for the life of me I don't understand why the powers that be didn't stick with the original ending! I do believe that this is more of a delated ending more than an 'alternate ending. The only reason to leave this out would be to cut the films running time. And cutting this out of the film may have cost James his well deserved Oscar. I urge anyone who has this film on DVD to watch the alternate ending and you'll see what I mean. Sincerly. Bob \\"Ziggy\\" Anderson
0312370849|3.0|I very much enjoyed about the first two-thirds of this book.  Then the author fell into the same trap that so many writers do: they forget Lewis Carroll's advice to stop when you get to the end.  This book, in my opinion, went way past the end before stopping.  The result was an overly-sentimental and improbable last one-third.

0857680986|5.0|This is possibly the best illustrator reference book I've found for drawing the figure from multiple camera angles. There aren't that many books out there covering bird's eye and worm's eye planar vantage points with human examples, but finally this classic explores this area with excellence.  Be aware that Loomis's book is an illustration book and not so much an anatomy book, although the drawings and muscles definition are top notch. This book should be absolute core reference material for all aspiring comic book artists.  It's huge book, with tons of great drawings, classic models and quality information.

B003VS0CXS|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in YEARS, so when i decided to pick it up on Blu-ray?DVD bundle i knew it would look pretty nice in HD, and i never bought the DVD so that's nice to have as well. BUT the Blu-ray version is simply mindblowingly vivid. Certain older movies i never know what to expect when seeing them in HD, so this one really is fun to see in HD glory. The package has decent extras, sing a long stuff for families, and lots of typical addtiions. Definitely worth having in the collection.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|It was a bit slow in development, but the last hour was exciting, as the master thieves squared off against each other.  The suspense was thick and palpable.  Who was going to win?  Who would outsmart whom?  A fine troupe of actors, and fine performances all around.  Charlize Theron continues to amaze.  With little more than body postures, she first does \\"I don't need anybody, thanks\\" to \\"I'd love to collapse into your arms, but I'm afraid to let myself be vulnerable\\" to \\"Okay, I want you, just give me a bit of time.\\"      All in all, a fun tale of a band of thieves who actually love each other, a betrayal, and a brilliant revenge scheme.  What's not to like about a film that features three Coopers (red, white, and blue, respectively) racing through the Metro underground?

B004CR5TD0|4.0|21 yr. old James Blake has seemingly come out of nowhere in the last 12 months with a couple of EP vinyl releases that created a sizable buzz and major anticipation for his debut album, which finally was released in February, 2011. In case you are not familiar with his sound: minimal, chill, electronic and heavily processed will give you an idea.<br /><br />\\"James Blake\\" (11 tracks; 38 min.) starts off with \\"Unluck\\", which features spares instrumentation and a heavily processed lead vocal. It is followed by \\"The Wilhelm Scream\\" (2nd UK single), which is one of the more accessible songs here. \\"I Never Learnt To Share\\" features only one line (\\"My brother and my sister don't speak to me/But I don't blame them\\"), which is repeated over and over again, while a wave of electronic sounds builds up. \\"Lindisfarme I and II\\" starts with just Blake's voice heavily sequenced and redone, with eventually some instrumentation as well. \\"Limit To Your Love\\" (1st UK single) is by now the signature song of Blake's short career, a compelling cover of Feist' track from her \\"The Reminder\\" album. It is one of the more traditional songs on this album, and I say that in the vaguest sense of the word, as the song is still nothing like what you might expect to hear on mainstream commercial radio. With underlying piano and Blake's vocals upfront, it reminded me of Bill Withers' \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\", of all things. After that, things slow down more and more, and most of the remainder 5 tracks are what I would call mostly electronic vignettes, more sound experimentation than true songs (check \\"I Mind\\" for example). And that is not a criticism, on the contrary.<br /><br />In all, I cannot emphasize enough how pleased and impressed I am with album. No melodies to speak of, just electronic mood-sounds. When this album was released in Europe some months ago, it made an immediate impact. It rose to No. 1 on the album chart in my native Belgium, and also reached the top 10 in the UK (in the US it didn't even break the top 100 of the Bilboard 200). This album is as about as likely to achieve mainstream success as Laurie Andersen's \\"Big Science\\" album all those years ago, but somehow has managed to do that, in Europe at least. \\"James Blake\\" is not for anyone in a hurry or looking for the next Lady Gaga or Nickelback, but I personnaly think it's a terrific album. Highly recommended!top 100 of the Bilboard 200).

1423101472|5.0|I completely loved the ending! It was very satisfying, even though its a little sad that the series has come to an end.<br /><br />So anyway, Kronos advances on New York City to get to Olympus and destroy it. But of course, Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and the rest of Camp Half-blood (plus others :P) help to defend Olympus.<br /><br />There is so much action and adventure in this book, its awesome! Plus its full of unending humor. Oh, and guess what? Pandora's Box isn's a box... its a jar! lol<br /><br />Overall, I thought this series was a very good read. I love Greek mythology, but the books were also a very easy read. I personally haven't really studied greek mythology, but you actually learn alot from these books.
B001AQMBKA|3.0|Works & all, but the Case is in Crappy Shape, and 2 of the discs had Fingerprint Smudges on them.<br /><br />But for LOST Fans, Great Own!!
0786838655|5.0|Before I read this book I saw the movie. I thought the movie was AWESOME! I had forgotten how much I loved Greek Mythology, even though I've never actually studied it. As we were watching the movie my cousin's girlfriend told me that there were books... I was like \\"I have to read them!\\"<br /><br />So about a week later I picked up this book. I was super excited to read it, and it didn't let me down. Yes, I know these books are for kids in the middle school age (my 12 year old brother is reading these books too) and I'm 18 years old...But I have to admit, this book had me hooked from start to finish, plus it was an easy read, lol.<br /><br />Imagine having ADHD and dyslexia... and then later on being told that you don't have that. That its your battle skills kicking in and that your brain is hardwired to Greek not English. Weird huh? Well not only that, imagine there's monsters chasing you, one of them captures your mom and you end up in a place called `Camp Half-Blood.' That's as weird as things can get, right? Wrong!<br /><br />Well this is exactly what happened to 12 year old Percy Jackson. But not only that, you know those Gods from Greek mythology that are well... myths? It turns out that they're not myths. Poseidon happens to be Percy's father... yep, one of those Greek Gods. Which makes Percy a Demigod AKA a half-human half-god.<br /><br />After all this information is thrown at Percy, he, Annabeth (his friend who is Athena`s daughter), and Grover (his best friend/protector/satyr... half-human half-goat, in other words) set out to find his mom.<br />But not only that. \\"It gets worse?\\" you ask? Well yes, yes it does. It turns out that Zeus' master bolt is stolen, and guess what... they are blaming Percy for it!<br /><br />That's as worse as it can get, right? Wrong! Er... again!<br />This book is packed with adventures as Percy tries to save his mom and tries to clear his name all at the same time. This is a great read if you're craving an adventure book, but its also crammed with tons of humor as well. And I have to say, you don't have to be in middle school to read this book :) lolts also crammed with tons of humor as well. And I have to say, you don't have to be in middle school to read this book :) lol
0240815807|4.0|imo more then worth the cost. there are a few insights here that i haven't found anywhere else. like listening to your faders, how to pick the right tools, time and pitch correction.    they also spend a lot of time addressing things that aren't really mixing but can have a huge effect on your final mix such as monitors and room treatment. people don't want to hear about this un-sexy stuff. they want to hear about cool gear. but no amount of great gear will save you from bad monitoring. so good advice.    there are also some nice workarounds for people that can't afford great rooms and great monitors.     the biggest strength in my opinion is how the book is tailored to small studio owners such as myself. we face a specific set of issues that pros do not have to be concerned about. like, what if your speakers can't accurately reproduce 40hz?
0062009540|4.0|I didn't even know about these books until I watched the show. I've watched the show since the first episode aired, and I love it!! So much that I had to read the books!<br /><br />Aria, Spencer, Emily, Hanna, and Alison are the best of friends! The do everything together and tell each other everything as well. Until one night Ali goes missing. What happened to her, nobody knows. The rest of the girls drift apart, barely talking to each other...until they stop talking completely.<br /><br />Now two years later the girls are receiving threatening texts from god knows who! If they only knew all those shared secrets would come back and haunt them. The sender signs the messages -A....is it possible that Ali could be back? *cue dramatic music*<br /><br />I seriously have no idea who A is, and I am dying to know!!! It can't be Ali...unless she's like haunting them, lol. But I've seen enough of the show to know it's not her. So if Ali isn't A...then who is?
B004EPYZQ2|2.0|Super 8 is a sub-par Spielberg knock-off. A forced-homage to the glory days of blockbuster film-making. I'm a fan of JJ Abrams first two films (Mission Impossible 3 and Star Trek)but this movie kind of left me cold. The story is boring and lacking any sort of emotional resonance. The design of the creature is uninspired, with unconvincing CGI, and not even remotely sympathetic. While all the kids are well-acted, their character's aren't really interesting, and many of them were downright annoying. The ending is silly, sentimental cheese at its worst. If you want to see the real thing, watch ET or Close Encounters instead.
142311339X|5.0|(major spoilers at the end)<br /><br />Oh. My. Gods. This book had me anxious from start to finish! Why? Well because Percy was missing! I was ready to tear my hair out! This was me the whole time (well, most of it anyway :P): WHERE THE HECK IS PERCY?!?! HE CANT JUST DISAPPEAR LIKE THAT! SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE HE IS!!!!<br /><br />Now that that's out of my system, lets get to the real review :)<br /><br />As you can see, Percy is in this book also...well, not really. He's only mentioned, because, once again, HE WAS MISSING! *Takes deep breath* If you have read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series  (and I recommend you do) than you will find familiar character in The Lost Hero, like Chiron, Annabeth, and Thalia.<br /><br />However, this book also introduced completely new characters: Jason, Leo, and Piper.<br />Jason woke up on a school field trip going to the Grand Canyon not knowing who or where he was. Total weirdness. Piper and Leo claim to be his friend, but how can this be true when he doesn't even remember? Throughout the book he gets glimpses of his memory every once in a while.<br />After a totally weird incident at the Grand Canyon, Annabeth and a son of Iris (cant remember his name, lol) take Jason, Leo, and Piper back to Camp-Half to find out they happen to be Demigods.<br /><br />(spoiler #1)<br /><br />Once at Camp Half-Blood, Jason then gets a quest to save Hera, who has been imprisoned my a mysterious someone.<br /><br /> So with the help of Piper and Leo (and a bronze dragon Leo fixes up) Jason sets out on this quest. On the way to saving Hera, they also rescue Pipers dad, who is a famous actor, and was kidnapped as well.<br /><br />(spoiler #2)<br /><br />AND SERIOUSLY?!?! Why must you have a cliffhanger, Rick?? Are you trying to give me a heart attack? How am I supposed to wait till October to find out more about Percy?!?!? *Takes deep breath*<br />Okay, so this book was amazing (besides that cursed cliffhanger -_-) Totally LOVED it!! Like always ;) I am soooo glad to be back in the Greek mythology world, which I completely love thanks to Rick Riordan :)<br />And I cannot wait for The Son of Neptune (literally... I want it NOW! hehe). I am almost positively sure that we are going to find out about Percy. I mean, the book is titled SON of NEPTUNE after all, and Neptune=Roman form of Poseidon who is Percy's father.<br />Whoooo! I am very excited for this!! :D<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Spoiler Alert<br /><br />spoiler #1- Leo is very funny and he happens to be one of my favorite characters. He is also  son of Hephaestus.<br /><br />Piper is daughter of Aphrodite. But don't let that fool you.  Piper is nothing like you would expect a child of Aphrodite to be like. She cuts her own her hair, purposefully uneven. She is not arrogant or self absorbed. She is quite the opposite, actually.<br /><br />And Jason........wait for it..........is son of Zeus! But Chiron somehow seemed to know this already. Hmm...<br /><br />spoiler #2- And get this, Thalia is Jason's sister!! Oh my gods!<br /><br />Well duh she's Jason's sister. They're both children of Zeus, you might be thinking. That's not exactly what I meant. They have the same mother as well.<br /><br />*gasp*<br /><br />I know right!!While saving Hera, Jason finally realizes who he is. He is Jason, son of Jupiter.<br /><br />Who is Jupiter? I thought we were talking about Greek mythology here. And didn't you say Jason was son of Zeus?<br /><br />Exactly! Jupiter is the Roman form of Zeus. Turns out there is also Roman demigods in some Roman camp back in San Francisco. Weird, right?<br /><br />Well it also turns out the Hera actually sent Jason to Camp Half-Blood...<br /><br />\\"Hera said my coming here was an exchange of leaders,\\" Jason said. \\"A way for the two camps to learn of each other`s existence.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, that Hera is evil!! Okay, not really. She's just trying to save them all from (the truly evil) Gaea, and join both the Roman and Greek camps to help one another.<br /><br />And wait for it...<br />\\"Percy Jackson is at the other camp, and he probably doesn't even remember who he is.\\" (Jason)il) Gaea, and join both the Roman and Greek camps to help one another.<br /><br />And wait for it...<br />\\"Percy Jackson is at the other camp, and he probably doesn't even remember who he is.\\" (Jason)
B004EBT5CU|5.0|21 is the album that won't stop selling, the musical gift that keeps on giving. After adding 5m sales since the start of 2012, making it the likely biggest album of the year aready, nothing seems impossible for this juggernaut. 21 is rapidly hoovering its way up the All Time 100 Album chart devouring iconic artists and albums in its path (Carole King, Tracy Chapman, Led Zeppelin, George Michael, Michael Jackson et al). On current projections, 21 probably won't pause for breath until it's well into the Top 30, a remarkable achievement in the age of digital downloads and file sharing networks.<br /><br />How has this come about? Having defied all the genres, genders, age brackets to reach its present supremacy, the focus is as always on the vocalist with THAT voice, but also increasingly on her writing skills, which have are increasingly differentiating Adele of late from her contemporaries. It's the sheer quality and freshness of her songs that have not only resisted listener fatigue after the statutory couple of dozen plays, but indeed have triggered a wave of global Adele addiction (adelation?) if the music blogs, tweets and reviews are anything to go by. Half the population seem to have 21 and/or 19 on permanent rotation.<br /><br />The most common criticism of 21 tends to focus on the alleged repetitiveness/blandness/weakness of its non-single tracks, with one reviewer even comparing 21 unfavourably (and incorrectly) to Amy Winehouse's \\"Back to Black\\", which also offers a tableau of similar-ish sounding songs. So, what's the beef - isn't this called having artistic style and identity? Its like saying Dark Side of the Moon is a lousy album because it has a unifying concept that shaped the overall sound. Doh?! As for \\"weaker\\" or \\"filler\\" songs on 21, this is simply not the case as many of them (Turning Tables, One and Only, Take It All, Lovesong) have YouTube plays running into millions.  Anyway, who can remember the names of the non-single songs from the albums ofalmost any other major artist? No, I thought not...<br /><br />Another occasional bewildering claim has been over 21's alleged sub-standard recording quality/mix. Even a cursory play on a high-end hi-fi or earphones (like Etymotic's excellent hf3's for iPhone) put the lie to that. The Neumann mikes used to record 21 are the gold standard for capturing warm, natural vocals, while the mix balances her voice against the backing perfectly, with a great stereo soundstage that places Adele's vocals almost uncannily into the room. Where effects like reverb are used, such as on Set Fire to the Rain, its done intentionally for a particular artistic effect, not as a way of hiding vocal shortcomings, unlike many of her contemporaries whose voices are doubled or tripled before being auto-tuned and otherwise digitally post-processed to death.<br /><br />Now back to Adele's voice, which is where it all starts and ends. A Dusty Springfield profile on TV the other day proved that as great as Dusty was (and still is), she didn't write her own material, and her voice didn't have the emotional or technical range of Adele's, even later in her career. Adele's much discussed appoggiaturas (Wall Street Journal etc) are only a small part of her artistic arsenal, which also includes unique self-taught vocal control that rivals the great singers like Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, Sara Vaughn and Billie Holliday, all of whom she studied assiduously during her own early development. Adele has already joined that pantheon. In the light of 21's chart topping sales figures well after a year of its release, global opinion increasingly appears to be reaching the same conclusion.
1423101499|5.0|Percy is finally going to start high school... that is, if he doesnt get killed first. The Titan lord Kronos continues to rise slowly with the help of the traitor, Luke. Yep, they're still trying to take over Olympus, but they first want to destroy Camp Half-Blood. And to do that they first have to enter the camp. But they wouldnt be able to do that since it was protective wards up. So they figured out another way in... through the Labyrinth. But they first have to figure out how to use it. So Percy, Annabeth, Tyson, and Grover set out into the Labyrinth to figure out how it works before Luke does. In order to do that, they will need the help of the least person they would expect to ask for help.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|A friend of mine convinced me to sit down and watch an episode of A Game of Thrones with him, and I was so intrigued that I went back and watched all the previous episodes he had on his DVR.  By that point, I was so interested in what was going to happen that I picked up this book.  I caught up to the series before the last episode aired.<br /><br />The book has a poetic flare that the show lacks somewhat.  I expected a lot less violence and gratuitous sexuality, but was surprised to see that much of it remained in the novel.  I'm not complaining, just noting it at this point.  It had a touch of realism that many other books sometimes lack.<br /><br />Martin also does a fantastic job of building his world through the events that may not seem like they are at the forefront.<br /><br />One of the more interesting things I must give the author credit for is his treatment of his characters.  I won't spoil anything, but I could not believe that he made some of his choices.  I was really mad by the end of this book, but something still compelled me to read on.  And I'm preparing to read the next book as well.<br /><br />To fans of the television series, if you're on the fence about whether or not to purchase this, pick it up.  You will not be dissapointed.<br /><br />And to fantasy fans in general, Martin is like a modern day Tolkien.  His ability to weave a tale is unprecedented.
B000002KJM|1.0|This is the best ZZ Top record ever. The CD will eventually be released with proper sound. We just have to wait for the ivory tower of Warner Brothers to decree it !! Hope I live long enough !!!
B003R0LBVW|2.0|I read a lot of fiction.  This book was one of the most frustrating books I've read in a long time.  The characters seem like 10X magnifications of people who might actually exist - way too liberal, way too self-loathing, way too everything.  Sure, the writing is good but the content is not.  There usually has to be at least one like-able character for me in a book, and in this one I hated all of them.  I felt like I stepped in on the lives of people who I couldn't stand.  I only gave it 2 stars because I felt compelled to finish it.  Otherwise, I would have given it 1.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|I found bulletproof a catch song and the rest of the cd sounded nice enough from the samples, so I got it. Overall, it was pretty decent, but not my most favored band. Besides bulletproof, there were a couple others songs that stood out. Several songs, like Growing Pains and tiger lily had a bit of a catch to them, which make them interesting.  So if you liked the samples, this would be one worth getting.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This entire album is nothing but epicness... every time I listen to it it makes me want to Sparta kick the person walking past me on the street.
0486266885|5.0|I'm sure most of us know some of this story already. In some ways, what I already heard about took away a lot of the surprise at the end. Still, it was an interesting read overall. It was certainly in a different format than I am use to in most books. It went through the vague story, and then had the missing story at the end to fill in any gaps.  So overall, it was an interesting story to actually read and if you want to know more about older and more classic stories like this one, I suggest you get and read this book.

This is a great album, I love just about every song on the album and can't wait to see what comes next from Florence + the Machine!
0375842209|4.0|This is a sad, although hopeful read. I like the concept of a tale narrated by death. I feel as if death is a lot more honest and raw than others would be, and yes, death does have a heart. You can't help but feel bad for him too. After all, he has a job that no one really wants, but yet it must be done.     For me, this story lagged a bit in the middle. I feel as if it dragged on and on for awhile before it finally picked up and reached a pace that finally brought on the sad, but thoughtful conclusion to the life of a foster child that lived during Nazi reign in Germany.
0811821846|5.0|I bought this for my nephew who is a Star Wars freak and loves to cook and bake.  He got SUCH a kick out of this book and made a bunch of recipes from it already!
0553284347|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book because of the numerous examples the author provided. I was drawn into the book because of the way in which I was able to relate to the stories of people who endured many of the same abuses and toxic behavior that I did. The examples also helped me to understand my own behavior - I wasn't really able to make a link between the cause and effect of the toxic behavior that has significantly shaped my life. This book, in addition to therapy, has helped me take the steps to reshape my life and dispel the hurt that would have consumed and ruined my life.

142314189X|5.0|I have loved this series and am already on the last book only a few weeks after purchasing them. They are really great for young adult readers and definitely keep your attention while weaving pretty exciting plots and situations together.<br /><br />I purchased them from a seller that works through Amazon, not Amazon directly. If you want better condition than what I have gotten through bookcloseouts, then I would order directly from Amazon.<br /><br />As far as the books go, read them. They are totally worth your time.
B002N1AF7W|5.0|\\"Man Machine\\" by Kraftwerk is a superb sounding cd that has a good collection of unique sounds.  \\"Man Machine\\" definitely sounds like a great cd that would be a good fit for many science fiction films.  I say this because the songs have a great mix of futuristic electronica music melodies.  My  favorite songs on this compilation would be \\"Neon Lights\\", \\"Spacelab\\", and \\"The Model\\".  \\"Spacelab\\" is a great musical track that has some very strong high-energy beats with a futuristic theme in them.  The voice that is used for \\"Spacelab\\" complements the song perfectly.  \\"Neon Lights\\" is a unique musical track that is about the beauty of the kaleidoscope of lights shimmering together in certain cities at night-time.  I admit that my overall favorite song is \\"The Model\\", because it is a clever blend of an interesting story mixed in with beautiful music.  \\"The Model\\" is a creative song about a person who is infatuated with a beautiful model who is very much sought after, popular, and successful. This Kraftwerk masterpiece is great to get if you love to listen to classic electronica music.
1594744769|3.0|\\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is a very unique and creative story.  It is, for the most part, well written and interesting.  The use of vintage photographs is something I haven't seen before in a novel, but it distracted me more than it added to the story.  I felt like the author tried a little too hard to fit the story to the photographs, and the story felt a little too forced in places.  This book has potential, but it really didn't do much for me.  I would recommend it to a younger audience, and I will probably end up giving it to my younger sister (who is a book-devouring 10 year old).
1932073221|5.0|\\"Creating Money: Attracting Abundance\\" by Sanaya Roman&Duane Packer is a very good guide on connecting with the vast resources of prosperity available in the universe. This book is also great because it is helpful to many people from various backgrounds and all walks of life.  What I enjoy about \\"Creating Money\\" is that there are many facets and dimensions of abundance and prosperity covered.  What I mean by this is that this book also contains ideas on increasing one's ability  to listen to inner guidance and develop unlimited thinking. The following is a sampling of what is covered in this phenomenal title:<br /><br />Following Your Inner Guidance(Chapter 5): This chapter covers information on the several kinds of inner guidance. There is also details available on ways to stimulate an intuition increase. The statements on the benefits of taking quiet time to reflect were very persuasive.<br /><br />Miracles (Chapter 11): I found it wonderful to see that the chapter begins with the how and why miracles are created from love. Creative information is available in this section regarding tips to increase the miracles in all areas of one's life.<br /><br />Believing In Yourself (Chapter 15): There is insightful details included as to why someone may encounter objections from those around them as they choose the path that is actually the closest to their joy. The detail that was very informative to me from this chapter is that having someone opposing you can be a blessing in disguise. I love that the authors emphasized that it is essential to avoid letting other people's images of what they see you doing influence your own personal dreams/ambitions. In addition, the authors also emphasize that in order to joyfully change your life, the belief that something better exists must be present.<br /><br />  There are many uplifting and inspiring affirmations available in \\"Creating Money\\".  My two favorite affirmations from this book are: 1) All my experiences are opportunities to gain more power, clarity, and vision (pg. 110). 2) I serve others to the best of my ability in all I say and do (pg. 233).<br />Creating Money: Attracting Abundance by Sanaya Roman and Duane Packer is written in the same type of loving and creative energy of the \\"Living with Joy\\" book.  This guide is a healing and unique to get if you are looking for something that contains a combination of ways to increase joy and a higher receptivity to good luck.to gain more power, clarity, and vision (pg. 110). 2) I serve others to the best of my ability in all I say and do (pg. 233).<br />Creating Money: Attracting Abundance by Sanaya Roman and Duane Packer is written in the same type of loving and creative energy of the \\"Living with Joy\\" book.

U should consider  [ scratch that out] u should buy Romeo Must Die!
B0000C8AVE|1.0|One of the reviewers stated that this was album was something that even non-Dylan fans would like.  Well, I know nothing about Bob Dylan, except that he is famous.  After listening to this album (I could only make it through the first two songs), I now know that it is in-famous, not famous.    Everyone has their own tastes, but I find it hard to understand how anyone could think that this person has talent.
0765365278|5.0|I finished \\"The Way of Kings\\" a few days ago, and I've been thinking of words that could describe this novel ever since. In many ways, \\"The Way of Kings\\" is a difficult book to describe. A thousand-page tome, the novel physically spans a continent, contains some four thousand years of history and mythology, is told from three main viewpoints (and a dozen minor ones), is decidedly nonlinear in format, and is the first novel of a prospective ten-book cycle. \\"The Way of Kings\\" is at times a war story, at times a religious text, and at times even Shakespearean in its tragedy.<br /><br />Taking all these factors into account, \\"The Way of Kings\\" can perhaps best be described as genre-defining. Its scope and Mr. Sanderson's writing abilities are comparable to George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" or to Robert Jordan's \\"The Wheel of Time,\\" both of which I've read. If anything, Mr. Sanderson's writing compares favorably to Mr. Jordan's--not only is Mr. Sanderson's world as detailed as that of Mr. Jordan's, his characters are considerably better-drawn, and his pacing is much much better. Additionally, Mr. Sanderson has a particular knack for twists. Numerous novels may claim to have unforeseeable twists and turns but this one actually delivers--there were two to three instances in which I literally had to set the book down and stare into space, attempting to digest the magnitude of the events that just transpired.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Way of Kings\\" is masterful storytelling and world-building, weaving the lives of its three protoganists--the slave-warrior Kaladin, the lord-prophet Dalinar, and the artist-thief Shallan--into an imaginative world thick with myth and legend. I realize that Mr. Sanderson will likely be penning the conclusion to \\"The Wheel of Time\\" before releasing the second novel of this series, but I, for one, am already eagerly awaiting the next installment.

055358894X|3.0|\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" (hereby to be shortened to \\"Locke Lamora\\") is a well-plotted novel that resembles an old-fashioned adventure tale. As other reviewers have undoubtedly stated, \\"Locke Lamora\\" is basically a medieval Oceans Eleven, with more dying. However, while I enjoined the twists and turns of the plot as well as the very well-developed backstory of the titular character, \\"Locke Lamora\\" is a novel that I was unable to finish. The reason? I really didn't care about Locke Lamora.    As a Robin Hood-style novel, the quality of this book is inextricably linked to the charisma of its main character. And unfortunately, Locke Lamora isn't sufficiently intelligent to be admired, sufficiently tragic to be pitied, or really even sufficiently human for me to care about. The author presents him as a sort of anti-hero, an unparalleled thief with a heart of gold, yet when the action ramps up, Locke Lamora becomes surprisingly beige. By the time I got three quarters of the way through the novel, I realized that I really didn't care what happened to Mr. Lamora--and that is a death sentence for this kind of novel.    It also does not help that the author spends quite a bit of time on world-building, yet this world-building never pays off. We see a fantastical world of alien artifacts, yet the reader is never able to understand this world--indeed, the world-building adds very little to the story of the novel.     In all, Mr. Lynch's novel has all the hallmarks of a great book, but for me at least, it was never very engaging.
1932073221|5.0|I found this book very simple and very educational. Upon doing the exercises I manifested stuff I desired and it was quite fun doing so. Anyways, this book is awesome. Buy it if you're interested in manifesting your desires :]. It will take some work, but work pays off.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie is amazing and I recommend it to everyone. I watched it with my family and we all loved it. The cast is perfect and the storytelling captures your attention from start to finish.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I had no intention of ever watching this series. It seemed to me like a Twilight-type show, only extended for hour upon hour. There's only so much teenage-angst and emo-drama I can stomach, so I had no plans to see it. And then, I got sick, and my sister grabbed the first season from the library with the intention of making me watch it. So, with protests and misgivings aplenty, I started watching.<br /><br />The first two discs or so confirmed what I believed the series would be...and then, something amazing happened. They dropped the emo-drama, and focused on actual story. And, instead of watching it because I had nothing better to do, I found that I really liked the series.<br /><br />To be fair, the first episodes necessarily had to be slower...we were \\"meeting\\" the characters and learning about their lives. That wasn't the problem. It was the predictable-and-oh-so-annoying back and forth of the main character, Elana, deciding she and her vampire boyfriend, Steffan, can't be together because he's a monster, then changing her mind only to find that he's decided they can't be together because he's a monster, before he changes his mind...etc., that was truly aggravating. Yes, I know it happens in the vampire stories, from True Blood to Twilight...but, for once, I'd like to see one where it didn't! That, and all the silly drama that went with it, was what I found really annoying about the first two or so discs. After that, though, the story really seemed to find its way, and became very enjoyable.<br /><br />The characters, especially after the first two discs, are really pretty likable - or, at least, understandable; the story is very interesting, and progresses (after the first two discs) at a good pace. The townspeople and history the series creates are very well done, and believable. You feel like you \\"know\\" Mystic Falls and its inhabitants after awhile.<br /><br />All in all, I give this 5/5 stars...because it redeemed itself from the emo-self-pity-party pattern that it had fallen into in such a superb way. Now, looking forward to season 2!uch a superb way. Now, looking forward to season 2!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|From James Cameron comes the epic and fantastic movie, Avatar. Opening in 2009 this movie won the award for \\"Best Visual Effects\\". This futuristic movie is based on the distant planet of Pandora. James Cameron has made many great movies, this one being one of them. His most famous movies are Terminator 1 & 2, Titanic, The Abyss and Avatar. Some of the famous actors from this movie are Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver (Alien movies).  By no means did this movie not live up to it potential.    Sam Worthington, who plays Jake Sully, falls in love with the beautiful Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). In this movie scientists and militants from earth come to Pandora, a moon which is orbiting the planet Polyphemus, in search of a very wealthy mineral called unobtanium. It funds the whole operation.    In the year 2154, a corporation known as the RDA Corporation mines on the planet Pandora for a valuable mineral known as unobtanium. Pandora is similar to earth. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) tries to become one of the Na'vi people. In the beginning he is only sabotaging the Na'vi people for his kind but soon he falls in love with the female Na'vi Neytiri. After not cooperating the RDA makes their move. Willingly the RDA Corp. tries to destroy the Na'vi's home and succeeds. The Na'vi retaliate. After a long strenuous fight the Na'vi win and send the earthlings home.    From this I think we can all understand that you should not try to fight on foreign territory and that any organism will fight till they die for what they love. Understandably you shouldn't antagonize anybody unless you're sure you can win. Really it's the same with humans as with the Na'vi because we both would fight for our homes.    In my opinion Avatar was the best, most fantastic movie I have ever seen. Granted other people say it sucks but nobody has a legitimate reason why. Some say they don't want to see blue cats run around for two and a half hours. That's definitely not a good reason to not likethe movie. Definitely did it have the best special effects and picture I have ever seen. Best movie ever.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's hard to add to what everyone else has said. I had to read the book because of all the attention it has gotten and because I was about to see the movie. I give Suzanne Collins a lot of credit for creating such an intricate and complicated world. Kudos to her incredible imagination. Very well written, too. I wasn't disappointed even with all the hype.

B004QMRHHW|5.0|To better explain my review it's important to note that I adore melodic death metal and symphonic black metal... to me absolute brutality and a haunting beauty mesh very well and Amon Amarth define those criteria better than anyone.    Johan Hegg certainly isn't the most talented vocalist but in my opinion he's the best in the industry at what he does... he'll never sing clean vocals but he sure as hell knows how to enunciate, every word can be clearly understood and given the subject matter (all of which Hegg writes) it's key to the whole experience.    As for the album itself, Surtur Rising definitely shows growth for the band and the production is top-notch.  Hard to pick favorites but Tock's Taunt/Loke's Treachery Part II, Slaves of Fear and Doom Over Dead Man really stand out for me.    So the bottom line... if you enjoy Amon Amarth you probably already own the album.  If you've never really heard of them but enjoy death metal in the vein of classic melodic bands such as In Flames, Arch Enemy or Dark Tranquillity you're seriously missing out.    And the best part... the album comes complete with a DVD concert video of their first four albums in their entirety.  I seriously had no idea \\"The Crusher\\" was that good... fantastic marketing idea seeing as the reason I can write this review is that I bought all the albums I was missing.

0374290024|5.0|This panoramic history is formidable reading about the comparative development of Western and Eastern civilizations. It catalogs significant archeological, scientific, and political events of 16,000 years of human history and several millennia in the life of the planet. Historian Ian Morris explains the forces that allowed Western civilization to overtake Eastern civilization and why this critical balance may now be tipping in favor of the East. This is high-quality academic scholarship: an interdisciplinary analysis, tying together esoteric facts and maps spanning geography, historical theories, paleontology, genetics, climatology, archeology and politics. Morris's book supports his detailed model comparing the development of Eastern and Western civilizations. His construct relies on recounting detailed history, analysis and comparisons. This can be challenging reading, albeit leavened by Morris's visible scholarship and entertaining style. You have to want to finish this book, but if you are a serious reader of history, getAbstract assures you that the effort has very substantial rewards - and if you are building up your ambitions, it also makes for fascinating skimming.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|Based on the upbringing and early reign of Queen Victoria and the courtship of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.    Beautifully done. There is not a mediocre actor or tepid scene in this whole movie. Just a marvel of film-making.    There are some complex political issues involved but I found this film lavishly, memorably romantic as well.    Blunt and Friend are FANTASTIC.     It's pretty perfect in my opinion though it could have / should have been longer.

Um, yeah, if you really want to read an exciting vampire series with action and erotica, check out the Midnight Breed Series by Lara Adrian. If you prefer a Twilight type of book with a long drawn out history lesson, then this is your book. I won't be reading the next novels by Deborah Harkness in this series!!
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|This book swept me into the grip of its story right away and managed to keep me spellbound until the end. Its unusual premise includes dark family secrets, lust and sexual perversion, love in many forms, a ghost, and a vivid cast of characters, including twins whose attachment defies psychological evaluation.<br /><br />Its protagonist Margaret Lea's love of reading and stories reflects the soul of all avid readers. She has been summoned by a famous author, Vida Winter, whose tangled stories are so fantastic as to defy truth, yet she wants Margaret to be her biographer and has vowed to tell her the truth. The narrative twists and turns and doubles back on itself, with the reader straining along with Margaret to figure out how on earth the famous storyteller's last story will end...and is it biography or pure fiction?
B004LAIU4I|5.0|According to Wikipedia, Paul Simon considers this \\"the best work I've done in 20 years.\\" To my mind, this may be among the best work anyone's done in 20 years.    \\"So Beautiful, or So What\\" is a stupendously rich album. Musically, the songs are rich - layered, various, endlessly inventive. Piece after  piece is filled with driving rhythms, counter rhythms and still more rhythms, plus gorgeous, tuney riffs suggesting a lot of different musical genres (including some of Simon's) - all mixed together, using different instruments and voices.You never quite know where he's going - a bluesy clarinet solo suddenly takes over, an unrelated major key jigs in, a light waltz appears.     For all of Simon's saying he wants to show the relevance of \\"old\\" music, the songs come off as new music: they almost seem a pastiche of the planet's songs and sounds, overheard and arranged, and played back from some kindly space-radio station. Clearly the songs are Paul Simon's: they sound personal, veering on intimate, and his voice is the loudest track. Indeed, if you hadn't heard Simon's music before, you might guess this came from a  folk singer with a lot of connections to musicians and a lot - a lot - of different music in his head. All of which still misses the power here. Listening in 2011 is like encountering Beethoven's Eroica in 1804: you just keep wondering what he's doing and being blown away.    The lyrics are rich, too - wry, tender, whimsical, joyous, worth reading by themselves. Some offer visions gathered in a narrative/chorus form (think Bob Dylan); some are narratives (\\"How did it all begin? Started with a bang\\") interrupted by a different story line (\\"I am driving along in my automobile - It's a brand new pre-owned '96 Ford\\").     The biggest surprise is the continual play of a religious imagination. The songs wade into Big Questions (what do our lives mean? Who/what is God? and what's the relationship? Does praying matter? What happens when we die?) and are unafraid toimagine answers - which do not, believe me, fit into any sort of systematic theology. In one song, for instance, his narrator sings to God, \\"Help me, help me, help me, help me, thank you, I`d no idea/ that you were there!\\" In another he pictures \\"The restless Lord\\" and \\"his only son\\" paying a visit (\\"a courtesy call\\") to earth, only to leave rapidly (\\". . .These people are slobs here. . . .It's sure to be a mob scene\\").     Simon's people continue to be likeable but not enlightened.  \\"Love and Blessings,\\" for instance, happily skewers us all for getting caught in a \\"good times\\" bubble before the recession - (There ain't no time like a good time, Charlie / Bo-bop-a-whoa, Ain't no times like the good times, Charlie, Bop-bop-a-whoa, whoa. . .\\":   Bop-bop-a-whoa           Bop-bop-a-whoa   Everywhere you look anywhere you go           Everybody working for the Bop-bop-a-whoa           Bop-bop-a-whoa           Bop-bop-a-whoa          Can't get enough of the Bop-bop-a-whoa. . . .  And  one of his characters - who's just died - even tries to start a little action with an attractive woman he sees (\\"How long you been dead?\\").      If you wanted to put together a message from the lyrics as a whole, you might get something like this. The sacred lasts (\\"Love is eternal, sacred light, free from the shackles of time\\") - unlike humans, who have limited time and understandings, especially about love (\\"ain't it strange the way we're ignorant, how we seek out bad advice. . . mistaking value for the price?\\"). So we are driven to ask Big Questions (\\"questions for the angels\\"), and we create less than lasting answers  (like a lover's declaration, \\"We'll build a wall that nothing can come through\\"). And yet, the songs assert, if humans cannot escape making myopic choices, we can still choose better or worse, we can learn, and our choices always matter (\\"I'm working on my rewrite\\"): \\"Life is what you make of it: so beautiful, or so what.\\"     You could also choose just to roll withthe marvelous music.    It's a moving and brilliant CD.
0307279189|4.0|This book was a wonderful and surprising pleasure -- I'm not runner, but this fascinating and compelling true life adventure will inspire runners to reach deeper in the sport and certainly will encourage non-runners to consider starting. It will make anyone think about the evolution of our bodies to be runners and makes a convincing case that running is exactly what we're made to do.<br /><br />In search of an answer to the question, \\"Why does my foot hurt?\\" Christopher McDougall embarks on an adventure to find a tribe of the world's greatest distance runners and learn the secrets to their remarkable achievements. His fascinating discoveries point to a total rethinking of everything we know about running.<br /><br />The reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico's deadly Copper Canyons are isolated by wild and treacherous terrain. For centuries they have cultivated practices that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while seeming to do it effortlessly.  The author and a motley collection of recluses and runners try to uncover the Tarahumara secrets to running, health, and tranquility.<br /><br />From Amazon's description: \\"With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.\\"<br /><br />This book inspires and edifies.
B000OPOAM0|2.0|Saw this 1984 film on Netflix.  I had never seen it before.  Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a cyborg from the future who is not human.  His mission is to kill a young woman (Linda Hamilton) because these creatures are going to take over the world but the son she will bear in the future will foil their plans.  However, Michael Biehn, who also comes from the future but is human is out to stop all this and save the world.<br /><br />What follows are a lot of chase scenes, guns, explosions and other predictable special effects that were available to 1984 audiences.  This fight doesn't seem fair at first because the cyborg is not human and can grow new body parts when necessary.  However there is no doubt how it will all turn out.<br /><br />The plot is simple, actually too simple for me.  Once I figured it out I fell asleep and awoke just once in a while to the sound of explosions.  I guess I'm just not into this kind of film.  But I'm glad I tried to watch it just to check it out.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|I watched a copy of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One\\" and found it a perfectly acceptible looking copy. There were a number of scenes I would have liked to see from the book which would have helped move the story along just as well as<br />leaving them out. The film did not look as dark as some other reviewers have claimed. I watched it on a regular television with a standard DVD-VHS player. If you have not read the book you may find the film more than a little confusing, many<br />changes were made in the screenplay that were not needed to put the story across; the special effects are as good as ever and the soundtrack is just as good as all the others in the series. Will probably get a copy of the DVD to add to my Potter DVD collection to have the full set, but do not feel that this is the best of the<br />series of films. Cannot wait to see the eighth and last film. Though I suspect it will have many changes from the book too. One last comment I feel that the Dursleys and the actors that portray them got the short end of the stick in this film. After all they were with Harry in the beginning and should have had a little more screen time at the end than they did.
0553386794|4.0|f you have been on the internet or have watched TV lately, you know that HBO has just made George R. R.

My boyfriend insisted that I read these books, and so I have just started the fourth book, after finishing the first book only a week ago.  Believe me, at first I did not want to start a 700 page book with all of the reading I want to get done.  Yet, as soon as I got a few chapters into the first book, I was hooked.<br /><br />If you have read The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss , then you are going to love this book.  It is so much more involved and intense than any other series I have read in the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre.  Each chapter tells the story of a different character, all in third person, so it is not at all difficult to follow.  If you love action, adventure, intrigue, romance, battle scenes, and political turmoil all mixed into a fantasy world, then this is the book for you.  I would caution that A Game of Thrones, and all of the books, are insanely graphic.  If you do not like vivid descriptions of gore and sex, I would not read this series.<br /><br />I think, though, that my favorite aspect of these books is that they feature strong female characters.  I have read too many fantasy books where there are no mail female protagonists, or if there are female characters, then they are damsels in distress with nothing better going for them than their looks.  Martin is able to create not only believable female characters of every age, but also strong women who are so extremely human in all of their actions.  Some might find these books depressing because there is so much death and destruction, but I think that they merely represent life.  There are no perfect happy endings, but that does not mean there is no joy in living.  I give this book a 4 out of 5.

0756405890|5.0|Before you judge this book by the cover, let me tell you how much I loved this book.  When I was a teenager, I was really into reading science fiction/fantasy of all types.  As I moved out of this phase, I was just disappointed with the sci-fi that was being released because so much of it was vampire/zombie strangeness.  The Name of the Wind has brought me back to true sci-fi.<br /><br />The writing style alone will make any sci-fi lover hooked within minutes.  I finished this book in about a week (it's a rather large tome), and I then handed it to my boyfriend.  I told him that he had to read it, and if he didn't love it then I would never trust his judgment in books again.  HE FINISHED IT IN TWO DAYS!  Kvothe is a dynamic character whom we follow from childhood into adulthood in a harsh medieval world.  Magic, or sympathy as it is called in the book, studies first under a friend and then heads to University to make his way in the world.  As Kvothe grows, he encounters the evil Chandrian and vows to find out more about them and the evil they perform.<br /><br />Rothfuss writes like a master storyteller in his first published book.  I hate too many comparisons of writers, but he really writes as if he knows the story he has to tell is an epic comparable to Tolkien or Lewis. Granted, I don't think anyone could surpass those authors, but Rothfuss comes very close.  Even for those of you who don't normally enjoy reading science fiction, I would say that you have to at least give this book a try.

After becoming friends again one incident rips them apart and the family worries it may never be fixed.  After reading the first book and watching the first movie, both of which I liked, I had higher expectations for this one.  My son loves these books and movies so it's a lot of fun to watch him laugh at the movie, almost more fun then the actual movie is.  Being that this is a kids movie I will make this one short.  Overall I thought the first one was better, but my kids liked this one a lot more. I give it a B, my kids give it an A+<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I saw it in theaters, then watched it again on DVD.

It took a little research on the net, but I found out how to change the COM port assignation from 7 to 1.  After that, it worked great.  I consider all that a minor glitch.

B000T06172|5.0|If you love The Beach Boys, this is a must have album, and you probably already own it.  If you like The Beach Boys, already own their Greatest Hits album but are looking for a little more definitive, Pet Sounds is a fantastic album to add to your collection.  It has a lot of music beyond the Greatest Hits, and all of it is pretty amazing stuff.  The sound is legendary, as are the stories of how this album impacted the music industry and John Lennon in particular.  It may take a couple of listens to really appreciate it, but this stuff is REALLY GOOD.  It definitely gives you an idea of what the group was capable of doing beyond their well known material.  Highly recommended!

0307588343|2.0|I'm very interested in economics and was hoping that this book could provide some insight into the collapse of Lehman Brothers. No such luck; this book is heavy on the personal anecdotes and light on analysis.  The first half of the book or so reads much like an autobiography. The author goes into the extreme things he did to try to become a trader at a major Wall Street firm. While this did help us to understand his emotions surrounding the collapse and perhaps make the Lehman Brothers collapse a little more &#34;human,&#34; it sometimes sounds like he's tooting his own horn. Some of it is almost pathetic - for example, he repeatedly brags about working 60 - 80 hour weeks but admits in passing that his first wife divorced him after less than a year because he was working so much. That's not a reason to brag - that's a reason to get psychiatric treatment.  Even after he finishes a lot of the autobiographical details, he spends a good deal of time talking worshipfully about his coworkers in his immediate department and their alleged brilliance (of course, HIS department had absolutely nothing to do with the firm's eventual bankruptcy; they saw it coming and tried their utmost to stop it but no one would listen to them until it was too late). He later goes on to demonize the CEO, COO, mortgage-backed securities department, risk management, and just about anyone else he can think to scapegoat - but especially the CEO, who he skewers as an incompetent, arrogant jerk who managed the company into a swamp. (He conveniently does not explain how Dick Fuld, the CEO at the time of the collapse, was able to successfully manage the company for 30 years prior to the collapse).  He then goes from tooting his own horn to tooting the horn of his immediate department, going to great lengths to describe how wonderfully competent his immediate colleagues were. He claims that they saw all of the problems coming all along and did everything in their power to save the company - and if only it weren't for the other people in the company they would've succeeded.  He offers little insight into how the company as a whole worked; instead, he serves up a very parochial view of the company that seemed to view the distressed bonds desk as the center of the company.  There is still some value to this book. As I mentioned, this book does a good job showing the &#34;human side&#34; to the Lehman Brothers collapse from the perspective of an insider. Just be aware that this book is much more focused on anecdotes and personal catharsis than on serious analysis.
0811879542|5.0|Herve Tullet's \\"Press Here\\" is a perfect marriage of concept and activity.  I purchased this \\"quiet\\" book for my grandchildren to use in church meetings.  What fun!  Far too interactive and entertaining for \\"quiet.\\"
B0013D8LOK|4.0|In 1979, Stephen Sondheim created the musical, Sweeney Todd, about a barber obsessed with revenge.  The play was a hit.  In 1982 a production was recorded starring Angela Lansburry and George Hern.  Twenty-eight years later, director Tim Burton moved the musical from the stage to the big screen.  But was the musical as good on the screen as it was on the stage?    Many people who watch this film will likely either have seen the play or be at least familiar with it, or heard about the script.  Thus, about the script I will simply say this.  The script by Stephen Sondheim is fantastic.  The story creates layer upon layer of Sweeney Todd.  However repulsive his actions may be, the audience cannot help but feel sorry for him in his predicament.  The songs are fun when they need to be and dramatic when they need to be and the mood of the songs flows perfectly.    Needless to say, Tim Burton did need to create some changes, mostly cuts, to the original script.  I believe this was related to the length the film was allowed to be.  Generally, I really don't like it when directors make changes.  However, I couldn't have been happier with what Tim Burton chose to change.  Of course, he did leave out most of the ensmble numbers (City on Fire and the Ballad of Sweeney Todd and its reprises) but I can see how it would be difficult if not impossible to successfully work that into the film.  But other than that, the changes were actually pretty good.  For one thing, he significantly cut down the role of Johanna, a character who, while I understand is necessary, I completely detest.  Yes, this means that those little snippet scenes with Johanna singing to Anthony \\"kiss me\\" are gone, to my great relief.  I absolutely HATED those scenes and found them annoying, boring, intrusive, and unnecessary.  I was so happy that he chose to keep those out of the film.  Another change that he made that I really liked was his cutting down the role of the beggar woman.  I just found her annoying.One interesting change that Tim Burton made to the script that involved replacing a scene rather than cutting a scene out would be replacing the scene where the Beadle kills the bird as Anthony admires Johanna for the first time.  Instead of this little conversation, the judge invites Anthony into his home politely, then accuses  Anthony of \\"gandering\\" at Johanna, then has the Beadle throw tim out (literally) and beat him.  I thought this scene was an improvement over the scene it replaced in that it really conveyed the hyppocritical, sinister nature of the judge.  Out of all the changes Tim Burton made, I think the only one I didn't like was the removal of the scene where Todd teaches Anthony how to pretend to be a wigmaker and the different colors of hair.  However, this scene in the play was quite short so its removal from the film was of little consequence.    The cast of the film is outstanding.  Johnny Depp has an incredible and haunting voice.  Combine that with the amazingh costume and makeup and the fact that it is Johnny Depp after all, and you have an amazing Sweeney Todd (the character, not the film).  The entire cast has excellent voices.  I was so happy that they chose someone for the part of Johanna who did not have an extremely annoying voice, as was the case in the 1982 recording.      The sets in this film are of Tim Burton's classic style that makes them seem so surreal and so fantastc, so not real, yet at the same time they have an odd sense of realism to them.      All in all, a fantastic film done by the classic team of Buron, Carter, and Depp.  Whether a musical fan, Johnny Depp fan, or a horror fan, this film is sure to make you want to attend the tale of Sweeney Todd again and again.
0596009208|4.0|This book was pretty good. My only complaint was that it was a bit wacky. When I say wacky I mean that the anicdotes kind of clouded what the writer was trying to say. With that being said, there were some great examples. But there was often a lot of unneeded dialogue.<br />Still, a good book.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Whether you are new to \\"Le Miz,\\" or have been a fan of the musical from its first production, this marvelous concert version is sure to bring goosebumps.<br /><br />Staged at the massive O2 entertainment complex in London, this 25th anniversary production manages to feel both intimate and epic, thanks largely to the well-placed camera locations and the magnificent sound design. And in the high definition BluRay format, the video and audio superbly renders this remarkable production. Since this isn't a staging of the actual play, but is instead a concert version, it might be helpful to know the basic plot points in advance, since certain of them are only hinted at. However, even without this background, the story is clear, as compelling as Victor Hugo intended it to be, and, for the most part, the vocal performances are flawless (sorry, Mr. Jonas, but you're just out of your depth here).<br /><br />My advice: buy this BluRay. It bears repeat viewings (we have watched it three times already, and it only gets better with successive viewings). Crank up your 5.1 home theater system, turn down the lights, and prepare to be moved by a rousing production that is spectacular in the truest sense of the word. This is the next best thing to having had a ticket to the actual live show. You will not be sorry.
B0050VJ29Y|5.0|This album came up in my recommended items on Amazon and while I did not recognize the composers I did some research on them and I do know who Norah Jones and Jack White are (Jack White being one of my favorite musicians) and found that these composers worked with some of my favorite artists. I then went on to listen to the CD and loved what I heard from the preview clips. My mother was behind me and said it reminded her of the spaghetti western music she used to enjoy in old western movies and sure enough Daniele Luppi was inspired by that sound and incorporated it into the album. All in all it's a great album and I haven't found a track on it that I didn't like.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|In this book, John Locke details the specific, nitty-gritty details about how he became the eighth author overall, and the FIRST self published author, to join the Kindle Million club whose members include James Patterson, Nora Roberts, and Stieg Larsson among others.<br /><br />Locke includes many reasons why self publishing is good for an author, allowing him/her to compete on the same level as the traditionally published author.  This will, of course, raise the hackles of those in the business of traditionally publishing authors (i.e. selling paper) who I'm sure will do their best to denigrate Locke and this book as hogwash.  They will warn their dwindling stable of authors to stay away from the 'dangerous' words in this book and that would be a shame.<br /><br />It would be a shame because most of this book is devoted to laying out and explaining Locke's self-created (and sometimes counter-intuitive), step by step marketing plan.  And unless an author is already in that Kindle million club with Locke, they will most likely be responsible for their own marketing, traditionally published authors included.  This book can help those authors languishing at publishing houses whose books have been priced at or above $9.99, hampering their sales potential from the beginning. These are the authors who literally need all of the help they can get given the obstacles they face being traditionally published.  And they can find a huge chunk of that help in this little book.  Will they reach John Locke's level of success without being self published? Probably not.  But every sale counts in any business and writers are in business whether they know it or not.<br /><br />You don't have to be a fan of Donovan Creed or John Locke for this system to make sense and work for you.  But fans will get something extra from this since Locke goes into some detail about the creation of Donovan Creed and how that character fits into Locke's business plan.<br /><br />One of the most compelling aspects of this book (besides the clear, actionable steps inside) is the price.  Locke has generously given up all of his secrets for only $5 bucks.  A better bargain for writers could not be found.<br /><br />In sum, if you are in the business of putting words together on digital paper and then getting people to pay money for those words, you need to buy this book.besides the clear, actionable steps inside) is the price.

0670022411|3.0|*** CAUTION... SOME SPOILERS****<br /><br />\\"A Discovery of Witches\\" ... the title alone sounds enticing.<br />Personally, I was just interested in the \\"witch\\" part. After having read just about every imaginable  paranormal entity there is, a witch sounded new and a refreshing break from the usual vampire and werewolf characters that are currently over populating some of Young Adult and Fantasy bookstore shelves.<br /><br />The premise is a good one, and if you are reading this review chances are that you know the basic plot, so I won't go into too much detail.  The main characters are: Diana, a reluctant Witch, (whose family lineage  goes as far back as Salem's Bridget Bishop), and who has chosen instead the field of History as a career, opting out of ever using her gifts and powers, after the brutal death of both her parents. And then there is Matthew de Clermont, a roughly 1500 year old vampire (and you thought Edward was old), who has dedicated his life (eternity?) to science and Ashmole 782, an Alchemy manuscript that holds the answer to the creation of all creatures (vamps, daemons, witches), how they are interconnected and it's possible relation to Diana and Matthew (which we later find out).<br /><br />Sounds promising, no?! I thought so too.<br /><br />A quarter into it, I was merely trudging along. Other than the brief moment of excitement at the very beginning of chapter one, when Diana encounters Ashmole 782, nothing was really keeping my interest.<br /><br />For the most part, the beginning of \\"Witches\\" focuses on Diana and her work, even after Matthew appears in the picture. I must admit I became tired of the usual monotony of her everyday life. Getting up, going for a run or rowing, showering, eggs for breakfast, dressing in boring black clothing and leggings, complaining about that pesky piece of hair that NEVER seemed to stay put behind her ear! And then of course, there was the never ending mental commentary on Oxford, the library, the grounds, the school, how it looks and how foggy it is, and not to mention the unnecessarily long detail of her research, compiled with her inner musings and turmoil over why she chose History and it's infallibleness and why the same cannot be said of magic, and so on and yadda yadda...<br /><br />Matthew (the vamp) is drawn to Diana because she has accessed his precious manuscript, and begins to -what i'd call- stalk her. After getting to know one another and of course having dinner together to seal the deal, they become an undeclared item of sorts. The chemistry between Diana and Matthew is not at all that overt. They are very civil, almost professional with each other, making it hard to decipher if there is anything more here. As the reader, you know that of course there will be, but it's not entirely FELT... well, I didn't, anyway.<br /><br />Diana begins to receive threats from fellow witches and vamps. Not only do they want the information on Ashmole 782, but they're also after her because of her association with Matthew.  Apparently vamps and witches are not to mix, who knew!?! Also, Diana is apparently this all powerful Witch (she is a Bishop after all) and the \\"creatures\\"  also want to find out JUST how powerful she is. Kind of hard to do, since she's omitted from magic for most of her life and has no idea herself of what she is capable of.  Matthew and Diana abruptly fly off to Sept-Tours, a castle he himself built way back when, where we meet Ysabeau (his mother) and Marthe (grandmother?!)<br /><br />The thought of Paris excited me, figuring this time the pace would definitely pick up. There was a change in location, and the plot had changed, albeit leaving me confused of what exactly they were running away from, and what exactly would make their new destination any safer, but it was a start.<br /><br />Alas, I was not to be.<br /><br />Once in Sept-Tours, we get to meet the family (I enjoyed Ysabeau quite a bit) and we also get to see what powers Diana really wields.We find out what she is capable of, rather abruptly, through a series of paragraphs in which we are TOLD she can fly, have visions, mentally speak to the horses in the stable, etc. I did not like how this was executed at all. It appeared as mere extra information that was spewed about, and as I've said, the reader was TOLD of these \\"powers,\\" rather than maybe having a progression of hints earlier in the story indicating the possibility of Diana possessing such abilities.<br /><br />Life with the family in Paris rolls on smoothly. Matthew and Diana get closer, but never really move past the usual casualness in which they did back at Oxford. They ride horses together, they eat/drink, congregate with the family, and yes, do more work in which we find out Matthew has met all of the greats from the past. Shakespeare, Newton, Machiavelli?! Matthew's met them all. This man sure gets around. I suppose that's the luxury of having time on your side.<br /><br />After a confrontation with Domenico (another vamp threatening the duo, Matthew goes on to explain the Congregation (a group of 3 vamps, 3 daemons and 3 witches) what their \\"rules\\"are and why he and Diana cannot be together and intermix. He understand he must \\"let go\\" of Diana, for her protection and so that the Congregation does not come after her. At this point Diana professes her \\"love\\" for Matthew by literally breaking down in tears.<br /><br />This was really an unwarranted declaration of love, and really put me at odds as to how i felt about Diana. At the start of the story, she appears as this independent, strong - at times even stubborn - individual, only to have her completely back-track on who she is because of her VERY recent association with Matthew. The move seems out of character and had me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />Matthew refutes her declaration saying she \\"cannot\\" love him, and after a phone call runs off to Oxford (alone) after someone has broken into the lab at which he works. Diana is left in tears, and stays behind for two days learning about Matthew's past and how to hunt, thanks to Ysabeau. When he finally returns a couple of days later, he decides he too loves her, and declares his affection for her, in turn binding them to each other. In other words, Matthew will be overtly protective of Diana and will now possess her, a woman who was once strong and independent.<br /><br />After this the \\"honeymoon\\" period begins in which Diana and Matthew get to KNOW each other fully, but never quite consummating their relationship. After one of the nights in which the two find out about each other's nooks and crannies, Diana gets out of bed for a sunrise stroll, even though Matthew has expressed the heightened sense of danger awaiting them now that they are officially a couple, and for her to stay within the castle's walls for her protection.<br /><br />When she ventures off a witch by the name of Satu takes her, (her mode of transport is flight) and while torturing the \\"magic\\" OUT of Diana, Satu poisons her mind into questioning Matthew, his past and current motivations with Diana, as well as confirming that Diana's parents were indeed killed by fellow witches. After unthinkable torture, she's placed in a vastly deep tunnel, (what i'd describe as a well) and after a few hallucinations/visions of her father/mother and some other ghosts, she is rescued by Matthew and his brother Baldwin (who seemed FAR more interesting than Matthew).<br /><br />After highly detail ministrations of essentially bringing her back to life and healing her, the trio head to an airport, where Baldwin sees Diana and Matthew off to New York to stay with Diana's aunts (Sarah and Emily) thinking they'd be safer there. Before leaving, Matthew declares Diana as a responsibility of the Knights of Lazarus (and old organization whose aim is to \\"protect those who are helpless\\").<br /><br />When they get to Madison, NY we get to know Sarah, Emily, the house (which is an entity on its own and ALIVE) andall the ghosts that inhabit the place. Emily and Sarah are two of my favorite characters in this book (other than Hamish). They offer great relief from the plot tensions and the lack-luster relationship between the main characters. A string of people appear at the house, starting with Miriam and Marcus (Matthew's assistant and son, respectively) and later on a daemon/witch couple about to bear a child, as well as Hamish, come comes along to deal with the \\"legal\\" terms of Matthew's and Diana's plans.<br /><br />During their stay in NY the \\"house\\" releases a letter from Diana's mother detailing how Diana has been spellbound since she was a child to protect her from other witches due to her great powers. The house also releases a page from the Ashmole 782 manuscript, which basically reveals that all \\"creatures\\" can in fact procreate. Somehow the picture in the manuscript page depicts Diana and Matthew and the possibility that they will reproduce?! (Ugh, not another vamp and human having babies!)<br /><br />During their stay in New York, a vamp (Camille, i believe was her name) is sent to collect Diana and in the process gives Matthew tear/hole on his heart before she is quickly finished off by Diana via \\"witchfire\\" (another of her powers). Matthew being on the brink of death, Diana offers him her blood and makes a pact with the Crone (the triple Goddess) to save Matthew's life. Matthew's life is of course recuperated, and Diana's lies in the balance. After many blood transfusions, she's back to her old self, and the group realizes that the Matthew and Diana are not safe anywhere.<br /><br />Because of this, they begin to discuss Timewalking (essentially time travel) which was a power that Diana's father possessed. They realize Diana is also able to access this ability, which according to her aunts she has been doing it since childhood. Diana and Matthew gather the necessary items to direct them to the correct time period they plan to Timewalk to. Once in the past they plan to get a hold of Ashmole 782 and learn of its contents.<br /><br />After many a practice of Timewalking, Diana and Matthew decide that the two of them will Timewalk on all Hallow's Eve. Everyone else involved will scurry and hide from the congregation in the meantime. After distributing some candy to trick-o-treaters, Matthew and Diana do the deed. That is, they Timewalk, and to the reader it appears that their endeavor succeeds.<br /><br />The ending is primed for a sequel, and i must say i'm more excited for the time period in which they will find themselves (Elizabethan).<br /><br />I did enjoy this book in fractions. There were moments i didn't think i'd finish, and overall it's a well written story, although, if you asked me for the spot in which the story hits the climax, i would not know what to tell you. There seemed to be a succession of events, some low and some high, but nothing really definitive as the ultimate turning point. I suppose this is the trouble with many series. Sometimes the author is so dead-set in making the story a series that each individual book does not stand alone.<br /><br />Also, although i did enjoy some of the historical plot points in the story, i was at times lost with all the names dropped, and their works. I was especially confused with the more scientific points of the story. They did not detract from the story, but perhaps they could have been slightly dumbed down, just in case the reader was not as educated in science as the writer!? I guess this means i'm dim-witted, lol Also, all of this scientific/historic talk didn't add much to the overall plot (if you are to contend the book's entire story), and it may have hindered the mystical attributes to the story. For me, even though the world of Matthew and Diana were interesting enough, they still felt too dripped with reality for me to feel any magic within it. It just seemed to be our world and oh yes, these \\"creatures\\" just happen to be a part of it as well.<br /><br />I have mentioned before that a lot of the story was rather told to reader instead of shown, as for example Diana's powers. Also, Ms. Harkness' writing is not terrible, but at times felt choppy, and not very prosaic.<br /><br />As i've said, the main characters were rather bland, but i enjoyed most of the supporting cast. I feel they will also play bigger roles in the books to come (this will apparently be a trilogy) and for the supporting cast alone i will be picking up the follow-up books.amish). They offer great relief from the plot tensions and the lack-luster relationship between the main characters. A string of people appear at the house, starting with Miriam and Marcus (Matthew's assistant and son, respectively) and later on a daemon/witch couple about to bear a child, as well as Hamish, come comes along to deal with the \\"legal\\" terms of Matthew's and Diana's plans.     During their stay in NY the \\"house\\" releases a letter from Diana's mother detailing how Diana has been spellbound since she was a child to protect her from other witches due to her great powers. The house also releases a page from the Ashmole 782 manuscript, which basically reveals that all \\"creatures\\" can in fact procreate. Somehow the picture in the manuscript page depicts Diana and Matthew and the possibility that they will reproduce?! (Ugh, not another vamp and human having babies!)     During their stay in New York, a vamp (Camille, i believe was her name) is sent to collect Diana and in the process gives Matthew tear/hole on his heart before she is quickly finished off by Diana via \\"witchfire\\" (another of her powers). Matthew being on the brink of death, Diana offers him her blood and makes a pact with the Crone (the triple Goddess) to save Matthew's life. Matthew's life is of course recuperated, and Diana's lies in the balance. After many blood transfusions, she's back to her old self, and the group realizes that the Matthew and Diana are not safe anywhere.     Because of this, they begin to discuss Timewalking (essentially time travel) which was a power that Diana's father possessed. They realize Diana is also able to access this ability, which according to her aunts she has been doing it since childhood. Diana and Matthew gather the necessary items to direct them to the correct time period they plan to Timewalk to. Once in the past they plan to get a hold of Ashmole 782 and learn of its contents.     After many a practice of Timewalking, Diana and Matthew decide that thetwo of them will Timewalk on all Hallow's Eve. Everyone else involved will scurry and hide from the congregation in the meantime. After distributing some candy to trick-o-treaters, Matthew and Diana do the deed. That is, they Timewalk, and to the reader it appears that their endeavor succeeds.     The ending is primed for a sequel, and i must say i'm more excited for the time period in which they will find themselves (Elizabethan).     I did enjoy this book in fractions. There were moments i didn't think i'd finish, and overall it's a well written story, although, if you asked me for the spot in which the story hits the climax, i would not know what to tell you. There seemed to be a succession of events, some low and some high, but nothing really definitive as the ultimate turning point. I suppose this is the trouble with many series. Sometimes the author is so dead-set in making the story a series that each individual book does not stand alone.     Also, although i did enjoy some of the historical plot points in the story, i was at times lost with all the names dropped, and their works. I was especially confused with the more scientific points of the story. They did not detract from the story, but perhaps they could have been slightly dumbed down, just in case the reader was not as educated in science as the writer!? I guess this means i'm dim-witted, lol Also, all of this scientific/historic talk didn't add much to the overall plot (if you are to contend the book's entire story), and it may have hindered the mystical attributes to the story.

1441870008|4.0|\\"The young-Irish-lad façade does not stand me in good stead when I'm trying to appear scholarly at my place of business -- I run an occult bookshop with an apothecary's counter squeezed in the corner -- but it has one outstanding advantage. When I go to the grocery store, for example, and people see my curly red hair, fair skin, and long goatee, they suspect that I play soccer and drink lots of Guinness. If I'm going sleeveless and they see the tattoos all up and down my right arm, they assume I'm in a rock band and smoke lots of weed. It never enters their mind for a moment that I could be an ancient Druid -- and that's the main reason why I like this look. If I grew a white beard and got myself a pointy hat, oozed dignity and sagacity and glowed with beatitude, people might start to get the wrong -- or the right -- idea.\\"    Atticus O'Sullivan is a 2100-year-old Druid. He's been lying low for a while, running his occult bookshop in Arizona and romping with his Irish wolfhound, Oberon. Back in the distant past, though, he absconded with a sword that the god Aenghus Og wants for his own. Now Aenghus has found him and is sending his goons to take the sword back.    Atticus is a fun character. He's a mixture of old and new, wise and youthful. His slang is a blend of the ancient and the current. At times you can sense the years weighing on him, and he has a certain degree of paranoia that explains how he's survived the millennia. At other times he seems closer to the age he appears, especially when it comes to his weakness for pretty women. Perhaps most importantly, he's witty, which makes him a great character to spend a book with. His narrative voice is often hilarious. Oberon is a delight, too; he may be smarter than the average dog, but he's utterly undone by sausages, belly rubs, and attractive French poodles.    The Irish-mythology aspect is very well done. Kevin Hearne has done his homework, and these aspects of the story feel perfectly rooted in the myths themselves. For example, when Atticus reveals the secret of his longevity, I think I actually said \\"OH!\\" aloud. It makes impeccable mythic sense.    The plot of _Hounded_ is pretty straightforward, and the book is not very long. It does serve, though, to introduce Atticus, his world and its rules, and the major players, and it moves Atticus into a position where he'll have plenty of chances to find more trouble (and more story hooks) as the Iron Druid series continues.    I listened to Brilliance Audio's production of _Hounded_, read by Luke Daniels. Daniels has a pleasant, unobtrusive voice that carries the listener easily through the story. His narration as Atticus has just the right tone of deadpan humor, and his voices for the other characters are distinctive in their accents and mannerisms without sounding like caricatures of themselves. I recommend both _Hounded_ and Brilliance Audio's production of it.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I loved this mini-series when it was broadcast.  This review is of the DVD set, not the series.  WHY do I need to be forced to watch a 5-minute HBO commecial (can't skip to menu, can't speed through) at the start of a DVD that I have purchased?    The box set is minimal.  The metal box is made of tin-foil thin metal that does less to protect the DVDs than cardboard.
B000FBFN1U|2.0|Fie on the editors for how they handle the maps. While I was not surprised that I couldn't read the maps on my kindle, I though on my computer Kindle program I would be able to -- and I should be able to! But instead they have them in there so small and at such a low resolution that they are worthless! I can zoom on my phone but again, so such a low resolution that they become fuzzy before they become readable -- the \\"look inside\\" preview pages are much better than the maps once you have bought the kindle version. A definite downside to the kindle books -- and unnecessary given the accompanying computer and phone programs for these books.
B001TH16DI|4.0|This is my first Blue-Ray experience. I just bought a Blue-Ray player so of course I had to start with Star Trek. I've owned multiple versions of these films and the picture quality of these DVDs is far superior. That's obviously most important. However, I was dissapointed these discs didn't include the extended editions of the films. In some stories, like The Wrath of Kahn, you miss an important piece of the back story. I also thought the DVD collection was weak on bonus features. Obviously there is the Bonus Captain's Summit, but as for the actual movies, nothing we haven't seen before, and not much there.<br /><br />Overall classic stories and great picture quality. If having the extras or extended cuts is a big deal, you may need to look at other editions. If picture is key,you can't beat this set.
B004YSDU9C|4.0|The show was entertaining and a lot of fun to watch. However, since I live in the southwestern United States, it really bothers me that the description of this show is so far off, because it puts the setting in Death Valley.<br /><br />The facts are: Death Valley is in California. Monument Valley is in Utah, on Navajo land in the four corners area. Whoever wrote the description of this Dr Who show is ignorant of geography and was obviously rushed to get the review completed. Still just under 60 seconds of Google search can really help you get your facts straight.<br /><br />Rest assured, the show was done in Monument Valley, Utah. This means it is not even close to California, and not close to Death Valley at all. The description was not the fault of the producers of this show, and it is a lot of fun, even if it made you dumber to watch it.

0553805371|5.0|Science can be truly beautiful, and every once in a while there's a science book that's beautiful too. Stephen Hawking's popular science books usually fall into that category, with gorgeous illustrations, in pictures and words, highlighting the wonders and mysteries of our world.<br /><br />The Grand Design reminds readers of those four pre-requisites of good scientific theory--it should be elegant, it should rely on as few unproven assumptions as possible, it should agree with and explain all existing observations, and it should make predictions about future observations that can prove or disprove the theory. The theory of gravity, for example, moves forward from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein as different experiments yield new results.<br /><br />The text is easy to read and complex concepts are nicely balanced with wryly humorous asides. Repetition of the authors' point of view that God is not \\"necessary\\" to explain the world might offend some religious readers, but the authors also point out that none of their explanations is \\"necessary,\\" and all the models we use to explain reality depend in the end on our own point of view. The fish in a spherical bowl doesn't see straight lines as we do and might explain life very differently, but if the model works the fish will be happy.<br /><br />I enjoyed learning about two very different scientific views--the deterministic science of initial conditions and well-defined results, and the probabilistic approach that's needed for wave-particle theories and the Grand Design. At last I know where \\"eleven dimensions\\" comes from, and at last I have a clearer view of how waves can be particles--there's a great illustration of soccer balls being kicked at a two-slitted screen.<br /><br />Free-will, psychology and stellar evolution all take their place in a thoroughly fascinating read. I still believe in God and attribute the final (and grandest) design to Him, but I really enjoyed this journey through the wonders of modern science.<br /><br />Disclosure: I got this book for Christmas--only took half a year to get around to reading it.is book for Christmas--only took half a year to get around to reading it.

B001NHNG64|5.0|If you are new to the series Jack Reacher is a former Army MP, part Rambo and part Columbo, who wants nothing more than to travel around the country. Through plausible plot setups, Reacher finds himself in a position to help someone.    This book had everything you expect from a Reacher novel, butt kicking (and a lot), investigation, great writing and a great bad guy.  The way Lee Child creates the character of the antagonist is great. The book shows you very early on that the \\"bad guy\\" is very terrifying and will stop at nothing; as the book and plot unravel you start to understand why.    A great book in the series as well as a really good book to stand alone outside the series.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />- Quality is top notch.<br /><br />- Bag is extremely roomy. With the laptop area separated from the main storage compartment there is room for either your lunch, or if you're traveling a set of shoes and clothes.<br /><br />- Protective area for eye classes is a good idea.<br /><br />- chest strap secures bag so you can run through the airport or chase after a train.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- There is a large slot that you use to stow odd items like a newspaper, a jacket etc. Unfortunately this slot is not sealable with a zipper and so if you are walking in the rain and your umbrella does not extend far back enough, you will find water filling that slot with no place to go since there is no drainage hole on the bottom.<br /><br />-I would have liked to see the side pouches zippered so I can use them to stick in an umbrella or spare change when I have to rush through airport security.

0811875040|4.0|I got the book the day it came out and I was delighted by the petite cakes, tarts, and cookie recipes in this book.  It's just me and my husband and regular cake recipes are too big for us to finish, but 6\\" cakes are perfect to each over a couple of nights.  I can't wait to actually make something out of this book, but I'm waiting to get a 6\\" x 3\\" cake pan and some smaller loaf pans before I try anything.<br /><br />That being said, the recipes (at least the cookies) need some serious editing.  For the lemon cookies, they have the ounces of flour for 2C as 8oz, for the walnut cookies, it's 1 3/4C flour or 9oz (more than for 2C?) but for the gingersnaps, 2C of flour is 10oz.  Very odd considering how otherwise well put together the book is.<br /><br />Also,  the lemon shortbread recipe has you roll to a 6x4\\" rectangle and cut into 1\\" squares - and it says it makes 48 cookies.  The walnut shortbread recipe has you roll to a 6x7\\" rectangle and cut into 1\\" squares and it says it makes 48 as well.  However... the math for neither one is right.  6x4\\" should equal only 24 squares and 6x7\\" should equal 42 squares.  So something is definitely off here.<br /><br />I should note I haven't made any of these recipes, so perhaps the cup measurements will work out, but that still doesn't explain the glaring errors in ounces as well as the miscount for how many cookies each recipe is supposed to make.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|I like mysteries, thrillers. At three different times I thought I had \\"the Snowman\\" all figured out; only to be wrong. So, I kept reading..and reading.. The REAL Snowman was revealed towards the end of the book, but then began the cliff-hanger hide and seek ending. I initially started the book, set it down, picked it up when convenient. About 2/3 thru I was enthralled, and didn't put it down until the last word. The Author writes in a flowing read. I was happy I purchased this book!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I actually enjoy the game while it works on my Viewsonic G Tablet with VEGAn-tab 5.1.  Unfortunately, it freezes somewhere between 5-15 minutes.  I have to force close the app and keep trying.  It's especially irritating when I'm close to finishing a level because I need to start that level over.  Sometimes it gets so bad I need to just put it down for a day so I don't throw it.    But, I do enjoy the game.  I hope a fix comes out that will allow me to play this on my tablet.  I will gladly waste many hours beating the game.

Another interesting read is the chapter \\"How I spent more than $25,000 discovering what didn't work, and why\\".

1603420398|4.0|I know this book is fairly clear, and I think if I stare at it long enough I'll be able to get it, but how I wish for a book like this with diagrams I can read.  Actually, not merely diagrams, but pictures of a stitch being executed from start to finish without shorthand.  An index like that would be great.  Seriously, crochet is elaborate enough without a learning disability thrown into the mix.    That said, I'd recommend this book.  It is easy to read, though every once in awhile the descriptions could be better.  The variety of patterns is what drew me to this book in the first place and in that I was not disappointed.  I'm not a beginner, but I am self taught and don't know the names of many of the stitches I do, and that's where an index would be nice.  I like to do things on my own and have a reference work or two for ideas.  Once I get this thing dissected and sorted out mentally, I can tell it will work for my purposes.
0312370849|4.0|I found this book very thought provoking.  I enjoyed the character development and the entanglement of present and past.

0553386794|5.0|For many years, I held off starting this series because of the negative reviews and complaints.  But after enough friends compared the series to The Wire in terms of scope and complexity, I realized that I had to give it a shot.  Now I believe that this series represents one of the masterworks in the fantasy genre.  There is nothing I can add to the positive reviews but I would like to address the negative reviews.  If you look closely you will realize there are very few bad reviews, ONLY BAD REVIEWERS!!!  The vast majority of negative reviews can be broken down into a few groups:<br /><br />BAD REVIEWERS GROUP ONE: Children (emotionally or mentally).<br />I stopped reading fantasy books in my early twenties because they are, by and large, childish and simplistic.  Some reviewers complain that they don't like the characters or can not identify with the characters Mr. Martin has created.  I can only assume that these people want HEROES and VILLAINS.  To those reviewers I say - stick with Disney films.  The characters created by Mr. Martin are complex and ambiguous.  In fact, many of the characters I hated in the first book, I found myself rooting for by the third book.<br /><br />BAD REVIEWERS GROUP TWO: Impatient amusement park riders.<br />I will be the first to admit that it is hard to wait to find out what happens next.  But people who want Mr Martin to \\"finish the series\\" seem to be operating under the faulty assumption that this series will end in some glorious conclusion that ties everything together.  I have no such expectation.  This is not Lord of the Rings.  Good will not eternally triumph over evil and justice will not be granted for everyone.  If that is what you are looking for, then you are craven and should return to your childish fairy-tales!<br /><br />BAD REVIEWERS GROUP THREE: The Choose your own adventurers.<br />By books three and four you will notice more and more reviewers complaining about which characters Mr. Martin focuses on.  Rarely, if ever, do they complain about the quality of the prose or the rich detail of this world Martin has created.  Usually their reviews can be boiled down to - \\"I want to know what happens to so and so right now!\\"  They also like to complain that some chapters are just filler that do not relate to the story.  It seems to me that this complaint is premature until the series is complete.  Minor characters in the first book are major characters in the third book and some characters disappear in the first book only to pop up again in the third.  With this in mind I will assume that these filler characters or the information revealed in their chapters is relevant to later parts of the story.  If you like a chef, you will be excited to eat whatever he dishes up.  Not all of the meals will be to your taste but what you enjoy is the chef's creativity and boldness, not a specific flavor.  This group of bad reviewers loved the first meal dished out and now they want everything to taste the same - To them I say - stick with Taco Bell!  That way you always know what you are getting.<br /><br />BAD REVIEWERS GROUP FOUR:  The Kindle reviews.<br />Reviews regarding kindle formatting have no place amidst the book reviews.  And some of these people complain that the kindle version should never cost more than the paperback version.  I would argue that having all of the books in a slender little device is an added bonus that is worth something in-and-of-itself.  Just imagine trying to travel with all five books!<br /><br />If you have the patience and maturity to go on this journey then I urge you to do so.  Leave your expectations at the door and let the story unfold as it will.  If you are going to read a story that is thousands of pages long, I would hope you are there for the journey, not the destination.  For the rest of you, enjoy your Disney/taco bell/fairy-tales.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Martin for creating such a rich and surprising world.  I am along for the ride, wherever it leads, and for however long it lasts!
B004R2HGMC|3.0|Admittedly, Super Trouper has always been my least favorite ABBA album, being too much in the adult-contemporary vein or something like that.  Anyhoo, I still eagerly anticipated the release of this Deluxe Edition, as I've purchased all of the others to this point, and they have been fantastic.  Mind you I'm not knocking content on the Super Trouper release AT ALL.  I think the CD remastering is fine, and the DVD has some very good material on it (although there could've been more, but there can ALWAYS be more); no, the problem here is the bad packaging.  The \\"Deluxe Edition\\" sticker runs over both sides and you must remove it in order to open the gatefold.  When you remove the sticker, the glue residue remains.  Also, the booklet insert (or at least mine) appears to have gotten absolutely crammed into the slip-cover, and therefore the first several pages are bent and folded, which is unnacceptable.  Both CD and DVD had visible fingerprints and small, inconsequential but still visible scratches from the manufacturer.  None of this affects content or playback, but when you're expecting a \\"deluxe\\" edition...?  Makes this something of a disappointment, considering the previous three releases have been basically pristine and of very high quality.

I would argue that having all of the books in a slender little device is an added bonus that is worth something in-and-of-itself.  Just imagine trying to travel with all five books!    If you have the patience and maturity to go on this journey then I urge you to do so.  Leave your expectations at the door and let the story unfold as it will.  If you are going to read a story that is thousands of pages long, I would hope you are there for the journey, not the destination.  For the rest of you, enjoy your Disney/taco bell/fairy-tales.    Thank you, Mr. Martin for creating such a rich and surprising world.  I am along for the ride, wherever it leads, and for however long it lasts!
B002VKE1K2|1.0|**Cracking knuckles**<br /><br />The scariest, most terrifying experience you could possibly have in the theaters?? Hmm, I digress.<br />I seem to remember writing a review for Cloverfield back in 2008. Oh wait, I also wrote a column for that Blair Witch Project travesty also in 1999. Needless to say this handheld camera film gimmick doesn't seem to be getting any better nor do I appreciate them anymore after 10 & a half years. I am steering clear from anymore of these \\"scariest movie of all time\\" claims from here on out.<br /><br />Sadly, we have here another disappointing case of independent horror which seemed destined for instant cult or sleeper status. While the movie-going audiences are still in some sort of whirlwind of conflicting ideas about what horror should be & whether or not they actually like horror films, this is the saddened result of a cinematic suppository which fails to satisfy on any great level. These boring, overlong films aren't entertaining nor do they even provide a sense of instant gratification & I deeply regret having voted for this movie by investing a single hard-earned dollar at the local multiplex. Unfortunately,I can't get my one dollar back & I've lost 82 minutes of life that cannot be returned.<br /><br />Katie & Micah are a young suburban couple who desperately try to battle a supernatural presence in their home while making sense of the footage captured through modern technology. Katie feels that she has terrorized by some entity since the young age of 8 & wants to be free of this evil force which somehow manages to follow her wherever she goes. Micah, on the other hand, feels he can abolish it with his overly Mano-Mano pride & doesn't wish to involve any third parties at his girlfriend's insistence. Katie does hire a psychic who convinces her throughout the film that forces are wreaking havoc within the home although the couple continues to merely record the activity & makes no attempt to evacuate the premises.<br /><br />While only 82 minutes, only about 14-15 of that is spent with any paranormal activity & the rest is spent with two amateur actors who pretend to be a couple haunted by some demonic presence. I've seen better acting in a local bar by two drunkards doing their best on karaoke night. As far as the paranormal activity goes, there are no real scares to speak of. Who hasn't heard footsteps or things that go bump in the night? In fact, there are doors at my current place of employment that open all throughout the night but I don't jump at the sound of them nor do I suspect any evil forces at play.  Without the proper atmosphere & lighting, you can't possibly expect any chills or thrills from something as flat as Paranormal Activity.<br /><br />If annoying dialog & slow pacing without any real atmosphere to speak of weren't bad enough, why do always find these nimrods in every handheld camera-film trying to capture every last semi-traumatic experience. If you were in a haunted house of sorts & you felt that you're friends were in some sort of eminent danger, wouldn't you drop that goddamn camera & try to assist your friends in their time of peril? Perhaps it's just me & my opinion only but this is yet one more strike against the film for being unbelievable & downright hokey. While no one really needs to shred Paranormal Activity for being unrealistic, it should be blatantly obvious in my book.<br /><br />Although I'm sure there will be many who will feel I've been too harsh with one of the most talked about films of 2009, I find it somewhat puzzling that so many have offered the undeserved four star rating. Somehow this film is anything but refreshing although the box office is usually flooded with unnecessary horror remakes & films catering to the Harry Potter/ Twilight fan base. Sheesh, and people are trashing Rob Zombie's films??

0553381695|5.0|For many years, I held off starting this series because of the negative reviews and complaints.  But after enough friends compared the series to The Wire in terms of scope and complexity, I realized that I had to give it a shot.  Now I believe that this series represents one of the masterworks in the fantasy genre.  There is nothing I can add to the positive reviews but I would like to address the negative reviews.  If you look closely you will realize there are very few bad reviews, ONLY BAD REVIEWERS!!!  The vast majority of negative reviews can be broken down into a few groups:    BAD REVIEWERS GROUP ONE: Children (emotionally or mentally).    I stopped reading fantasy books in my early twenties because they are, by and large, childish and simplistic.  Some reviewers complain that they don't like the characters or can not identify with the characters Mr. Martin has created.  I can only assume that these people want HEROES and VILLAINS.  To those reviewers I say - stick with Disney films.  The characters created by Mr. Martin are complex and ambiguous.  In fact, many of the characters I hated in the first book, I found myself rooting for by the third book.      BAD REVIEWERS GROUP TWO: Impatient amusement park riders.    I will be the first to admit that it is hard to wait to find out what happens next.  But people who want Mr Martin to \\"finish the series\\" seem to be operating under the faulty assumption that this series will end in some glorious conclusion that ties everything together.  I have no such expectation.  This is not Lord of the Rings.  Good will not eternally triumph over evil and justice will not be granted for everyone.  If that is what you are looking for, then you are craven and should return to your childish fairy-tales!      BAD REVIEWERS GROUP THREE: The Choose your own adventurers.  By books three and four you will notice more and more reviewers complaining about which characters Mr. Martin focuses on.  Rarely, if ever, do they complain aboutthe quality of the prose or the rich detail of this world Martin has created.  Usually their reviews can be boiled down to - \\"I want to know what happens to so and so right now!\\"  They also like to complain that some chapters are just filler that do not relate to the story.  It seems to me that this complaint is premature until the series is complete.  Minor characters in the first book are major characters in the third book and some characters disappear in the first book only to pop up again in the third.  With this in mind I will assume that these filler characters or the information revealed in their chapters is relevant to later parts of the story.  If you like a chef, you will be excited to eat whatever he dishes up.  Not all of the meals will be to your taste but what you enjoy is the chef's creativity and boldness, not a specific flavor.  This group of bad reviewers loved the first meal dished out and now they want everything to taste the same - To them I say - stick with Taco Bell!  That way you always know what you are getting.    BAD REVIEWERS GROUP FOUR:  The Kindle reviews.  Reviews regarding kindle formatting have no place amidst the book reviews.  And some of these people complain that the kindle version should never cost more than the paperback version.  I would argue that having all of the books in a slender little device is an added bonus that is worth something in-and-of-itself.  Just imagine trying to travel with all five books!

B0041KKYCY|4.0|I remember seeing the posters for this one when my buddy and I were hanging out in Cali for the Weekend of Horrors horror con. I can't say I was thrilled at first when I hard the news although I had known it was just a matter of time before some schmuck saw reason to remake yet another cult film fave. I still was hellbent for election on seeing this film and even had hoped that I'd be able to catch it in the theaters. No such luck. I had to wait for DVD like everyone else but at least Walmart sells the standard DVD for $10 so who's complaining, right?<br /><br />If you've seen the original, you pretty much know what to expect here. If rape or brutality offends you, ISOYG isn't your movie. No other way to put it. This is not a Michael Bay film and I thank God for that. The film-makers here actually did their homework and delivered a very effective, if not powerful revenge flick which holds up well for repeated viewings and should satisfy most horror fans in the midst of things. Probability suggests I will grow to like this film even more with repeated viewings as there aren't any great horror films that I'm aware of anymore which are granted a major release.<br /><br />ISOYG is as brutal as they come but this is not an Eli Roth film as we have no sympathy for Jennifer Hill's victims. Well, maybe one. :-) Suffice to say, you are rooting for her all the way in the second half of the film as each lowlife is dispatched in the most gruesome fashion imaginable. Rest assured, she will have no mercy on any of them and will not back down until each one is punished severely.<br /><br />Definitely much more polished and professional than the seventies Grind house classic, the remake still manages to disturb it's viewer and doesn't let up. Whereas the original focused somewhat on the sexualized violence in our protagonist's revenge scheme, the modern day classic alleviates seduction altogether. Instead, Jennifer chooses to pit them against each other and takes her time to carry out the methodical revenge plan. Although we do not necessarily see how she escapes or her grand scheme of revenge, we are fully assured that justice will be served in the most bloody, cathartic sense of the word.<br /><br />What I found most disturbing about the revision is how her attackers torment the lead character as if we were watching Michael Haneke's Funny Games instead of your typical rape/revenge fare. I must confide that watching these men abuse Jennifer in every sense of the word before sexually assaulting her really took me out of my element and I couldn't but think of all the innocent women who have been raped through the years. Even a more hideous thought, they've been killed after being assaulted.<br /><br />Brave Sarah Butler. This is one role that really deserves the utmost praise and it's a shame we don't give Oscars for horror flicks very often. Camille Keaton is an awesome actress and I couldn't imagine anyone who could pull off this role but Sarah Butler is outstanding as Jennifer Hills. In fact, the supporting actors are very convincing as well which is a strong suit considering most of the cast in the original looked very wooden.<br /><br />Thumbs up sky high! It's hard to tell if the ISOYG is really just a fluke or if we can expect more great endeavors from the cast/crew but I'm definitely sold on this effort. As a long time horror fan and lover of films which address the male encroachment issue, this is one powerful piece of film-making. See it if you handle it!!ge plan.

B004LWZW4C|4.0|It's funny to think that there was a time when movies containing super-heroes were considered poison at the box office. Sure, the first Superman movie from 1978 nearly tripled its budget, but as time went on the sequels lost money. Blade made its production money back, but it was X-Men that showed that movies based on comic books could be a medium that makes money.    With the first installment the box office saw more than double the budget of the film domestically. The second installment saw a rise in the budget and nearly double that budget was raised in box office receipts. With the third installment the gross increased, but the budget for the film did as well, and it was not nearly as proportional. By the time X-Men Origins: Wolverine came around audiences felt tired and the film couldn't even double its budget at the box office. Now we get another try at Bryan Singer's magic from X-Men and X2: X-Men United with director Matthew Vaughn and X-Men: First Class.    X-Men: First Class chronicles the first meeting of Eric Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy). Of course, we as the audience know that these two powerhouses of mutants will eventually become Magneto and Professor X, respectively. Throughout the film, we also see the beginning of Xavier's School for Gifted Young People with Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Beast (Nicholas Hoult). Through the creation of the film we also learn of Lensherr's hatred for former Nazi doctor turned wannabe world dictator Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon).    Stylistically, X-Men: First Class is a complete departure from the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner/Gavin Hood days of the film series. Where they were dark, this film is bright. The previous films held their dark colors to represent the darkness of the world these mutants inhabited; in this film the bright pallet references the bright futures the mutants have. That ideal is further exemplified in many references in the film to be true to oneself. Where X-Menwas about being an outsider, and X2 was about the rage of being shunned boiling over, this film is about embracing who you are. That singular vision is what allows this film to rise over the frenetic and ill-conceived X-Men 3.    Taking on a role made iconic by another actor is extremely difficult, especially when you're practically playing your counterpart's younger self. It's not impossible, though, as Robert DeNiro proved in The Godfather, Part 2 and Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto proved in Star Trek. Matthew Fassbender and James McAvoy once again prove it's possible to create a brilliant portrayal of a character attributed to someone else.    For Charles Xavier, James McAvoy plays him as a smooth ladies' man with a brilliant mind. It's a refreshing portrayal of a character that seems too good to be true. Through the course of the film, McAvoy does a brilliant job showing the arc of Professor X as he moves from college graduate to mutant leader/savior. Fassbender plays Eric Lensherr with the verve of a globetrotting spy, almost like Bond with a vendetta. While a drive for revenge could have easily turned Magneto into a one-note character, there's much more simmering under the surface as he deals with his past, and learning that there are others like him in the world. Fassbender does a brilliant job of showing all of that in his performance.    On the side of the X-Men, Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult bring the best performances. As Mystique, we watch Lawrence battle with ideas of image and how her image keeps her from getting close to anyone, with the exception of Charles who regards her as a sister despite her desire for a more romantic relationship. Hoult's beast has the same problem, and with an arc that resembles and digresses from Mystique's, he brings a brilliant edge to the character. On the side of The Hellfire Club, Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw is a great villain, and it's easy to tell that Bacon is having a lot of fun playing a villain that would have been at home in a `60's spy film.    Not all of the characters receive the same fully realized treatment. As Emma Frost, January Jones is given decent material, but she either doesn't want to be in a super hero film or she doesn't have the acting chops to pull off the role, as she comes across as flat. Most of the characters serve their purpose in showing the beginning of Professor X and Magneto's feud as well as the start of Xavier's School, but when one of these mutants switches from the side of the X-Men to The Hellfire Club they're not quite fleshed out enough to make the betrayal feel genuine.    Matthew Vaughn didn't just succeed at bringing X-Men's former glory back to the series, he exceeded all expectations to create the best in the series. Bringing in several influences from Bond to 60's culture, Vaughn creates something that stands out from the rest while remaining true to the spirit of Singer's first X-Men films.    4.5/5    For more reviews check out: jasoncwilkerson.blogspot.com
B004UIOUHC|5.0|It's noticeably faster than the android browser, and, more importantly, opera has a more intuitive UI, with a great start up page (that can sync with your pc, if you want) and web page tabs that are immediatly available to preview, switch to or close a tab at anytime - on the stock android, you have to hit the menu button to pull up a page to take you to a page to do that, and even then, you can't preview the tab first on stock android browser, which can be painful when all u have is the title of the site on each tab to go by.... And 5 or 10 different tabs from that site open, ie opening up news stories on a blog.  So, I highly rec this one (or the more light-weight/data saving &quot;mini&quot; version) over the stock android browser.
B000BCE918|5.0|Great moviess!! I am such a bigg fan of Jurassic Park, its my all time favorite movie! The movie cam in prefectly good brand new condition and I got it at a wonderful price! Thank you so much!(:
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Five stars!  Pros: Comes with everything you need and can get support @ turtlebeach.com, great price, works great with Xbox and PS3 and PC (I have all), great surround, long cord, comfortable, and good mic quality.  Cons: ummmmmmmmmmmm idk?
0486284735|2.0|I picked this book up from my daughter's bookshelf and thought it might be fun to read such a classic. I have to say I am disappointed. About halfway through, I grew so thoroughly bored, I had to put the book down for a few days. It is just a predictable romance novel, nothing especially wonderful or exciting. There is so much conversations and it can get really confusing sometimes.
B004YJZ5GM|5.0|I originally posted a very negative review of this album and must say I was DEAD wrong about it. the 1st copy I received was defective (Warped) and I should not have reviewed it. Today I received a pristine new copy in the mail and it when I put it on my turntable and played it the difference was night and day. It's the very first time I have heard Blues For Allah sound warm, lush and musically involving. I always loved the record to begin with but this is the very best RE-mastering job I have ever heard. Much thanks to Kevin Grey & Steve Hoffman of Audio Fidelity for their dedication to perfection.<br /><br />I also got the chance to hear Shakedown Street and Ditto, fantastic re-mastering job by Kevin Grey. Both records are perfectly pressed and totally silent, no snap, crackle, pop, to be found here.<br /><br />I'm so impressed by these reissues that I may go ahead pre-order all of the upcoming Grateful Dead titles from Audio Fidelity. They are that good and I think they are likely to sell out very quickly.
1594744769|4.0|First of all, I didnt even realize this book was in the \\"Young Adult\\" genre.  I am a 50 yr old female, and I thought it was great!  I started reading late Friday, and literally could not stop reading it all weekend until I was done.  It was very well written, and those pictures, which the author says are authentic, are haunting!<br /><br />The only problem with buying this book for my Kindle is that the pictures are a little hard to see, as well as some of the hand written notes that appear in the text, hence only a 4-star rating.  I may need to buy the actual book so I can look at those pictures again.  They really stay with you, you can't stop thinking about them and wondering about them.<br /><br />I am so glad it was set up for a sequel, I will definately buy it!  oh, and I would love to see this made into a movie, how cool would that be???  As long as the right people make it.  The story would be ruined if they try to cutesy it up, because of the kids.

0340896965|5.0|I loved this book from the very first page to the very last page - it was so good that i finished it in a day and a half. it is a charming, witty, and in some ways - a heartbreaking love story about two people (Emma and Dexter) who become attached to one another after meeting on one fateful day, July 15 1988. Time, distance, varied interests, and different career paths tear them apart. Unfortunately, they grow apart and although both become involved in a string of relationships with other partners over the years, they cannot stop thinking about one another. They never quite got over one another; in some ways, and are often left wondering if it was too late to pursue something with one another in the present day. Not to give the story away for any reader interested in this book - ultimately, \\"One Day\\" is a story reminding us about how the past affects the present; who we are back then and who we turn out to be today. What happens in the course of one's life shapes the person you become. Both emma and dexter realize they have made mistakes (romantically and personally) and realize that they have let many opportunities of a real relationship with one another slip away from them. Eventually, Dexter becomes a family man; Emma becomes an up and coming writer who has a television deal that is in production based on her book series. Rhere are several \\"themes\\" that Nicholls pursues in this book: the nature of life and fate, friendship, friendship withstanding the test of time, heartbreak, the journey of love-hate relationships leading one to discover that the person you love the most is not that hard to find. And once you do find that person, do not let an opportunity pass by you. It is such a bittersweet love story that touches the heart, and becomes an emotional read for anyone who has fallen out of love, fallen in love, or has never been in love. There is something for any person to take away from this story. I am amazed at how well Nicholls can take such a simple idea and transform it into such a magical, touching love story that flows effortlessly, leaving no stone unturned. He writes so masterfully that you become immersed in both these characters, including other non main characters. It was as if I knew Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew and felt like I lived in their apartment, their city, experienced their lives. His writing captures the heart with every sentimental emotion possible. Well done, Nicholls. A long novel, but is most definitely a worthwhile read even your most tired and busiest days.
0670034711|1.0|I can't even bring myself to give this book to charity.. it took me several months of really trying to get into it.. when eventually at the pitiful page of 80 I gave up.. eat, pray and be completed bored and fed-up.. life can be disappointing at the best of times.. reading a book to get this feeling isn't something I feel the need to do.. it felt like a monologue of twaddle. may this book be recycled into something more useful.

B0025UHKNS|3.0|I bought this GPS watch when it was in the Gold Box for quite cheap but I am still debating over returning it. I have some very limited experience with Forerunner 305, which I borrowed from my coworker, and probably will be getting that one.  There is a thing that 405cx does better:  Satellite reception, it fixes while I am inside the house and it takes a few seconds to fix. 305 is much slower and less sensitive.    Everything else is not so better. I am scratching my head over some design decision:    1. Wireless data transfer, Why ?!  One needs to charge the watch quite often attaching it to USB anyway so what's the point ? I would not mind if it worked flawlessly but it does not. In fact it is a pain. I see many \\"failed to transfer data\\" statuses. When it happens my Logitech wireless mouse and sometimes keyboard become unresponsive and I cannot use the computer. Eventually it goes through but it is a hassle.    2. Bezel ! I am sure if you are reading this you heard quite a few things about it. My actual complain is not the bad user experience with it but the fact that it is relatively very wide taking the real estate of the watch. So despite the watch is still quite big the face is very small making the data in the 2nd and 3rd fields difficult to see.    3. The watch/strap is very rigid and is designed for an average wrist, If you have smaller wrists you cannot use it. Mine are wider than average and the watch sits on my hand quite uncomfortably.  In comparison 305  fits much better. True that Garmin provides fabric straps for such cases but it takes away the watch appearance and is not very clean.     4. Battery. I tried the watch for half an hour and left it on the desk expecting it to go to the power save mode.  It did not, Probably because it was inside, where the satellite reception was weaker and less accurate, it thought I was walking back and forth at very slow pace - around 30. Of course the battery lost power. Since there is no way to turn the watch off( why again ? ) this definitely can cause problems. Edit: Looking at the manual I see it was probably my mistake as I did not stop the timer. So one has to remember to turn it off. Pretty lame I must say.  Secondly why does it last only two weeks in the power save mode ? All the modules, besides the clock, should be powered off and the battery should last at least a few years in this mode.    5. Multisport feature. Why did they remove it ? I have no idea. I bicycle and run as many of my friends so this feature was quite useful. Some remnants of it there but the functionality is seriously degraded.    6. Current Pace funtion. Despite this is a very important piece of data it should be removed from this particular unit. It is useless in its current implementation. The accuracy is horrible. It jumps from 10:40 to 13:50 while Im walking at constant speed. The older 305 unit does much more descent job here.    It is in fact a very attractive watch and if it fits it feels much smaller, lighter and less obtrusive than 305. You forget that it is on your hand, which is not the case with 305. I would not mind carrying it on my hand all the times     But there are just too many unfinished and unpolished things.  While 305 is plain ugly, it is very comfortable to wear, is much simpler and more intuitive and has some features 405cx misses.      If I had just one phrase to describe this watch I would say it is overdesigned and undertested.     EDIT: After using the watch for two weeks I really started liking it. It sill could feel on my hand better but I have got used to it. The alarming issues are though that the watch rebooted several times in two weeks and once it lost a part of the data when uploading it to Garming Connect, making that specific run data unusable. Also two times the data was lost when downloading a course from Garming Connect to the watch. Even though the transfer process succeeded the course did not appear in the menu. I am afraid that the data stuck in thewatch taking memory but not reflected in the user intrface. All this just confirms my guess that the device was not tested properly before being released. I am not sure if 305 was developed by the same team but that product is more stable and polished.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Beginning of this season is not so great and it takes probably till the middle of it to really start getting into it again. By the end of the season you craving more information and, like usual, it ends you wanting more and more. Love this show and this season is great.
B003NVFYOA|1.0|There are two traps into which a spinoff of a popular show can fall.  It can either lean so heavily on the show off of which it spun that it never escapes that show's shadow and becomes nothing more than a pale imitation of a much better program (Sarah Jane Adventures), or it can go to the other extreme and bear so little resemblance to the original that there's nothing to draw in fans from the parent show.    Torchwood here falls into the latter trap.  You've got Jack Harkness, the always bad-ass part time companion to the Ninth and Tenth Doctors, to attract DW fans; but once you get past him, there's no Dr Who here.  There are stray references to this and that minor element of the revival; the hand which the Doctor lost in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" is kept in a jar in the background; and Jack makes cryptic reference to his desire to find \\"the right kind of doctor\\" in the pilot and again in the finale.  There's an episode that's about Cybermen . . . sort of.  (Actually, it's no less about the Cybermen than most of the Cybermen episodes of Tenant's run were.)  But this Doctor Who spinoff bears no meaningful resemblance to Doctor Who.    That's not a bad thing necessarily, of course, if the show can turn into something interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, it doesn't, not in this case.  The cast of characters pretty much kills it. Of the four original characters, Owen is an unlikeable jerk who's got the obnoxiousness of half a dozen Donna Nobles and all the redeeming virtues of John Simm's--no, Eric Roberts's!--Master, while Gwen, Tosh, and Ianto (Geez, who came up with these names?) are just uninteresting dweebs. As for Jack, Barrowman makes the character such a joy to watch when he's in a Doctor Who episode, but for the most part he seems to be just phoning it in here.    The season does manage some good episodes. The pilot was certainly an enjoyable watch, and the next episode, which chronicled Gwen's first day on the job, was interesting.  (Gwen joins Jackas a first-tier character; the other three are distinctly less important. I won't say they're the Scotty and Sulu to Jack and Gwen's Kirk and Spock, but if you watch the opening titles and notice that the other three actors' names appear to be separated from Barrowman's and Eve Myles's by several blank lines, you'll see what I mean.)  This episode was about an alien who had a sexual obsession, and it was pretty enjoyable.  Unfortunately, the sexual obsession set the tone for the rest of the season, but more on that in just a bit.    From there on out most of the better episodes are driven by guest stars--and there are some good guest characters in here.  There were a couple of episodes whose plots didn't rely on any characters, but on phenomena. One dealing with fairies felt like it could have been an okay Doctor Who episode, and I suspect it would have been quite good if it had brought in DW elements, but Jack tries to solve it on his own and it leaves the episode with the sense of a potentially good idea not realized.  There's the Cybermen episode I mentioned above, which was only so-so on an objective standard but shines a lot brighter due to its less-than-lustrous companions.  \\"Countrycide\\" is a disturbing one.  (By the way, according to the Wiki it's the first episode in the DW universe to involve no science fiction elements other than a time traveller who's not what he seems since the Fifth Doctor story \\"Black Orchid,\\" which was itself a throwback to the straight historicals of the William Hartnell era, when the show was supposed to be educational.)    Most of the episodes focus on a regular character and try to kick off a character arc.  This makes sense for the first season of a new show, but the results are not pretty.  We don't really get an episode on Jack, partly because we already know him from his Doctor Who appearances and partly because, for the purposes of this show, he's got a real air of mystery about him that would dissipate if his teammates learned what makes him tick.  (And maintaining this mystery for the characters without frustrating curious audiences is almost the only thing that this season does well.)  There IS an episode titled \\"Captain Jack Harkness,\\" and that one features Barrowman to about the same extent that the various character episodes starred the actors playing the characters being focused on, but it's not about Jack.  It's about the other Captain Jack Harkness, whose identity was stolen by the Jack we all know of love when he first landed in the Battle of Britain to attempt to con the Doctor, right before the events of \\"The Empty Child.\\"    Each of the other four gets at least one episode to try to develop their characters, but this is where the show really falls apart. As I alluded to above, there's a tremendous amount of sex here. Now Torchwood is specifically advertised for adults-only audiences, so that's not objectionable in and of itself.  Sex is often a useful tool for advancing the plot of adult fiction, and certainly a little gratuitous sex never killed anyone, but they go way overboard with it on this show.  Sex is the only vehicle used for any kind of characterization, and it REALLY wears thin.  (Interestingly enough, Jack--who's notorious among the Ninth and Tenth Doctors and their companions for flirting with any man, woman, or alien he meets, unless duty has forced upon him some urgent need to keep his mind on other things--shows no more interest in sex on this show than most normal real-world adults, despite being both surrounded and WRITTEN by nymphomaniacs.)    Gwen has a season-long subplot in which her lover--a genuinely nice guy named Rhys, and the only recurring original character a viewer is likely to develop any sympathy or affinity for--gradually grows less and less willing to accept the unpredictable hours of Gwen's new job--all he knows is that she's working for a kind of \\"special ops\\"--and especially the evasiveness and dishonesty that creeps into their relationship as Gwen's life becomes increasingly affected by stuff that's confidential.  This very nearly worked, and would have, if the writers had portrayed Gwen as being torn between the equally valid demands of love and duty.  Unfortunately, on this show, anything interesting gets traded in for an extra dose of sex, so Gwen uses this secrecy to conceal the fact that she's taken another lover.  (That's not a spoiler, by the way; the audience learns of it almost immediately.  Only poor Rhys is left in the dark.)    The three second-tier characters each get an episode where a lover pops up out of nowhere and leads them to question their loyalties to Torchwood. We learn next to nothing about the characters this way.  In fact, I'm having a hard time thinking of a cheaper way to do characterization, and that's made even worse in the cases of Tosh and Ianto, whose characters are more or less reset to what they'd been originally almost immediately and go through the remainder of the season only minimally changed.  As for Owen, he becomes an even bigger jerk after his short-term lover leaves him, setting up a two-episode arc which I'm going to spoil below because it illuminates just how badly these characters can ruin a story.    S    P    O    I    L    E    R    S    As I said, Owen's short-term lover leaves him and this drives him to become an even bigger jerk. In the penultimate episode he goes against Jack's orders and does something incredibly stupid and dangerous, killing hundreds of people in the process. In the finale, the ripples of his decision quickly get away from him and he indignantly demands that Jack clean up his mess.  Jack starts by firing him for insubordination, though the other Torchwood members make half-hearted attempts to save Owen's job (instead of standing up and cheering, like the audience is doing).    Jack's having no luck fixing things, and then Owen barges back in and proposes doing something that will make the situation even worse.  Jack is prepared to use force to stop him but Owen gets the other three to mutiny. Jack reminds each of them why they suck and they respond by killing him--something that's happened quite a few times this season.  You'll recall that ever since Time Vortex-possessed Rose revived him after he bought it against the Daleks in \\"The Parting of Ways,\\" he's been immortal and recovers from all forms of deadly injury in seconds.  In this one case, though, he stays dead for several minutes, which gives Owen and Friends the opportunity to release a spawn of Satan on the Earth, as per Revelation--which seems pretty out of place considering that a good deal of the season was spent not-so-subtly pushing an atheist agenda.    What follows is a five-minute fight with a fake-looking city-stomping monster.  The whole thing feels more like an episode of Underdog than either Doctor Who or any of the other shows to which Torchwood has been favorably compared: The X-Files, CSI, a few others. The ending is pat. Jack dies and undies again, even more slowly this time because he'd run the immovable object of his immortality up against an irresistable force, the Death Lord. Then he again makes reference to \\"the right kind of doctor.\\"  Almost immediately, the Doctor's hand starts glowing, we hear the sound of the TARDIS, and Jack runs off.    Since I watched all of Doctor Who before turning my attention to Torchwood, I know he's running off to return to a much better show and to take part in one of its best story arcs, the return of the Master for the twenty-first century revival. (I had always wondered where he was coming from in such a hurry in the opening scene of \\"Utopia.\\") Unfortunately, no sooner did I remember this than the disappointment I felt when he turned down the chance to resume being a companion at the end of \\"Last of the Time Lords\\" was retroactively enhanced by realizing that he was just going back for another season of more of this crap.  I doubt I'll be joining him.    Sorry to spoil theseason finale, but I feel it was necessary to show just how bad this season was.  I wouldn't quite say it should be avoided at all costs, but if you watch it expecting anything other than bland sci fi adventures and oversexed losers, you're in for a big disappointment.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|great show! this season is amazing! the whole season you trying to figure out what's going on since timeline is all messed up and it goes back and forth between past, future and present within same episode. Very cool season.    the only disappointing feature is that even though dvd set has 6 disks, only 4 of those are actual episodes.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great game. not too difficult or easy nor is it too short. I recommend this to most people looking for a game to play in the car or metro.

B00005JMCN|3.0|I liked \\"Seabiscuit\\" as a film but, for me, it was at least 20 minutes too long.  There was no mystery to me what needed to be cut; all the narration regarding the Great Depression.  If you know about America's Great Depression, the intersperced narration wasn't going to enlighten you.  If you didn't know anything about the Great Depression, the narration would have been too incomplete.  In addition, the efforts to cinematically bring together several persons from several different backgrounds was way too overdone.  This overdone backdrop in \\"Seabiscuit\\" is an example of what good film-editting is for.  Great film-editting often goes unnoticed because we are better focussed on the film.  Poor editing confuses, interupts and boors the audience.        All the complaints above are what went through my mind while I was enjoying glimpses of a potentially great film.  The suspense, action, excitement and all keep getting brushed aside by psychological examinations of our two-legged actors.  The acting was a mixed bag.  Some was fairly decent and I thought Chris Cooper's generally lethargic style fit well in \\"Seabiscuit\\" as a trainer who seemed liked he'd been kicked in the head by a horse too often.  This is a movie that someone ought to redo somewhere down the road.  After all, the horse deserved better.  In the meantime, I think I'll read the book.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Lot of fun. Very addicting. I really need to get other things done on my smart phone. But hey you know you only live once, have fun with it!?
0670022411|2.0|WARNING: This book ends extremely abruptly raising many questions it leaves unanswered. I read it on my Kindle and was very surprised to see the \\"acknowledgements\\" section sneak up on me. The author is obviously setting this up for a sequel but I wish I would've known that before taking this book on. Her character development was very poor. I found myself wondering who was that person again? once I was already well into the novel. Her attention to mundane and insignificant details was exhausting. On the plus side her idea for the novel, cross-breading between creature species, was brilliant but poorly executed I'm afraid. I am very well read in this genre as Kim Harrison, Karen Marie Moning, Laurell K. Hamilton, Jeaniene Frost, & Kelley Armstrong are some of my favorite authors. I guess I set the bar too high when comparing this author to those aforementioned. I find myself very disappointed not not willing to read any further books in this series.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|When me and my family first saw the hit ABC family TV show Pretty Little Liars we fell in love! thn we heard about the book we went crazy I am the middle of four kids and I put everything aside to read this book and  am soooooo glad I did
0316044695|1.0|After reading an article about a warship being named after Michael Murphy I found a reference to this book and was very excited to get my hands on it and start reading.  I had just finished \\"Joker One\\" which was written by a Marine Officer about serving in Afghanistan and absolutely loved the book.  I expected the same page turner written in a similar tone, the unassuming Military professional giving us common people a glimpse into the fight.    While I admit some sections were very interesting (SEAL training, the refuge in the village), I had a hard time with the random anti-liberal commentary.  I did not feel it proved any point or helped the story.  While I understand that everyone has their opinions, I did not feel that the middle of a book is the right platform for this.  I think that Marcus' opinions should have been kept to a foreword or \\"notes from the author\\" in the back of the book.      The commentary also at times made it look like Marcus was completely contradicting himself.  He kept saying how humble and valiant the SEALS were, taking responsibility for what happens and never seeking credit or recognition - strong and silent, yet the book seemed like him pounding his chest saying how awesome he is and that anything that went wrong was the liberal's fault.  I understand that he has gone through things most of us will never even come close to encountering but it was not presented very well.    For a good book about military leadership and brotherhood, I suggest \\"Joker One\\" by Donovan Campbell.

B0043GAZYS|4.0|I know, I know. Cliche. To be honest, I saw the movie before reading the books and liked it. Then, I read the books and loved them. Now I watch the movie and, \\"eh\\". If you're a S.P. fanboy/girl, then you should have this movie in your collection. comic fans will appreciate that many illustrations and illustrated \\"effects\\" were incorporated into the movie which is something I think that is lost when Graphic Novels go to the big screen. Gamers will appreciate the nods to classic video games that the books proudly convey as well. Both movie and books are not as violent as say \\"kick ass\\", but they keep fun adult themes and action going. Book fans may be disappointed mainly in the content of the movie. Realistically, trying to fit 6 books worth of content into 113mins is a tough task and probably better not attempted. This movie might have had greater appeal as a 3 part epic (hey, why the hell not!). Much of the quotes and actions from the book were swapped to other characters in the movie, at times misplaced to just \\"have it in there\\". As mentioned, some characters were not fully developed which is expected. My issue is that Ramona, who is a primary character to both movie and book, was severely underdeveloped. So much so, that coming to the end you're left thinking that it seems more appropriate that Scott end up with Knives (WHAT?! Yeah). I've seen the movie 2 or 3 times now because it is fun and different from your run-of-the-mill super hero/graphic novel movie, but I will probably watch it sparingly in the future, then not at all. I have bought and read the books 4 times now in the last 6 months and can see myself going back to them for quite some years to come and handing them down to my kids (maybe when their adolescents) to read. So hopefully that says something...or whatever.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is as good as the prior two, if not better.  Suzanne Collins is no doubt a talented author skilled in the art of piquing human interest.  Buy this book, buy the whole series.  It is well worth the time.
0670022411|2.0|You know, like others, I'm not sure how I feel about this book.  There was a very basic storyline with the book, yet it took 500 pages to get it going. If it was an intense book with varying plots, I would understand that. It wasn't.  You know how there are some books that you start to read at night before bed and the next thing you know it's 4 a.m. and you can't put it down? Not this book. There was nothing really wrong with the book, per se, but it took me 2 months to finish it because I used it as a \\"few pages before bed\\" book. Like other reviewers, when I finally got into the last 20% (I have a Kindle) of the book, I did read it with more interest than in the beginning; however, like other readers, I was extremely confused/disappointed by the ending. With over 500 pages of text, I would hope to get to an ending point that would at least put the proverbial bow on the package to tie it up nicely.  It didn't. It didn't end it with a heart-thumping 'what will happen next? ... I must be the sequel ASAP!' moment, either. It just ... ended. In summation, while it wasn't such a bad book that I couldn't finish it, I found it dragged on with too much text for a basic plot and did not leave me feeling satisfied.  FTR: I enjoy a good vampire/witch book, but did not like Twilight past the first novel.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love Plants Vs. Zombies, so I was really excited to have it on Android. Unfortunately, I have lost all of my progress twice now. The first time, I had played through the entire game. The second time, I was on level 4-3. My only comfort is that I'm reading a lot of other 1-star reviews telling the same tale. The game is great, otherwise. But a game where half the fun is unlocking the mini games and buying up all the plants is just about useless if you can't progress. So until there is a fix for this progress issue, I give 1 star.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I would have really loved this headset if it did what I bought it for; fraps recording. Unfortunately, whenever I talk, fraps creates a buzzing/static noise in the background, it gets louder as I talk. It doesn't buzz all the time, which is what happens to some people; ONLY WHEN I TALK. I came to the conclusion that It's the microphone because when I disable \\"Record external input\\" in fraps and enable Voice Preview in the Logitech G930 Settings fraps records my voice without any static. Unfortunately, Voice Preview plays everything you say back into the headset, which means you hear yourself 2 seconds after saying something, which gets in the way more than you might think if you've never heard that.     Also, the audio sensitivity Isn't that great, I know It's a gaming headset but buzzing when hearing human voices and certain music playback just isn't acceptable. The human voice buzzing isn't quite as bad as the mic through fraps, you can get used to it.    Tested mic with Skype and voip over a bunch of games, no one has reported any buzzing on their size which leads me to believe that it might not be the headset but fraps itself, which really doesn't change anything. It still DOESN'T WORK WITH FRAPS. If it is fraps, hopefully this will be fixed, if not then don't get this for fraps recording.    The microphone cancels out outside noise very well, i have a bunch of fans blowing air in my room and the mic doesn't pick any of it up. The Comfort isn't that great, in fact it's the worst I've ever felt. When i got it, it was Crushing my skull like there was no tomorrow, so i dubbed it the skull crusher, it loosened up as time went by but it's still a skull crusher. The headband is painful on the head so I find myself constantly having to move it. The bass is great(too much of it makes music buzz), too much treble makes music buzz even more. The 7.1 isn't that great, I would be much happier with a good Stereo 3.5mm headset, that has a mic with the same noise cancelling asthis headset.    It gets 2 stars for: Mic noise cancelling is WOW, The bass is great, when music doesn't buzz it sounds amazing, the Design sucks, microphone buzzes with fraps, human voices create static/buzzing, and the wireless frequency is only 2.4Ghz.

B001DF68MA|5.0|I read all the reviews from several sights before purchasing this seat for my daughter. She is almost two and too short to reach the pedals on a trike and she so badly wanted to ride a bike with big sis.She is thirty pounds. It only took me a half hour to install this on my cranbrook cruiser bike. I was worried it may not fit due to the bike being a bit thick but it fit great. Plenty of rubber protection pieces to protect by bike from the hardware as well. All tools for installation were provided as well as easy to follow instructions. The seatlooks small but she had plenty of room. The seat has a 5 point harness as well. She loves it!!!! As I amnot an avid bike rider the bike with the seat with her in it was very easy to ride. I didnt have any balance issues at all and she was moving with excitement the entire time. It was easy to put her in the seat and take her out without even being on the bike.I just hung on to the bie so it would not tip. I recomend this seat to every parent. Well worth the price. We will get alot of use. I even take her to the daycare in it. I installed a basket on the front of my bike for her bag and my work items.
B000SEIK2S|3.0|I would just reiterate what some others here have already said. This is a good book, but not what I would call great. Scalzi is definitely a good writer and I will give him that. I will also say the book makes some interesting points and paints an interesting view of one possible future. Most of the book seems plausible though other parts kind of made me raise an eyebrow (I won't go into specifics so as not to spoil anything). As for all the people who seem to try and rebuff every negative criticism of the book, I think they are probably just looking for a deeper meaning that isn't there. There is plenty of originality in the book, but there are plenty of ideas that are just rehashes of other novels (I'm not saying he plagiarized or anything, just that the ideas aren't all new).
B004HO6HWK|4.0|I am biased writing this review because I am a huge Jason Statham fan. To those who, like me, enjoy watching his flicks you will not be disappointed with this one. Statham is excellent as always. 4.5/5.0    I admit that I have not seen the original with the great Charles Bronson so have no comparison on that front. As far as how the story goes I like it. I am also a fan of the assassin/hit man genre and this was definitely on par here. 4.5/5.0 for that.    The story was fast paced and the acting was alright. Donald Sutherland played a good part for the short time he was there. Ben Foster was ok in his role, nothing overly fantastic but played the part of a young gun know it all as good as anyone. 3.5/5.0    The extras on this Blu-Ray were lacking to say the best. Deleted scenes were ok but no optional commentary. No commentary on the movie and the featurette on the stunts was fairly cool but limited. All in all a disappoinment as far as Extras go but then when you look at this movie how much more could there have been? Maybe the director discussing how they went about doing the remake. 2.5/5.0    Overall, I will watch this movie again. This is up there with Statham flicks like Cellular and Chaos but not as cool as say the Transporter movies. 4.25/5.0 for a Statham flick.    Final Verdict: 3.75/5.0 and cos it's Statham I give it 4.0 stars.

B004LQI0HE|2.0|...and hence I simply couldnt enjoy this movie.  I could not for a minute believe that human donor \\"programs\\" would be accepted by any society with not ONE person being rebellious about it.  I also wanted to know more about the program...there was a mention of other schools raising donors in subhuman ways.  I would have been more interested in seeing how the program really worked then looking at the pathetic, doomed, love trio drama.  Acting was ok but the story simply was not in the realm of even faintly plausible.  For me, I need some link to reality in order to enjoy these dystopian type of films.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Khalyn King   6/19/2011   Language Arts P.5   King Kong Honors     King Kong, written by James Creelman and Ruth Rose, is a movie that you won't forget. This astonishing movie won Best Classic Film DVD release in 2006, as well as Best Movie to Watch at a Drive-In theater in the year 2008. The genre of the classic movie is adventure, fantasy, and horror. King Kong, the 1933 version was the first version ever made.     There are many characters in this movie; however the main characters are King Kong, Ann Darrow, Carl Denham and John Driscoll. The story takes place at the location Skull Island. A crew goes on this tropical island for an exotic location to shoot and discover this huge, giant gorilla, who takes interests on their blonde actor. The character, Ann Darrow, is a shy woman who starts out poor in the movie. Then she meets Carl Denham, who people think he's crazy because he will do anything to make a great movie. John Driscoll is the romantic guy in the story and finally King Kong is the villain who is terrifying to all the people.    In the beginning Carl Denham needs to finish his movie at Skull Island but he needs an actress to play the part even if it's dangerous. He eventually finds a beautiful young lady. They sail of to sea to find Skull Island with his crew. In the middle, John Driscoll starts to like Ann Darrow and tells her that he loves her. When she is alone the native people take her away to sacrifice to the huge gorilla. The crew members find out soon and off to the island once again to find there actress. In the end, John Driscoll saves her without the gorilla looking. A few hours later the 30 foot gorilla finds out that Ann Darrow is missing and he is furious. He storms out of his village and tires to get her back. He soon gets her back and takes her on top of the empire state building trying to protect the attractive actress.    Once they take King Kong into New York, He is chained up and is shown to everyone. The gorilla then gets angry and tries to break loose. He does, and tries to get the Ann Darrow back, he looks in apartment buildings and houses and finds her and takes her all the way to the top of the empire state building. John Driscoll then thinks of a plan to stop King Kong from hurting his future wife. He calls out the airplanes to shoot at the beast. After a few blows to the chess and head, the gorilla is then hurt very bad and falls down to the ground and dies. Carl Denham then tells everyone, he did not die of the bullets to his chess, beauty is what killed the beast.   In my opinion, I though the movie was great. The movie had emotion, excitement, and love. The ending is always the best part in movies. In this case, beauty really did kill the beast. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves old, exciting movies.
0316098329|5.0|\\"Stone walls do not a prison make,  Nor iron bars a cage;  Minds innocent and quiet take  That for an hermitage\\"    Richard Lovelace, 1618-1657    A great work of literature which can be read and appreciated on many different levels. On the suface, a psychological thriller, a moving story about love and the mother/son bond, about suffering and the value of freedom; on allegorical levels, about perception, religion, human psychology and the world we live in - or think we live in. You name it, Donoghue has it covered. A classic. As a teacher of literature, I'm longing to study this with young minds and see their eyes widen as we explore the universe inside Room.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Khalyn King  6\19\2011  Language Arts P.5  The Princess and the Frog - Pleasure Book    Amazing, creative, and historical. All these words can explain the Disney movie called The Princess and the Frog. This movie was made in 2009 and received a 7.3 out of 10 rating. It was inspired by E.D. Baker's novel, \\"The Frog Prince\\".   The main characters in this movie where Tiana, Prince Naveen, Dr. Facilier, Louis, Charlotte Labouff, Big Daddy Labouff, and James. This movie took place in New Orleans.   In the beginning, a young girl named Tiana lives in a small house with her mom and dad. Her dads dream was always to have his own restaurant. He passed away before his dream came true, she finally gets enough money but someone else brought the place for more money. In the end gets kissed by a royal frog and eventually ends up liking him and they get married and live happy ever after.   This is a modern day retelling of the classic story of the Frog prince. A young girl named Tiara was a strong woman who never gave up on what she believed in. His goal always was to own the restaurant her dad never had because he passed away. Her mom, Endora, always supported her in anything Tiara wanted to do. She had a good friend named Charlotte Labouff who helped her get her \\"dream place\\". Once Tiara had enough money to buy the place, the owners told her she couldn't buy it because someone offered a higher price. She was depressed but the next day she went to her friend's party. Charlotte is rich and her dad has a lot of money, she gets whatever she wants, and the prince, named Naveen is at her party. She is supposed to get married with the prince until a certain person gets in the way of all that. The prince makes a bad decision and ends up turning into a frog, while Lawrence looks exactly like him. The only way for him to turn back to himself is to kiss a princess. He mistakenly kisses Tiara, thinking that she is a princess, and she turns into a frog as well. Now with the help of a alligator named Louis, a firefly, and an old lady named mama Odie, they dug a little deeper into the heart and realized that they loved eachother. The two frogs end up getting married and both turning human again and living happily ever after.   My opinion on the movie is that it is truly one of a kind. It was unique as well as entertaining. This great movie always kept you thinking what was going to happen next. I recommend this movie to children 15 and below, it reminds me of something I would watch when I was younger. I also recommend this movie to people who enjoy fantasy and happy endings.
B000006O7C|5.0|Jeff Buckley did not like when people obsessed over the young deaths of musicians, (a fact I learned when reading this album's liner notes), so I will try not to do that in this review.     The album Buckley intended to release was \\"My Sweetheart, The Drunk.\\" So, when you listen to \\"Sketches,\\"  be aware that these recordings are as much the album as are sketches to a painting: a preliminary, and incomplete, effort.     Having said that, these are incredible recordings, many of which were recorded with remarkable clarity by Buckley on a 4-track recorder. Listen to this album, start to finish. I promise, when you get to the last track, \\"Satisfied Mind,\\" and when Jeff sings \\"One thing for certain: When it comes my time, I leave this old world with a satisfied mind,\\" you'll find it moving.     These songs are not perfect, but the beauty is in the rawness and the flaws.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|Super 8 is a wild roller coaster ride of a movie!  If the train crash doesn't take all the Oscars, I will be amazed.  I saw it in IMAX & felt like boxcars, oil tankers, & misc. other cars were crashing all around me.  Great movie for adults & older children.  Don't take your younger kids unless you WANT them in your bed for months to come.  The alien is scary when you finally do see it but it is scarier BEFORE you actually see it because of your imagination.  Great summer fun!  Don't miss this movie!
B004V2S4SS|2.0|We watched Medium from the first show. We quit watching several months ago. Patricia Arquette is lousy at showing emotion, which she has to do all the time. Sofia Vassilieva grew into a self-centered young adult. We also got tired of the social mores exhibited in the show. Maybe that's reality, but it wasn't fun to watch anymore.
B004NSULHM|2.0|I loved the last (I think last) Radiohead album (In Rainbows), but I just can't break into this one.  During the inital cacaphony, my mind wanders to more pressing topics such as whether or not my left shoe is more comfortable than the right one.  I've tried listening to the album several times now, but I can't remember a single song.  There's a good chance it gets better further into the tracks, but there's not much incentive to go there versus go to sleep.  Or try to go to sleep, it they would stop making those funny noises and squeals.
B004LROMSY|1.0|This show is terrible.  As in atrocious.  The acting is flat and cheesy.  Either that and they are doing the Joseph Fiennes version of scene chewing over acting.  I have never seen him in worse form.  The sets are obviously sets.  They look like sets from a stage production.  The props were the same as well as the costumes.    I did not mind the re-writes to the plot line of the Camelot/Arthurian legends.  The worse part of it was the 90210 relationship between Arthur and Guinevere.  It not only got to be grating and full of teen style angst, but it took up way to much time on the screen.  Too much kissy kissy, too little of the kingdom building.  There is just not enough interesting character expositions and action.  The characters in short are boring.  Even the King.  Which is really bad.  Because that is who is supposed to be the central character.    The sad thing is that the most interesting plot line with King Lot was stopped much to fast as the just killed him off.  Sad that.  Because Eva Green as Morgan is just boringtown.  I have not seen a more unconvincing villain in a very long time.  She is also chewing some scenery with her over acting.    This show was SO bad that we did not even care to watch the last three episodes.  Which is VERY disappointing because when I first heard about this show I was very very excited as was my wife.  Now was are both disgusted.  We had to go watch Excalibur just to wash the foul taste of Camelot from our mouths.  Very disappointing indeed.  I would give the show no stars if Amazon let me do it.    Spend your time watching other current fantasy genre shows that blow this tripe out of the water in every conceivable way possible.  I know we did.
B003L20IJM|4.0|Emma Thompson is an artist of s many gifts that she defies categorization.  In addition to being one of our best actresses of the day, she is also a very fine writer and not at all afraid of jumping into 'family movies' that bundle fun as well as sage advice.  Her she has written and stars in NANNY MCPHEE RETURNS and lets hope this isn't her last visit.<br /><br />Nanny McPhee appears as a grotesquely ugly woman who arrives in households besotted with potential disasters and in the course of her manipulations of the microcosm that initiated the problems she has a sense of magic in reversing the behavior patterns of children and adults to bring about a happy ending to a crisis waiting to happen.  This trip finds her visiting the farm of Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whose husband (Ewan McGregor) is off at war, leaving the care of the three children and the farm and life in general in her hands.  Add to that the constant interference of Isabel's pestering brother-in-law (Rhys Ifans) and a battery of spoiled cousins and the madness of a misplaced bomb form the sky and Nanny has her hands full teaching the children not only how to cope but also how to behave in a manner that aids Isabel's survival.  Maggie Smith joins this irrepressible cast and in the end it is difficult to judge what entertains most - the madness or the glee.  Deep it is not, but it is one of those films you can slip into the telly and enjoy as much as an adult as the youngsters adore it. Fantasy, a bit of family drama, and a lot of fine lessons make this a fluffy movie nearly everyone can enjoy. Grady Harp, June 11
0307279189|5.0|My husband runs.  I do not.  I read.  My husband does not.  So I read this book and told him all about it so he could enjoy it as well.  I loved the stories and adventures and I actually learned a few things.  They sold me on the barefoot running.  If I were a runner I would wear those little rubber sock shoes!  This is not just a book for runners.  It is very enjoyable.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I can't add much to what's already been said, so I'll just list some of my thoughts on pros & cons:    Pros:  - heavy! 1/4\\" thick blade.  great for everything from splitting wood to whittling to prying open car doors.  - well balanced, decent chopper.  - very sharp out of the box.  i won't say razor sharp, but does pop arm hairs.  - handle is very ergonomic  - well designed ambidextrous sheath.  holds VERY tight even without the handle snap.  - i'm sure this thing would last many generations if cared for.  - extended pommel is a nice feature.  - looks intimidating as hell.    Cons:  - heavy!  i might choose a different knife if i were counting ounces for a backpacking trek.  - a bit short for serious chopping (though i don't use knives for that anyway).  - handle is a bit slick when wet.  could use a nice checkered texture.  - too heavy and a bit short for a fighter, but that's not why you buy it anyway.    All in all, I love this thing.  No regrets.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I really wanted to like this headset. However, with distorted lows and a high price tag with constant dropping and short range... leaves you wanting something else.<br /><br />The Pro's.<br /><br />The G keys and push to talk in vent. It is so nice to be able to walk away from your keyboard and chat with your friends without having to set your Ventrilo to activate on voice. I wish more companies would include this!<br />The mic quality is pretty good, and they do look very nice on your head... although sometimes a bit heavy for some people.<br />Battery life is pretty good and the phones charge fast.<br /><br />The Downside.<br /><br />The range is worse than the Creative WoW headset and tends to have problems syncing with programs often.<br />With Ventrilo often times you have to unplug your dongle from the computer and replug it in.<br />If you play shooters or listen to classical music (of which a lot of games have anyway) any really low bass<br />completely distorts out. This makes for a very annoying game immersion when it sounds like a cheap stereo strapped to you head.<br />Lowering the volume and mixing down the bass helps but still >.&lt;<br />Construction although looks nice, its still a lot of plastic.<br /><br />Overall if you like your bass and games with volume... I wouldn't take these.

B004GHNHVW|5.0|I must say that \\"Dazzling Blue\\" is perhaps one of the greatest songs he has composed. There are so many layers to the song, and the instruments are beautiful. I will admit that some of the songs on \\"So Beautiful\\" do not have a true \\"melody\\", but \\"Dazzling Blue\\" is a song that should be admired for its complexity and musicality. \\"Graceland\\" is my favorite album ever made, and it makes me happy to know that even at his age, Simon is still composing awe-inspiring music. The mixture of sounds that he brings to this album make it truly brilliant. Once you listen to the songs multiple times, you will come to love this album.

0143036424|1.0|Tony Hillerman wrote wonderful colorful mysteries set in the four corners area of the U.S. He told us about Navajo customs and local color but wove it into his story. I thought Craig Johnson would be a similar kind of writer, but am greatly disappointed.  He just goes on and on and on until I wonder if the mystery is ever going to develop. I enjoy local color as part of the story, not the story itself.  I am reading The Cold Dish and listening to Death Without Company and find both of them boring.
B004132HZS|5.0|From whatever perspective you choose to watch this series from it's smart, witty, and all around entertaining. The plot and storylines are nicely adapted without trying to overdo things, and the characters each have suprising depth making them truly believable.     Sherlock is handled nicely by Benedict Cumberbatch. He is as anti-social and cold as he is giddy and endearing. Martin Freeman plays John Watson with a bolder twist. While he does support Sherlock in his endeavors, he is also a capable stand alone character. I've heard some people think this was a strange way to go about handling the re-creation of Watson's character, but I for one absolutely love it. Overall, the acting is superb.    Many of us are waiting for Season two! Congratulations Sherlock. In just three episodes you managed to create a worldwide (and sometimes foaming at the mouth) legion of dedicated fans. We can't wait to see what's next!

1594202842|5.0|After all the controversy, I didn't know what to expect from this book.  I was delighted to find it to be an easy, humorous, and elegant read.  Not only that, but the author's perspective is balanced and culturally accurate.  A perfect book for those believe that hard work prevails over fun, and for those who remain unsatisfied with average results from sustained effort.

0143039601|3.0|Jack Keroauc's 1959 novel THE DHARMA BUMS is a lightly fictionalized account of the author's friendship with the poet Gary Snyder among an underground literary scene fascinated with Buddhism.<br /><br />In the mid-Fifties, the nomadic writer Ray Smith comes to San Francisco and meets the Buddhist hipster Japhy Ryder. Their backgrounds could not be more different, as Smith is an alcoholic, urban East Coast figure while Ryder grew up in the forests of the Northwest and finds his highs in nature. Ryder introduces Smith to mountain climbing and wilderness survival, a more rigorous study of Buddhism than just a few pithy tropes, and a sexual openness that looks forward to the late 1960s. As much as Smith appreciates Ryder's example, he is reluctant to adopt more from Buddhism than what he can reconcile with his deep (albeit troubled) Catholicism, and his alcoholism persists through the novel in a poignant way.<br /><br />The novel is written in Kerouac's characteristic \\"spontaneous prose\\", a rambling, somewhat zany way of storytelling that eschews cautious rewriting or editing. I must admit I don't care much for Kerouac's style. Furthermore, the dramatic flow of the book isn't particularly compelling until the last ten pages or so, where Smith takes Ryder's advice and spends a summer in mountain solitude as a fire lookout in Washington.<br /><br />For me the book's interest lies in its documentation of a certain Zeitgeist. The Beats had become mad about Buddhism, but with decades of hindsight, one can see how -- as much as they filled their conversations with koans and exhortations to mindfullness -- most of them greatly misunderstood various schools of Buddhism. As a more or less full-time hitchhiker, I enjoyed Kerouac's detailed accounts of 1950s hitchhiking and train hopping, and you can still glean practical advice from the book that is useful today.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Wow! I read most of the books a number of years ago and wasn't sure if this was something that would translate well to the screen. It does. This is visually captivating. The script is excellent. These were some very long books & I thought they did a great job of boiling it down to the essentials. I found the set creation and filming life like. It's is also filmed so beautifully that it's worth watching just for the visual effect. There are some superb actors in this as well. Everyone delivers a captivating performance - not a false note in the lot. It is violent & not for the feint of heart. For those of you that aren't deterred by that, sit back & enjoy. I'm just sorry that it wasn't longer.
0316098329|4.0|With Room, Emma Donoghue set out to do something quite difficult, write a full-length thriller entirely from the point-of-view (and in the words) of a five-year-old child.  And not just any five-year-old - this little boy has spent literally every single moment of his life confined to the 121 square foot room in which he was born.  The only window in the room is a skylight through which he occasionally gets a glimpse of the sun or moon, or the leaves that fall onto it once in a great while.  The only person he has ever spoken to is his mother, although the boy does sometimes gets a sneak peak at Old Nick from the wardrobe in which he hides when Nick comes to visit Ma late at night.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Jack, his mother has not seen the outside of Room for the seven years she has been Old Nick's prisoner.  Without Jack, Ma would have no reason to go on living.  She has created an entire world for the boy inside this small space, a world in which she is the source of all knowledge, love, and support.  The outside world makes its way into Room only because Old Nick allows the pair a small television set, but Ma is the one who decides what Jack will watch and how what he sees will be interpreted for him.  Imagine a world in which Room is all that is real, and everything seen on television is make-believe.  That is the way Jack sees the world.<br /><br />Room reaches the gut-wrenching stage when Ma decides that it is time to escape the little prison in which she and her son have been trapped for so long.  Try as she might to come up with alternate plans, escape seems impossible without Jack's willingness to face Old Nick.  But even if she is able to convince Jack to go along with her plan, Ma knows that they will have only one shot at escaping Old Nick; failure means death for both of them.<br /><br />For the most part, Donogue's idea to filter what the reader knows and sees through the eyes of a small boy works remarkably well.  One comes to admire Ma, as seen through his innocent eyes, as she seeks new ways to educate and entertain her young son; the woman takes recycling to a high level as she creates toys for her son from every bit of packaging material that Old Nick allows to enter Room.  Part of the fun, too, comes from following Jack's evolving logic as he combines what he sees on television and reads in his little books with what his mother tells him about the world.  Through Jack's innocent eyes, often come basic life truths that adults sometime have forgotten.<br /><br />Having Jack narrate Room generally works pretty well for Donoghue.  There is more of a problem with the key element in the book's plot, something most readers are likely to find it difficult to believe would be possible knowing what they know about Jack.  It is a plot twist I cannot discuss in any detail because doing so would require me to reveal the book's biggest spoiler.  However, Room is so unusual that I am perfectly willing to put aside plot details if that allows me to get inside Jack and Ma's world for a few hours.  This one is definitely worth a look.as she seeks new ways to educate and entertain her young son; the woman takes recycling to a high level as she creates toys for her son from every bit of packaging material that Old Nick allows to enter Room.

1416550550|5.0|Beautifully written Gothic Victorian fairy tale. Morton uses a unique conceit here of jumping around in time - always telling you the date first so you know what part of the story you are in - and switching amongst various characters as the narrator. Smart and fun. It took a few pages to get used to, but she's piecing together a mystery that happened around 1913 as figured out partially by someone around 1975 and fully figured out by that woman's granddaughter in 2005. It's not as complicated as it sounds. I couldn't put the book down. The characters are perfection and the landscapes are well drawn. Loved it!!! I'm off to read more Kate Morton!

B0043RT8E0|5.0|This book is powerful - potentially! You see, this isn't another cookbook with recipes on how to get rich (fast), happy (now) or immensely creative in five easy steps. Those looking for that sort of approach will be disappointed. Instead it offers some insights with enormous implications - potentially (we'll get to the \\"potential\\" part in a minute).   The basic argument in the book is that if you can't find your true calling - your element - then chances are high you'll not live a fulfilling life. In fact there's a good chance you'll merely endure it.  From there Sir Ken takes the reader through a series of illustrative stories of people who have successfully found their element. And how that enriched their lives - as well as that of countless others around them. (you'll also find that none of them did what they did for the money. Often quite the contrary! But they all got to be free of financial worries and wants anyway. A bonus they didn't ask for)  In addition he is suggesting ways you could go look for your passion, although it must be said the trees do not grow into the heavens. There's a reason for that: If there were such a thing as a ready-made recipe for finding ones passion then someone would have published it already. And it would work every single time ... right?   Sir Ken believes that our current educational system is for a large part responsible for people not finding their element. That is why he spends a great deal of time trying to take you back and show you how it could have been. That once, back in the shrouded memory of your childhood and passage through school, you were passionate - about many things. Or perhaps just one thing. He wants you to pick up from there and see if that possibly leads you onto your element.   So this book is only potentially powerful because it leaves you with all the hard work: 1) Finding your passion and 2) Muster the courage to change your life accordingly.   So, I rate this book five stars because it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. And this little candle could well start a fire!

B00532A8JI|5.0|My only previous experience with Symphony X was V: The New Mythology Suite, which I picked up 10 years ago after reading several stellar review. For reasons I have mostly forgotten, the album did not click with me and I made a mental note that Symphony X was not the band for me.    I stumbled upon streams of The End of Innocence and Dehumanized last week and immediately knew that I was going to give Symphony X another chance with this new album. After hearing the entire album I am blown away by how good it is. The album is heavy, aggressive and dark. It gets right up in your faces and doesn't let go for 80 minutes. It combines power metal, progressive metal and symphonic rock. Despite how heavy the album is, the production is excellent, the sound is crisp and the music is accessible. It is filled with crunching riffs, great solos, soaring vocals and all kinds of hooks.    This is a concept album that appears loosely tied around a story involving the fall of mankind in a future war against machines. It has a bit of a Terminator vibe to it. I sense the band is trying to warn against losing our humanity to science and technology. The lyrics are occasionally a bit cheesy but the music is so good it hardly matters. The lead singer does an amazing job of communicating the emotion of the story through his singing. I am not one who generally likes singers who growl or scream the lyrics, but, in this case, even the growled vocals sound great.      There is not a bad song on the entire album. If I had to pick favorites I might chose Electric Messiah, The Lords of Chaos and Reign In Madness. My one complaint is that listening to the entire album can be draining as it almost never lets up. The only song that slows things down a bit is When All Is Lost, which is perhaps the most progressive song on the album.    Highly recommended!

6304806418|5.0|This is certainly one of my all-time favorite movies. I watched it in my Spanish class and fell in love, then went home and bought it on Amazon! I share tons of inside jokes from this movie with my friends and I even have the soundtrack, which I love just as much. The music is simply amazing and catchy, and the best you will ever see/hear of the Evita broadway musical. If you love Madonna, you will love this movie. If you don't love Madonna, you will fall in love with her after watching this movie. This is her best work of her lifetime, hands-down. Madonna herself even agrees (via an interview)! For those who aren't used to watching musicals, you might find this movie weird at first; but watch through the whole thing and you'll realize how great it is and want to watch it again and again :) So in a nutshell, this movie is the best performance and interpretation of Evita, the music is epic, and you will love it forever. For $5 you can get a priceless work of true artistry.
0515141429|5.0|This book grabbed me and never let go.  Each time it seemed like something was resolved or it wasn't getting resolved - BANG - he grabbed you and the momentum simply accelerated again.  I've read five or six of his later books and I enjoyed every one, but this one is by far the best one of all.  The Jack Reacher character is unusual, but certainly not unique.  In this book, however, the situation seems to get more complex as he moves along and each time you think you've figured it all out, well, think again.  Lee Child has become one of my favorite authors and if you have any reason to doubt my judgment, read this book and you'll understand why I feel this way.  I rate this one as a full TEN.

B004TJ1H3C|4.0|Here the cast is a lot more stable (granted the show was only two seasons), if also somewhat larger. The one thing this show lacks is a really charismatic character. Scott is the closest we see, but his introduction (sex with fellow soldier, Vanessa James) somehow seemed off. I know that this show is meant to be grittier and darker than its predecessors, but perhaps they overdid it a little with this cast. I dislike Chloe who seems sort of personality-less to me and there are too many unstable-seeming characters otherwise (Young, Rush, Greer, even Wray but in a different way). We don't really get to know TJ well enough. Eli is the other character that draws you in and he does a pretty good job (I was devastated by the loss of Ginn, but maybe because I liked her more than the rest of the cast), but it also seems a little too easy for him to do everything. I know he's a super-genius, but really, he has never seen alien technology before.    This show is reminiscent of Voyager, which immediately gives it a special place for me (you know, the whole stranded in the other side of the galaxy, trying to get home thing). Even more fascinating is that, where Voyager had Janeway as an obvious and able leader, Universe has no one who is quite fit to lead. This leads to constant battles for control of the ship, especially when Stargate Command back at home, along with the IOA, attempts to give them control. I'm surprised by the fact that there has been less rebellion against the folks back home. Even in Voyager Janeway strayed away from proper protocol and she was super concerned with the Federation's rules. Only once did Young say \\"I'm not taking commands from people on the other side of the universe\\" and he still ended up doing what they wanted.    It makes a big issue of justice and authority, which is fascinating given their circumstances and while I am not entirely clear on when they figured out how to work the communication stones, I love the way they utilize them to bringthe characters back home every so often. I'm not sure that the impending threat of a Lucian Alliance attack works the way they want it to, but otherwise, I love hearing orders come from Earth, always daring for the moment when someone says, \\"let's be honest, I'm never going to be back home again, I don't care what you say. and if by some chance I do make it home, I'll say I had a nervous breakdown or something for extenuating circumstances.\\" i wonder why they never propose a multi-leader situation, where Young is in charge of security, Rush (or maybe someone else) is in charge of technology, and Camille (or a voted on representative) represents the rest, so that they can discuss things that are more general lifestyle issues (such as should anyone be allowed to stay behind on the planet) and should some, if any, of the Lucian Alliance people be allowed out of confinement, etc. It's also funny that Young gets angry when Scott says he should have been informed that the only way to break David's mind control was to kill him and bring him back. He's all, \\"so you will only obey me if I explain myself?\\" and I'm all \\"soldiers aren't supposed to let their commanding officers murder people just because they feel like it, so in this case, yes, you should be explaining.\\"    We get our SG-1 favorites every so often, which is always nice, though I dislike how O'Niell is represented in this season, forgoing all the rule-breaking for right that we have gotten to know him for.    I personally love this darker series, even though I don't particularly love the cast/crew. It's such a shame that it was cancelled so early on, when it had so much more potential for a story (though the plan for Destiny to go looking for aliens that pre-existed the creation of the universe...eh).
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game gets 5/5.  Awesome game, not much needs to be said about it.    Needing wifi gets 1/5.  Why do I need wifi to download it?  I don't care how long it takes.  I don't care if it fails and I have to restart the download.  I have unlimited data, so I don't care about the amount of data I'm downloading.  So why not give me the option to download over 3G?
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I've made a long list of shows that I want to watch from beginning to end (some that I have seen before, some that I have heard are excellent but have missed for some reason) and the first on this long list is The West Wing. Somehow, I completely missed this show while it was on. To be fair, I wasn't even in high school when it started. but now that I've finally gotten the chance, I know what I was missing out on.    The West Wing follows President Jed Bartlet and his staff as they navigate the politics, drama, and disasters that happen when you run a country. Though the politics plays an enormous part of the show, the characters are what truly makes it great.        Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen)- The principled, ever hopeful and all but unstoppable president. Most of the time the president is astounding us by his unshakeable faith in mankind and America, but meanwhile, he was keeping an enormous secret from the American people: he had remitting relapsing multiple sclerosis. His illness adds another layer to an already inspiring and complex person. His wife, Abigail, who helped him cover up his illness thanks to her doctor credentials, is an essential part of his character. She is strong and opinionated (played by Stockard Channing).      Leo McGarry (Josh Spencer)- the chief of staff (and later democratic nominee for vice president) and the moral center of the show when the president could not be. One of McGarry's struggles throughout the show was his alcoholism and later, his health issues. [Spoiler: Spencer died in the middle of the final season and the show did an excellent job of handling his death tastefully and emotionally.]      CJ Cregg (Allison Janney)- originally press secretary and later chief of staff, Cregg was easily one of my favorite characters on the show. Maybe it was her quick wit or her unshakability despite everything she had to deal with (being kept in the dark before briefing the press, the president's illness, multiple security leaks, etc). Herbiggest personal trials included her father's alzheimer's and her romantic life.      Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff)- Communications director and perhaps one of my least favorite characters on the show. I think I disliked him for the same reason his ex-wife did: he was too sad all the time. He was very sweet with his twins and seeing him coached by Kristin Chenowith to be the new press secretary when Cregg becomes chief of staff was pretty funny, but that's about it.      Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford)- Deputy Chief of Staff for Bartlet and later Campaign Manager and Chief of staff for the next president, Josh was the cocky sort of ladies man. I say sort of because he didn't really seem to quite know what to do with the women who were attracted to him. (One particularly fun relationship was between him and Mary Louise Parker's character, Amy Gardner, though we always knew he would end up with longtime secretary Donna Moss.) despite his arrogance, he's a fighter and does not easily give up. He fought an uphill battle to secure Matthew Santos the next presidency.      Donna Moss (Janel Maloney)- originally senior assistant to Josh, she later becomes a spokesperson and then chief of staff to the first lady. Donna is another enjoyable character on the show. Donna's main story lines revolve around her interactions with Josh but she's always been able to hold her own against his craziness.      Charlie Young (Dule Hill)- he starts off as the personal aide to the president but ultimately becomes deputy special assistant to CJ when she is chief of staff. Charlie's mother was a police officer killed in the line of duty and gets a job to help care for his sister. One of his biggest plots revolves around his relationship with the president's youngest daughter Zoe which leads to hate mail and an assassination attempt. he is another one of my favorites.    Some other excellent actors, who were not in the show for the full duration, include Rob Lowe, Joshua Malina, Mary McCormack,Kristin Chenoweth, Jimmy Smits, Alan Alda, Emily Procter, Janeanne Garofolo, Matthew Perry, Lisa Edelstein, Marlee Maitlin, and Mark Fuerstein. The list is long and the amount of people we must deal with and remember is even longer. Where this normally bothers me in any other show, I didn't mind the large cast here. It made it more believable because these were real positions that would be filled in a real White House, rather than combining people for simplicity's sake. Plus, anyone who has every become anyone seems to have been on the show at one point or another.    As the show tried to transition out of the Bartlet presidency and into the next president, the show seemed to lose some steam. It was split between the current president and the presidential campaign, which meant dividing our attention between the cast we had come to love and all the candidates for president plus their campaign staffs. But though at first this was annoying, the new characters grew on me and eventually I found myself really liking Matt Santos and his wife Helen and truly caring about the outcome of the election that had originally felt like a distraction.    The West Wing ended up being one of my favorite shows that I have seen in a long time. I can only hope they make another show like this sometime soon.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|What I liked about this movie is beautiful costumes, scenery, castles, etc. What I didn't, that many historical facts were missrepresented. Mary didn't visit her sister before her death; even though Anne was accused of incest, that was just a way for the king to marry his mistress with hopes to have a male heir. The king is shown as a guy overcome with passion for the evil calculating woman, but he had his motives for the male legite son in mind, when he anulled his marriage to marry Anne.And he married a few times after that too. Ironically, he did get his male heir, but he died too early to actually rule- even though officially he was a king for a while.    To sum up- too much drama, too little historic truth, but lots of beauty.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|The funny thing about this show is that I really wasn't into it the first time I watched it. At the time, it didn't feel like there was a bigger back story. It just felt like the standard fantasy procedural where the characters go out, investigate some strange incident, and solve the problem by fighting some demon or another. I'm not sure why that bothered me, since there are so many shows like this and I actually enjoy most of them. Which might be why I decided to give it another try.    I have now watched the entire show to date and I'm glad I did. It turns out, there definitely was a bigger story going on-yellow eyes, Sam's demonic abilities, Dean's role in the apocalypse, oh right...and the apocalypse. It turns out that what I like most about the series is, in fact, those very things that I thought the show was missing. Where some fantasy shows struggle to build from one season to the next-how bad can things get after all?-this show has done an excellent job of making on season impact the next one so that to every action there is a bigger reaction coming. (See the end of this season, where we meet God, sort of.)    Supernatural follows Sam and Dean, two brothers who have grown up, raised by their father in the rough world of demon hunting after their mother is killed by a demon with yellow eyes. Sam attempts to leave this life to go to college, only to be pulled back in when his girlfriend is killed the same way.    The show has struggled over the years to add in a few more characters. In came:        Ruby, a demon who seems to be on the side of good      Bobby Singer, a fellow hunter and father figure in the boys' lives      Ellen and Jo- Ellen is a saloon owner who is constantly in contact with hunters and Jo who becomes a hunter      Bela, a self-centered thief      Castiel, an arch-angel who becomes an ally      Anna, a fallen angel who eventually gains her wings again    These are some of the bigger characters who have come into the story at some point or another. Bobby's introduction originally felt forced and abrupt but he has since better integrated into the show and now feels like a good fit. The need for important characters also comes from a lack of tension-there is no chance that the brothers can be killed off so we have to care about others who might be killed.    One of the big issues about the show is that we have essentially seen that death is not really ever permanent. There are a myriad of ways in which a person might be resurrected. Because of this, we can never really be sad when someone dies and the fear that we might lose someone is never really there. This, in my opinion, is one of the primary issues with sci-fi and fantasy in general (think about Stargate SG-1 where Daniel dies every few episodes). It lowers the stakes of any problems happening. Despite this problem, the show has managed to make things build up from season to season. Even now, when you start wondering how we could have gotten bigger than the coming of Lucifer, we learn that there can be bigger problems.    There is also a general lack of female characters (which is where Bela and Ruby came in). It would be nice to have a bit more female energy on the show. The writers seem to be struggling with this. They are never really satisfied with their female characters and therefore none have stayed so far. I'm hoping they manage this eventually (I liked Jo, Ruby, and Anna personally but supposedly other viewers did not). I am hoping they will find and stick to one or two, perhaps someone who is equal to the brothers and not someone who needs protecting (like Dean's most recent love interest).    Castiel wound up being one of the most interesting characters on the show, as we watched him grow from an unquestioning angel to someone who has come to question, think, and act of his own volition. interestingly, this is what leads to the issue of the coming season. The brothers are often self-centered and it is this lack of paying attention to others that ultimately leads to Castiel's wild behavior.    I like how far the show's mythology has gone and I am curious to see where they plan to take things. At the same time, it does feel like the show is winding down. I am not sure how much longer it can run.
0062060554|5.0|Absolutely stupendous!  I started this book at midnight and finally had to force myself to stop at 5 am.  It's one of those books that you won't want to put down and you don't want it to end. And the ending....WOW....it's one of those big twists that you don't see coming.   I eagerly await another title by this author. So get busy and write Watson!!!!
B000E41MS6|4.0|A couple of weeks ago, my father kept bugging me about a show he'd recently discovered: Doctor Who. A friend had recommended the show to me over the summer and I tried it but found myself unable to get through episode one. I found the graphics and the acting to be sub-par. But my dad kept talking about it. And I mean KEPT. Like brought it up every day on our morning bus ride to the city. I told him I didn't like to watch shows not from the beginning (which would be quite a trick since the show started back in the 1960s and has been on and off since, being most recently rejuvenated in 2005). Finally, after he'd driven me crazy for...a few days, I agreed to watch the show, starting from the beginning of 2005 (he said you can start with 2010, but that's not my style).    I'm glad I did because once I watched for a bit longer, I found myself actually enjoying it. Sure, the acting isn't the greatest (I often find that British shows don't have the best acting) and the special effects are greatly lacking (some of it is so incredibly old fashioned to the point where things that should be creepy feel more silly than creepy-I know sometimes they're staying true to the original series, but couldn't the Daleks have done with an upgrade?), but for some reason it's still pretty addictive.    I think that discovering that Billie Piper of The Secret Diary of a Call Girl was the first of the companions amused me enough to give it a chance.    The show, it turns out, is fairly clever. Sometimes the cleverness has to do with plays on history (such as meeting Agatha Christie and resolving the question of where she was for the seven days that she couldn't remember and having her think she failed as a writer) and other times it has to do with the characters.    Considering the number of changes in the Doctor's companion, they do a good job of integrating each new personality so that it actually feels like they are close to the Doctor. Some are better than others of course, but always youcan feel the bond that is developed.    I think the thing I like best about the show is the way they handle serious issues, (SPOILER) such as the departure of Rose (giving a plausible explanation without killing her while keeping her relevant, at least for season three) and the Doctor's Daughter. I wish they did more in terms of letting us know about the Doctor, though I get that the point is that we don't know a lot. They slowly build information over the course of the show and we learn something new about him all the time.    I'm only mid-season four so I can't wait to see where things go. I've heard good things about the episode I'm up to (The Library).    I also particularly like how many episode are joint episodes, spanning two, sometimes even three, episodes per arc. It really allows you to get involved and to care about the characters, even when they are temporary.    The concept of time travel is a complicated and confusing one, which has yet to satisfactorily be explained. You can't change events that are fixed but some are in flux and those ones can be changed. How do you determine one over the other? The Doctor knows. Not the most satisfactory answer. It may be further addressed later, but seeing as I'm pretty far into the show, I don't think so.
B004N44SOI|5.0|I think this turned out the best cd from Sixx A.M. The first week i got it i couldn't stop playing and replaying it. Its that good.

B000R02K6A|5.0|When Brave New World was released I was impressed at how well the album was done. Even though I bought the CD when it came out I doubted Maiden had it in them anymore. I thought, \\"Here is a band past their prime looking for a cash grab\\". I decided to buy the CD anyhow and Oh how wrong I was! Brave new World was an attention getter. Iron Maiden was serving notice to the world that they were back and meant buisness!<br /><br /> On Maidens next CD I heard so many bad things ranging from the CD cover to the music itself that I figured it was a bad CD. (I for one love the CD cover. It remindes me of the Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut) I didnt buy the CD when it came out. I waited almost two years after it was released before I bought it. I saw it at a record store for $4.99. I thought, \\"What the heck?\\" Even if its bad I really havent lost much. I put the CD in on the way home and immediatly fell in love! From the opening track Wildest Dreams I was hooked! Rainmaker, Montsegur, Dance of Death, New Frontier, Journeyman, and one of my all time favorite Maiden songs, Pashendale! I had heard about how weak this album was. How there were \\"weak\\" tracks on it. I listened to the hype and almost missed out on one of Maidens strongest releases. After this I remember thinking \\"I wont doubt them again\\"<br /><br /> It wasnt until 2011, just before the release of Final Frontier, that I bought A Matter of Life and Death. Yeah, I know, I doubted them again. I dont know why I did either? AMOLAD had won album of the year in 2006 when it came out. (by Metal Storm and Metal Maniacs) There was alot of good reviews about it. However, there were alot of bad ones also.<br /> I guess I thought \\"Can Maiden really keep it up?\\" How can these guys keep getting better? There has to be a day they will slack off and make a bad CD. HA! Fat chance! No, instead they made the second best CD to 7th Son. 7th son was their masterpiece. Most bands, no matter how long they are together, usually only get one masterpiece, if they are lucky. How can you expect a band to have two? Well as hard as it may seem to be to believe, Iron Maiden has done it again.<br /><br /> I've been listening to Iron maiden since 1983 so I could say I'm a connoisseur of sorts. No expert, but very familiar with them. I grew up listening to such albums like Killers, Number of the Beast, Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, and 7th Son. Just those five albums alone are some of the best albums/songs released in the 80s. You cant go wrong with any of them. This is the standard I hold Maiden to, these five albums. (Apparently they hold themselves to that same standard also)<br /> So for about five years I was unaware that Maiden had released another masterpiece. That was until Amazon had a sale and I got AMOLAD for $5.99! What a deal!(Thanks Amazon!)From the first listen the whole thing really didnt jive with me. But there was something about it that kept me listening.<br /> The biggest thing that jumped out at me at first was the thick bass in this one. Im a huge bass guy so this kept me interested. Steve Harris really laid it down in this one. (He really tears it up in Lord of Light!) A bold move on Maidens part. But It really sets the tone for the whole album.<br /><br /> There were people who bashed the production of this CD. I'm not sure if they think the production was \\"bad\\" because of the heavy bass on this album, or what? But I really dont know how much better of a production you can get? Everything is at an even keel. Not too much of one thing or not enough of another. Maiden was on their A game here and knew exactly what they wanted. And they got it.<br /> I remember reading a review about AMOLAD. In it a man claimed that Mr. Dickinson spent way too much time in the high range. If you say this Sir then you couldnt have listened to the CD. Dickison's voice ranges from some highs too alot of lows. Done perfectly. He does some things I havent heard him do before. His vocals on For the Greater Goodof God kept me listening from the beginning. The way he does the chorus for that song really caught my attention. Some have said that Mr. Dickinson's vocals weren't as strong as they once were. I say nonsense! What he does on The Longest Day shows proof that his range is intact.<br /><br /> I'm sure most people who have bashed this record arent \\"true\\" fans of the band. By true I mean the ones that know Maiden for what they are. A band that makes Epic songs. Some call it progressive. Regardless of what you call it the fact remains that Maiden has the ability to make a 9 minute song seem like four. The songs dont \\"drag\\" on as one might think because of their length. This is what the true Maiden fans look for. Not saying we dont like the radio friendly tunes but \\"epic\\" ones are the real gems here. And AMOLAD has plenty of them!<br /><br /> The other fans are the ones that as soon as they dont hear Run to the Hills, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Wasted Years, or Can I Play with Madness they dismiss it as a failure. They dont want to take the time to understand what Maiden is doing on this album. And what are they doing? Setting a somber mood. I remember thinking when I first started to listen to this CD was that all the songs sounded alike. It would be easy to quickly write off this album because of this.<br /> But this is not an album that your going to \\"get\\" the first or second listen. Ive listened to it at least two dozen times and things are still setting in me. It's alot to take in. Theres so much that there is no way possible to absorb everything in a few listens. This is definatly a grower and lengthens the life of the CD. Your more likely to listen to it more often just so you can wrap your head around everything. I started by listening to it every other day then it grew to a couple times a day. Then it was three or four times a day. I'm still picking up on things I haven't picked up before. It will be at the top of my rotation for a long time (like 7th Son did for three years after it came out)<br /><br /> If your looking for killer solos then you need to look no further. AMOLAD is chock full of them. Inspiring solos! I'm not quite sure where the inspiration came from on this CD. There are some real eye opening solos here. I havent heard so much inspiration since 7th Son! These solos that can be missed though, due to everything else going on. Especially the whole mood that Maiden had set on this record. It sucks you in and almost puts you in a trance. Your so enthralled with the mood you miss some things like the solos. Another distracter is the songs. You get so involved with what Mr. Dickinson is singing about that you could miss a solo. Not to mention other things like the well placed synths. (Just like they were in Pashendale and Dance of Death)<br /> Drums? I seriously thought Niko McBrain had been replaced with someone else. He is stellar! He also is inspired! I never knew how talented this guy was. Bravo! Mr. McBrain.<br /><br /> All in all this CD proves Iron Maiden hasent given up on crafting excellent songs. After all these years they still have \\"it\\". Since their \\"reunion\\" they have progressivly gotten better with every release. Now with everything positive I've heard about Final Frontier I look forward to buying that CD. By that time Iron Maiden will probably have released another CD. If thats how it is, so be it! I know I'll have alot of enjoyment in the time I'm using to catch up!<br /> And let it be known from this day forth I will never doubt Iron Maiden again.The way he does the chorus for that song really caught my attention. Some have said that Mr. Dickinson's vocals weren't as strong as they once were. I say nonsense! What he does on The Longest Day shows proof that his range is intact.

Theres so much that there is no way possible to absorb everything in a few listens. This is definatly a grower and lengthens the life of the CD. Your more likely to listen to it more often just so you can wrap your head around everything. I started by listening to it every other day then it grew to a couple times a day. Then it was three or four times a day. I'm still picking up on things I haven't picked up before. It will be at the top of my rotation for a long time (like 7th Son did for three years after it came out)     If your looking for killer solos then you need to look no further. AMOLAD is chock full of them. Inspiring solos! I'm not quite sure where the inspiration came from on this CD. There are some real eye opening solos here. I havent heard so much inspiration since 7th Son! These solos that can be missed though, due to everything else going on. Especially the whole mood that Maiden had set on this record. It sucks you in and almost puts you in a trance. Your so enthralled with the mood you miss some things like the solos. Another distracter is the songs. You get so involved with what Mr. Dickinson is singing about that you could miss a solo. Not to mention other things like the well placed synths. (Just like they were in Pashendale and Dance of Death)    Drums? I seriously thought Niko McBrain had been replaced with someone else. He is stellar! He also is inspired! I never knew how talented this guy was. Bravo! Mr. McBrain.     All in all this CD proves Iron Maiden hasent given up on crafting excellent songs. After all these years they still have \\"it\\". Since their \\"reunion\\" they have progressivly gotten better with every release. Now with everything positive I've heard about Final Frontier I look forward to buying that CD. By that time Iron Maiden will probably have released another CD. If thats how it is, so be it! I know I'll have alot of enjoyment in the time I'm using to catch up!    And let it be known from this day forth I will never doubt Iron Maiden again.
1849162743|5.0|Okay maybe not the best but a strong ending to an epic adventure.  Wish I could meet a girl like this.  If you haven't read the first two books, don't read this one yet.  Read them in order and savor the literary genius that is Stieg Larsson.
B0056369RO|5.0|This album was awesome!!! You gotta get the deluxe version all of the songs are really good and LMFAO deliver a great follow up album. Stand out tracks are put that ass to work, one day, and with you! Fun feel good music
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Take one of the best electronic/techno groups out there and tell them to compose the soundtrack to a tech junkie, throw back great movies of all time and you get something wonderful.  If you can't see the scenes of the movie while listening to the soundtrack you missed something awesome.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Watched this production on PBS and had to have the DVD so I can enjoy it over and over!!  I have a copy of the 10th Anniversary ('Dream Cast') addition and was hesitant to even watch the 25th Anniversary thinking it wouldn't compare.  But I was wrong. This production includes additional songs, cast, and acting parts giving the story more depth. LOVE IT. Although I missed Colm Wilkinson and Michael Ball, I was happy to see Lea Salonga (as Fantine) and grew to love Alfie Boe (Jean Valjean), Samantha Barks (Eponine), and Katie Hall (Cosette)! Nick Jonas (Marius) doesn't have the power to his voice that Michael Ball has, but I enjoyed his performance anyway.  Definately worth purchasing!!
B004UOE7VA|5.0|Put them together and you got yourself a great movie and sound track.  Loved the movie and soundtrack from beginning to end.  The remixes are just that much cooler.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Fantastic workout video... Dose a great job with the levels. Easy to do, easy to follow and yet a very hard workout!!  Because it is only 30 minites it really takes the pressure off...   LOVE IT!
B001TODO54|5.0|With 422 reviews, this book probably doesn't need another...!  But I feel compelled, because this was my absolute favorite book of last year. I'll skip the plot summary as you've already read it...  Katsa is such a great role model for young women: she's independent, and tough yet incredibly compassionate. For me, this is what puts this book head and shoulders above other fantasy novels - yes, there are other heroines out there, but I LOVED Katsa's single-mindedness, even through her confusion about who she is. She was really strong, not just in her commitment to helping others but in her choices for herself.   *SPOILER ALERT* In most YA novels with a romance, the girl and the guy end up together. Happily ever after, hand and hand into the sunset. I LOVED that Katsa chose to be on her own at the end! That was so refreshingly different! I wish there were way more YA novels where the girl's happiness isn't dependent on the guy. Hopefully this book will blaze a trail!  The writing is superb, and there's enough tension to keep you turning, turning those pages, and not going to sleep when you should!
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was recommended to me by a student.  So I decided to do a little summer reading.  Got on Amazon, found a reasonably priced box set and hit buy.  I do not regret it at all.  The story is well paced with enough detail to feel connected to the characters. I have already read all three books and have convinced my brother and my husband to read them as well.
1416955070|1.0|I had heard lots about this book, so I was really looking forward to reading it. WOW is it overrated - I totally don't understand why it's so popular. For me, it was just cliche after cliche. It felt like characters AND plot points were taken from other books. Very specific books!  Clary thinks she's a normal teen then finds out, after meeting Mysterious Guy, that she has special powers. (Cliche #1). Apart from her ability to see demons, basically Clary is Bella and Jace is Edward. Jace is the Mysterious Aloof Otherwordly guy (cliche #2). No, he's not a vampire, he's a demon hunter; but for some reason that doesn't come across as fresh or different, it seems like a very convenient way to then be able to insert any number of paranormal people/creatures. He's orphaned (Harry Potter, anyone? cliche #3), and there's even a Dumbledore-like character (cliche #4) where he lives. I could go on with the cliches but to tell you the truth, I couldn't even make it to the end of this book, and it's seldom that I give up on a book!!!  The writing was OK in parts but ATROCIOUS in others. That's the main reason I gave up on the book.  If paranormal was not such a hot genre right now, this book would NEVER have made it big.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|Did it break new ground? Nope. Was I blown away? Nope. Did I enjoy the 2 hours of escapism? Yup!  Take it for what it is - a movie with good actors, a mediocre story line, and lots of action... then just enjoy!
0385341679|3.0|First, I absolutely love the Fever Series. That being said, this last book was disappointing. Too many questions were left unanswered and I think there was plenty of opportunity to clarify. This book just makes me want her to write one more to give a better farewell. I still like the book and her characters are always interesting, but I feel like this one shouldn't be the end.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|Pro: This book has a lot of really good information.  The dieting information gives guidelines that are easy to follow for the most part.  The best part of this book is really just reading his stories and the stories of others.  The workouts in this book are intense but give very specific instructions for the most part so you don't have to design your own plan.  The book also talks a lot about some dieting and workout things that you would never even think about.  He does some really cool experiments on himself.    Con:  Some sections are really missing info for the diet and some workouts.  The book could have been laid out better.  Some sections are very specific about what you should do while others have important information in random places, like in the middle of a story.  The diet sounds very easy while reading the book but will test of your will.  If you want the diet to work you have to stick to it word for word, if you have any kind of weekend social life it will be hard to follow this diet.  Want a beer for happy hour on Friday?  Not if it's not your cheat day.  Some sections are vague and don't give proper explanations.  Lastly the Kindle version is not laid out well.  Do not buy this for kindle, there is not active table of contents and instead of just flipping through a dog eared book you will have to advance page by page.  It looks like they put it in some kind of converter and didn't give the kindle version any kind of special attention.  I would say buy it if you want to read about some cool self experiments and the workouts are good.
B004K4AUZW|3.0|If there's one thing Lady Gaga is good at, it's marching to the beat of her own drummer. No one can deny that while some of her style and musicality can definitely be traced back to earlier influences, no one has done what Gaga does exactly the same way.     While her sense of fashion has proven her a true chameleon, as her music career continues she is showing herself to be very fond of repetition. There is a lot of \\"Born this Way\\" that can be easily compared to earlier hits of her career. Judas, though catchy, is almost a clone of \\"Bad Romance\\" right down to the chants and shameless insertion of her stage name. Most of the repetition, however, comes from songs on the album itself. The same beats, voice alterations, and synths surge through \\"Born This Way\\" leaving many of the tunes indistinguishable from the rest.   It is natural that an artist carve a niche or create a known style that can easily be attributed to them, but when your \\"niche\\" is supposed to be constant, hyper-speed evolution Lady Gaga fails to deliver and stumbles through the album stuck in her \\"Fame Monster\\" phase.    Perhaps Lady Gaga has set the musical bar too high for herself. It's almost impossible to change your sound as radically as she does her outfits but if it walks like a duck, you halfway expect it to talk like one, too. I don't think this is a *bad* album, the intent here is clear as is the effort at creativity. However perhaps \\"intent\\" is the problem with \\"Born This Way.\\" Gaga's fame seemed to come to her effortlessly, songs about sex, lust, and drunkenly dancing about provided the world party anthems and a star with attitude to spare. Now that everyone is listening, Gaga appears more conscious of what she has to say. That is truly the only artistic evolution \\"Born This Way\\" is evidence of.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|First off, I love this movie.  Most of my significant relationships have been with straight women, so I really relate to Peyton's roller coaster of emotions while Elena struggles with her feelings.<br /><br />Traci does a magnificent job.  Her body language and facial expressions express a wide range of emotions with great precision.  Watch her response when Elena says, \\"Your partner.\\"  Watch after she says, \\"That [sex] is a big deal for lesbians.  At least at first, anyway.\\"  Her communication goes way beyond her words.<br /><br />I thought the longest kiss ever was a bit long, but I love the first part, the first kiss.  Very erotic.<br /><br />Mary Wells plays Peyton's best friend, Wave, and provides a wonderful counterpoint to the subdued Peyton.  She's got some of the best lines in the movie as she tries to help Peyton though the maze of building a new relationship with a straight, married woman.  Their chemistry is great and very natural.  I wish I had a friend like Wave.<br /><br />Tori, Elena's son's girlfriend, is played by Sabrina Foster.  She's \\"introduced\\" in this movie and does a wonderful job.  If the leads weren't so good, she could have stolen the show.<br /><br />I've seen quite a few lesbian films, and a number of straight woman meets lesbian movies, and this one is by far the best.<br /><br />By the way, the soundtrack CD is great, and all women artists. Check it out.
B004Y03LQ2|4.0|This is a very good collection of great Iron Maiden songs from 1990-2010 and I have no issues with their choices here. They obviously can't include every song but this is a nice recap of their last twenty years. Anyone that wants to get a good taste of Iron Maiden before diving in and purchasing all the studio albums would do well with this CD and the price is great considering the packaging and the music.
B0050VJ29Y|5.0|I can remember hearing talk about this album long before it came out. So when it was finely released I was caught a bit unaware. All I can say is it lives up to the hype. Rome is a beautiful album. The voices of Norah Jones and Jack White fit the music perfectly. I really do not think they could have chosen any more appropriate artists. As you're listening to the album it sounds just like a movie soundtrack which is exactly what Danger Mouse and Luppi where going for. Now all we need is someone to create 'Rome: the movie'. My favorite songs on the album are the three done by Norah and the three done by Jack. It's a beautiful album to add to your collection (perfect study/writing music).     Side note: I'm holding out for a Norah Jones/Jack White collaboration album now.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|My 12 year old son set this headset up all by himself and now has friends around the world that enjoys talking to through Little Big Planet. He can wear them for an hour with no discomfort and the cable is really, really long. You won't regret this purchase.
B004ZH66XO|2.0|The apple iic had a better version of this game 20 years ago. Very monotonous game play. Presentation at least is nice.
0345529057|3.0|I read these books some time ago and they begin quite well. The characters seem interesting, like the setting... that is until Martin begins to delve into them and the story unfolds. At that point I realize how uninteresting Martin's characters and world really are. The \\"intrigue\\" in the book is quite dull, laced with constant and unnecessary references to incest and debauchery. Not that I'm a prude of any kind, but after a while it becomes very generic and cheapens the story. It's as if he says, \\"Well, I've run out of anything interesting to write, so I'll squeeze a few paragraphs out of this [explicit reference to a story] to keep my reader from sleeping.\\"     I found that many of the characters I did develop a rudimentary interest towards were given a cursory inspection and then shelved by the author himself. In hindsight, this was probably for the best as Martin likely would have killed off any interest I had in them had he continued exploring their natures and situations. In the end, I found that I simply didn't care about any of the characters or their fates. For me, that's the death of a series.    I will admit that I read all 4 of the initial books, so in that regard, they're not completely bad, or it could just be my nature to finish things I begin. The only series I've not been able to finish was Robert Jordan's epic snoozefest which I used for sleeping insurance during many finals weeks.     The \\"Song\\" series is average at best.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This is a fun long and sometimes hard game to play. It will keep your interest for hours. Fun for the entire family.
1591843790|5.0|For me, this book is not really about tips and hints on how to influence people, this book is about things that you've missed while treating people. The book doesn't show the wow things, it has a lot of common senses you can find in your school workshops. Things like smiling with your eyes, firm handshakes.. are too obvious, but hey, how many of us could practice these techniques at the level that enchants others?    When we want to make people do something, we often go off the track and try to manipulate, rather than to influence. Don't get me wrong, many of us at least one time either told the \\"noble lies\\" or \\"hide the conflicts of interest\\". The book asks you to look at your heart and shows you that the art of influencing people is to influence their heart, and not their head. It is because something that comes from the heart is very powerful as it will touch the other heart. To the top level, people do things for you when you don't ask them to.    This book is suitable for entrepreneurs (as Guy is himself) who want to use their people skills to enchant, woo and influence their team, their boss, and even their investors. Guy took his many decades of experience listening to pitches and give you insights of how investors think of the presentations. He also showed you the thinking process when launching your product, such as conducting the premortem, rather than the postmortem.    The last chapter \\"How to resist enchantment\\" interests me the most. It's like the final move the martial art master teaches you to counter all other moves and combos. It's, again, quite common sense, but it's good that now somebody wrote it up so the checklist pops up our head when people try to \\"enchant\\" us.    Overall, this is a must-read for everyone, not just entrepreneurs, beside the \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" of Dale Carnegie. No matter who we are, we spend most of our time dealing with people, and not logics. The book is the direction for those who are genuine and original at heart. It is the most enchanting book I've read in many years!
0439023491|4.0|Which is no bad thing. In a way it could be argued this book is just a rehash of the first in that the book is centred around another Hunger Games.<br />Therefore it's not as fresh or original as the first book.<br />Don't let this put you off, as even though it has it's similarities Collins has plenty of surprises & tricks up her sleeve to make this just as riveting a read as the first novel.<br />Cleverly Collins ends the book in such a way that you'll want to rush out & get the final book \\"Mockingjay\\".
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Bon Iver's self titled new album is an expansion of 2008's \\"For Emma, Forever Ago,\\" and it sounds amazing. Justin Vernon has an incredible voice and is an extremely talented songwriter. A cool variety of musical touches highlight many of the songs and create some awesome textures in the sound. Everything from E-Bow guitars to killer saxophone solos that work perfectly with Vernon's multi-layered  vocal harmonies. \\"Perth\\" starts things off with a great combination of keyboards, electric guitar that is almost timid, and a subtle horn arrangement that serves as a great segue into \\"Minnesota, WI.\\" \\"Holocene\\" keeps things going with an outstanding mix of lap steel, vibraphone, and woodwinds. \\"Wash\\" is classic Bon Iver folk: beautiful piano chords wrap around wailing violins that sets a mood reminiscent of a walk in the forest.  \\"Beth/Rest\\" closes out the album and sounds like a power ballad with licks of hillbilly steel and a virtuoso guitar solo. From start to finish this is a fresh sounding mix of songs that will not disappoint!
B004EPZ07K|4.0|The movie was entertaining throughout.  Ryan seems to have the same personality in most movies he is in, but it works well here, with a blend of humor and seriousness.  I liked the green lanterns' powers and the special effects were pretty neat.
B002TRL87Q|2.0|I had high hopes for this record. I had heard some rocking Gov't Mule before and thought I'd give them a try with this release.     It's dark, very long-winded and the songs just seem to go on forever without much direction, changing into weird keys and moving from one to another in a Pink-Floyd like tapestry of sound.     Not exactly what I was expecting.     In praise, the musicianship is very good - the guitar work is outstanding, and the bass work is quite excellent.    But, as a first taste, it's really bitter. Between 'Railroad Boy' and 'Monday Mourning Meltdown' I'm depressed every time I hear it. They just linger for about 1 or 2 minutes more than they should and seem to last forever. I find myself wanting them to end as opposed to wishing they'd go on forever...     It's unfortunate, but it's about to come out of my playlists because I just can't take the sallow depressing lyrics and black as coal chords.     Sigh. A shame. Not for me.     I hope everyone else loves this stuff, 'cause I can live without it.
0553381695|4.0|This is the second book in the A Song of Fire and Ice cycle. Therefore, this review will contain some spoilers if you haven't read the first book, A Game of Thrones or watched the finale of the season. You have been warned.<br /><br />Martin delivers another epic masterpiece, advancing the saga by leaps and bounds. The characters are deep and invoking, particularly the ones we never got to know very well the first time through. Martin's style has improved as well: there are far more battles in this one that are described in action, not merely in passing. Still, there are places where Martin's attention to detail is curious. For example, there is a harrowing escape plot by the Kingslayer that we don't get to see: only hear about after it has been foiled. I think most readers would have preferred to read that, rather than be subjected to an entire chapter of Theon Greyjoy unknowingly trying to nail his sister. In the first book, I began to suspect that Martin was obsessed with food: meals are described in lavish (often unnecessary) detail, fights and love scenes are usually told in passing dialog. This suspicion was confirmed during my reading of A Clash of Kings: every meal gets a the royal treatment. I realize that Martin is doing what he does best here: world building, and the \\"flavor\\" of a culture is often expressed best by it's food. But, still...I would have loved to have read more fights. I like fights. I like food, too, but I can eat anytime. I can't always put on armor and get into a fight.<br /><br />As for the world-building, Martin is a master. He hints at a rich, ancient world that compels the reader, often just mentioning a people or nation with a simple line or two; it's enough. Daenerys and Jorah are off exploring another continent, one where magic is a little less dead than on Westeros, and we get to see a lot of exoticness. And food...Martin describes the food. A lot. He likes food. But he also likes creating entire cultures that we barely get a taste of, just enough to make us keep reading to see if there is more.<br /><br />There are good battles, though. More than in the first book. We get a melee between knights competing for the honor of being a king's guard. We also get Tyrion, one of my favorite characters, leading a charge against a sortie of Stannis Baratheon's men. He also gets one of the best lines in the book: \\"What brave men...let's go kill them.\\"<br /><br />I will say this: something will happen near the end of the book that will probably piss you off so much you might stop reading. I almost did. DON'T. It isn't what you're thinking, I promise. Just keep going. Martin established in the first book that he'll kill pretty much anyone, no matter how invested the reader has become. He killed Ned and Drogo in the first one, before either of those characters got to live out what you were sure was going to be a spectacular destiny. This unpredictability ads to the excitement of the book: anyone could die at any point and in any way, but this also inserts an element of capriciousness, and makes it feel authentic when the unthinkable seems to occur near the end of the book. I assure you: keep reading. I did and I wasn't sorry.<br /><br />This epic requires a commitment from the reader. This is no casual read, and it would be impossible to pick up this book without having read the first. You might even want to take notes. And once you've read the first two, you'll need to get the rest to see what it's going. Some characters are so complex that you have no idea what their ultimate goal might be. One example of this is Littlefinger, who has been scheming since the beginning for...who the hell knows? He winds up achieving something notable by the end, but it's an odd victory and it's difficult to see where it ultimately ends (note, you get a hint of his great scheme not far into the third book). And then there is Tyrion: the only Lannister over the age of 12 that you don't want to brain with a mace. Tyrion continues to be my favorite, and this book does him as much justice as the first.<br /><br />One minor complaint: names. Martin is generally uncreative with naming characters, and it creates a some problems. He has a lot of characters with very similar names, most notably in the D range of the alphabet: Ser Davos, Devas, Daenerys, Devan...it's difficult to get straight sometimes, especially for such a long book where minor characters may have five or more chapters between them. For a fast reader like me, this isn't such a big deal. If you only have time to read once or twice a week, this could get exhausting. Fortunately, most of the important characters have nicknames to help identify them, like The Onion Knight or the Knight of Roses.<br /><br />And there were some characters that I desperately wanted to see in the first book and hoped to see in this one...like the Red Priest with the flaming sword. He gets mentioned, and his flaming sword explained (he doesn't just light it on fire, it's way cooler than that) but we don't ever get to see him. Martin makes up for this by introducing even more intruiging characters, like the two Crannogmen and the wildlings north of the wall...most notably Craster of Crasterly Keep.<br /><br />So, keep it up, George. I'm into this one until this series till the end! I have my theories and dreams about where it's going, but you never cease to surprise me...even when I'm right. Four stars, easily. Four and a half, if Amazon only let me give ratings in half-stars.rite, and this book does him as much justice as the first.        One minor complaint: names.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|What a great summer read! Such an original idea, to use antique, quirky pictures to develop characters around and create a wonderful, \\"peculiar\\" story.   I found the idea so completely different from anything I had read and hope the story will continue....

B004YJZ5GM|5.0|I am very familiar with this album and it never looked or sounded better.  The original album was a single jacket.  this is a beautiful deluxe gatefold.  The sound is fantastic!  The mid-range is clear and present.  The recording is full of life.    One of the reviewers here, Jamie Tate, is now using an alias of JT.  He has written so many bad reviews about Audio Fidelity and their mastering engineers that he feels he has to use an alias.    The reviews on this album from The Grateful Dead forum are all raves.  You can either believe the Dead Heads or Jamie Tate (JT).    Even though Tate throws around a lot of audiophile expressions he has never mastered an audiophile recording for an audiophile label.  I wonder why?    Compared to the original album this 180 audiophile vinyl is a pure treat.  The engineer Kevin Gray did a superb job in bringing out all the elements of this classic album.

B004H4XDBI|4.0|I didn't like the sequel as much as the first book, but the end of the first book made me want to read the sequel. I know this is a short review, but if you liked [[ASIN:006172680X Before I Fall]] you'll probably like this. Gayle Forman's writing is lighter than lauren Oliver's... better for younger people.
0375826742|5.0|As the third book in a series, there's not much I can say without giving away important details from the other books.  So I won't go into detail.  Instead, I'm going to rave.<br /><br />Ummmm....HOW did this happen??!!  All of a sudden, Paolini is a genius.  The writing, the story, the characters, the incredible visuals and personal depth.  I mean - where in the heck did it come from?!<br /><br />For one, I was taken away by Roran's incredible role for this book.  He's one heck of a man:  hammer-weilding, Katrina-loving, brave, courageous, honest, and just plain awesome!  All the scenes including him in Brisingr absolutely shock me into awe.  I can't wait to see what happens to him in Book 4!  \\"Insubordination\\" is my favorite chapter in the whole book...the WHOLE book.<br /><br />Nasuada lived up to expectations, and actually surpassed them.  The chapter about the knives and the tribal leaders was chilling and gross and fantastic.  WOW.  Elva, Arya, and Eragon were also wonderful.  I enjoyed everything about them so much more this time around!<br /><br />Oh, and the laughing dead... OOOHHHH.......<br /><br />The story holds much more depth and just the right amount of detail.  (Except for the sword scene...it was like 80 pages and kind of grueling, but interesting if you skim...haha!)  The writing surprised me this time around, in such a good way that I can't recommend this book enough!!  Everything about it blew me away...<br /><br />So I'm thinking, if you haven't already, you need to give this series a try.  Today.<br /><br />5/5 stars
0061726826|5.0|Wow. This book was remarkable. It really shows how love is. I really hope there will be a sequel. If you read [[ASIN:0525423648 Matched]] you will like this book. I found it a bit more compelling than Matched, but both are very well written. I really like this author's wirting. She also wrote [[ASIN:006172680X Before I Fall]]. I hope this has helped!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Lots of fun if you are a fan of the tower defense genre with a twist. I've been playing it since the day it was free on amazon and the game is more and more complex without becoming overwhelming.  Fun time waster!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Simple and short.  If you like games that have a little puzzle, little actions and a lot of planning ahead this is great.  I found it a little easy, but them I went through it again and it is much harder.  I really enjoy this game.
1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot spent 10 years in relentless pursuit of the full story behind Henrietta Lacks' contribution to medical science through her eponymous He-La cells. In this narrative, Skloot juxtaposes the worldwide selling of the He-La among laboratories, which has led to breakthroughs on several medical fronts, with the frantic, marginal lives of Henrietta Lacks' children. Ironically, the Lacks received no financial or social benefits from the magical workings of their mothers' cells. An example: After by-pass surgery, one son found himself $125k in debt - without health insurance. The writer presents the science behind the He-La cells in a straight-forward, accessible narrative that explores the science and its attendant legal and ethical implications. Just as fascinating and complicated as the history of Henrietta Lacks' cells are the individual and collective stories of Mrs. Lacks' children. The Lacks progeny are the inheritors of a past mired in poverty and congenital health issues. Yet, with all the challenges, when Skloot meets them 20 years after their mother's death they do not come across as victims. Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter became the central, most powerful voice in the story. She was a tenacious autodidact that overcame her initial reluctance to assist in Skloot's research for the book. I think Skloot would agree that this book would not have been complete without Deborah. Skloot is not just a chronicler of events but a visible, essential presence. Yet, she is never intrusive. To my ears, Skloot captures the dialect, accent, including syntax and grammar with perfect pitch. This book combines science, history and social commentary in a way that makes the reader think about the people - the family and the doctors - long after turning the last page.
B0038P9LTU|4.0|Ah, another album by Rhapsody, another chapter of Luca Turilli's version of Middle Earth. Not bad at all, but for such a great performer and composer, this just repetitive and starts to bore some of us, plus, somebody please tell Christopher Lee to retire!!!!!!!His \\"came from the grave\\" voice does not work any more. I hope this band will try something different next time.
0142002038|4.0|I am still more a fan of the contemporaneous Quiller series, mostly because, as opposed to M-6 (of the movies anyway), Q's outfit frowns on the collateral damage inevitable in, say, driving a tank through the side streets of Moscow.<br /><br />And it is true that this novel can be pretty accurately summarized as a hybrid of Huckleberry Finn (not least with racial stereotypes that jar in a 20th century work all the more) and The Wizard of Oz...which is to say, it's a boy's version of The Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />No wonder 007 took over the silver screen.<br /><br />But it does convey--one may say, makes sexy and cool, a profound sense of that old notion called duty. Nothing wrong with popularizing that, a notion whose pendulum by then (1958) had swung too far away from its place in the winning of the Second World War.<br /><br />And who knew he was such a romantic? When the stakes are finally revealed, Bond regrets having to look after Honeychile--two hearts and so two targets for the opponent, to his one. But without her well being as a spur through the epic final gaunlet, Fleming makes it pretty clear 007 would have ended as toast, squid bait, you name it. And so his thesis proven: not just two heads, but two hearts, better than one.
B004H1YH66|5.0|This release is in my opinion one of the very few times a re recording is better than the original, the sound is amazing. The clarity and quality of both the performance and the recording are topnotch, Basil most be smiling, his child is finally free and in the shape and form he intended from the beginning. A great homage to a great composer and a great movie, recommended 100%.
0439023521|5.0|I absolutely loved this book- and all three in the trilogy. I read through the entire series in a weekend.    First of all, I'm 25- not exactly the typical YA reader; however, my mother and sister each read the novels and encouraged me to do the same. I'm not sorry I did at all!    One of the most exciting and interesting aspects of this trilogy is the complexity of the characters. This isn't a black/ white, good v. bad type of book. Characters form all shades of gray in the novels. I also loved that the plot was a fresh idea, I was completely captivated, and I had no reservations about harassing my fiancé into reading the books.    I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 14 or so!
B003UESJH4|5.0|The Kings Speech is a fascinating movie. The story line flows evenly throughout the whole production. The Duke of York, Bertie, has a stammer which, as it seems, is incurable. Conversely his position has Duke of York forces him to give a few speeches. Bertie's stammer causes problems during speeches and frustrates him greatly. He seeks medical help and turns to many qualified and knighted doctors, who all fail at curing his stammer. The Duke of York's wife found a \\"therapy doctor\\" named Lionel and convinced him to seek help from this therapist. Lionel works with the Prince profusely. After many appointments and practicing the Bertie's stammer seems to be getting better.  Meanwhile, King George V was dying. The successor was apparent: Dave. Dave, however, was in a love affair with a divorced woman and therefore could not take the throne. This landed the Prince, now King George VI, on the throne. This brought up one problem, the king's obligations were to give speeches and comfort his citizens. Speeches were not Kings Georges sort to say, specialty.  After many arguments with Lionel, King George VI is faced with a colossal dilemma. He must give a war speech, on air, in a time of crisis for his nation and empire. Germany and Hitler practically declared war on Britain. Again Bertie seeks out help from his, now friend and trusted speech therapist, to help him through the tough nine minute speech he must give. They work through it together using Lionel's peculiar strategies, namely singing, jumping, dancing, and cursing.   I think this movie tells about how friendships and trust can help you through unmanageable moments in life. It also shows that with much hard work and perseverance, one can find confidence and strength in one's own weakness and faults.  I would highly recomend this movie.
1402760663|5.0|I am part native american and never really studied the truth about what really happened in South Dakota. I only knew about the stories that our american schools try to pass on as a cover up from the true Massacres that really happened. There was no battle at wounded knee, just mass killings of inocent people and women and children. This is a very good book, have not finished it, but so far very good and strait to detail. Everyone should own this book, and the more people who read it and know the truth, the better.I make this book a priority book to read in my class.  Very Good.

B000QQFKYE|2.0|I love David Lynch, but this was just too long and convoluted a series for me to understand or stick with, unfortunately.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I use this for nature recordings and my kid's violin recitals and everything in between, it excels at all tasks.  The sonic quality is stunning, it's what one would have needed a studio for ten years ago I suppose.  Well worth the price.  I use mine outdoors a lot and the unit has taken a beating and has more than a few scratches, but it's still working just like brand new.  Really, if you are even thinking about this unit, just do it.
B001POX73C|5.0|Just finished, and I'm sad that it's over.  A delightful story with unexpected characters and surprising little twists.  The leading couple's romance is one you probably haven't quite read before.  And for most romance-readers, that's uncommon.  Georgette Heyer exercises her talent of whisking us away to London in the time of Jane Austen.  As always, her descriptions of customs, costumes, and intricate family politics are fun to read and hard to put down. I recommend this for any fan of Regency Romance.
B000SEGMAU|3.0|I wanted to like this book more than I did. What I was hoping for was a remarkable story. Something I would remember with clarity. Something that would leave me mentally scarred.    What I got instead was a watered-down version of what could have been a remarkable story. The way it was told, the writing style - it just felt weak. It could have had a lot more punch, a lot more detail, a lot more heart. But it fell flat.    The message to slow down, appreciate what you have, appreciate life and live a life full of love and one you would be proud of was not lost on me, so I will not disregard that. I just don't care for reading books that feel like the fangs were taken out so it will have more mass appeal.
0345529057|5.0|Martin manages to interweave a story of awe-inspiring depth and size (over 4,000 pages) without EVER becoming boring (I didn't \\"skim\\" one page, because I didn't want to miss anything,) or losing the reader (somehow, you manage to stay up to speed with the army of houses, characters, and creatures.) In short, the single best epic I have ever read, period. Better than The Lord of the Rings. There, I said it, let the games begin.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I really like this cd, i bought it for the first song, GRENADE. There's a few others that i also like. I really enjoy listening to Bruno, he has an awesome voice.

B000BCE918|1.0|I had problems viewing all 3 DVD's in the collection.  Each one of them had areas where it would \\"freeze up\\".  I was unable to watch any of the movies from start to finish due to poor quality of the DVD's.  I have not had any problems with watching other DVD's in my player either before or after trying to watch this set so I do not think it is my DVD player.  (The DVD player was purchased this year.) The DVD set I purchased was used so that's what I get for trying to save some money.
B001EC3JME|4.0|I purchased this to hold a Fenix E21 LED flashlight. I did find that it does hold the flashlight extremely tight. I use this light everyday and so far the holster is doing it's job. I gave it four stars because the outside binding on the bottom of the holster catches the bottom edge of the flashlight. It is not a problem as I give the light a slight twist when inserting in the holster.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Michael Connelly does not write a bad story and this book is no exception, as good as some in the Harry Bosch series, perhaps not but still good.  THE OVERLOOK is the thirteenth book in the Bosch series, one of the best police procedurals out there.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the series.  This one is a little shorter than most but then again it takes place in a twelve hour time window.  Harry is again with the LAPD Homicide Special Squad with new partner Iggy Ferras and lands an execution style slaying with national security concerns so once again enter Rachael Walling, FBI to assist.  I enjoyed the quick read.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|And I bought most music through amazon, anyway, since I dislike iTunes.  The streaming isn't great when moving between towers, so I downloaded the music.  Yay.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I rarely buy DVDs, but this series was so exceptional that I ... well, made an exception. I recommend it for any history buff; I learned a lot about the founding of the U.S. and the men and women involved. They were ordinary people who rose to an extraordinary challenge, becoming historic figures in the process. I loved (and have frequently referred to) one line of dialog whose gist is as true today as ever: The only thing most meetings accomplish is providing an opportunity for everyone to speak without anyone actually making any decisions or taking any action. Apparently the Continental Congress had the same problems as the 112th Congress faces. I guess some things never change.
0670022411|1.0|If I could timewalk back to when the author was finishing this novel, I would tell her to a) cut out 99% of the eating, running, drinking wine and/or tea, and VAMPIRE YOGA scenes, b) read about Mary Sue tropes and eliminate 99% of them from your main character, and c) since your book will now be about 25% of its original final length, go ahead and finish it instead of just ending it the way you did. It's so frustrating because there are some truly compelling elements in here -- some great fight scenes, the daemons are fantastic, the spellbinding, the settings are marvelous! -- but it is so bogged down by cheap weird filler that it is practically unfinishable.
B001RIY49C|5.0|First of all, the movie is the movie.  If you don't already like the movie, why are you looking at this?<br /><br />That said, this review is regarding the amazing Endoskull bust.  First of all, this think is freaking huge.  It is probably the actual size of a human skull.  Second thing -- it is scary.  It scared the bejesus out of my 2-year old daughter, and now functions as an effective scarecrow in my study.  The eyes glow bright and the noises are loud.  It even makes my wife nervous.  So, in summation: fun times, just make sure you have the room.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|I'm still at a lost as to what the creators intended by creating this movie.  From the very first scene, this movie struggled to establish what genre it wanted to be and I felt that I could never take the actors seriously.  The potential was definitely there.  Visually, this movie was beautiful.  However, between the bad writing and over the top acting, this movie was confusing and should definitely be skipped.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I am very pleased with the product and the service I got with this purchase and would do the same again.
0547391005|5.0|We recently purchased this book on a whim at a local book store. Being that it has the cd's I thought it was a good deal. I'm always looking for new things for my daughter to listen to at night while she is in bed.   Who knew this would be such a hit! She listens to one or even 2 of the disk's everyday, and sits and looks at the book while she listens. The disks are well done, complete with a few sound affects. My only compliant about the book is the stories are long! My voice gets tired, but we all love the stories too-so it's not too much of a chore!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|It was as good the 2nd time as it was in the theater. I am quite pleased with the product and service.

As always, we are always happy to get the lates addition to our Harry Potter library and this movie was no exception. I love that the movie follows closely to the book, and of course it would be a really long movie to include everything, but the movie is very enjoyable even if you have read the book. We can't wait to get the last two dvds in the series.

B004ULEEY8|5.0|This review is going to be short and sweet because a very simple point needs to be made.    This is not a \\"war movie\\", this is Military Science Fiction. It's in the gritty style of Black Hawk Down without it being a real event in history.    As a sub-genre of Science Fiction, MilSciFi has very specific flavors and ideas that tend to come through (Usually very pro-American, semi-realistic or realistic as possible point of view, seemingly simplistic characters that find depth through action rather then history and so on) and if you aren't into that sort of thing, you won't enjoy the movie, plain and simple.    Another point: This isn't Heinlein or Drake or any of the greats of MilSciFi writing. This is a straight forward shooter - Marines Kick Ass. If you're looking for long exposition on the ideas of war or the futility thereof, this is not the movie for you.    If this isn't your sort of movie, i respect that, and lets move on.    If it is, you're going to love it. This is, frankly, the best take on MilSciFi available to watch on DVD or BlueRay.    Hoorah.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I watch this guy sing on Palladia HD.  I ended up liking his style of singing.  This CD has very good selections of his songs.  It doesn't have the song called \\"Candy\\" as one of the selection.

0156027321|5.0|First thing's first: This is an amazing novel! Literally, it will amaze you. It's awe inspiring. There were moments were I felt my mouth drop open and eyes widen as I read what was before me. Is this for real? Can this really be happening? No way... (yes way!) lol ... The authors writing style itself is engaging and entertaining as is - add an awesome story and you'll be hooked! Now... I don't know what to believe. While reading you will think the story has so much scope to branch off in so many directions & most likely it will take u places u never thought it would. It will in the end leave you just wondering...
B004WJRDN2|4.0|This was a charming record and remains so, and if nothing else this limited edition gives you access to a few great photos of the very, very beautiful (inside and out) Studer 4-track used to record the album.  You have to take a moment to appreciate the technical and mechanical excellence of these machines, especially in the digital audio context of today. Anyone that has been in a control room with a Studer, its own specific gravity pulling lightly on your ears while idling silently in the corner, knows exactly what I mean. And anyone amazed by the remastered sound here needs to acknowledge the technology that serves as its source: the analog tape recorder.<br /><br />But anyway, what seems to be happening with these ne plus ultra editions is an attempt to emulate the Genesis Publications ( if you're not familiar with them, look them up) line of truly outstanding books based on popular music, often developed by and with the artists themselves. Their multiple limited edition books on The Beatles, Syd Barrett, Bowie, The Who and others have set an unbeatable standard in content, design and reproduction. And while this wonderfully produced edition doesn't quite hit the Genesis Standard, we all need to acknowledge the value of their work, and mumble a little \\"thank you Genesis Publications\\" for inspiring a higher level of finish within the greater mainstream. And in this case, the visual presentation really is more sophisticated than the music, whose principal strength remains its disarming naivete.

B0013N3MV2|5.0|I wouldn't miss a Nr.1 Lady's detective agency book. I love the pace of Africa, I love the gentle femenism of the heroine and I even love that the author dared to make her look like a real woman can look like, with the real problems a real woman has: troubles on the job, troubles with men. Thanks to hiim for having shown us that indeed it is worthwhile writing about the everyday little situations, because those are exactly the ones we live through. Hurra for traditionally built women who put communication and people above material issues. Reading about Mma Ramotse is like going on a Safari trip while staying home.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I liked this book a lot. Its readability, solid thinking, and welcome brevity is far and away the best advice I've found for authors (and publishers) trying to sell books online when there's no startup name recognition. Some of his suggestions will require a little additional research for those unfamiliar with social networking, but his concepts for putting such resources to effective use are quite brilliant.    The bottom line is John's tremendous success as a bookseller who started about the same time I did, but with a million times better results. This is the start of something big for new writers and small publishers who have to compete for attention against the big guns in the business.    I commend John for sharing his knowledge with the rest of us. It's also a smart business move, because he has identified over 700,000 of \\"us\\" as potential buyers. I think he's right. The $4.99 will be the best investment we're ever likely to encounter in our lifetimes, and John deserves every cent of the royalties heading his way.    Thanks, John!

B003INBOEM|5.0|Not only is this a great Martial Arts film, it is a great movie period. In many Kung Fu movies the action scenes are amazing but the film usually lacks a well developed plot. This movie has an amazing plot with good acting, and well choreographed fighting scenes. I had seen this film on Netflix, but after watching i had to get it on Blu Ray. If you enjoyed this film i would recommend the sequel, Ip Man 2.
B004S699K4|1.0|Do not suppourt Echo Bridge with your money. If you absolutely need this on Blu-ray, get the Halloween trilogy released by Alliance in Canada. It's region 1, it has a DTS master audio soundtrack and it preserves the original aspect ratio. This version of H20 has an \\"open matte\\" widescreen presentation, which, in fact, shows MORE picture information than the 2.35:1 theatrical release, it doesn't preserve the intended style of the film.
B004I11VZ0|5.0|People who say this movie sucks have no taste in movies. I agree that Ip man 2 isn't quite as good as the first film, However that doesn't mean that this isnt a good movie. Ip man 2 is a very well put together film and those who enjoyed the first film will more than likely enjoy this one as well.
B002JVWRAO|1.0|This used to be one of the best shows ever on TV. Now they have ruined it. It's become a turgid, predictable, fatuous piece of evangelical Crap. Angels, devils, Satan, Armageddon, and their imaginary friend GOD. (And their book of fairy tales, of course.) \\"The opiate of the masses\\" They've also changed the format: instead of being about Sam & Dave, it's now about Sam & Dave & an angel--a three character show instead of a two-character show. (And that actor who plays the new leading man! A triple threat: uninteresting, unattractive, unpleasant--also annoying--Oh well.) They ruined X FILES, MOONLIGHTING, TORCHWOOD, etal, by evolving them into something that seems to be the opposite (in a way) of what they were originally. I loved this show so very much--it wasn't untill the fourth season's final two-parter that I began trembling in dread and lost respect for the writers because I could see where they were going; and my forebodeing prediction has, sadly, come true. I'm heart-broken. Sitting through the first two episodes of season 5 was painful/depressing/enraging and b o r i n g. I don't think I can bear to sit through the remaining episodes of season5. Does the rest of season 5 follow this unfortunate trend? If you who are reading this can answer that question for me, please do so. I'm so sad--someone please assure me that they're going to recapture what they've lost...

TRULY A CLASSIC RECOLLECTION THAT IS DEAD ON IN ITS RECREATION OF THIS PERIOD IN TIME.  ITS A STORY OF 4 FRIENDS LAST SUMMER NIGHT TOGEATHER BEFORE HEADING OFF TO COLLEGE AND THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE THEY FACE. THE DEVELOPEMENT OF THE CHARACTERS IS THE CROWNING POINT OF THIS MOVIE. AT THE END YOU FEEL THAT YOU ACTUALLY KNOW THESE CHARACTERS FROM SOMEWHERE IN YOUR HIGHSCHOOL YEARS.  THE ENDING CREDITS SHOW THAT:  JOHN MILNER WAS KILLED BY A DRUNK DRIVER IN DECEMBER OF 1964  TERRY \\"THE TOAD\\" FIELDS WAS MISSING IN ACTION IN VIETNAM IN DECEMBER OF 1965  STEVE BOLANGER IS AN INSURANCE AGENT IN MODESTO , CALIFORNIA.  CURT HENDERSON IS A WRITER LIVING IN CANADA.    UNIVERSAL PICTURES RELEASED THIS FILM, AFTER LUCAS WAS REJECTED BY ALL THE OTHER STUDIOS. THEY AGREED TO FINANCE IT ONLY IF FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA SIGNED ON AS CO-PRODUCER. THIS WAY THEY COULD MARKET THE FILM AS \\"FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE GODFATHER \\". EVEN WITH COPPOLA ON BOARD UNIVERSAL DEEMED \\"GRAFFITI\\" FIT AS ONLY A TELEVISION MOVIE. NOT UNTIL IT RECEIVED CRITICAL PRAISE FROM AN EARLY VIEWING IN LA AND NEW YORK DID THEY AGREE TO INVEST IN MARKETING AND PROMOTION TO PREPARE IT FOR THE 1973 SUMMER BIG SCREEN RELEASE.  LUCAS FOUGHT HARD FOR THE SOUND TRACK TO \\"GRAFFITI\\", HE FELT THAT THE MUSIC FROM THE PERIOD WAS CRUCIAL TO THE FILM. UNIVERSAL AT FIRST BALKED AT PAYING THE RIGHTS FOR THE 41 ORIGINAL HITS, BUT LATER AGREED TO PAY OVER $90,000 TO THE VARIOUS MUSIC PUBLISHERS. THE ONLY HOLDOUT WAS RCA, WHICH IS WHY YOU DO NOT HEAR ANY ELVIS PRESLEY HITS ON THE SOUNDTRACK. THIS SOUND TRACK ALWAYS STICKS WITH ME, WHENEVER I HEAR ONE OF THESE CLASSICS I AUTOMATICALLY THINK ABOUT THIS FILM. THEY WILL ALWAYS BE LINKED TO EACH OTHER.  \\"GRAFITTI\\" ALSO REKINDLED A LOST INTEREST IN THE 1950's AND 60's ERA. OTHER NOSTALGIA MOVIES CAME FORTH AND TELEVISION CAME OUT WITH THE HIT \\"HAPPY DAYS\\" WHICH ALSO STARRED RON HOWARD (AS RICHIE CUNNINGHAM) AND IT HAD A MEL's DINER, AND ALSO FEATURED A CHARACTER NAMED THE FONZ ( WAS THIS PAUL LE MAT's CHARACTER JOHN ??),WE ALSO HAD \\"LAVERN AND SHIRLEY\\" WITH CINDY WILLIAMS .  A TRUE AMERICAN CLASSIC, HARDLY SEEN ON THE NETWORKS OR CABLE ANYMORE.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is so much fun, and it runs flawlessly on my Droid 2.  I got it for free, but would still reccomend paying full price to get it.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book is awesome for those like me, who have a book available but don't have a clue how to market it. I would also recommend \\"The First Ten Steps\\" by M.R. Mathias, you really need to read both; Mathias' book lays out a simple system that someone brand new, with only 1 book available, can get started with.  Locke's book gives more in-depth of how to blog, Twitter, etc. Both give you an actual marketing plan, all you have to do is follow it!  Also, both of these books cover how to market self-published FICTION EBooks, most of the marketing tips I've seen are geared toward non-fiction/self-help books, so I was very excited to read these books!  I now feel confident that soon I'll generate the exposure that my book (Immortal Implements) deserves!  Very highly recommended.<br /><br />Ryan K. Hoover, author of \\"Immortal Implements\\"
B000KCVH5A|3.0|The delivery was fast and the book appeared to be in good condition the pages were a tanted color due to possibly the age, what was a sad thing was that the hard front cover when you look at it was in great condition but when we opened it the binding on the base of the book cracked all the way down. The book must have not been kept in a sealed book case and it should have mentioned that the book cover was damaged. I wouldn't have bought it for the price, however my son said he will pay to have it repaired and likes the book. I hate giving a present to anyone when its damaged.

B00127RAJY|5.0|i have only used this a couple times since i received it couple weeks ago, and already people i know have commented on the difference it has made. i do plan to do it every day for 30 days like you are suppose to but just after a couple times i feel a difference. the great thing is each workout is a little under 30 min., and once level one becomes too easy you can move on to levels 2 and 3. i really like jillian michaels and plan to purchase more of her dvds. i recommend this video!

B004XNGKBS|4.0|I bought this app for note taking for grad school and it serves its purpose well. It's able to allow me to type notes and also hand draw or write equations and notations when I need to. the drawn figures then fit snugly right after the typed text and the whole note page looks very nice.   I like that I'm able to export my notes into png files and email them to myself. It makes turning in homework or sharing notes a breeze.   Some suggestions and wish list include: - Allowing more file types to export or share, as png is nice but I'm unable to do text search on my notes once I exported them as png. - Ability to manually override the scaling factor. When I draw a figure, no matter how big the drawing, the app seems to scale it down so it can fit onto the one line of notes. But sometimes I want to draw a big figure and not have it be scaled down. - Ability to choose a previously drawn figure or notes and scale it back up. this feature would help solve the previous use case scenario.
B005342N58|2.0|I like arctic monkeys, thought their first 2 albums were fantastic (basically like every song on each of them even after listening to both of them a whole lot)    Humbug took a little while to grow onto me, but even then i skip about half the tracks on that album because they just aren't enjoyable    this album I've listened to about 15 times hoping it would grow on me, but it never did and i only like about 3 songs on the whole thing (and those aren't anything spectacular)    it just doesn't have the 'fun' factor that the band used to have which made them so great to listen to    i honestly was hoping for another jammin' out album like their first 2, but instead i get put to sleep
0061122416|5.0|I bought the Alchemist, based on a friend's recommendation, before reading any other reviews (either positive or negative). As a result, I approached the book with no expectations; I think this is one of the reasons I ended up enjoying it immensely,     The Alchemist has neither a complicated plot, nor multidimensional character development. As other reviews pointed out, these are not its strengths. However, this should not be mistaken for naivety. To the careful reader, the Alchemist is anything but.     The strength of the Alchemist is its ability to provide an emotional stimulus. It invokes hope, and optimism, and rekindles the desire to follow your dreams. Whether or not you'll enjoy the book depends largely on your state of mind.    If you're on the fence for buying the book, I highly recommend reading at least the first chapter, available online. It's short, and provides a good example of the tone and writing style that follows.
B0041T52S6|2.0|I wanted to give Michael Cera another chance. I had seen Juno, and Nick & Nora and found them to be very similar. I wanted to see if Michael was a one trick pony.    What better way to be a \\"game changer\\" as the cover blurb says than with a comic book style movie?    In Scott Pilgrim vs The World, Cera plays the same guy who plays the guitar, loves independent music, his friends are gay and he develops a relationship with a girl who is similar to him with hidden issues.    Now, granted, this may reflect life in some cities, but I was hoping to see this guy portray something different.    Take Brandon Routh. The guy was Superman and in this movie he's some flaky bass player. (Of course he has superpowers and his eyes light up)    Scott Pilgrim (Cera) is dating a 17 girl before he meets Mary Winstead's character. She changes hair color every few weeks and she happens to have had a relationship with 7 different people prior to Scott. These 7 people seek to defeat him. Why? Because he's the latest boyfriend.    This is shot in comic-book fashion (see Hulk) and I found it too absurd to enjoy.    Plus, I was hoping for different and instead I watch the same Michael Cera in three different movies.    Has the typecast been set?
0345529057|5.0|Could not be more pleased with this bookset. For the price, you cannot get a better deal. Paperback but very well made. The books are amazing. George R.R. Martin is a fantastic writer who takes you into his world with superb writing. I am not into sci-fi books but this is my first and I love them. I cannot put the books down. This is a great boxset and could not be better for the price.
B004LWZW42|4.0|I was pleased to see that Bryan Singer was returning to the X-Men franchise after bailing to make the Superman Returns movie. I enjoyed the first two X-Men movies (not so much with the third).    X-Men: First Class is an origin story of how the X-Men first form. You will see the early stories of Professor X and Magneto and how their friendship forms to become a working alliance.    James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender do fantastic jobs in their roles but the Oscar should go to Kevin Bacon who plays the villain. It's been a while since I've seen Bacon in anything worth seeing and he does a perfect bad guy.    The other characters are just there for filler. They do tie in to the other films and there are a couple cameos that may come as a surprise. But all in all this is a fun summer movie. You don't have to think too hard, the special effects are \\"special\\" enough without being hokey and there is enough emotional resonance to keep people plugged in. (Fassbender finds his strength here)    This movie proposes that mutants were actually involved in some of the Cuban Missile ramp ups. It ties comic book and actual history in a nice package.    A fine addition to the Bryan Singer X-Men movies.
B002A9OJ0Q|3.0|Don't expect this one to blow your mind. It's more like a pleasant little 'PS', for old time's sake. There are, however, a few interesting tracks like the modern-sounding 'Bandstand', the cool 'Real meaning', the dark and obscure 'Start the simulator' or 'Sunny mystery' that will haunt your mind after you've heard it a few times. Too bad there are also these few songs that you'll wish you never had to listen to, like 'Nothing's keeping you here', 'What there is' or 'Shadowside'. Sometimes, you just have to ask yourself: \\"What were they thinking?\\"
B000CNESU8|5.0|Our media is possessed of a crippling power. It can make heroes out of raving lunatics, martyrs out of monsters and stars out of human garbage. When someone appears on television, suddenly everything they say becomes the gospel truth. If Fox News told half of America that Obama was really a Nazi bigfoot/grey alien crossbreed, then they would get their torches and pitchforks and hunt the lousy spacesquatch down. Truth, lies, love, selfhood, all transformed under the influence of television. The viewer, the message and the people that send that message become something different. Network was prophetic. Network saw the seeds being planted and knew they would grow into something frightful. Peter Finch's performance as suicidal burnt out newscaster turned media prophet Howard Beale is one that every film buff should see. William Holden's struggle for integrity and connection, Faye Dunaway's submission to her worst impulses, it must be witnessed. It must be experienced. Watch it and then watch Cronenberg's Videodrome.
B001R1G01O|4.0|\\"The Majestic\\" was overall a great film.  Although a bit lengthy, it's worth it!  The plot is unique and very interesting, especially because of the time setting it's based on.  Jim Carrey was wonderful.  This movie made me laugh and cry, and I was quite satisfied by the end of it.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Awesome when it works on my gtablet. Save your cash until they clean it up. It randomly hangs and then force close. Fine for a level or two after a reboot.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This short instructional book had plenty of great advice for first-time Kindle writers like myself. It's worth the cheap price. Hopefully, my book will find the right audience now that I have these simple tips in mind.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I would gladly review the gameplay, however I can't even download the game because of the wifi only restriction. I have unlimited data from Verizon so there should at least be an option to download it on the 3G connection. I live in a remote area where there is ZERO access to wifi so I cannot download any of these apps. No other app store has this ridiculous limitation.

0811874192|5.0|I gave this book to my Mom for Mother's Day...b/c I was looking for someting a little more interesting and long lasting than cut flowers.   I happened to come across this book, and ordered it right away.    The detail is AMAZING!! I've visited my parent's house multiple times since then, and every time it seems there's a different \\"bouquet\\" on the coffee table. And, I know multiple people have asked me where I got it, after seeing it there -- so it's been a big hit!!!    Highly recommend as a gift...esp. if you're looking for something unique for a person who has everything.
B0012CH350|4.0|The Weber cover was free of defects: no holes, rips or tears. The first few time putting the cover on were sort of difficult due to the newness of the item. The elastic band at the bottom needs break in time to easily get the cover on and off the grill. Keep in mind it ought to be tight to prevent the wind from getting up under it and blowing it off the grill.

B004ZQ74G8|5.0|I've been hearing for awhile now how I need to read 'Room' by Emma Donoghue and a last I have read it. When I started reading the first few lines of 'Room' I became concerned as I realized it was written from a five year olds perspective and using five year old language. While I thought this was a risky move for Donoghue to pick this writting style as it could be difficult for the reader to get pulled into the story. However, after getting used to it I'm surprised to say I rather enjoyed it.     One of the things I loved about this book was the way Donoguhe brought a clear picture to the reader of what life was like for these two characters in Room. Each of them have different perspectives of this 11x11 space. For Ma Room is her prison being kidnapped at nineteen, but for Jack, Room is his home being born two years after his mothers abduction. Donoghue does an amazing job exploring their differences regarding Room which brought with it a greater understanding for the reader.     Experienceing the world through Jacks eyes during this book was competely captivating. Limited on life experinces because of his captivation, and young age, it was intresting to read his journey through the real word after his and his Ma's heroic and heart wrenching escape. The reader walked with Jacks through new discoveries like learning how to go up and down stairs, how bee's sting, and sunbock must be warn at all times because his skin has never been exposed to the sun. The list of discoveries is endless and eye opening, while at times it's entertaining, at others it is heartbreaking.     Room is full of emotion and a wonderful story of an unbreakable bond between mother and son, and the hope that one day together they can recover and rediscover a world outside of 4 walls that they call Room. This is a must read!
B001UV4XUG|4.0|I was a bit put off by the occasional voice-of-god narrator, though it's one of many little ticks here inserted to try to make this studio comedy seem really hip. Other little touches like animation, split screen and one big, over-the-top musical production number by the male lead, replete with marching band, also show how hard the makers were trying to be different here. The soundtrack? Yeah, whatever. It's the musical equivalent of this film: of the moment, indie-sounding, very young, ironic with its touch of unhip 80s hits. I did like the 500-day non-linear storyline: we see the male lead all happy early on when his one-sided romance is going well in the early \\"500 days of Summer.\\" Then we see him zombie-fied in those later 400-something days when Summer, his doe-eyed space-shot girlfriend, decides she wants to kick him to the curb after he totally falls for her. This film beats many others in the same genre for watchability.
0316069485|4.0|If you enjoy Michael Connelly's writing, you will enjoy this book.  If you aren't familiar with him, connelly  writes novels based upon police detectives and at times lawyers.  You get to know his characters from book to book, though the same group isn't in each on.  The quality of writing is stronger than most books of the genres.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|I wasn't sure at first about this book. I started it, didn't get that into it, and gave up. But I tried again and found that I loved the book so much, I was able to finish it in a few days.
B002Z58GQS|5.0|I love this flash drive, but I expected I would after researching drives for almost an hour (Yeah, that's how I roll; I over-research almost everything I buy.).  I wanted a drive that would automatically back up files without me having to drag and drop the ones I thought had been updated.  This one surpasses my needs as it syncs/backs up my favorites, the document folders/items I choose, and e-mails, if I so choose.  The software is easy to use with a simple interface.  No installation needed.  The transfer rate seems fast to me, but it's not like I wait until the last minute to download secret spy files before the bad guys catch me.  The space is perfect, though I also have a 16GB one.  The price was inexpensive.  I like the keychain ability, though I don't use it.  The only suggestion/flaw is that the cap could be easy to lose...it would be nice if it was a sliding closure.  However, I'd still buy this again and won't buy any flash drive unless it has JetFlash software now, something I didn't know I'd love as much as I do.  Hope this helps.
0962477060|4.0|One of the reviews inside the book itself says something like 'this should be included with the owners manual for every guitar.' It's kinda true. This is a really good book that methodically explains the structure of the guitar and why it is the way it is. Very helpful in understanding how to get around the fretboard and not be limited to 'the box.'<br />Not gonna lie though it was hard to understand at some point and it moves FAST. I would read a section and have to come back to it months later before I could move on. Overall a fantastic book that every serious guitar player would benefit from reading
B00332GA8I|5.0|(this is NOT a review of the movie, which shouldn't even be on this page) I purchased this flash drive to copy pictures from my computer for one of my childcare families. I use it once a month and it has held up to the back and forth travel between their home and ours.  The transfer rate seems fast, I like the white look (seems easier to find than the black ones I own), and I love the simple sliding closure instead of having a cap that can easily be lost.  It is a nice bonus to have the MJ movie on it, but that's not why I bought it; it was the least expensive 2 GB flash drive when I purchased it last year.  It's still going strong today, everything works perfect.  If you're an MJ fan, then you'll appreciate the \\"This is It\\" movie logo on it.

0307474275|5.0|While Dan Brown has been criticized for many aspects of his writing style, this book was totally captivating, I really could not put it down.  Well researched, excellent pacing, a great mystery.  I loved it.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|I usually don't like real life kid movies but this was a good movie. I saw it on HBO channel & I watched it several times before I came here to buy it. Good movie for all ages.
1400079144|2.0|Okay, so I had read all of Dan Brown's books by the time I excitedly picked up the Lost Symbol.  I'm not sure what I expected, but I was disappointed.  The Lost Symbol follows the same formula as all of his other books and while I expected to be wowed, I felt it was very predictable and as a result, disappointing.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I've been a serious music lover since I learned to work a record player at the age of 3 in 1954. I can't even remember why I bought this CD about eight years ago. I think it was because I'd listened to \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\" on the local community radio station and thought that it was one of the best songs that I'd ever heard, on a par with \\"Madame George\\" and other greats. Like most people, I expected to be disappointed by the rest and instead found myself enjoying every song, some more than others, of course, but all of them good in their own way. I don't think that I can say that of anything else I've listened to since the late 60s to the late 70s. Many of his songs bring to mind the music of that era, while still being original and with his unique voice. This CD should be listened to the way we did back \\"in the day,\\" straight through in a dark or dimly lit room, with good speakers or headphones (chemical enhancement entirely optional). It's not my favorite album of all time--\\"Revolver,\\" \\"Kaya,\\" \\"Natch'l Blues\\" and \\"Astral Weeks\\" are closer to that elusive target--but it's certainly the best album of the 21st Century that I've heard, and perhaps a couple of more decades, too. (Note: I have purchased about three of his other CDs, and liked them all, just not nearly as much.)
030745455X|5.0|A great follow-up.  More intrigue, further character development, a fast paced plot.  What can I say - this is what I love
0131103628|5.0|An authoritative user's manual for the C programming language, written by the same two people as C itself.    Not the best book for just starting out in C, though.[[ASIN:0131103628 C Programming Language (2nd Edition)]]
B004SBB0LU|5.0|Too many people are eager to cry \\"Compression!\\" or \\"Loud!\\" when a remastered recording doesn't sound like their favorite version from the past.  While I'm not prepared to say there is NO compression here or that I was prepared for the *slight* trebliness (?), the truth is there is plenty of dynamic range (especially considering the original tape source).    And I don't conflate \\"loudness\\" and increased detail.  These remasters sound clean and crisp with good attention to nuance.    But, as with all these other armchair engineers, that's just my opinion.
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|Danger Mouse and Luppi weave a sonic landscape that conjures up a film you've never scene, but you feel like you have seen it and loved it once you've listened to ROME a very times and let the aural beauty sink into your body.<br /><br />Guest vocals back Jack White and Norah Jones add dimension and vibrancy to the overall fun; Norah Jones vocal phrasing on 'Black' is remarkable and gives the necessary gravity and potency to this sombre march.
B004YM67TI|5.0|I haven't seen that movie yet but it seems pretty interesting and closer to what was the \\"Red Riding Hood\\" tale at first. Indeed, if you read research on tales (Bruno Bettelheim or Sheldon Cashdan), they were nothing but tales as we understand them today. This is a way to bring back the purpose of stories telling from a long long time.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Departures features several smaller stories telling one larger.  There's by far the most screen time for Daigo, a young man who leaves his profession as cellist in order to be a caretaker of the dead.  Basically, he prepares the dead for their loved ones to view.  Because he knows his wife will dislike his new career, he tries to keep it secret.  He is also troubled by the unresolved bitterness resulting from his being abandoned by his father.  It is a major transition the protagonist is to make, and that is why this movie is very fun to watch.<br /><br />I was awed.  Although many of the scenes are of moments resulting from death, it isn't a dramatic portrayal but is uplifting, comedic, and respectful.  It is evident that Daigo admires and respects his new employer--the head honcho in this business.  He seems to see him as a father figure.  The scene of the employer enjoying a nice meal is my favorite.  The employer is really my favorite character, and I recommend this movie to anyone.  Its theme is to always follow your heart, and accept others when they do the same, even if it's difficult for you to understand at first.  If it's something that brings joy to other people, it is worthwhile.

1439108277|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It takes the reader on a journey through classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, waves and Professor Lewin's area of long term research, X-ray astronomy.  Although this outline mirrors to some extent the three MIT courses (now available to all, see the post Ellipses), this is more than a cut down version  of these lectures.<br /><br />Professor Lewin takes us on this journey with passion, with humor and with enthusiasm.  On every page are  connections to experiences in everyday life. These connections are not dry explanations of common phenomena but encouragements to the reader to test these ideas.  I  found myself having the almost uncontrollable desire to turn on a hose with the sun at my back and spin around to  generate my own rainbow. I was also saddened that my shower and sun configuration prevents my own personal grasp on these rainbows. These small experiments are not solely qualitative but quantitative exercises. This powerful explanatory and predictive nature of physics is bed rock in the book.  At every opportunity, Professor Lewin helps us to understand the enormous numbers (mass, energy, power, etc)  of the quantum and astronomical scale by comparisons with values of these properties on  objects  and states on our human scale.<br /><br />As testimony to the Professor's connection with the reader (we are another wave of students) there are repeated references to  internet resources that amplify his words. I have provided some of these in previous posts.<br /><br />The chapters on X-ray astronomy take us on the journey of a an active experimental research physicist. There is agony and ecstasy.  This revelation of the invisible, distant and historical amazing view of the cosmos is \\"mind-blowing\\".<br /><br />The book not only reveals the fundamental importance of physics in understanding the universe but weaves seamlessly the insightful views of a grand master physicist  on issues of global importance: the energy crisis, human obesity, the safety of nuclear power, the Large Hadron Collider.<br /><br />Finally, Professor Lewin  gives us instructive glimpses of the formative influences of his life: family, the Nazi occupation and Holocuast (an ever-present shadow),  Lady Luck (the visit to MIT, the opportune meetings with friends and colleagues) and the transformative powers of education and Art.  It is also clear that \\"fortune favours the prepared mind\\".<br /><br />May we all learn to enrich our connections with the world through education, reason and art.  If the intelligence, enthusiasm and wonder that Professor Lewin conveys transforms us even a little, then bonus intra melior exi, i.e we enter good but leave better.  What greater honour to a bestow on a brilliant teacher?
B002ZG976U|5.0|Cher is amazing as always. I'd always liked Christina Aguilera's voice, never knew how powerful it was until I saw this movie. And Stanley Touchi (sp?) is such an excellent actor, watching him is a joy.  The music routines are wonderful. The art of Burlesque has moved into the 21st century with power and pizzazz.  I enjoyed this movie so much I showed it to many friends, all of whom have loved it as well.  I've now ordered 2 more to give as gifts.  It's funny, entertaining, a great way to laugh and enjoy an afternoon.  I'd hang out at Cher's Burlesque club anytime, great fun !
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I am able to take the bible with me everywhere I go, read different versions &amp; compare &amp; study them for a deeper understanding, listen to many versions, take notes, follow reading plans, and so much more! One of my personal favorites is how easily I am able to share the Word with others by just highlighting the text &amp; simply tapping the share option! This app rocks!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I loved the movie Burlesque so much I had to have the cd.  Each time I listen to the songs it takes me back to the movie scenes and how fun the movie was.  These tunes make you feel happy, sassy, strong.  My only wish would be for more songs by Cher, but Christina Aguilera is wonderful. Amazing voice with a surprising strength and range.  Love the movie ? Do yourself a favor and get the cd.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was great, a roller coaster of emotions.  At times I was like wooooaaahhh he has anger issues but man she has anger issues too. Funny, sweet, romantic, intense, the whole fire in bldg I was on the edge of my seat 'no no no don't kill anyone Jaime' - you will have to read to find out what happens - I just really liked it. I even had to buy it twice because I accidently loaned it to myself and couldn't wait 7 whole days to finish reading the last chapters. I finished reading the book three days ago and I still hear Adam introducing us to Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox. Ohhhhh Travis, I would obsess over you and twirl my hair too. I couldn't be as cool and unaffected as Abby pretends to be.   Don't want to give away anything just read it for yourself.   P.S. Someone needs to tell Jamie to write more books.  p.s.s. no vampires, ghosts, demons, fairies or werewolves in this book - refreshing :)  Loving angsty books,  Patty
B0042JH05I|3.0|In a few words, for people who\\"s looking to watch a Phill Collins greatest hits concert, it is not, only a few (one or two) Phill Collins hits, a lot of 60s songs. Good stage, unfamiliar songs. In my opinion, inadvisable...
0345522478|4.0|It had me at \\"Thor is an asshat\\" (and that was page 2).<br /><br />Do not get the wrong idea here - this isn't a romp through mythology with Beavis and Butthead, but the bits of snark and pop culture references had me laughing (there are some fantastic Star Wars references as well - this geekgirl approves).<br /><br />Atticus looks like a 21 year old stoner who owns a New Age bookstore. He actually is a 21 HUNDRED year old Druid who has spent most of those 2100 years running from the Celtic god of love (the Celts weren't big on cherubs, and this guy packs a mean punch). Just when Atticus seems to have found a place he can settle in for awhile, he is discovered. Fight or flight? Throw in a complicated \\"friendship\\" with the Morrigan, more deities, other mythologies, vampires, werewolves, witches, betrayals, new allies, and Oberon, his trusty Irish Wolfhound, and you have an adventure with a broad cast of characters that never gets out of hand and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />Add that's the big thing - I can't wait to get my hands on book 2 and read more about Atticus and the world he lives in. There are no cliffhangers, I just had so much fun reading this book.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4.5 stars, because we're still growing into the character and his world. Great start to series.
B004WJREMW|4.0|Tired of the formality of going back into the studio for another album, McCartney decided to hole up for a few weeks with a 16-track machine and several instruments.  He only meant to write a few songs to share with friends and family.  He says he just wanted a cassette to listen to in his car!  He evidently had no intention of creating a new album.  Yet he ended up doing just that.  This three CD set is an exhaustive account of the genius of McCartney.<br /><br />McCartney is all over the map with this collection.  From the bouncy pop hit, \\"Coming Up\\" to the gentle acoustics of \\"One Of These Days\\", McCartney is on a path of experimentation.  \\"Temporary Secretary\\" is a synthesized annoyance, while \\"On The Way\\" is one of his best bluesy contributions in years.  The hand-clapping jaunt of \\"Nobody Knows\\" contrasts with the ballad-like, pretty, \\"Waterfalls\\".  \\"Front Parlour\\" is just weird and \\"Frozen Jap\\" is equally bizarre, but each one shows just how far McCartney is willing to go to get his true groove on.  \\"Summer's Day Song\\" is a bleak lifeless experiment while \\"Bogey Music\\" takes the drum beat of Golden Earrings, \\"Radar Love\\" and produces a dance house delight.  Some of the songs sound solidly mixed and produced while others sound like demos.  The album is hit and miss, but definitely not one to be missed.<br /><br />The second CD contains a mix of live materials and some truly unique McCartney productions.  One of these marvels is \\"Blue Sway\\", inspired by a fantastic video taken by surf filmmaker Jack McCoy, using an orchestra in a brilliant fashion.  \\"Secret Friend\\", a ten and a half minute journey lacks any real surprises and the equally long, \\"All You Horse Riders\\" is more filler.  Other than having some live material, I can't say the second CD produces much music or insight, despite the very very wide variety of styles and the amazing, \\"Blue Sway\\".<br /><br />The DVD contains an interesting (but a one-time viewing) of Tim Rice with McCartney that really just shows McCartney as he was in that moment.  Videos of \\"Coming Up\\", \\"Waterfalls\\" and \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\" are included; but have not aged well.  \\"Christmastime\\" is just bloody awful, while the video of \\"Coming Up\\" from Kampuchea is very nice to watch.  There is a rehearsal take of \\"Coming Up\\" by Wings which is inventive and upbeat.  The \\"Making of the \\"Coming Up\\" video is surprisingly brief, but provides an interesting look into how the groundbreaking promo was produced.  For the price, there really is no excuse for any McCartney fan not to enjoy this and if you're an average fan, you'll still be surprised and entertained by the sheer variety and fearless creativity of Paul McCartney.s in that moment.

B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|If you love music and you're feeling as though, no Rodney King, we can't all just get along, get this CD/DVD combo. The music is great, and to watch these musicians from around the world come together to create this magic, you'll have renewed hope in mankind. A side bonus? The amazing instruments that are played.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I updated to unlock the 4th season, but it only allowed me to unlock half of it. THEN I got another notice to update it and it did NOT unlock the second portion of the game. What gives!? I played the 1st half, now I wanna play the 2nd half!!
B000R7HY0K|3.0|An homage to grindhouse films of the 70s. In fact if it wasn't for the cell phones I'd presume this whole thing was set in the 70s with the cars, tacky hairstyle and 70s outfits. Kurt Russel plays a driving serial killer who likes to terrorize attractive women. The first time around you see the brutality of what he can do but in the next chapter he's up for a big surprise as the girls fight back. The side conversations by the girls and the ending put this grade up a notch. There is a planned sequel. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; ACTION/HORROR ELEMENTS: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday.
0689504764|4.0|This story is fun to read out loud, with a great cadence.  As the family seeks, finds, and flees the bear, the repetition allows a toddler or preschooler to help tell the story.  I like to pause and have my 4 year old say the next line.  Pages alternate between full color and black and white illustrations.  It would be nice if all the illustrations were full color.
B0012GMZKE|5.0|I'd lost my original well-payed record (beware loaning masterpieces) and bought this CD.  Lucky tragedy; LC sounds even better digitally. Buy everything of this extraordinary man's  creative brilliance. His poetry and novels are finer than fine as well. He's timeless; even if   you're a Generation Z you'll be awed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book sat on my Kindle for several months before I finally read it.  I purchased based on a recommendation, but procrastinated reading because I wasn't in the mood for a dark, post apocolyptic story.  My prejudice meant that I didn't get to immediately experience this immersive, interesting, and intelligent story.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I see that almost everyone had given this 5 stars, and I concur. So well written, so well performed. A true classic by any yardstick. This is one that will always be in my collection. It is also amazing how many songs Carole wrote which were hits for other people. If you start looking the songs up on Wiki, you will find many have been recorded both in the U.S. and abroad, and many have been hits multiple times. Whether they were ever big sellers or not, though, would not affect my opinion of them, I personally like every track on here, to a greater or lesser degree.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was my least favorite of the Hunger Games trilogy.  Katniss became a pawn rather than the strong, insightful warrior from the first 2 books.  Additionally, many of the supporting characters were tortured and/or killed off unnecessarily.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It's a good game and most everyone knows about the simplified tower defense addictive gameplay.   They did a good job of tiering the difficulty and adding additional units.     The main problem I had with the game was that it EXPLODES in size once you finish the campaign. It balloons up to 15 megs to allow for the additional content you have unlocked. I do not know why this cannot be unlocked on the SD card and has to be put into system memory. It ended up making it impossible for me to keep it on my phone. I hope they fix this in additional patches.    (Phone Type - Nexus One)
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|When I was a teenager, one of my younger sisters regularly called me Bossy Butt due to my strong leadership abilities.  Based on a feeling of kinship, I decided to purchase Bossypants.  I was not disappointed.  I found the book funny, yet poignant.  I especially related to Tina Fey's discussion of her daughter and the struggle to decide whether to have a second child.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|No one will argue that the 'Alien' \\"quadrilogy' is anything less than incredible - maybe the 4th one sucks, but whatever - but watching the films again in HD ups the ante in a way that you may not be truly ready for. Watching 'Alien' again on Blu-Ray was like watching a movie for the very first time. I saw details that never occurred to me to even look for while watching it on DVD - my only fault is the \\"Mu.Th.Ur.\\" menu - my feeling is that if you need an instruction booklet to operate the Blu-Ray menu (as this set has), it's a bit too complicated. But I digress - the true gem here is the films themselves, and they definitely don't disappoint. Even 'Alien: Resurrection' is relatively enthralling in this format. For this price, theres no argument.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|In order to take a trip down memory lane, when the Beatles were at their (drug-induced) prime, I bought Sgt Peppers. My college era. In retrospect, Abbey Road would have been a better choice ... better lyrics, more depth, greater maturity (stronger drugs!?). This album did not live up to my expectations or memories.
B0044RUSZM|2.0|I bought this thinking that it would give me more usable desk space but in reality, it does not.  It lifts your Mac off the desk so that there's room to put something under but not much.    The construction is solid but it is a bit wobbly.  The height has a negative effect of adding a lot of stress on the power cable and the video adapter (I use it with an external monitor).    In the end, I'm not sure it got me anything at all.  Sure it looks cool to have your Mac on a stand but the stand has a lot of negatives.  1)  no new usable desk space (a vertical one would have been better), 2) cable stress on the ports on your MBP, 3) adds additional area for dust to collect.....    I'm usually a huge fan of Griffin stuff but not this one.

You can indulge in Elizabeth Gilbert's journey.  It's guaranteed to inspire you and give you hope that you can live happily ever after divorce.  If you saw the movie, the book is much better.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I came into this book happy form to first book but sad at the second. Suzane Collins is a great writter but she should of left this trilogy to the first book.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I love ordering things from Amazon.. you guys are very efficient and have very good quality of things  ... It has saved me time and money ... Thank you all for a job well done
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller was cheaper than all of the retail stores. Its the standard controller. It doesn't come with a charging cable, just the controller, but that's all you really need I guess. Great spare to play with friends.
B0041KKYBA|1.0|Any movie that has Eliot Spitzer introduced in the first five minutes can instantly be put in the trash. Inside Job does highlight the rise of sub-prime lending and collateralized debt obligations. However, this movie neglects to inform viewers that THE U.S. Government UNDER DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS encouraged sub-prime lending. They also neglect to inform viewers the FREDDIE MAC AND FANNIE MAE (U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES) guaranteed payment for CDOs. This would lead them to get AAA ratings because they were backed by the U.S. government. Also it does not include the fact that many of these big banks lost billions themselves, went bankrupt, laid of thousands of employees, and have never really recovered. Mistakes were made by big banks and our own government.<br /><br />This is extremely biased and is terrible. It was irresponsible for a movie studio to produce this and the director should be ashamed of himself.
B004LL1HM4|4.0|2nd album from Seattle band who have almost singlehandedly re-popularized the folk/pop sound<br />  among the indie crowd.  This is organic folk/pop layered with stunningly gorgeous, almost dream-<br />  like, vocal harmonies and unusually \\"earthy\\" instrumentation--with the occasional sonic surprise.<br />  The 60s influence is undeniable, but the immaculate production and purity of intention render the<br />  sound timeless.  The effect of really listening to this album is something akin to that of meditating.<br />  Recalls a number of artists:  most notably, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, plus Simon & Garfunkel,<br />  Tranquility, The Soundcarriers, Fairport Convention, Stackridge, Band Of Horses, Seals & Crofts,<br />  America, Midlake.
0307408833|2.0|Bought the book and the ingredients, all except the rice powder.    Made the ginger snaps, and they were okay, a little too sweet, but okay.    With so many negative reviews about the frosting, I just can't bring myself to make it.   Too much work and  expensive for something that just might turn out okay.    I sent them an email to ask a question after having spent a long time on their website.   I wanted to avoid bothering them with something that could have been answered there.    They never got back.   Will not recommend the book to anyone and will donate this book to our local library.    There are other books on this website that were mentioned by other reviewers that are more deserving.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|...it's not for very small children. However, having stated that, there are some pretty frightening scenes in the original Wizard of OZ, too, and parents have been propping infants in front of that film for decades!  This is really a wonderful film, very imaginative, a little dark, but thoroughly entertaining, and Fairuza Balk (The Waterboy's Vicki Vallencourt) gives us a great Dorothy Gale. The minor characters are quirky and lovable. It's a good one.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I did go into the theater expecting to love this film, and it far exceeded my expectations. The beginning's a bit awkward--starting with Thor's arrival on Earth, then abruptly backtracking to how he got there and replaying the opening scene, but from there on, the pacing is excellent.<br /><br />A prince in his own realm, heir to the throne of Asgard, Thor is a young man in desperate need of some anger management counseling. This prince's temper is measured on the Richter scale. When his coronation is interrupted by the intrusion of  beings from another realm, Thor seeks revenge--and re-ignites an ancient war. This leads his angry and disappointed father, Odin, to banish him to Midgard--Earth--to teach him a lesson in humility. Thor must live as a mortal man until he can prove himself worthy. Then, and only then, will his magic hammer, Mjolnir, be returned to him, along with his power and his immortality.<br /><br />Mjolnir has also been sent to Earth--trapped in a Sword in the Stone-type scenario in the New Mexico desert. (Look for Thor's creator, Stan Lee, in his obligatory cameo as one of a crowd of rednecks trying to withdraw the mystical hammer from the stone. Good thing Stan can afford to buy a new truck!)<br /><br />The fish-out-of-water aspect of the story is humorous without being over the top. In Thor's first twenty-four hours on Earth, he's hit by a car twice (three times if you count the replay of the opening scene), had a hypodermic full of tranquilizers shot into his butt, gone drinking with Jane Foster's mentor, Erik Selvig (and had to carry him home when he passed out), and takes on a platoon of S.H.I.E.L.D. guards surrounding Mjolnir.<br /><br />It was those moments of humor I enjoyed most--and that price-of-admission scene of a shirtless Thor (when the film comes out on DVD, that scene's going to get a lot of replay action). Chris Hemsworth portrays Thor with the regal bearing of a prince, the ferocity of a warrior, and the good humor of a regular guy.  The budding romance between Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman), however, didn't get enough screen time to convince the audience it was true love. Note to screenwriters: SHOW, DON'T TELL! The audience needs to believe Thor has made enough of an emotional bond with Jane and others here on Earth to overcome centuries of arrogance  on his part.<br /><br />As Thor comes to terms with his exile, trouble is brewing in Asgard. Odin has fallen into a coma and Thor's younger brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), is taking over the kingdom. Thor's loyal friends, the Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, defy royal decree and head for Earth to find him and bring him home. In a confrontation with a gigantic destroyer from their realm, the five of them join forces to defeat the enemy. And when Thor makes the decision to sacrifice himself, caring more for Jane and the others than for himself, his powers and his immortality are restored.<br /><br />The dialogue is sharp and witty. In one scene, future Avenger Hawkeye observes Thor's battles with S.H.I.E.L.D. security and asks Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) if he should take him out \\"or are you going to send out more guys for him to beat up?\\"<br /><br />When Thor's Asgardian buddies walk down the town's main street in search of their friend, a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative reports to Coulson, \\"We have Xena, Robin Hood....\\"<br /><br />And then there's the scene in which Thor goes to a pet shop to get a horse. When he's told they only sell dogs, cats and birds, he says, \\"Give me one big enough to ride.\\"<br /><br />There are also not-so-subtle nods to other Marvel superheroes. When the Asgardian destroyer arrives on Earth, Agent Coulson is asked, \\"Is that one of Stark's?\\" To which Coulson responds, \\"That man never tells me anything.\\" In another scene, a reference is made to a scientist working on the effects of gamma radiation (that would be Dr. Bruce Banner, The Incredible Hulk).<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, difficult as it is to resist, but it's both spectacular and bittersweet. If you want a movie that's fast-paced, exciting, fun and even romantic, look no further. This is it!ed, exciting, fun and even romantic, look no further. This is it!
B00008CLOA|5.0|This SACD version of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is definitely the best I've ever heard. This may be better than the live concert I attended at the ASU Activity Center in April 1975, however it's hard to remember that far back :>).    Regards
B004IK8PLE|5.0|I like how the book alternates between storytelling and teaching. It exceeded my expectations in how interesting the author describes the events and algorithms.
006621131X|5.0|If you were a teen in 1978 when Patti Smith hit the height of her fame, with the cover of the Rolling Stone and the unwanted moniker as the queen of punk rock, then this book has the goods.  If you want to get a front row seat to artsy punk new wave grungy New York of the 70's, this book has the goods.  If you ever dreamed of living at the Chelsea Hotel among the artsy crazy people, this book has the goods.  There are many amusing stories involving many famous celebs of the time.  Whether you liked her or hated her, you will love this book.  A very sympathetic view of Mapplethorpe whom she sees through rose colored glasses.  If you want the dirt on him and Patti, read Mapplethorpe: A Biogrpahy by Patricia Morrisroe.
1439153663|2.0|When I saw the size of this novel, I knew it was not another \\"Gone With the Wind.\\"  I think the premise was good, but there was virtually no character development, except with the son of the plantation owner and the plantation owner's sickly wife.  The heroines were noble, articulate at times, and filled with \\"spunk.\\"  So much so that I wanted them to stumble from time to time.  Of course, like all romance novels, the heroines are beautiful.  How I long for a plain Jane heroine from time to time.  The plot is woefully predictable and the characters, from Mama Mae the black matriarch, Papa George the black patriarch, Radkin the evil overseer, and Will the kind overseer are so true to type they are almost cartoonish.  I certainly wish the author success in a cut-throat industry, but she's going to have to do better than this next time.
B00005JO5L|4.0|It took me 2 times before I got the real meaning of this film...Gays hated the movie when it came out back then in the 70's....the film wasn't far off, when it came to the Levi/Leather crowd during the time period...Before AIDS came along. I saw this kind of behavior first hand myself...mainly in the BIG cities like New York City,Washington,DC,and Atlanta,Ga..I can also see why many gay people didn't approve of this, seemed to think the public would think that this behavior was common and was practiced by ALL gay people...NOT True..Most every day gay folks were not like this...promiscuity to the extreme. Al Pacino does a great job in this role, one of many good performances during the 70's.
B004OBQDH0|4.0|i only bought this for the Dobby bookend. It was worth that. the DVD is ok. the volume level is low. I have to turn the volume up to almost double what I normally use, but other than that no complaints.  the Dobby bookend looks nice next to my HP books.
096798467X|5.0|Great book, answered all my questions, I feel confident now that I have all the knowledge to build my oven.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|For all the diehard fans...I feel your pain about the original ORIGIANLS not being included. I have seen all the Star Wars movies in the theater. I remember back in 1977 having to wait 3 hours to see it.     Remember, George released the ORIGINALS on DVD already. I really don't think there will be any benefit to having them on Blu-Ray because with Blu-Ray will will see the original film in High Def which will make the quality SUCK....but only this time in Hig Def.     As with all Star Wars stuff, there will be Blu-Ray of the originals a few years down the road....probably!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters.  This is an interesting movie with the setting of the movie taking place in 1979, which puts an interesting spin on the movie compared to new movies you see today.  This was a great movie to see in theaters and I can't wait until it comes out on blu ray.
0440423023|2.0|I'm not sure what Lee's point is.  We are on Reacher novel #11 yet he painfully re-writes everything he's already discussed in the previous 10 books and in unneeded detail.  So 1/5 of the book is \\"Reacher Likes Food\\". Another 1/5 is REACHER and numbers which is equally lame since this something he's had his whole life but never important before. REALLY?!      Out of the gate Reacher is such an atheist he won't take an airline to the point of saying if he saw a prayer on the box of a free meal that he'd lose his appetite.  This from a broke man give free food.  And then again from a friend who knew him so well that she knew he wouldn't.  REALLY?!  And has strong political feelings (strong hinted left especially considering when this was) despite not having a home, TV, car, only recall hearing him talk about reading twice, from a political family and the previous 10 novels he is very ANTI-GOVERNMENT which one would expect anyone to be who is disgruntled from military life. REALLY?!      So what is the point of this book?  Well, if you can get past the unrealistic morph from anti-government, live and let live Reacher into this anti-God liberal and the almost creepy infatuation the author has with him (now more than ever) you'll find an enjoyable short story. REALLY?!  REALLY?!
0811875040|5.0|I finished writing this review and just had to go back and say that I am just THRILLED ABOUT THIS BOOK!  I have not seen another like it out there and I shop a lot for cooking and baking books!  Such a BEAUTIFUL BOOK!  I LOVE IT SO MUCH!        (This is where I originally started my review:) I have many baking and cooking books and search online for recipes as well but this book is by FAR the BEST ONE!  First of all, this book is so pretty that I don't mind leaving it out on the table.  The cover is not only very attractive but the edges of the pages are scalloped!  I love the variety of recipes and the way that the author shows how to convert a cake recipe to a cupcake recipe.      This book shows how to make French Buttercream, Coffee Buttercream, Cream Cheese Frosting, Boiled icing, Ganache, Chocolate or Strawberry or Coconut Mousse, Pastry Cream, Lady Fingers (YES, even Ladyfingers, I have never found a recipe for Ladyfingers before not even with an online search), Simple Syrup, Gingerbread cake or cupcakes, Tarts of all kinds(I have never heard of a Pecan Tart before nor a Banana Cream Tart), cakes of all kinds, Chocolate Caramels, Caramel Corn, Marshmallows, Buttermilk Panna Cotta, English Toffee, Eclairs, Creme Fraiche Scones, Graham Crackers, several different kinds of Macarons: Parisian, Geranium, Hazelnut, Rose and more Macarons.    Do you know how hard it is to find a Marshmallow recipe?  Normally you have to have 5 or more books with the variety in this ONE BOOK!  What a savings plus everything is so simply written!    The book is so inviting as are the recipes.  It is simply written so that the recipes are easy and don't take long to make.  Even if you are the occasional baker, you will find that the ingredients are ones that you will already have in your cabinet.    I have waited a while for this book to be published and even thought about cancelling the order because I was tired of waiting.  I am so happy that I stuck it out because I am more thrilledabout this book than any of my many others.  I have around 300 excellent cook and bake books.  My husband and I do a lot of cooking but I do all the baking.  When we go to or have parties,  everyone always raves about my deserts and dishes.  So I do know how to choose the right recipes/the right cook and baking books.    G. from California
0307887960|3.0|Don't know why I bought a book like this cause I know that there are no wonder diets.  I have a couple pounds to lose and I'm sure if you really get into this book and follow the stages you'll lose weight but I'm not ready to change my eating that radically.  I'll change my portion sizes and lose the weight I need to lose.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Symphony X are the kings of melodic metal and Iconoclast is their amazing new album that will rival anything released this year by anyone. Lead by the amazing guitar talents of Michael Romeo and the aggressive vocal style of Russell Allen, this group has become the shining light of this style of music. There's too many highlights to mention in an album of this quality with amazing performances and superb production held together by a lyrical theme that only Symphony X can create. The guitar riffs and solos are just mind blowing - so technical yet so catchy! Iconoclast is highly recommended to all Symphony X fans and to anyone that loves heavy progressive music including bands such as Dream Theater and Pagan's Mind. This is definitely going to be hard to beat for album of the year but I'm looking forward to what Dream Theater muster up. Iconoclast is stunning!
1400052181|4.0|I'm not a science person but this kind of science - everyone should be interested in!  I had never heard of HeLa cells before I read this book.  (Most medical people who have done any research know about them.) The author makes the subject very accessible with a smooth writing style, including many stories about how hard she had to work to get some of the interviews she scored. Well written, seemingly well-researched and fascinating.  I highly recommend this book.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I purchased the album from the Radiohead web site when it came out...but i needed some time to fully appreciate it!  After almost 4 years of its release I can't stop listen to it. I can not choose a favourite song...they are all fantastic.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've already spent too long on this game. totally addictive! I can't believe I got it for free! still worth the money now.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Bought this on the opening day and I am in love with their music so much.  Still has that Foo feel.  The first and last songs are my favorite beyond the rope song and there is only one in the middle I skip by mostly because I am not in the mood for a hard metal sound.  Awesome!!!!!!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I bought the digital copy of born this way when it was on Goldbox for 99 cents, and I stand behind my purchase. I have been reading a lot of the other reviews that people have been put up and I decided to share my opinion of them:<br /><br />A lot of people have been commenting on how Gaga is the new Madonna. I completely agree with this. I am only 23 years old, but I am a huge fan of Madonna. I think she was very creative and original for her time. But to say that Gaga shouldn't be like her or Gaga needs to be more original is like saying that after Mozart created his original symphonies, Beethoven and Bach shouldn't have made classical music because Mozart already explored that territory. That just makes no sense to me. If you like a particular genre of music, then I say, the more the merrier!<br /><br />The next big comment was that Gaga is trying to do too many things at once. But I think the people that say this are forgetting something: since when does an artist have to pick 1 genre and stick with it? Gaga enjoys exploring different types of sounds and what she can do to personalize them. I personally am a huge Gaga fan, but I also love Linkin Park, 311, Eminem, and Britney Spears. Why do I like such different types of music? Because each of them conveys a different message ( or no message at all ) and I listen to each when I am in the mood for it. If you like techno, you will love \\"heavy metal lover.\\" If you like Michael Jackson's \\"Beat It\\" then you will love \\"Electric Chapel. She also puts in meaningful songs, such as \\"Hair\\" and some of the struggles that she faced growing up in \\"Bad Kid.\\" This album is a compilation of stories. The stories that she wants us to hear. And that's what i love about her and what most of her fans love about her.<br /><br />The last thing that has caused an uproar was the fact that Gaga is getting religious. I am also an Italian girl from New York, and as such, I understand what she is getting at.

Many children benefit from strict discipline and attain skills that will last a lifetime, resulting in self-confidence. As subjects of such discipline in a permissive Western environment, they also may suffer confusion and stress from conflicting cultural expectations.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|Check out the full review at [...]!<br /><br />At the start of Battle: Los Angeles, we meet Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz. He is getting older, and it is shown that he can't quite keep up with his fellow soldiers any more, so he makes the decision to retire. He figures his best years as a soldier are behind him.He is given one last mission, and he is assigned to a group of Marines led by a young Lieutenant. Of course, the day starts out well enough, and soon goes to hell as aliens invade LA and start exterminating humanity.<br /><br />Directed by Jonathan Liebesman, Battle: Los Angeles is a thrilling, gritty action movie. It's not meant to be taken too seriously, as it is, at its core, a dumb popcorn flick. It's full of cheesy dialogue and overzealous patriotism, but if you turn your brain off for a little bit you'll have fun watching this.<br /><br />The whole movie in anchored by the perpetually awesome actor Aaron Eckhart. He is given a good amount of bad dialogue in this movie, but he somehow makes it work. You never cringe when he says a line that would be cringe-worthy coming out of a lesser actor's mouth. He nails the intense stare and general badass vibe of an action hero. I would love to see Eckhart in more roles like this, preferably where he is surrounded by equal actors with a better script.<br /><br />If you've ever played the Playstation 3 game series Resistance, you'll instantly feel like you are watching a live action version of that franchise. I can see why the movie is being promoted alongside Resistance 3 (you can even catch a glimpse of a Resistance 3 billboard in the background of one scene). It's basically Resistance mixed with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.<br /><br />Like I said before, most of this movie's problems stem from its script. The characters, apart from Eckhart's Michael Nantz, are not very fleshed out, which makes it kind of hard to care about them later in the movie when they are in danger. The action in this movie is great and fast paced, however, and helps mask the flaws embedded in the script.<br /><br />Michelle Rodriguez is in this movie, once again typecast as a badass chick who kicks ass. At least she always pulls it off. Ramon Rodriguez, who played Shia's extremely annoying roommate in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, is slightly less annoying here. Ne-Yo is the only other actor I recognized, and I have to say his acting range is severely limited, which is all the more pronounced when he is around a seasoned vet like Eckhart.<br /><br />Battle: Los Angeles would probably have been a much lesser movie without Aaron Eckhart. His great skill and careful subtlety really help ground the movie, when it would otherwise just spiral into absolute ridiculousness. If you know what you're getting into, and adjust your expectations accordingly, Battle Los Angeles is worth picking up. The Blu Ray has a great picture, some decent extras, and an exclusive demo for Resistance 3. At less than $18 currently on Amazon, it is worth picking up in my opinion, if you are a fan of the genre.<br /><br />Check out  [...] for more reviews and daily news!laws embedded in the script.

If you want shallow, emotionless, manufactured bieberesque pablum pop by guys pretending to be from the 1800's complete w/ costumes then by all means, buy this album.      If you like this band, chances are you are new to this type of music and have missed the good stuff.  Get on pandora and make stations for del mccoury and james vincent mcmorrow et al.

B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie has been one of my top 4 movies of ALL time! Labyrinth is such a great story. I remember being little and being like Sarah. Wanting the fairytale lifestyle. Ive been kind of dramatic like that all my life. Jim Henson is AMAZING. After watching this movie all my life, I finally decided to look to see if it has books to go along with the story, and it does! Which I will be buying and reading. Like Sarah, I play out parts of books. Which I plan to do when I read these books. :)

B004YJZ5GM|5.0|I received a pristine copy of Blues For Allah, the first Grateful Dead release from Audio Fidelity of a promised five to follow. This is exciting news because this company consistently delivers satisfactory work whether on their 24K Gold CDs or on the brilliant 180g virgin vinyl remasters. The packaging too is very special and above standard in my estimation.   Let me begin with the Blues For Allah packaging. I have a copy of the original mid-'70's release, a single jacket with a paper insert with lyrics and credits. My copy is showing its history and the iconic cover art has lost its former lustre. The solid substance and sheen of this newly designed gatefold jacket was a pleasant upgrade as were the lyrics and credits now spread across the inside of the double cover.  I couldn't wait to hear the recording, but I had my amp sit a while as I read the words to the songs on the album and was transported to an earlier time.  I should be clear to note I read the English words to Blues For Allah for the detailed package design also includes the Hebrew, Arabic and Persian translations.   At this time I removed the vinyl from the audiophile-quality inner sleeve, examined the pressing - flawless to my eye, but the turntable stylus and speakers would be the true test.  Before I placed the album on the turntable I saw that the track information for both sides of the 180g pressing was printed on one record label - \\"the other side\\" (as it is noted on that label) has a full color image of the original harlequin-skeleton-with mandolin art work.  What a great touch - just another reason why I respect Audio Fidelity and continue my patronage.  The packaging aside, the main attraction to this company is based on the continued level of mastering by among the most respected and highly regarded engineers working today and an apparently very high standard of quality control regarding their pressings.  Listening to the record was like visiting with an old friend; one who hadn't aged, onewho matured and now offered sonic insights and secrets not previously revealed.  I know Blues For Allah inside and out and it never sounded so rich, warm, full and round - this is the essence of a remastering miracle. There's no comparison to an earlier CD re-issue in my collection and this new release clearly surpasses all that was available in the original album. Some may debate the quality of the Dead's body of studio albums which goes directly to my thesis that this version is full of life anew by way of nuanced aural revelations previosuly unavailable and unheard.  I can't wait to see and hear what's to be discovered on the future Grateful Dead titles from the good people at Audio Fidelity.

0684865130|1.0|I have read hundreds of books, and the enormous amount of hype surrounding this novel is unparalleled.  Personally, I attribute most of it to the chance luck of Heller in creating the often used phrase \\"Catch-22.\\"  Essentially, he coined a phrase that became an advertisement for the book.  If his title had been something slightly less appealing like \\"Catch-33\\" or if the term \\"Catch-22\\" was used but hidden in the text, rather than used as the title, no one would have ever heard of this book.    Another important attribute of this hype is the hipster element of Heller's title phrase.  It seems to imply that someone who read the book is deeply philosophical or understands a truth not many know.  This is not just my own imagination.  In college, I knew a guy who having already read the book, brought it (on a plane, cross country) seemingly to display in his dorm room.  Once, apropos of nothing, he picked it up and explained that it was his favorite book.  Coincidently, he also happened to be a dandy who wore (I think) satin shirts.    Heller's prose is plain and uninspired rather than brilliant or funny.  Worse yet, it goes on and on.  Incidents which might have made mediocre short stories get added together and filled out to a torturing tediousness.  Characters are wooden.  Dialogue and prose are mostly indiscernible from each other, except that the first is surrounded by quotation marks.  The result is too silly and boring to be a satire.  This is not Swift, or Graves's \\"I, Claudius\\", instead I would compare it to Graham Greene's horrible \\"Our Man in Havana.\\"    This is the sort of book that you might hear people discuss at snobbish cocktail parties.  If you get a third way it into and you are bored to tears, drop it like a brick, or better yet, avoid reading it all together.

0553386794|1.0|I'm going to say something here I never thought I would: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. WATCH THE TV SHOW INSTEAD. Why? Because it's better. Which, generally speaking, I would've said was impossible.<br /><br />I quit reading these books somewhere toward the end of the 3rd or beginning of the 4th book. These novels are extraordinary pieces of work, however there are some major flaws which eventually turned me off to the entire series. I'll explain.<br /><br />Pros: Martin creates a many-layered, incredibly detailed fantasy world replete with instantly memorable characters. The kingdoms, families, alliances and histories are amazing. His writing is very good and frequently excellent. Martin winds together vastly different storylines into a recognizable whole, told from the viewpoint of both central and non-central characters.<br /><br />Cons: Unbelievable, inconceivable, unforgivable episodes of catastrophic stupidity that afflict major characters when Martin needs dramatic effect or a shift in storyline.  Example 1: pretty much every decision made by Ned Stark after becoming the King's Hand - \\"You need me 1000 miles away from kin, home, and loyal supporters? No prob! I'll bring a teeny-tiny group of men and some of my children to a snake-pit of a city where I can't defend myself or them, then make enemies with every freaking faction in the capital! But, hey, I'm a military commander AND the equivalent of a hereditary earl, so naturally I'm a complete moron at both politics AND intrigue.\\" Yeesh.  Example 2: \\"I'm Jaime Lannister, one of the most ruthless and dangerous men in the 7 kingdoms, but I can't seem to kill a freaking 10-year-old. Like pulling him INTO a castle tower, killing him, THEN pitching him out.\\" Example 3: \\"I'm Daenerys Targaryen. I'll ride in with an army that butchered and burned your city, but when my hubby needs medical attention, I'll see if you can help.\\" This one REALLY sent me over the edge - imagine driving into a town with 10 super-violent friends. You drive over to the doctor's house, burn it down and kill his family. Then one of your guys needs medical attention, are you going to turn to the guy you just GAVE EVERY REASON TO KILL YOU for help?!? Not just stupid. Blinding, disastrous idiocy.<br /><br />This continues in the succeeding books (see most decisions by the Starks, Robb especially, Queen Cersei, and others). I finally got fed up and just quit. I simply didn't care anymore. Whenever a character appeared too competent, Martin simply rendered them retarded then dead.<br /><br />However, HBO has created a series that showcases the novel's virtues and minimizes their faults. This show truly is better than the novels. Tyrion Lannister, especially, comes across as a more sympathetic character.<br />So, save yourself the time and aggravation. Forget the books.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|Get the deluxe double disc version.  Iconoclast was intended as a double album but Nuclear Blast insisted that the band also release a single disc version.  The album starts out stellar with Iconoclast, End of Innocence, Dehumanized, and Bastards of the Machine.  After that, the song writing fluctuates just a bit, but there are amazing moments everywhere.  Children of a Faceless God, Electric Messiah, and Prometheus are especially badass.  I loved Paradise Lost, but this album is heavier, darker, and more epic in every way.  Romeo's chops are ridiculous on this record, and it's the best Russell has ever sounded.  As another reviewer pointed out, LePond's bass and Pinnella's keyboards are prominent in the mix which is refreshing.  Jason Rullo also hits a new benchmark on this one.  Precise double bass craziness as always, but he really shines in making the riffs groove.  Production is  good; just the typical compression most modern rock records suffer from.  I hope we get an uncompressed high-resolution multi-channel surround version of this on Blu-Ray audio at some point (see the recent re-release of Rush's Moving Pictures on Blu-Ray audio).  This album would be spectacular on a discreet 5.1 setup.

1594202710|5.0|One would be hard pressed to point to any relationship between two countries that will have greater global impact over the coming decades than the relationship between the United States and China. We would be equally hard pressed to find a better guide to understanding and explaining the historical foundation, current status and future prospects of that intricate, evolving and potentially brittle relationship than Henry Kissinger.<br /><br />Intellectual, academic, author, consultant to private and public leaders in both countries, and most significantly, as National Security Adviser and Secretary of State to Presidents Nixon and Ford, Kissinger was arguably the primary actor whose performance on the international stage shaped the current state of Sino-American relations.<br /><br />The name of Henry Kissinger's new book is \\"On China\\". A more accurate title might be \\"On Sino - American Relations - A Handbook for US and Chinese Diplomats and Leaders\\".<br /><br />In the preface and prologue Kissinger is explicit about his intentions:<br /><br />  \\"This book is an effort... to explain the conceptual way the Chinese think about problems of peace and war and international order, and its relation to the more pragmatic, case-by-case American approach... American exceptionalism is missionary... Chinese exceptionalism is cultural... A primary focus of this book is the interaction between Chinese and American leaders since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949.\\"<br /><br />Kissinger hits the mark. It is well written in an easily accessible style that does not require prerequisite knowledge of Chinese history or culture. Yet by simple virtue of its 530 page length, breadth and depth, the book requires a reader to make a commitment and bring a strong desire to understand the historic and cultural foundation on which current Sino-American relations are built.<br /><br />It is only in the last chapter and epilogue that Kissinger explains why it is vitally important for Americans (and Chinese) to make the effort to understand the cultural and psychological differences in our respective approaches to foreign relations. These differences have in the past and may again in the future lead to misunderstandings, distrust, unintended consequences and tragedy.  I suggest that anyone wondering whether to commit to the effort required by this tome to read the epilogue first. It doesn't give anything away, but it does raise the stakes and correctly frames the context needed to appreciate the rest of the book. I'll revisit the epilogue later in the review.<br /><br />\\"On China\\" is organized chronologically, beginning with the early history of China and ending with a look into her immediate future. Although it is structured as a historical timeline, it is not a conventional history nor does it pretend to be comprehensive. The history is offered as a framework for understanding the roots of the Chinese world view and (if we accept Kissinger's premise) as the keys to unlocking and understanding contemporary Chinese diplomatic approaches to managing US relations.<br /><br />Kissinger cites ancient Chinese texts and thinkers like Sun-Tzu and Confucius to compare and contrast American and Chinese approaches to international diplomacy. Throughout the arc of post revolutionary Chinese history, Kissinger repeatedly applies these ancient texts and principles to explain the contemporaneous Chinese attitudes and illustrate recent historic and current events including the Korean War, the Mao/Nixon/Kissinger initiatives to restore relations, two Vietnam wars and even the current currency/trade negotiations.  First he outlines ancient texts including Confucian thoughts, Sun Tzu's Art of War, Ming Dynasty strategies for \\"using barbarians to check barbarians \\", Han Dynasty tactics to use \\"five baits\\" to manage barbarians [foreigners], the game of \\"surrounding pieces\\" known as \\"Wei Qi\\" or \\"Go\\", and the pervasive perception afforded by millennia of Chinese cultural exceptionalism. Then he shows how these ideas and attitudes have been in the recent past and continue now to be practically applied by Chinese leadership to international relations in the modern era.<br /><br />Kissinger concludes with a warning. The failure to understand the differences in strategy and tactics applied by China and the US in international relations can lead to misunderstandings with tragic consequences. In chapters 4 and 5, he contends this is exactly what happened in Korea:<br /><br />  \\"In China's conflicts with both the United States and the Soviet Union, Mao and his top associates conceived of the threat in them of a wei qi concept - that of preventing strategic encirclement. It was in precisely these most traditional aspects that the superpowers had the most difficulty comprehending Mao's strategic moves... Mao was determined to prevent encirclement by any power or combination of powers,regardless of ideology, that he perceived as securing too many wei qi \\"stones\\" surrounding China, by disrupting their calculations. This was the catalyst that led China into the Korean War...\\"<br /><br />  \\" ... When the Chinese view of preemption encounters the Western concept of deterrence, a vicious circle can result: acts conceived as defensive in China may be treated as aggressive by the outside world; deterrent moves by the West may be interpreted in China as encirclement. The United States and China wrested with this dilemma repeatedly during the Cold War; to some extent they have not found a way to transcend it.\\"<br /><br />Which brings us to the epilogue - where Kissinger turns his eyes from looking back to looking forward and applying the lessons learned. The epilogue may be the rasion d'etre for the book. Here Kissinger asks the question \\"Will History Repeat Itself?\\" - clearly fearing it might, and perhaps hoping his book points to a way of avoiding the future he fears.<br /><br />The history that Kissinger hopes to avoid is not the recent Sino-American history that consumes his attention in the first 500 pages. Instead he invokes pre-World War I Europe where an emerging unified Germany challenged the preeminence of the dominant superpower of the age - the United Kingdom. He cites the \\"Crowe Memorandum\\" written in 1907 by a senior official in the British Foreign Office. In this memorandum (characterized by Kissinger as \\"brilliant\\") Crowe argues that future conflict is inherent in the relationship of the two powers.<br /><br />  Crowe concluded that it made no difference what goal Germany avowed. Whichever course Germany was pursuing, \\"Germany would clearly be wise to build as powerful a navy as she can afford.\\" And once Germany achieved naval supremacy, Crowe assessed, this in itself - regardless of German intentions - would be an objective threat to Britain and \\"incompatible with the existence of the British Empire.\\"<br /><br />The obvious comparison is to a rising China building as powerful a military and economy as it can, and begs the question whether China similarly becomes an objective threat to the United States - \\"regardless of intentions\\".<br /><br />Perhaps Kissinger sees this book as his own modern day \\"Crowe Memorandum\\". By calling attention to the potential dangers inherent in the relationship, he hopes to head off a similar catastrophic conflict. Certainly he finishes with suggestions to avoid such a fate, and strikes a hopeful (or wishful) note:<br /><br />  \\"I am aware that the cultural, historic, and strategic gaps in perception that I have described will pose formidable challenges for even the best intentioned and most far-sighted leadership on both sides. On the other had, were history confided the mechanical repetition of the past, no transformation would ever have occurred. Every great achievement was a vision before it became a reality. In that sense, it arose from commitment, not resignation to the inevitable.\\"<br /><br />Growing up in the shadow of the Vietnam war, I have mixed feelings about Henry Kissinger and in particular the role he played in the Nixon and Ford administrations. That said, I judge this book a success by the standards he set out in the preface, as well as by my own lofty expectations.<br /><br />Reading it has changed the way I look at China, our historical relationship, and the issues confronting us today and in the future.War I Europe where an emerging unified Germany challenged the preeminence of the dominant superpower of the age - the United Kingdom.

0894803123|5.0|This is a dated book written by two prototype Sixties guys with brains and a light touch. Made the vanilla ice cream recipe with my new Cuisinart and found it a tad too rich but very tasty. Since it was published in the 1980s, some new dairy products and home appliances have come on the market giving even more choices than Ben and Jerry's includes. For instance, I used my hand blender rather than a wisk. Cut down on the time and effort and helped make a delicious batch of ice cream. This is a fun book, easy on the eyes, written with a sense of humor, including the simplest and tastiest recipes. The idea is to enjoy making your ice cream as much as you enjoy eating it. It's the only ice cream recipe book I'll use along with the one that came with the Cuisinart. Enjoy!
0201485672|1.0|Too often we see a well respected name and assume that the content must be golden. I've had to revise my views after spending more time looking through the book. Initially I described this as being too verbose and being of use to new programmers only. I take that all back. I was not thorough enough to realise that there's some very bad advice here, and that learning to do things like this is going to lead to poor thinking.<br /><br />The book is clearly written by someone who thinks short = easy to understand. That isn't true. For proof see any piece of obfuscated code entered into one of the many competitions. If you inline everything, as suggested by the examples given of good inlining (inline method, inline temp, replace temp with query etc.) you end up with code that's actually harder to read, and harder to debug.<br /><br />Debugging is important to consider. If you inline, instead of being able to step over a method and examine or print the result in a variable your choices in a debugger are either to execute the method on it's own (only if you're sure it won't change state) or step through the method to see the result (in which case you've just broken your concentration and train of thought to jump to a whole other method). It's even worse if you don't have access to a debugger and have to print output to log or screen - it will be difficult to print the value of the inline call only when called from the particular method you're debugging. Unless you want to pass variables around just for debugging (or set and unset some kind of global) you're going to have the inlined method print out for every single invocation, making it much harder to follow debug output if the method is called in a lot of places.<br /><br />Since I'm not going to write a book in response to this one I'll cut it short and leave you with the parts of my original review made when I haven't looked at the book. I still stand by these initial impressions. The only thing I have removed is my reference to this being a good book for beginners. It's not. It will lead to poor coding, debugging and difficult to read code. I've downgraded my rating as low as I can accordingly.<br /><br />Since when does adding a parameter to a function require 4 compilations to get right? All his refactoring techniques seem to require an inflated number of intermediate steps and recompilations. That only wastes a little time if your code base is small, but it has the potential to be a real time waster on larger slower to compile projects.<br /><br />A less wasteful recipe for adding a parameter to a method signature would read: Search for all occurrences of the method. Change the method signature in the prototype to add the parameter, then change the method definition, then change calls to the method. Do each step carefully and check your work. Make sure you add the parameter in the same place/order in each change. Compile once with warnings switched on. Look carefully for problems in your compilation output. If the compilation breaks or you see warnings, fix the problems and try again. When it works, run your unit tests. After doing this a few times you should be able to aim for 0 errors on the first compile. Any more than an occasional error means you're being sloppy. Only make one change at a time.
B001POX73C|5.0|This is the second book I've read by this author.  I enjoy a book that makes you fall in love with the characters and there are a couple of characters you will slowly fall in love with while reading to the end.  This was a very enjoyable book with a nice amount of humor added in.
B004X80QNG|2.0|I used this app for years with Windows Mobile, and it was my favorite killer app.  I was excited to see the android port until I realized that it does not sync tasks with Outlook.  As an avid GTD'er who relies heavily on my phone as a pda, and needs to sync all of it with a corporate exchange server, this simply won't work for me.  It's a shame too, because PI is a great app.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|Those who said this concert was as good as when the boys were in their prime are wrong. It's better.    Thank goodness I, and Cliff and the Shadows, have stayed around long enough to be able to appreciate the technical advances which make performances like this so enjoyable. The sound is immaculate, the visuals are exciting and the camerawork brings the concert right into your living room. I remember so well seeing Cliff and the Shadows on a little flickering black and white screen lip-synching the songs; not because they couldn't perform them live, but because the live sound simply couldn't be recorded adequately.    Not that any technical advance would matter if the group couldn't deliver the goods. Happily, that isn't so; both the vocals and the instrumental backdrop are right on the money. These guys are totally professional and as tight as if they'd never stopped performing together. More than that, they are having such a good time that it's impossible not to share their enthusiasm.    The songs are familiar to everyone who knows their work and they haven't fiddled about much with the arrangements. In this day of dragged out, endless repetitions of lines which had little melody to start with, it's amazingly refreshing to hear songs which never last more than 3 minutes and yet leave you humming a tune. Today's artists, good as many of them are, could take a listen to this material and realize that more isn't always better (though I have to say that lyrically these aren't the most sophisticated songs around; 'Lucky Lips' and 'Dancing Shoes', for example, are pretty naive by today's standards!).    Of its type, this DVD is as good as it gets. Thoroughly recommended.
B00164CM46|5.0|Definitely a classic. Awesome movie, awesome history, awesome casting... Remastered images look pretty decent on BluRay    Had some troubles with shipment. After contacting Amazon support, another disk has been sent to me with no cost, and shipped to Brazil in 3 days.      Thanks Amazon
B004FLIXVS|4.0|Excellent Record!!!!! Pearl Jam more than grunge music, rock and roll music, eddie a real poetry<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I listen to a lot of music this days, trying to find a great album and great music, but this one, from one of my all time favorites, blow my mind, i had low expectations for this one, but i was dead wrong, the riffs and flows of the whole album are amazing, from the first song to the last. My favorite song is these days, but that is with a score of 10, where all the remaining songs have a scores of 9.8, 9.9, and so. Really, really a great album, a rock classic.
B003GJSUIQ|5.0|I love Avatar.  It is one of my favorite movies.  It's kind of funny, when I first saw it, I didn't really connect with it.  I mean I liked it, but I wasn't too excited about it.  Then recently I bought it on Blu-ray and have watched it many times since.  It grows on me every time and I notice more and more of the beauty of Pandora.  So it finally grew on me enough that I bought this mp3 album.  I decided to buy the deluxe edition because I figured I might as well get all the songs if I was going to do it.  The songs really sound great.  An excellent soundtrack.  My imagination really goes wild when I listen to these.  James Horner does a great job at mixing the Na'vi chanting and sounds in with the cinematic pieces.  I'm pleased with this album and look forward to Avatar 2's soundtrack as well as the movie.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The first thing that attracted me to Room was the cover - and then I read the description. After that I put off reading it after I had already purchased it until one of my friends read it, said it was good, and couldn't believe how sad it was.<br /><br />What is truly sad and difficult to read is watching Jack, who thinks Room is the only place in the world, marvel at the simplest of things with no knowledge of what else is going on the world.<br /><br />I am not going to spoil anything but if you are reading this review now - stop - go read the book, it's great.<br /><br />Okay so if you're reading this far you know that Ma and Jack get out of Room and the rest of the book is Jack, and Ma, getting used to the world.<br /><br />All I'll say is this: Room comes full circle and the ending really tugs at those heart strings.
B00008A7QK|5.0|Buckle my shoe indeed... Fire up your tube gear and put this bad boy on the turntable! I have had the vinyl version of this record since it first came out. I originally listened to it on a very basic tube system. Fast forward 40(!) years and here I am queing it up again on a nicer, more modern tube system. I don't have the CD version of this record (it is now in my cart).     When I first heard my original vinyl copy of Electric Warrior again I just about fell out of my chair! The T Rex sound is like no other and the production is outstanding. This music has a very timeless quality and sounds as fresh today as when it first came out. There are many well-known big name groups from this era that you can't quite say that about. Any of the first three T Rex albums have this sound to them so get one or all three. \\"Electric Warrior\\" is a great place to start. I especially, highly recommend the vinyl editions.

It was an older edition than I expected, but with this book that hardly matters and it may be more indicative that I have not kept up with recent editions of Strunk & White.

B002VLWJLY|5.0|I bought [[ASIN:0345501292 The Complete Making of Indiana Jones: The Definitive Story Behind All Four Films]] on the 30th anniversary of [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark]], and boy has it been a great way to celebrate Indy's birthday. The book provides a pretty detailed history of all 4 Indiana Jones movies, from Raiders to Crystal Skull. Also, it includes storyboard and production photos. It's a fairly quick read, but it looks beautiful and you'll probably find yourself flipping through this many times as you rewatch the movies.    One thing you start to realize reading the book is just how taxing the entire movie production was, both mentally and physically, for the cast and crew. While not quite as stressful for Spielberg as Star Wars was for Lucas, still it seems like every other page Harrison Ford is getting hurt or ILM fears it's in over its head. Spielberg even nearly broke down after weeks in Tunisia - a surprisingly candid recollection from an official Lucasfilm book. Also, while this book is published by Lucasfilm and hence isn't going to air dirty laundry, it still reveals quite a few interesting disagreements between the principals, including sometimes testy exchanges between Lucas and Spielberg over the story concepts (of course, relatively \\"testy\\", but still with some noticeable tension).     The book spends the most time on Raiders, but also covers Temple of Doom and Crystal Skull in some depth. I was disappointed that the Last Crusade, my favorite of the films, received the least attention. There were some interesting stories about the original concept for the third Indy movie (let's just say it involves a Monkey King and no Sean Connery), but after that it whizzes by.    One change I'd recommend would be to include the time or date of when a particular person said something. Rinzler includes thousands of direct quotes from the cast and crew, which is great, but it's also not entirely clear when certain people said something. I would interpret a quote that was spoken during production of the film differently than one stated some 20-30 years later in retrospect.  For example, Harrison Ford says Indy III was the most fun, but was that simply something he said during a promotional interview in 1989 or his feelings 20 years later? Most of the quotes seem to come from around the making of the films, but it's not entirely clear. Overall, I wish Rinzler had included more retrospectives from the principal cast and crew.    Overall, this is definitely THE book to get if you're an Indy fan. At least for Last Crusade, it's not quite definitive, but for the other movies it's pretty close to definitive.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|[[ASIN:B001IBIHQ4 The Pacific (HBO Miniseries)]] My father was in the 6th Recon. Company, 6th Marine Division, and was on Okinawa from 1 April 1945 until it was secured. The 1st Marine Division was on the 6th's immediate left flank at the blood bath on Sugar Loaf Hill (and the other two hills which created the \\"killing zone\\")which was handled as well as \\"Hell on Earth\\" can be handled. But the reality was total butchery. Finally, the Marines simply poured gasoline down the holes and caves, and used \\"Willie Peter\\" grenades to light them up. Then the bull dozers sealed up the caves, burying those suicidal Japs alive.<br />The Pacific was kind to the U.S. Army. They were supposed to cover the left flank of The 1st Marine Division, but fell behind, as usual. So two battaliones from the 2nd Marine Division had to be pulled out of reserve to do the job that the Army could not do. After all the Army had over 8 million men during WWII. The U.S.Marine Corps never exceeded 800,000 men, yet were able to defeated an entire empire on its own.<br />As an interesting side note,as the 6th Recon.Company closed in on the last holdout, the Marines over took the guards,but not before the Jap General committed ritual suicide. My father took the general's samurai sword, and one of the guard's rifles.<br />Years ago, the Jap family history is kept in the handle of the samurai. I imagine the Jap we got to translate it, contacted the family, and they wrote my father, requesting the samurai be returned. I would think the best answer lies in the fact that I have both of them; and hell could freeze over before they ever see that samurai sword. An old Marine saying:\\"Don't bring a sword to fight a Marine with a<br />BAR.\\"<br />I have read the book, and all of the books from which the facts were drawn. Every night, I read book after book on the Pacific War during WWII. I have watched \\"The Pacific\\" untold times, and I have cried each time. You see, my father died in 2003, and I continue to attempt to bring him back through books and movies. \\"The Pacific\\" is the closest that I have come.rough books and movies. \\"The Pacific\\" is the closest that I have come.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. If you are into the arts and literature, have visited Paris with an understanding of either, or are just a hopeless romantic, you will love this movie. It touches on many other genres, but one has to be careful in a review to not disclose too much in this almost magical experience. Frankly, I have not always cared for Woody Allen produced movies, but that was sometimes because WA acted in many of them, and I always had difficulty identifying with him in the roles in which he played. This time around, he found Owen Wilson to take his place, and OW is perfectly cast. In fact, I found all of the casting to be remarkably thoughtful. Poor casting is one of the great weaknesses in most modern films, but WA hit it just right for this movie with all roles. As each layer of the plot unfolds, I was amazed at my comfort at the casting. This movie is a gem, and will become a cult classic. This will be one of those rare movies I need to watch again over the years.

0525425578|4.0|I was amazed how John Grisham created a kids book, but this is actually aimed for teens. However, Grisham portrays the main character as a perfect thirteen year old teen who is a straight 'A' student who is a hero, solves crimes, gives legal advice, and wishes to practice law. He is the type of kid who isn't afraid to speak up but is respectful to his peers and to his parents. Grisham starts off with the harsh reality of child neglect, drug abuse,and alcohol problems. When Theo's best friend, April,disappears from her bedroom in the middle of the night, it is up to Theo to solve the mystery and to find her. Grisham does add some scary moments like when the police found a body in the river with a similar clothing Theo gave to April. Overall, this novel is a great sequel to the first book, Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer, but the first one is better.

B004TF3HZ2|5.0|Live Rails is another great live show from Steve Hackett and his band. The difference here is he has some renewed inspiration through having an almost completely different band from the last couple of albums. It really adds an uplifting spirit about the band as a whole. With the release of \\"Out of the Tunnels Mouth\\" last year and Steve's recent break-up with long-time wife and partner Kim Poor, Steve seems to have come back with a somewhat stronger edge to his work. The CDs cover some of his new material as well as some older solo stuff and some even older Genesis material. All played superbly. If you are a Steve Hackett fan then I definately recommend this one for you, as it is a great addition to your collection of Hackett recordings. If you are new to Steve's work then I would also recommend this because it is a nice representation of what he can do as a guitarist and the magical content of his music and songwriting.
1401322425|5.0|If you like flavor coupled with nutrition, this book is for you!  If you try the freezer jams, you'll never go back to eating anything that's been heated or cooked down; the flavor is incredible. Everything in the books is an education and I also greatly appreciate the fact that he structured most of them for two adult portions...no huge amounts of left-overs and it reinforces portion control.      Hadn't really heard of Jamie until recently (no I don't live under a rock), but I'm definitely a fan now and it's his TV programs that did it!  Do yourself a favor and watch the Jamie at Home series, the book follows it exactly and you'll get even more out of it.    Clara  Spring, Texas

0061784788|5.0|I have been a fan of James Rollins for quite a few years now, and I've been hooked like a junky craving his next fix...a fix which is increasingly more difficult to deal with considering the gaps between releases. Now I WILL say this: with the addition of his Jake Ransom series and 'Alter of Eden', a stand-alone release, James has had a literally phenomenal run as of late...however, when you're hooked, the wait seems to feel longer & longer, even when sometimes it really isn't. I suppose all things considered, I'd rather wait for a 'great' novel than get a relatively 'good' novel sooner.<br /><br />The Sigma Force series, which began with Sandstorm (yet another home run hit, btw), has never been better, and with The Devil Colony, we have the best to date. Its hard to summarize this story without giving too much away...let me ask you this: what does Thomas Jefferson have to do with the founding of America...? You probably only THINK you know the whole truth. The famous trek West by Lewis & Clark, did it have a secret agenda that history has ignored--or have we purposely been kept in the dark about? The Great Seal of the United States has a connection with an all but forgotten American Indian, who some consider a Lost Founding Father...so what is the connection all about? Did some ancient cultures actually manufacture tools which have nanotechnology built in...fiction or did it in fact actually happen? What does the Book of Mormon have to do with it all? Trust me, it takes an unusually skilled author to bring all of these elements together as seamlessly as Rollins does. Not only are most the topics 100% true--it becomes increasingly difficult to separate fact & fiction as you progress further into this Sigma Adventure. One of my favorite parts of reading a Rollins novel is going through the last few pages which--thankfully--answers the question as to what really IS truth and what was simply grand storytelling (sometimes truth IS stranger than fiction).<br /><br />Whether you find yourself in the mountains of Utah, inside Fort Knox or making a grand discovery of what happened to the Anasazi Indians who inexplicably disappeared hundreds of years ago without a trace, The Devil Colony is a force to be reckoned with from literally the first page on. I've said for years now that while I really LOVE all his books, Map of Bones was Rollins best all-around tale...but with The Devil Colony, its time I made a much-needed amendment to my opinion. Hands down the most all-out entertaining novel I've read in at LEAST 5 years. I KNOW how irritating it is when I see blurbs on the backs of books which say 'once you start, you can't stop'...mostly 'cuz the phrase is SO over-used...but honestly, I cannot think of anything to say other than be careful: once you start this book, it is VERY difficult to put down. I found as I read late into the night that I would make deals with myself, saying I'd stop...after the NEXT chapter, only to break that promise time & again. Maybe you have better self-control, but I guess if I'm going to have a lapse, I'm glad it was while reading this.<br /><br />Once again, the wait is on for whats coming next...THANKS, James, you hit a Grand Slam with this one, kudos--I simply loved it!rself in the mountains of Utah, inside Fort Knox or making a grand discovery of what happened to the Anasazi Indians who inexplicably disappeared hundreds of years ago without a trace, The Devil Colony is a force to be reckoned with from literally the first page on.

B0043RT8E0|5.0|In this book, the author has gotten down on paper the outline of a philosophy that I've been asked to explain in the past, but didn't have the words for. An easy read, with many examples of the author's philosophy on life, those well known and not so well known (doesn't matter, in the grand context). Very similar to the trite phrase often heard these days, \\"Follow your bliss!\\". But an important, basic way of seeing the world, and the possibilities. Understanding this basic tenet from young would be of great benefit to everyone. I would like my teenage daughter to read this book.    As for the few naysayers here yelling \\"But HOW do I do this??\\", I guess expecting some sort of workbook, or those claiming this book is a collection of People mag articles on \\"celebrities,\\" I have to assume you are the types who buy self help books by the carload, looking for easy answers.The US has become a country of lazy, easy fix/do nothing for easy gain, \\"want it now!\\" types who whine from their armchairs, wanting others to take their hand and walk them towards whatever nirvana they imagine they'd like to have. The POINT is, everyone has to do the work ... in this case, INNER work (ah, you have no idea what I'm talking about. I thought so.), in order to gain the ideal situation for themselves in life (whatever that situation might be - sometimes it's not what we thought it would be ...). Get off your butts, learn some reading comprehension and figure it out for *yourselves.* Another little tidbit for your crowd - it's much more rewarding to have done for yourself, rather than acting like a sick patient and having others do for you. Watch the movie Wal-ii. I know, it's a Disney animated movie. But see those folks in the easy boy recliner transport vehicles who've got blobs for legs cuz they've done nothing in their lives 'cept move in circles while sitting on their butts all their lives within their little hideholes? (Frankly, I think this movie is genius. Laughed out loud when I sawthose characters.) Now look in the mirror. Then take some action!

I understand that Mr. Simon is trying to make music refreshing and interesting -and he should be commended for taking a risk in unexplored musical terrain that few have had the courage to go.<br /> If you're looking for music that has succeeded in making interesting music please see:<br />(PAUL SIMON TAKE NOTE )  1)Beatles: Within You Without You 2) Beatles: Tomorrow Never Knows 3) Beatles: I am the Walrus 4) Splinter: Which Way Will I Get Home, 5) Byrds: Mind Gardens 6) Beatles Strawberry Fields Forever 7) Rolling Stone:2000 Light Years From Home 8) Simon and Garfunkel -Save the life of My Child<br />What's even sadder is a solo album with no harmony!!!!!!!!!!<br />And there is very little if any vocal creative harmony on this recording-<br />What's real pathetic is Paul Simons Web Page sights Rolling Stone Magazine's review of So Beautiful or So What as evidence of its greatness- when this is the same pathetic magazine that in 1970 reviewed and trashed Simon and Garfunkel's masterpiece \\"Bridge Over Trouble Water\\". When Rolling Stone Magazine says its great chances are its garbage. In fact if you take anything this magazine says (from a musical point of view)seriously you should consider getting a psych evaluation.<br />Yes there are those who'll tell you that this is a great piece of musical work from a successful musical genius - and you know what these are the same people who listen to it a couple of times who file it into their vast CD collection (along with their egocentric opinions) where it collects dust next to Surprise and You're the One.<br />Lets face it- very few people have been able to create a solo record were all the songs are enjoyable. But sadly none of these recordings come no where near the experience known as enjoyable!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I actually think this game is more fun than Angry Birds! Easy to play. Challenging enough to be fun for both kids &amp; adults! It's also a great way to kill time, or cure boredom! My daughters and I are totally hooked on this game! HTC EVO 4G
B004VFYPTW|4.0|Amazing Value for this great sounding audio/DVD video package. This represents the later part of Whitesnake's \\"sunset strip hairband period!\\" all of which from an image standpoint, was absolutely LOL! Did Spinal Tap teach us nothing?  I mean, what people dress like this? That aside the music is top quality rock and this is a very worthy addition to the collection of any rock fan. Now, where's my studded leatherette codpiece?! PLAY IT LOUD!!

B0056BMK6K|1.0|This is an easy to read in just an hour or so book, but I felt like I was in a sales seminar more than anything.   I suppose the big question is this: What is your motivation for writing? If your motivation is money, then I suppose this would be a great \\"how to\\" book.   This book didn't speak to me at all. Even at its low price, I feel it is a waste of money.
0446567337|4.0|i got the book right when it was expected and it was in the condition they stated. i was very pleased. but then i saw i had another package from the same people. and it was a huge package. i checked to see if it was addressed to me then opened it. i ended up with 4-5 books that werent even related to the book i bought at all. they were western romantics. i emailed them right away assuming it was someone elses order. they got back to me like a week later and now i have to go through returning books i didnt want in the first place, im sure this is just a one time mix up but its still annoying. i'll probably still order from them though.
0345529057|5.0|These books are fantastic.  I didn't know when I ordered them the most recent book came out around 5 years ago.  I hope the next two don't take as long.
0553381695|5.0|Wow what an amazing experience this series has been so far. I was lucky enough to start it before the show and it helped me tremendously and filled in sub-plots that are only hinted at. I try to read negative reviews on everything to try and find flaws and reasons not to read. In this instance the nay sayers are wrong in my opinion. This was just as good as the first, because it only added to a great story filled with characters you can't help but love. I'm trying not to read all 4 too quickly because I'll have to quit cold turkey.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have the kindle edition of this  4 book set.  I will not give it a lengthy review, as there is no need.  The only complaint is there is not enough hours in the day to finish as much as I want to read.        How do you explain books as exciting and thrilling as these?  I can hopefully help you by saying - I have 56 medieval / fantasy / knights/ highlander themed books and these are 4 of my favorites, and I WILL read them all over again as soon as I am done with the 5th book when I get it next month.    If you dont mind I need to add that HBO's show is perfection, as close to the book as it can be, and didnt appear to leave anything really important out.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|I thought there would be a little more humor, but this is a happy little movie to watch when you are feeling down. I never read the book, so I cannot comment on that.
B004XZ99LO|1.0|This blu-ray disc does not play on my LG 3D blu-ray player. To date I have about twenty 3D titles on blu-ray and this is the only one that does not work properly. I tried it also on my pioneer blu-ray burner and it did not play properly. The quality of the blu-ray disc seems much cheaper than the others that I have - disc is very flimsy.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The are only a few reasons I didn't give this a five stars is:  1. One of the extended scenes from ALIEN (right before Lambert is killed) is not included.   2. There is much more sexually based foul language in the last two films.  3. In one of the extras for ALIEN RESURRECTION has Sigourney Weaver bearing her breast for all to see. I didn't see any point in this.  The last two reasons are why I didn't give it five stars.
B002PJ4NIO|5.0|*The Chronicles of Narnia* is perhaps the best-loved series of all time. It is loved by not just children, but men and women of all ages. I have grown up since I was eleven years old with these beloved stories, and they, along with CS Lewis' other writings that I discovered as an adult, have had an immeasurable impact on my life.<br /><br />Indeed, I feel almost shy about writing a review of any of these books, but I will try to do so. We will start with the first review about the first book, *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe*. I am going to be reviewing these in publishing order, not chronological order.<br /><br />Most everyone knows the base story. Probably many know it better than their own country's history. Many children are sent into the English countryside to escape the air raids over London by the German *Luftwaffe* during World War II. Among these are four siblings, the Pevensies. They are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They are extremely fortunate to end up in the house of a wealthy Professor.<br /><br />Once at the house, first Lucy, then Edmund, and eventually all four of the children, wind up in the enchanted land of Narnia. Really, (as shall be revealed in later books) it is a completely other dimension/universe from our own. The country of Narnia in this other world is ruled by a tyrant, the White Witch Jadis, who is determined to kill the children to thwart a prophecy that states that when four humans, two boys and two girls, sit on the thrones in the castle of Cair Paravel, it will mean the end of her tyranny and her life.<br /><br />Along the way, many adventures are had, and many lessons are learned. Edmund betrays them, and is repentant later on. He is redeemed from his stain of betrayal by Aslan the Lion, Who leads the children and the Narnians to triumph over the Witch and her forces.<br /><br />The novel is not just an example of superb storytelling, but also of wit, description, and wonderful use of the English language. The subtle jokes and historical references are enjoyable, and lead to the audience actually *thinking* about what they are reading. The descriptions and elegant use of language is absolutely captivating. The audience is transported directly into the story, and can almost see and smell what the characters do, and eat the foods along with them. What I mean by the masterful use of the English language is how Lewis was not overly \\"high-minded\\" in his words and descriptions. He was elegant without seeming snooty. This is not always easy to do, and Lewis did it quite well.<br /><br />All of these ideas are well-known about the book, but there is even more to glean from the work. To be sure, the most important element in the story is the symbolic truth of Christ, and His atoning death on the Cross for our sins via the story of Aslan giving His life in place of Edmund the traitor. Lewis once stated how culture in the West has become too comfortable and familiar with the Scriptures, and thus they have lost much of their impact on us. When we are moved by the story of Aslan dying for Edmund (and rising in the end), or even of any sacrificial character in other stories (whether they rise like Gandalf, or stay dead), it is really the truth of the Scriptures touching our hearts.<br /><br />There are many other areas that I could examine, but I will focus on one more that I think reviewers do not focus on enough. This area deals with heroism and the modern definition and view (a very *Christian* view), that would have been familiar to Lewis given his studies of literature and various periods of history, including the so-called \\"Dark Ages\\".<br /><br />I do not know for certain what Lewis thought beyond what he has said, and I heartily disdain putting words in an author's mouth. I have always hated that people say what an author thinks, especially if they don't know what the author thinks, or if their statements of the author's intents actually *contradicts* the author's beliefs.<br /><br />Theabove disclaimer is to serve as a notice that I can not guarantee what I am venturing is correct about CS Lewis' intentions. But I will try to gauge his idea of a hero, because it is important for us to consider how even in this area, the Bible impacted our culture and Lewis' story. In the history of the West and of America in particular, there is a falsehood that many erroneously believe. This is that the culture we all embrace comes from the Greco-Roman heritage of the West. This is pure bunk. To be sure, the love of learning and the importance of the Law were gleaned from the Greco-Roman history, but the moral and philosophical underpinnings that have made the West more vibrant, and more ready to use knowledge to better ourselves and others, than any other civilization in history are the result of the Christian Faith.<br /><br />What this has to do with the idea of heroism is that the gods and heroes in Greek mythology were vile and cruel creatures. They were murderous and petty, and took obscene delight in hurting and torturing people. The idea of the hero as the strongest one who exerts his will on others is the Greco-Roman idea of the hero. The idea was changed and altered as Christianity became the dominant force in the West.<br /><br />Really, the early concept embraced by the Church is identical, except that the obvious change had started in the morality of the hero. The hero was called on to do good in honor of God. This was due to the Church taking the knightly orders under it's control, in order to put an end to indiscriminate killings for \\"glory\\" that many of the supposed \\"heroes\\" pursued.<br /><br />Eventually, a Reformation and Enlightenment came and went, and the \\"hero\\" changed. Now the hero was expected to act as the Lord Jesus Christ acted. Sacrifice for the sake of others is what marks a true hero. This is what is special about Aslan the Lion, and even Edmund as well. Aslan sacrifices his life for Edmund, and via the prophecy, *all of Narnia itself*. Edmund sacrifices himself to save his fellow Narnians and his family when he destroys the Witch's wand, leaving himself open to attack.<br /><br />This sacrificial hero is important to our history, and it is one we are fast losing. Lewis has helped us to revive this great ideal and this great Truth. Indeed, many other concepts and Truths are buried in LWW, as in they are in the rest of the Narnia books. For helping to teach, and ingrain them in the minds of many men and women for nearly sixty years, we owe a massive debt to Lewis.<br /><br />This book inaugurates a series that has many \\"hidden\\" nuggets of wisdom and moral ideals that we would all do well to notice and embrace. It is also a frollicking good story. Please pick up this book and the others, you will *NOT* regret it.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.I am venturing is correct about CS Lewis' intentions.

B00127RAJY|3.0|The exercises in this video are great.  Tough for first timers, but a few weeks in these are great for limited time workouts.  I still use this DVD 2 years after buying it, but soon I will order different DVDs.  This DVD is starting to get too annoying.    There are two cons with this video.  First the developers poorly chose the limits for skipping to the menu.  From the time you pop in the DVD to the time you start the workout it is about 4-5 minutes.  Some introductory scenes can be skipped manually but two cannot.  The most annoying is the one where Jillian goes over how tough she is.  Once you've done this DVD 50 times, you don't need to see that anymore, you just want to workout.  Any when you have limited time, that 4-5 minute wait sucks.  Best to pop it in the DVD, hit play, keep the TV off, and come back in 5-10 minutes, or the next morning.  Then you just go to the workout you want and skip the rest.  The second, slightly annoying thing, which you only notice after using it many times, is that Jillian contradicts herself in the different workouts.  For example in one workout she'll say she always does this warm-up exercise and in the other workouts, she doesn't do it at all.  A nitpick, I know.    The benefits are the exercises and the hot blonde.  This DVD is good, but be prepared to get annoyed at it too.
159420229X|5.0|I almost stopped reading this book halfway through the Chapter 1.  It sounded very verbose.  I was thinking \\"get to the point already, just tell me how to improve my memory!\\".<br /><br />But I am glad that I continued to read.  The rest of the book was very interesting.  It covered the history of memory improvement techniques as well as the latest research on how the brain functions.  This book is not a self help book devoted to improving the readers memory, there are probably better books for that purpose.<br /><br />This is an interesting book, definitely worth reading.  It will be in my all time favorite book list.
B001V9LPWQ|3.0|...but, despite it's digital resolution tweaks, Snow White (while dear to many people's nostalgic hearts) is still one of the weakest of the library.<br /><br />A relic of its era, with cupie doll voice actress Adriana Caselotti in the title role, the songs are quaint but not really thrilling. The story is typical early Disney (what with it being Disney's first feature) with plenty of physical comedy and a handsome prince who wakes the dear maiden with a kiss.<br /><br />Definitely something for the kids, but not as accessible to adults as the early Disney shorts were. It's innocent and light and really rather harmless.<br /><br />Still, the special features are to die for and it's great to see the vault open (\\"for a limited time only~\\") like they do every decade or so... a typical consumer would probably be safe with the only the DVD edition, the Blu-Ray being only necessary for collectors.
B000FDECGA|5.0|I ordered this film from Amazon after knowing about it for quite some time. This is a fun movie to watch with enough battles to keep the action junkie entertained. The blood shed is similar to Kill Bill with plenty of blood spraying out of a victim who has just suffered the loss of a limb.The movie has a running time of 85 minutes and moves along at a nice pace without dulling the viewer. The story is narrated by the little boy who accompanies his father on \\"the road to vengeance\\". The boy tells it hows it is  without  being naive or childlike. He has a calm and collected voice which demonstrates his understanding of the kill or be killed world he lives in,which sets a nice tone for the film.The dvd picture is of good quality. The dubbing is good, I've read that they used deaf lip readers to aid in the dubbing process.The only voice that seems a bit out of place is that of the shogun who seems to have had a reverb effect added to his voice.If your into films involving sword play and blood splatter that has the colorful richness of 70's slasher flick this is a movie for you.

B0036EH3WU|5.0|My Lost: complete collection took almost two weeks to finally get to my house. It was an agonizing wait but the minute I opened it when it finally got here I knew it was definitely worth the long wait. This is, by far, the coolest box set I have ever seen. The pyramid that holds all the little trinkets is extremely detailed with different raised pictures on each side and the texture is really interesting. The bonus disc was really fun to find, and the features on it were great(I had a lot of fun finding all the little easter eggs). The black light is awesome, there are tons of hidden pictures to search for all over the box and its contents. The senet game looks fun and I plan to play it as soon as I can with my cousin (who is also a Lost-lover). The ankh was pretty cool as well. I thoroughly enjoyed leafing through the episode guide and seeing all the great pics inside it. The black rock journal entry, though the writing was hard to read, was quite enlightening. And I know that some people think that the size of the DVD case is to big and they hate that it is, but I think it's really cool and I personally couldn't care less about the size of the boxes I'm just proud to be the owner of the greatest show on television. I can't wait to start watching Lost again!!!!!
B002JVWQT6|5.0|I purchased this for my wife. We both watched it together since we had missed most of season 1 when it was first out on TV. IMO it's the funniest sitcom since Seinfeld. Definately worth having.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|The mass media tends to ignore fantasy stories, especially high fantasy stories. So it came as a pleasant surprise to me that George R.R. Martin's fantasy epic A Song Of Ice And Fire was being adapted for television -- and HBO crafts it with all the dignity it deserves, with plenty of grime, blood and a tangle of convoluted storylines.<br /><br />The castle of Winterfell is thrown on its ear when King Robert (Mark Addy) of Westeros arrives to ask Eddard \\"Ned\\" Stark (Sean Bean) to be his Hand. But soon after Ned agrees, he receives a message from his mentor's widow, informing him that Queen Cersei's (Lena Headey) family, the Lannisters, are secretly plotting against the king -- and that they are killing off anyone who might be a threat to them.<br /><br />One of Ned's younger sons is gravely wounded when he sees something shocking, and the acid-tongued dwarf Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) is framed for the crime. Ned's bastard son Jon (Kit Harington) joins the Watch near the Wall -- but has little idea of the horrors that are approaching with the White Walkers.<br /><br />And across the Narrow Sea, exiled princess Daenerys Targaryen is wed to the barbarian lord Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), so that her brother can invade Westeros and take back the throne. But Daenerys quickly grows in strength and wisdom, and the Small Council of Westeros has reason to fear her when it's found that she's pregnant -- but her greatest power is that of the dragon's daughter.<br /><br />As Ned takes to his new duties, he begins investigating the death of his predecessor, and begins to uncover a shocking secret about the queen and her children. Treachery, death and war will be brought to Westeros, and a war will begin with the blood of the good-hearted.<br /><br />\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is truly an epic story -- it took a whole ten episodes to encapsulate a single book, and the story is far from over. There are countless plot threads woven into one enormous, bloodsoaked tapestry, linked together even if they are technically separate. And since this is only based on the first of Martin's books, it ends on a note both depressing and uplifting. Lots of plot threads are left dangling, but in such a way that you end up wanting to know what happens next.<br /><br />The entire series is draped in cold stone walls, grimy medieval atmosphere, windswept steppes, splatters of dark blood and the occasional sunny day. They don't skimp on explicit violence (including the death of a beloved character) or sex, but the focus here is always on the clashing families, battles and seedy plots of the queen. And despite that focus, there is still a hint of the magical in this fantasy -- talk of dragons, the White Walkers and their undead wights.<br /><br />As for the cast, it is BRILLIANT -- Sean Bean is perfection as the world-weary, good-hearted Eddard, and he's got a brilliant backing cast in Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, the amazing Peter Dinklage, Jason Momoa, Michelle Fairley, and countless others. Even the child actors like Maisie Williams and Jack Gleeson are absolute perfection.<br /><br />And best of all, their characters are all so REAL. They have good points and bad points, strengths and failings, and they often change drastically over the course of the season (Daenerys turns from a pallid little wallflower to a powerful and icy queen).<br /><br />\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a truly spellbinding experience, if not one that you want to see all together. Bloody, complicated and full of richly-developed characters, this is a future classic.since this is only based on the first of Martin's books, it ends on a note both depressing and uplifting.

0143039601|5.0|When I came into correspondence with one of America's top short story writers, I shipped him a copy of \\"The Dharma Bums\\" as a thank you gift for answering some of my questions.  I did this not only because its rough-cut pages make the book a wonder to handle, but because I think it's imperative for any devotee of American literature to read.<br /><br />Jack Kerouac envisioned that his many books would ultimately form a self-contained, complete volume which all linked together, an autobiography he entitled the \\"Duluoz Legend.\\"<br /><br />He writes, \\"The whole thing forms one enormous comedy, seen through they eyes of poor Ti Jean (me), otherwise known as Jack Duluoz, the world of raging action and folly and also of gentle sweetness seen through the keyhole of his eye.\\"<br /><br />Kerouac's more frequently read \\"On the Road\\" showcases his innovation of spontaneous prose through a frenetic story that glorifies what is arguably immoral rebellious behavior.  \\"The Dharma Bums,\\" set about seven years later, again utilizes his madcap writing style, but in a way much more accessible to the reader than many of his other works.  For how they snub conventional grammar and syntax, \\"The Subterraneans,\\" \\"Big Sur,\\" and \\"Satori in Paris\\" are dizzying.<br /><br />\\"The Dharma Bums,\\" however, expands into a commentary on Zen Buddhism through a sort of travelogue that chronicles Kerouac's meditations and wanderings through nature.  It's a modernist adaptation of the works of the roaming poets of ancient Japan, most notable among them Matsuo Basho.  Here Kerouac effortlessly glides past the preconceived notions of what form literature is supposed to take, and in so doing, with his melodic prosody, he renders a reading experience that is vivid and transcendent.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Fantastic Mr. Fox (animation, adventure, comedy)<br />Directed by Wes Anderson<br />Starring the voices of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray and Michael Gambon<br /><br />20th Century Fox   2009   87 min   Rated PG   Released Mar 23, 2010<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English, French, Mandarin (Simplified and Traditional), Portuguese, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD copy (with digital copy)<br /><br />*Spoilers within*<br /><br />Wes Anderson's films are traditionally quirky and full of complex themes, and his adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox is no different. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's animated (stop motion); this material is not targeted at children.<br /><br />When we join the story, Mrs. Fox (Streep) is telling Mr. Fox (Clooney) that she's pregnant. The two proceed to rob a chicken farm and narrowly escape capture. Mrs. Fox makes him promise to look for other work now that they are about to become parents. Mr. Fox agrees and finds a job writing a newspaper column.<br /><br />Mr. Fox settles down in his new life, but always regrets giving up his old ways. He's also tired of living in a hole in the ground and wants a better home for his family. He goes to see Badger (Murray), who advises him about properties for sale in the area. Fox wants a house near three local farms, but Badger suggests that the neighborhood is too dangerous. The local children even have a rhyme about the farmers:<br /><br />Boggis, Bunce and Bean<br />One fat, one short, one lean<br />These horrible crooks<br />So different in looks<br />Were nonetheless equally mean<br /><br />Fox is aware of the danger, but yearns for his former chicken-stealing days. As Anderson regularly reminds us, these are wild animals. Fox can't deny his nature and buys the new house so that he can be close to the three farms.<br /><br />His decision goes directly against his promise to his wife and that was his first mistake.<br /><br />There's a lot of humor in the film, but it's generally quite subtle. The family sits down to eat dinner and they eat like wild animals. The food is gone in seconds. Their son, Ash, is moody and craves attention from his father. He spits on the floor when he's angry or disappointed and he clearly has problems. When his cousin Kristofferson comes to stay, the situation worsens. Fox seems to favor Kristofferson over his own son and compliments him constantly.<br /><br />Forget that we're dealing with animals for a moment and think about the story. If that happened in a regular movie, we would be dealing with a typical family drama. Husband and wife break promises and have trust issues, while their son is being raised by parents who don't understand him. This is not the kind of story that small children would understand, although some of the scenes are funny and contain action that would appeal to a child.<br /><br />Fox enlists the help of Kylie Opossum and the two steal chickens from Boggis. The action is typical animated fare and the way the two sneak around is funny. They lace blueberries with a sedative to get past the dogs and the way the dogs react is also funny. They successfully steal from Bunce and plan to stop once they steal cider from Bean. For the final robbery, Ash wants to come along. Fox won't let him, but allows Kristofferson to take part. He seems to have very little idea that such a decision could hurt his son's feelings.<br /><br />The robberies are fun to watch, especially when the animals wear bandit hats. It reminds me of the robbery in Bottle Rocket when the participants decide to wear similar hats even though their victims have already seen their faces.<br /><br />Ash yearns to be an athlete and wants to emulate his father's success at Whack-Bat (a game which parodies cricket). Kristofferson is a balanced individual who regularly meditates and knows karate. Ash is extremely jealous of his cousin and his ability to win his father's approval.<br /><br />The three robberies annoy the farmers, so Bean (Gambon) decides to organize the trio and plans to kill Fox. This is where the film starts to take on a more serious tone. Mrs. Fox discovers that her husband has been lying to her and scratches his face in a fit of temper. This scene annoyed one of my friends who expected the film to be lighthearted and suitable for the whole family. Mrs. Fox acts like the wild animal she is. There's another scene in which one of the animals is maimed. Although it's presented in a humorous way, it could disturb people.<br /><br />The remainder of the film deals with the three farmers finding ways to threaten the existence of Fox and his friends. They escape by tunneling deeper, but face the threat of starvation if they don't find a solution. Some of the other animals resent Fox for putting them in such a dangerous situation.<br /><br />There's considerable peril which could worry small children, and a lot of humor which would probably fly over their heads. It was only given a PG-rating, but be aware that not every child will like this harsh world. The animals are true to their nature.<br /><br />The reason I like the film so much is the style of humor. Like Bottle Rocket and The Darjeeling Limited, the characters speak with a sense of irony or sarcasm and most of the humor is tongue-in-cheek. It feels similar to Tarantino or the Coen brothers at times. There's no swearing, but every character uses the word \\"cuss\\" in situations in which they would normally swear. I found that particularly funny. One animal questions why a ransom note was made using words cut out of a magazine when everyone already knew the identities of the kidnappers. That's also funny to me. The missions all have elaborate titles and remind me of the way Tarantino uses chapters in his stories.<br /><br />Fantastic Mr. Fox is an exercise in style. Mr. Fox himself is very stylish, dressing smartly and using his trademark whistle when he thinks he's being clever or cool. Clooney was a great choice for the part and the other actors all do a good job too.<br /><br />The story is essentially about a dysfunctional family and shows how Ash attempts to come to terms with his existence. Will Mr. Fox eventually become a better father? Will Ash grow up and take responsibility for his own actions? Do Mr. and Mrs. Fox strengthen their marriage, or will the trust issues tear them apart? There's a lot going on beneath the surface.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />The look of Fantastic Mr. Fox is virtually flawless. The frames were shot digitally with a high quality camera and the detail is superb throughout. You can see every hair on the puppets and the stitches in their clothing.

B002BGFUPQ|3.0|This one is so silly that  crowds of thousands of people magically part in downtown tokyo so the 'drifters' can come through. And lets be honest drifting is lamest form of racing in cars ever, but that's just what most people who like car racing feel about it not everyone! . This has a backstory about a yankee in tokyo who must fit in. This one can't compete on any level with the other flicks but it's still worth owning if you like this over the top series. Which lets face it , the whole series is like a teen fantasy flick with cars doing impossible tasks. But fantasy race movies are no more silly than some sci fi flicks! which I love so.... Still this is like alot of series where it's only very loosely attached to the other movies and that's ok but if you like the others you will probably be disapointed with this one to a degree. On blu ray this looks splendid being a new movie you would not expect less.  The acting is decent here but this isn't a high drama really but a teen car movie and that's what you get. A movie that's not about a cop infiltrating racers and such but a teen flick.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I just downloaded this terrific eBook and read it in a couple of hours. It's a quick read and I appreciate that; my time is valuable and I love an author who can cut to the chase! John Locke has delivered a very thorough yet succinct account of how he drove up sales of his 99¢ eBooks to become one of today's bestselling authors on amazon.com.<br />This is not a book on how to write a bestseller. This is a book directed at authors who have already done their due diligence, carefully crafting the best book they can before bringing it to market. He urges his readers to--first and foremost--write a great book. Might seem like obvious advice, but it's critically important for all of us to put our best foot forward! Once we've written our books and self-edited them to the best of our ability, it's a good idea to have them edited and proofread by professionals, and to pay for an outstanding cover design.<br />Marketing comes only after we have a polished product to sell, and here is where you will find some great advice. I love the fact that the author shares his early mistakes in marketing his eBooks, telling us not only what didn't work, but why it didn't. That advice alone is going to save me thousands! Next, he details his strategy for e-marketing success, including how to make the best use of your twitter account and blogs, web sites, emailing supportive readers, etc. I'm already doing all of that, but after reading this book I can see some areas where I need to make a few adjustments.<br />Thank you, John! A great book; I hope you sell 700,000 copies!<br />Sharilyn Miller, author of the Arty Jewelry series
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Every night when Christine goes to sleep, her memory is erased.  Every morning when Christine wakes up, her husband has to explain who she is and what her life is like.  When a doctor suggests Christine should keep a journal, the reader comes along for the ride while Christine discovers memories and truths she did not know existed.      I felt both sorry and fearful for Christine while reading.  She addresses throughout the book that we are the people we are because of our memories and that without memories and a past, we have no future.   I loved being with her as she discovers new memories and tries to solve the mystery of how she lost her memory in the first place.  There is plenty of suspense throughout the novel and a great twist ending!
B0001DMPVI|5.0|Few bands in history could make a acid rock disc and have two top hit singles! and yet this band did it here with the songs 'monterrey' and 'sky pilot' , which is a fantastic achievement by any standards. Most of the songs hold up pretty well too a few are more ecclectic for some perhaps. But I love it, this band was not making just space out music but real songs here and that's a good thing.<br />It helped that they had such good musicians in the band as well.

B003L77GH4|5.0|I think the goal of this season is to reveal a surprise in every episode, and boy did they deliver!  I have never watched a TV show that had me dropping my jaw at the end of each episode.  Some parts even made me want to cry, which I NEVER do when I watch stuff.  This season has me craving more, and I cannot wait for the next season to start.  Especially after season finale!  True Blood will have to hold me over until then, but Vampire Diaries is where it's really at.
B0000AVF29|5.0|This one was a real departure for the animals. I never liked the 'eric burden and the animals' tag though. record stors would seperate them in the racks from the animals! oh well.  This one roars out of 1967 with psych songs like 'it's all meat' and 'san fransciso nights'  a hit single and other songs like 'the black plague'<br />and such are really interesting and deep. The whole cd is filled with some deep songs here. The four bonus tracks are good ones too even if they are sadly only in mono.  Eric burden(and the animals) had released the pop rocker 'eric is here' which had the hit 'help me girl' and even that couldn't prepare one for this sudden drastic change in direction the animals took. Here was a band with a violin even.<br />Eric sings his heart out too on this  one.  Strangely the big hit out at this time  'when I was young' was not included on this release which could have helped sales at the time. This was psych rock or acid rock and blues mixture  and it's all good if not sometimes ecclectic. This wouldn't be released today because the purpose here was to make a great album and it succeeds.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|i been readin yalls reviews and i bought it on that and a show i seen on tv, this cat can rock and do bluesey type stuff and it just sounds good in the mornin or in the evenin when ya had a few cool 1,s. in other words i do like bluesrock music and thos is a good 1 and then some.  its got a shitload o good tunes on there too. scuse my cussword but thass the way it goes down here in missisippi. and i know i cant spell. o yeah  1st cd i bought by joe bones.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|My best friend told me to watch this show and I thought it would be stupid so I never did.  I really wish I would have listened to her from the start.  During the break of the second season I downloaded the first episode of the show and I was hooked just like that.  I downloaded and watched every episode and managed to catch up to the current episode in a matter of about 2 weeks.  Not bad for almost 35 episodes!  To anyone who hasn't seen the show, I would recommend buying a DVD set, because once you start watching you will not want to stop.  Not to give away any details, but this show never fails to shock and delight the viewer and hopefully will continue on for a long time!
B00042YBTK|4.0|this more than any other animals cd is directly of it's time so much that unlike other discs you can't help but think completely of the already dying days of psych rock. It has great  versions of other bands hits on here that are incredible though \\" 'river deep mountain high' ( ike and tina turner) , 'to love somebody' ( the bee gees) and 'ring of fire' (johnny cash)<br />are just fantastic , the band makes them explode into their own psych versions here. The rest of the cd has some good songs that are great psych and few very 1969 meandering space out songs about colors and such. Songs of the lsd era, one that destroyed alot of brains sadly at this point the band would sadly break up, even though the police's andy summers had joined they just hung it up and if they had continued on they would have passed from this psych rock era in 1970 just like the rest of the music biz did and who knows what tight music they may have made. Instead this one is like the end of psych rock other than dedicated psych bands like pink floyd w ho would even later morph themselves. This is worth owning but the long songs about spacing out are not easy listening today in some regard. In spite of that this is mainly a fantastic cd of late sixties psych that has excellent musicians playing it and not just space cadets like some bands.

B003VIW8DK|4.0|I heard of Roxy Music on and off over the years, but never did investigate their music. A friend loaned me 'Olympia' a few weeks ago, and I have fallen in love with much of it. \\"Song to the Siren\\" is one of the most rich and moving songs I've ever heard. I was aware this song from a track by 'Izzy' on a sampler of woman artists some years back. Her austere and stripped down version was beautiful and to me unforgettable. (Unfortunately, it did not seem to be representative of Izzy's broader work). This version by Ferry, with richly layered production, singing guitars and firm and driving rock beat, gives me chill bumps. Ferry sings beautifully, and the earnestess and conviction in his voice make the song timeless. (I found I could not decipher much of the lyrics with out reading them; but no matter. The song is so moving that the extra work it takes to understand the images in the lyrics make it even more of a gem.) \\"You can Dance,\\" \\"Heartache by Numbers\\" and \\"No Face, No Name, No Number\\" are also acoustic and rhytmic treasures. I cannot get them out of my head. What wonderful, powerful music from a man who is nearly my age. Wow!

1609419693|5.0|Tina Fey's book Bossypants is her own story of how she grew up in Pennsylvania (with an over protective dad who will do anythig to save a buck), to the early days of saturday Night Live (when women could not have a leading role), her honeymoon cruise because her husband does not like to fly (very Peseiden Adventure and includes a fire on the ship), to her Sarah Palin impression that she sis not have time nor want to do, to deciding if one child is enough...<br /><br />I knew when I seen this book was coming out I had to read it.  When I seen the audio was going to be narrated by Tina herself, I decided scratch the book, I now wanted to hear Tina tell her story.  I am so glad I did.<br /><br />Call it a guilty pleasure but I do really like good funny quick witted humor.  I love my \\"funny\\" to have inteligence with it and Tina Fey delivers all that in an audio that I will cherish as good laugh at yourself moments becuase what else are you going to do - and that is kind of the way I like to live my life too.  :razz:<br /><br />I have enjoyed Tina Fey not so much on Saturday Night Live (mainly becuase I never really watched Saturday Night Live), but more for her movie roles.  I ewjoyed her in both Date Night and baby Mama.<br /><br />So.... here is the visual of my listenign to this audio book.  I had it downloaded on my IPOD.  I am mowing our 5 acreas of yard on the riding mower... where once I would listen to music and firghten the neighbors with my singing... now instead I listen to audio.  Hey that is three hours of non interupted \\"book\\" time.  This particular audio however had me at times laughing out loud to the point i am sure the neighbors were ready to call the \\"crazies hot line\\".<br /><br />Yes, at times she can be a bit raunchy - and thankfully that is few and far between on this audio.  Over all it was a pleasurable audio that I would recommend over the book just for the reason that it is Tina Fey herself narrating and she has that matter of fact tone that just makes me smile.
1577314808|5.0|This book sums up why we're here on the earth like no other!  Eckhart Tolle is a master spiritual teacher who shines the light of his awareness to those of us who are still stumbling in the dark.  He helps us to connect with the divine radiance of who we really are thus fulfilling our purpose here on the earth.  Eckhart serves as a guide who emphasizes the present moment as a portal into our true selves.  I have read his book over and over, and it centers me every time I read it.  It's for those people who see that there is much dysfunction here on planet earth and are wanting to be part of the solution.  It helps me to shine the light of awareness on my everyday life and Eckhart's crystal clear words are a great source of strength and inspiration.  He takes the great spiritual teachings from all over the world and sums them up with the greatest clarity and wisdom.  I have read many spiritual books in my life (I'm 63 years old) and have truly loved and been inspired by many, but this is my all time favorite!!

1594744769|5.0|What a treat this book is!  Part suspense, part fantasy, and beguilingly unique.       A teenage boy (Jacob) finds his grandfather dying - the grandfather who used to tell fantastic stories of his childhood at a strange island orphanage in Wales and illustrate his tales with photos of odd-looking children and descriptions of monsters.  The grandfather pleads with him to go to the island, where he'll be safe, whispers some enigmatic phrases and then \\"I should've told you a long time ago\\", and dies, and as Jacob copes with his grief, he determines to travel to the island and search out the truth.  What he finds will forever change his life.    Magical, thrilling, and lovingly illustrated with the photos and letters described in the story.  This is one of those books that will appeal to adults and older kids equally, and I'm going to pass it on to my 11- and 20-year old nieces and see what they think.
1847879071|5.0|I am a political science PHD student using SPSS for my research.I am not an SPSS newbie and having used over 10 books of statistics and SPSS for the past 5 years I must say that this is definitely one of the best there is. Easy to read and understand if you have little or no idea about statistics and SPSS, very helpful if you already know what you're doing but looking for the little extra info and guidance. The mathematics are easy to understand and even if you do not agree with the author's humour it is an acceptable break. Everything is to the point and explains the why's and how's of this mystifying beast in an easy manner.    If you are not interested in the details you can skip them without missing the essence or you can read on and follow the bibliographic references. It can be read from start to finish or used as a reference equally well, so for the social scientists and health students it's a very good choice.    The third edition is way better than the second.    My money was well spent for once.    On the other hand if you are a statistician/mathematician then this is too introductory and focused on the practicalities so you might skip it and go for something more hardcore with extra mathematics and theory.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|I hadn't played the McCartney album all the way through in 40 years. This original came out when I was in the Army, I had been used to buying Beatle albums the day of release, but needless to say this wasn't the case due to the circumstances.  Someone in the barracks had this Album and a cheap portable record player, that was my first exposure to this album. I wasn't impressed and it was at least a year later I purchased it, but it never really got a fair listen as by that time he had \\"RAM\\" out and that was the latest flavor of the month.<br />  Fast forward 41 years to this remastered release: my first response is, whoa this is a solid little record and the remastering does it justice, it sounds crisp and robust, especially considering it is essentially home demos. The songs are funkier than I remember (\\"Ooh You\\" \\"Valentine Day\\", \\"That Would Be Something\\", Maybe I'm Amazed\\" etc.) . The record is quite charming really, with its Low-Fi no frills approach. I'd love to see Paul tackle \\"Ooh You\\" in concert.  I'm really pleasantly surprised that I like every song, \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" and \\"Every Night\\" are the sole classics here but a fun listen all the way through and I'll be revisiting  this album on a steady basis. Going to see Paul at Yankee Stadium in July and not expecting to hear much from this album other than \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", but I'd really like to, it'd be a gas. The packaging with the CD is quite nice, there are a lot of photo's not included in the original album and it is a 3 panel foldout, like the recent Remastered Beatles albums, there are lyrics included and the second disc of extras contains some live versions of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", \\"Every Night\\" with a nice guitar solo by Laurence Juber and the rarely played \\"Hot As Sun\\" all 3 are from the Glasgow Show in 1979 that was the swan song for Wings as a live unit. All three live reninditions are excellent interpretations. The other songs are nice to have as a collecter, but are not indepensible. All in all a much better record than I remember and one that I can highly recommend.h better record than I remember and one that I can highly recommend.
B001GJOL22|5.0|I already owned this on DVD, and once I purchased a Blu-Ray player I knew this was a must have.  My 8 year old son, being the avid Rush fan, begged for it for months as we looked in our local stores for it.  First off, this is the best produced live Rush video around.  The DVD looks great and the Blu-Ray doesn't disappoint.  Definitely a must have for any Rush fan, 8 or 80.

030726999X|4.0|It is a great pity that Stieg Larsson passed away before seeing the success of his Millennium trilogy. According to various online sources, the series was not intended to end with the third book. Nevertheless, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the third and final book of Larsson. Knowing all of this, you might wonder if this book truly ends the series or if it leaves the reader hanging. In my opinion, it does indeed end well. This book ties up all the loose ends and leaves you feeling satisfied. It's not a great book, but it is a good ending to the series.<br /><br />The greatest shortfall of the book is its uneven pacing. The first third and the last third of this book proceed at a decently fast pace. There is action, suspense, and mystery. But the middle third is dreadfully slow. For a plot-driven book, there's hardly any plot in the middle third; nothing happens. I was bored to tears and almost stopped reading.<br /><br />What kept me going was how much I adored Salander. I desperately wanted a resolution to her story and vengeance for her suffering. Although she is nothing like me, I really grew to like her and I related to her introversion and outsider status. I was sympathetic to her unfortunate situation, and I forgave her for her violent tendencies.<br /><br />This book like the previous two also suffers from having too many characters. All the names are hard to keep track of, and I ended up glossing over some of them. On the Kindle, you can easily search for names to remind yourself of who's who, and I did this for the first two books. But by the third book, I no longer had the patience to search and more importantly, I no longer cared. It turns out that I didn't miss much, as many of the names are unimportant characters.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good ending to the series. Of the three books, I enjoyed the first one the most. It was the most explosive and provocative. Once it got going, it was impossible to put down. The third book doesn't make as big of an impact as the first book, but it does offer a nice conclusion.rst book, but it does offer a nice conclusion.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|The Black Swan starring Natalie Portman is a very intense and interesting film. I've never really cared for any of Portman's performance prior to Black Swan, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and why she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Surprise, surpise...Portman is absolutely stellar in this film! Her facial expressions and dancing are what carries this film. Barbara Hershey is also fabulous as Portman's controlling mother. The only performance I found awkward and stiff was Mila Kunis's. Kunis is a beautiful woman but she doesn't have a lot of depth to pull off such a complex character. Black Swan was definitely worth all the hype, has some odd moments but overall...I'd watch it again!

0060853972|4.0|This is the first book i have read by either Gaiman or Pratchett and i must say i was impressed. I literally just finished the book, i got it a few days ago and have been diving through it to finish it.     The concept is fun and the characters are some of my favorites in the literary world. I absolutely adore Crowley and find Aziraphale to be incredibly endearing. The four Horsepersons are wonderfully funny even when they aren't meant to be (i even enjoyed the other four, their names are brilliant). I think The Them are an accurate representation of kids and would love to be friends with them, they sound like fun. Even the witch-finders group captures my heart, every characters is meant to be there and you don't feel like there are any extraneous characters. Nothing is filer every word in the story is meant to continue the point and plot.      I had really high hopes for the book, all the reviews i read seemed to love it and the word of mouth was all but glowing. I don't really have anything negative to say about the book. It is a book that requires a certain sense of humor and possible a working understanding of Apocalypse literature but it defiantly isn't a book for everyone but everyone who would like it should read it. i got my hopes up really high for this book and i wasn't disappointed it was different then i expected but it was still really good. I think an opinion can only be formed after reading it and that would be my suggestion. Read it and laugh, read it and smile, or even read it and weep. Its up to you but i think most people will like it, i am certainly intrigued enough to pick up some other books written by the respective authors.

I am not an audiophile and normally can't notice much about different speakers but in this case it is very noticeable. If you care about sound quality these are not for you.    If you position the ear cups correctly they don't hurt after a couple of hours other wise they do.     I seem to destroy headphones on a semi annual basis so spending big $ on them is out of the question. I won't feel bad when this set goes. I got decent value for what I spent.

0061784788|5.0|Over the years, I've written a lot of enthusiastic things about the novels of James Rollins.  But until now, I've never written this:  THE DEVIL COLONY IS THE BEST NOVEL THAT JAMES ROLLINS HAS EVER WRITTEN!  (Yes, in all caps even!)  Like many readers, I was disappointed in the two-year wait for this latest installment in the Sigma Force series.  Now, I'm thinking perhaps he should take two years on all the novels--I don't know if it was the extra time, but something has paid off huge dividends.<br /><br />As always, summarizing the story is the hardest part.  First, because I'd hate to spoil any surprises.  And secondly, because it's just really hard to summarize one of Rollins's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink plots.  The main action of this book opens in present day Utah.  From two boys who can't resist the lure of the forbidden, a great and terrible discovery is made at a sacred Native American site.  There are bodies.  There is an artifact.  And, astonishingly, something that goes to the very core of Mormon theology!<br /><br />Just as the scientists on site are beginning to grasp what they've discovered, there is a huge explosion.  The explosion is blamed on a Native American activist, but it's clear that this wasn't your standard bomb.  It's something far more dangerous, with implications that spread further and further afield, and which drag Sigma operatives into the story on differing assignments and for different reasons.  All the usual suspects are back, including the enigmatic Seichan, who is again paired in an uneasy alliance with Gray Pierce.  Painter Crowe is also back in the field this time around.  Operatives from the Guild are up to their usual tricks, and even as readers learn more about the shadowy organization in this novel, new questions are raised for the next book.  (It's infuriating how he does that.)<br /><br />In provocative messages leading up to the publication of The Devil Colony, James Rollins repeated asked, \\"Was America founded on a lie?\\"  The plot of this novel does get right to the heart of the formation of this country.  What were Lewis and Clark really up to?  What was Thomas Jefferson communicating in secret ciphers?  It also explains the fate of some of the most mysteriously lost cultures through history.  It delves into the not only the most cutting-edge technology, but also some amazingly advanced ancient technology.  And, yes, it also explores the foundation of the Mormon Church.  Oh, and there's a super-volcano!  And killer whales!  And the heist of all heists!<br /><br />Seriously, I could go on like this all day.  The scope of this novel is breath-taking.  What's amazing is that Rollins pulls all of these diverse threads together SO plausibly that you'll find yourself wondering if he has indeed solved half the puzzles of the ages in one fell swoop.  As always, there's a staggering amount of fact laced throughout his fantastic plot.  It's enough to make you go, \\"Hmmm.\\"<br /><br />The pace starts to race early on, and it just never slows down.  The stakes in the book simply get bigger and bigger.  Technically, it's a well-structured page-turner.  But in the end, it's the story that got me and held me.  Every part of it was just so inventive, exciting, and so darn interesting!

B004XANKVO|5.0|Love this bag. It's got so many great features -- a \\"safe zone\\" that's a hard-sided pocket for fragile items like cell phones, chargers, etc. There's a hard-side section on the back (nearest the straps) for your laptop, and another large pocket for books, clothes, whatever. All the pockets and organizers make it extremely flexible, and the color (charcoal black with touches of blue) make it perfect for teens, adults, men or women. While I got this for my middle-school son, I think I'll be claiming it when I have to travel.

B004LWZW42|4.0|The movie gives you some quick backgrounds on 4 of the characters, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and Raven / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The rest you have to guess at. And if you are like me, and have never read the comics, you are clueless and sit back and enjoy all the women in lingerie. It boils down to a good vs. evil scenario, which I can understand.<br /><br />The good guys create a machine that will locate other mutants. Charles is able to cleverly locate all the mutants during a single music montage. Meanwhile Kevin Bacon wants to start an all out nuclear war so the radiation will kill all the humans and only leave the mutants. This is remake of the history of the Cuban missile crisis.<br /><br />As always, great special effects. Background knowledge of the characters and other movies would be a plus, such as cameo by Hugh Jackman or Rebecca Romijn, but not necessary to enjoy the film.<br /><br />The nuclear reactor controls on the submarine were totally bogus for any era. Favorite line: \\"I have been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again.\\"<br /><br />F-bomb (thanks Hugh for the F.O.) sexual situations and \\"Avatar\\" nudity. Excellent prequel.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|On Bon Iver's second album the painful honesty and isolated log cabin melancholy of 2008s \\"For Emma\\" is thoroughly downplayed. Yet this remains an instantly recognisable Justin Vernon record not least because of the presence of his trademark falsetto as he announces on the superb opening track \\"Perth\\" that \\"I'm tearing up, across your face/Move dust through the light/To find your name/It's only faint\\". Throughout there are gear changes all over the album and \\"Perth\\" starts with an achingly slow electric guitar but flowers into a beast of a song with military drumming and by its close Emeralds style power chords. \\"Perth\\" segues into Minnesota WI, which is a gentle but funky track which shows that Vernon's time spent with Kanye West has paid off. The third track \\"Holocene\\" is probably the song on here that could have slipped onto \\"For Emma\\". It is a lush delight gently powered by Vernon's voice and beautiful guitar phrasing. As a starting trilogy these songs amount to a brilliant opening fusillade. Next up \\"Towers\\" is what could be described as straightforward Bon Iver song but \\"Michicant\\" follows it with exquisite textures and shimmers along making it an absolute standout. Throbbing synths and chanting follow next on \\"Hinnom TX\\" which picks up some Blood Bank themes, while the song \\"Wash\\" is full of opulent but hushed piano ballad interspersed with violins.<br /><br />Many will have already heard the single \\"Calgary\\" which powers up to a tremendous crescendo only to gently fade out. Trying to find different ways of saying \\"lovely\\" is becoming pointless because that what it is and it deserves widespread radio play as much as all good people deserve a big lottery win. It is followed by the slight instrumental \\"Lisbon OH\\" which has an almost Eno style ambience and then by the albums closer \\"Beth/Rest\\" which could end up splitting the jury. On first hearing this reviewer felt that it could be one of those clich&eacute;d soundtrack \\"Celtic\\" songs which producers use on documentaries about Scotland or Ireland. It does get better on repeated listens and for many this may well be the albums highlight. Yet having listened recently to Vernon's inspired cover of Peter Gabriel's \\"Come talk to me\\" suggests that perhaps a better and more apt conclusion was already recorded? You obviously have the ultimate decision. In any case it's a small slip in an album that truly is a thing of beauty and which cements Justin Vernon's reputation as one of the finest songwriters in indie music, and the Bon Iver band who have turned into a very special unit. \\"Bon Iver\\" is a expansive set of songs that reveal more on every listen, taken as a whole it is an instant joy that we should warmly celebrate.bout Scotland or Ireland.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought a set of these like eight years ago at Wal-Mart and found them to be bar-none the best headphones for working out.  Because they have the top-piece that rests on the top of your head, they WILL NOT move when working out, especially running.  They also don't have any spongy-cushioning so you can SWEAT all over them and just wipe them off afterward.  They're TOTALLY light too.<br /><br />I tried Bose, Apple's ear-buds, all of them fall out, but not these.  Once you adjust them and get them good and tight, they stay SUPER-SNUG.  For the money, it's a no-brainer.<br /><br />The sounds is pretty good, but it's the fit that's perfect.  I have to have music when I run but I HATE it when ear-buds won't stay in, so these are the ones for me.  I'm ordering another pair now because after eight years of being beat up, sweated on, carried around in bags on my daily commute, on airplanes, after eight years and hundreds of work-outs, one of the ear-speakers is dead.<br /><br />Time for a new pair.  What a value.  By far the best, take it from me.

B004XE0P5E|4.0|The second full-length from Justin Vernon's Bon Iver project, an eponymous 10-song record with strikingly detailed cover art, is perhaps the most anticipated non-commercial release of 2011, thanks in full to the universal love the Bon's debut record, For Emma, For Ever Ago, saw upon its wide release in 2008. And while I'd like to tell you that the new album is a letdown (Lord knows the stopgap EP, Blood Bank, was), it's not. Not even close. What Bon Iver is, is a grand record that boasts a sound far more complete than that of Emma. Resources, man, resources.    And sure, the album is impressively long-labored stuff, flaunting a big and bold full-band sound; but does it have any of the haunting magic of Emma, a record that breathed desperation and emotion like few have before it? Well, maybe not. That's a rare, rare thing. By now we're used to Vernon's once-unique vocal style (many have already been influenced by it since 2008), so the shock of that appeal is also gone, replaced by incredibly deep compositions that feel at every moment fragile, mixing delicate nuance and grand ideas in a way similar to some of Low's work, but to a much different effect.    Opener \\"Perth\\" is an instant winner, jumping out of the speakers in a very cinematic, emotional way. Starting simple - with floating voice and processed guitar - the song at first reminds of Emma before taking a soft turn towards pseudo-chamber pop, held together by marching drums and layer after layer of sweet, emotive melody. Vernon singes over his band's epic arrangement in the way only he truly can, instantly reminding listeners why they were so excited in the first place. It's a hell of a start to a record that plenty of people will - for reasons unknown to me - inevitably call a letdown. Yeah, the sound here is bummer and the departures aren't anything too drastic, but isn't knocking those attributes kind of like saying that Bon Iver reminds us of one of the best albums of the last decade, the irresistible Emma, if taken from a different perspective?    Ask Jeff Tweedy about his Loose Fur project and he'll no doubt tell ya that growth learned from experimental side-work is never a bad thing. Similarly here, as each song progresses we begin to hear hints of one Vernon's other primary projects, the prog-minded Volcano Choir. Like that record, the ideas on Bon Iver are big, the execution is tasteful and, for the most part, effective (not necessarily the case on the Volcano record). Slightly altering an incredibly winning formula - not a bad approach to to following up a hands-down classic. My only real worry with this album is that the songs are all too big, too full. Part of the original appeal of the Bons was the solidarity factor, not unlike that heard on Bruce Springsteen's intimate classic, Nebraska. And while it's perfectly fine for a band to change gears from album to album, Bon Iver as a whole is so full and deep that it often feels hard to pull the moments from the mud. Similar to The Arcade Fire's second record, the great Neon Bible, Vernon really goes for it here, taking the time to build his already great sound into something more.    The artwork for Emma and Bon do the talking. The cover for Emma, a sole window, iced over, set the stage for the story of a man alone, cold and longing. The result was an affecting, relatable album whose emotional impact put fingerprints on the souls of its listeners. The new record is taken from the perspective of outside the cabin, far off, detailing the surroundings in a beautiful way - deeper yet brighter. We're still in the same neighborhood here, but the attitude - and results - are different. The question becomes, is the appeal different? Will a fan of Emma find the same amount of emotion in the record, the same connection? I'd argue that yes, as long as you get to know the depths of these gently giant compositions, you'll enjoy the record very much, as it's a truly great batch of songs. But no, Bon Iver will not stand as the major classic Emma was. But that's okay, leaving the hideout is good for you.    Read more of my music- and film-focused writing at [...]

B004VFYOA2|4.0|If you were in high school in 1990 like I was, you remember Whitesnake as an arena rock powerhouse. For those of us who didn't make it to Donington UK for the Monsters of Rock festival that summer, this DVD is the next best thing to catching the headlining act in person.    Others have complained about the video quality here. The source tape is obviously a mid-grade videotape from the time period which has been in storage for the last two decades. It's unfortunate that the event wasn't captured on a higher quality cassette (rumor has it the video is what fans at the show saw on video monitors near the stage), but digital enhancement has made the best of a bad situation. Furthermore, superior re-mixed digital sound (5.1 surround) taken from the official BBC Radio broadcast goes a long way toward making up for the disappointing video. It's puzzling that an inferior videotape is the only official film of this 1990 show when, for example, Elvis Presley's Aloha From Hawaii concert was captured on professional grade videotape in 1973 and makes for a near perfect DVD.     A high-energy performance by the band (a superb Whitesnake lineup featuring Steve Vai and Adrian Vandenberg on guitars) makes this a fun concert video to be sure. I felt like I was transported back to those magical days of glam metal that I remember so fondly. The viewer can tell that after an intense summer of touring and performing, David Coverdale's voice was more raspy than usual at this show. On a few tunes, including \\"Kitten's Got Claws,\\" Coverdale sounds more like Brian Johnson of AC/DC than the Whitesnake frontman we know. This element somehow adds to the intensity of the performances and leaves one wishing for more concert DVDs from that period. WS Live at Donington 1990 was definitely worth the $ and two hours of my time.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|Symphony X has continued to put out strong albums since 'Damnation Game'. While 'Divine Wings of Tragedy' and 'V' have been generally favored by fans, a brief look at reviews will show a strong favorable support to every album.    Their latest, 'Iconoclast' will disappoint any fans who wish to hear 'Through the Looking Glass' or 'Rediscovery'. This new album stands by a strong formula of heavy metal which offers very few unexpected song progression twists. For that reason i will not say for certain that it is their best.    It is however, a Masterpiece. Symphony X has chosen to significantly slow down their usual tempo in favor of a much more impressive grind. This shift manages to make every song on the album more head bang worthy than most of anything Symphony X has done before. It also brings out the very best of Romeo's melodic ability. For those who need a fix of song styles not found here, you may always listen to an earlier album. I'm sure those songs will also continue to be played live for years to come.    'Iconoclast' is an essential recording.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Viewed: 7/07, 6/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />7/07: The movie starts off slowly in a dumb way that would have resembled an ordinary picture, but its freefall into despair is extraordinary. The infusion of style through Requiem for a Dream makes it an unforgettable picture. Quite possibly Requiem for a Dream may be the most haunting picture I've seen. The performances, save for Marlon Wayans, are thoroughly outstanding. There have been some pictures that deal with drug use and chemical dependency, and quite many of them glorify the shattering experience. But Requiem for a Dream is the exception. It elevates the elements of Sid and Nancy while incorporating the motivation with regard for neither nihilism nor gratification. No question, the most outstanding performance of the picture is Ellen Burstyn as she combines the delicacy of Vivien Leigh from A Streetcar Named Desire with the madness of Bette Davis from What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Jared Leto is an actor of limited abilities, but in this one, he digs deep and pushes himself farther than he has never been. For Jennifer Connelly, she is usually a blank person with a lot of façade that turned in many mediocre performances, but in this one, she fits in flawlessly of her role and transforms herself into the character that blended in what the content demands. A veteran of many bad, bad movies, Marlon Wayans makes an appearance in a film that's quite unlike him, and he does well staying within the level of others. Is it the performances that make Requiem for a Dream the picture it is, or is it the work of a director? Hmm, I think it's more of the latter. Darren Aronofsky shows that he had learned a great deal from his first picture Pi and transfers its style into Requiem for a Dream plus adding more inventive ways to take his vision to the next level. The result is a smashing one. It starts off, as I said, leisurely, begins its ascent with endearing performances, and lights up a fuse that promises to explode with lots of fireworks. When all are said and done, the effect of the picture has stayed with me mentally because it becomes, to a certain extent, impacting. Requiem for a Dream is a film that is waiting to be recognized as a venerable classic in decades to come, and it deserves to be held in high esteem. It's so unlike anything I've seen. I think that the movie had enough to make a compelling in-look of what would happen to a person if s/he started to get into hardcore drugs. Yeah, Traffic fails to portray it because Steven Soderbergh spent his time excessively juggling with so many characters in an overly ambitious picture. Darren Aronofsky avoids that mistake by keeping the characters small and simple. It is also at the point that their past backgrounds ceased to matter, so I am instructed to watch the decaying effects of the present characters to the point of finality. I must say, the title Requiem for a Dream is very intriguing. To dream of something big is to swap for something else just like how Dr. Faustus did? Seems to be like it. Some of the scenes in Requiem for a Dream are painful for me to watch, but I saw every second of it. When I could think of the most hollowing part, it has to be either the black circular bruise on Jared Leto's arm or the double sodomy sex scene in a machine gun rapidity. Giving the film a `10', it is easy for me to do so because when a film fails to invoke feelings, then it is not considered a good picture. But Requiem for a Dream pretty much takes away all of that from me, and I may have been speechless already afterwards. Surely, to show evidence, the fact is I usually write a review the day after I finish the movie, but for Requiem for a Dream, it is three days after. I may have to wait years before I will take interest in watching it again. To repeat, Ellen Burstyn's performance may be just the best of her career.<br /><br />6/11: Requiem for a Dream is the ultimate anti-drug picture. Show this to kids, and you'll get the desired effect because I don't know, except for junkies, who can not be repelled by Jared Leto's black circled arm. Also, it is the ultimate ADD picture because of the extensive editing where an average film would have 600 to 700 cuts, but Requiem for a Dream had 2,000 of it. I just love the camera style throughout; it's bold and innovative. The pacing is extremely fast and to the point, magnifying the extremeness per scene by 10 fold. As a result, the ending is one depressing maniac finish. Although the cast does very well collectively, it's Ellen Burstyn's show. She steals every scene and makes for one sad, pathetic character. If there is a reason not to do drugs, legal or illegal, and then abuse them, see Requiem for a Dream. It's worth every second. Forget the idea that there are extreme scenes; the film is meant to tackle an extreme subject in an extreme way.

I also loved the other side stories in the book as it went along. It was fun seeing previous story characters. I won't go into the whole story as other reviewer's have done that, but . . . . fantastic!

It was actually three-disc, the third being the DVD version of the movie, which was a pleasant surprise.    But of course, the best part of the Blu-ray was the film itself. Inception became one of my all time favorites immediately after I saw it last summer, and this Blu-ray allows me to enjoy this crazy ride whenever I want. In my opinion, it is one of the best, if not THE best, movies of the past several years, and I look forward to seeing Christopher Nolan's future work.

You've read books about the horrible life of slaves and you may have read how white women were actually a form of slave to their husband's whims - but you have NEVER read a book like this.  The only way I would like to return to those days is with a million dollars and an AK-47 to be used on overseers and white ego laden masters.  This book is one of a kind and belongs in your heart and on your shelf.  Long after you have finished reading you will be remembering the characters and travelling back to the kitchen house.  I am eagerly awaiting her new book - Crow Woman.  Hope you are too.

B0051QO4QY|4.0|*UPDATE* After 2 years, I actually became more appreciative to The Fame. She was more likeable to me during The Fame. Now it's just all gimmicks and pretentions. I'm not really crazy about this album like I was initially. I wasn't really fascinated with this era and its videos. For me, I think she became less fascinating around The Fame Monster era when her videos and style started to get so ambiguous and pretentious. Her style was just so cool to me during The Fame. She reminded me of Gwen Stefani/Nicki Minaj. So funky and quirky. I wish she would go back to that. And her \\"little monsters\\" weren't merely annoying as of now.<br /><br />I was disappointed when I heard Born this Way. It didn't quite live up to the expectations even though I love what the message was trying to convey. I was relieved when Judas came around, yet, I was still skeptical about how her album would turned out to be. After playing Gagaville, I heard the preview of the songs and I was ASTONISHED that they sounded that good. I decided to download the whole album to give it a second opinion. It was like I fell in love with the album overnight. I started to become hook in that I found myself listening it to it more than The Fame. Note to self...don't ever underestimate gaga! I think I went waay overboard when I said Born This Way is a VAST improvement of everything The Fame was lacking of and that BTW has more coherent, deep lyrics as opposed to the superficial ones on The Fame.  It's true that I said that The Fame was no different from all those other partying/getting drunk/sex/electropop craze and that I didn't wanna hear anymore of that. BTW may have a lil bit more substance, but I actually like the Fame era moreso than BTW. BTW may sound too dated to some people, but it samples an amazing sound of the 80s, Depeche Mode, Cyndi Lauper, disco, early 90s, and rock.  When I hear Gaga's spoken parts, it does bring back memories of Madonna from the Like A Prayer/Blonde Ambition/Erotica era. I will not go on and on about their comparisons. I'm only here to discuss on what I thought about Born This Way. I am not going to display each rating track by track because it's long and most of the tracks sounded good to me. It has some minor flaws, imo. There were a few I could do without. I will give an honest opinion and describe it the way I perceive. All the songs are mostly comprised of uptempos and midtempos. There aren't exactly any ballads.<br /><br />Great:<br />Scheibe is one of the most played track on my ipod. It has an early 90s sound. It expresses its fondness over the german language and you could hear Gaga speaking in german. It reminds me alot like Madonna's Rescue Me. The chorus and everything....<br /><br />Black Jesus  Amen Fashion is saying that Jesus can be just as trendy as fashion. It has an early 90s/supermodel on the runway sound like Scheibe. This should have been on the standard edition.<br /><br />Bad Kids is about being proud of being a rebel and not caring about what other people think and their standards. It sounds very disco-ish. The intro gives out character and personality of the song.<br /><br />Heavy Metal Lover puts me in a trance in a way that I feel that it is soothing and makes me want to relax. I could hear elements of New Order.<br /><br />Electric Chapel channels Depeche Mode and Cyndi Lauper. It's one of the best songs on the album.<br /><br />Good:<br />Judas has a religious tone in which it's about trying to step into the light while you're still clinging onto the darkness. That's where the metaphors start here. Some people were offended by this song and felt it was mockery and blasphemous. Others think it's a Bad Romance ripoff.<br /><br />Government Hooker is a tribute to all the politicians and their affairs. The lyrics say further on how she will do whatever you want her to do as long as she gets paid. I can't help it if this song makes me feel I'm at some disco karaoke bar. I could just literally picture myself being inone. It does make me want to step further into the naughty side and pull out a whip. The beats are so infectious that it gets me hook. It's a good song if you want to go out and get drunk with your friends.<br /><br />Hair takes me back into the 80s with it's soft rock and jazz sound. I could clearly hear Kim Carnes or Bonnie Tyler in her voice. Kim Carnes is the one that sang \\"Bette Davis Eyes\\" and Bonnie Tyler sang \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\"<br /><br />Bloody Mary is the second song on here that has a religious undertone.The song makes references to the Virgin Mary and Jesus' Crucifixion. It actually feels very dark moreso than the rest especially when she does that distorted voice. I could hear voices of people in church. It may feel creepy at times to some people.<br /><br />Highway Unicorn could easily be played in footbal stadiums. I'm not sure what the concept of this song is all about. But I'm making guesses that it's about love conquers all.<br /><br />The Queen sounds like The Cure's music. I don't know what to think about this song.  I'm speechless at this point.<br /><br />The Edge of Glory is about reaching your final destination in life. I think having the saxophone and the soft rock feel adds to what this song is going for. It makes you want to feel more accomplished in life.<br /><br />Just Ok:<br /><br />Fashion of His Love is a cutesy kind of song written in tribute to Alexander McQueen who brought out the best in Gaga's clothing and made her visions came to life. Gaga mentions that Whitney Houston is her inspiration. I think I had found that in this song. However, I don't really consider this my favorite.<br /><br />Marry The Night is about going after the things you want in life. Chasing after your dreams. She makes references to herself climbing to the top in New York. Not too crazy with the song ...nor the video.<br /><br />Bleh (songs I could do w/o):<br />Born This Way is pretty much self explanatory. As the song states, it's about coming into terms that people are unique and must to learn to accept themselves the way they were to made to be. Born This Way and Express Yourself do have their own similarities. The arrangement and the fact that they are both about respecting one's self. Born This Way grows on you. The beat sounds pretty bland and weak compared to the rest of the songs on here, but I think it gets better towards the end. The ending feels special and intimate. I'll give +1 for that.<br /><br />Americano is something I don't hear too frequently. It reminds me of Tom Jones \\"Delilah\\" and it has this Italian restaurant feeling to it.  It tells a story about falling in love with a latina in east-l.a. It may seem over the top but I find it to be the most unique track on here even though it's really not my cup of tea.<br /><br />You And I is one of the songs on here I didn't cared for. It just never really stood out for me. Brown Eyes waaaay better.one. It does make me want to step further into the naughty side and pull out a whip. The beats are so infectious that it gets me hook.

0316056863|2.0|Ouch! This hurts to read. Tina is great - funny, cute, funny. But sarcasm just does not translate to printed word. I had a hard time finding a laugh out of the book even when it was clear she was going for a cheap laugh or quick silly one. Case in point, the \\"slipping\\" in her husbands name when she was trying to use a psuedonym. Just not really funny.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I purchased this book mainly based upon the reviews I read in several magazines and the reviewers should be shot.  The book was enjoyable and yet very tedious at the same time.The ending left much to be desired. If the author was about to begin a series, the title should have been \\"A Discovery of Witches: the first in a series of novels\\". The ending left much to be desired and left me feeling very dissatisfied. The whole book was not a disaster; parts of it kept me engrossed and other parts felt as if I were I attempting to walk through a lake of molasses- BOGGED DOWN!!  I WISH I WERE A WITCH so I could cast a spell to rewrite the ending and weed out the parts that made for slow reading.
B004HD61KE|3.0|I agree totally with TheCritic that this is a ridiculous price for a Kindle book. I too never buy any book with such an outrageous cost, as there are thousands of other good books for a reasonable price.<br /><br />I have read two Rollins books, one very good ad the other not so much.<br /><br />What I do when an author comes out with a new book that is way overpriced, is get a list of his other, earlier books, and buy one of those that appears interesting.<br /><br />I have just done that with Rollins. He has some books that sound interesting for $8.99, and that is what I have ordered.

0061784788|5.0|In Utah, teenagers Charlie Reed and Trent Wilder explore a cavern filled with desiccated mummified humans.  Amongst the horrid sight, the boys also find a gold-coated skull of a saber-toothed tiger.  They report their findings.  While Native Americans and scientists argue over the findings, archeologists remove the prehistoric artifact.  However, instead of a simple excavation, the removal causes an explosion that leads to the release of a substance that erodes rock on contact.<br /><br />During the blast, an archeologist is murdered; the police suspect Kai Quicheets a teen leader of the Native American protest group at the dig site who tossed the charges that caused the initial explosion.  She turns to her Uncle Painter Crowe, leader of the Sigma Special Forces unit.  His team uncovers a conspiracy that goes to the roots of the United States.<br /><br />This is a great action-packed Sigma Force thriller (see The Doomsday Key) in which James Rollins ties together Jefferson, Mormonism and Native American lore into a save the world scenario.  Fast-paced, Painter has to deal with the ooze released by explosion, his contrite niece and the \\"war\\" between the scientists and the Native Americans.  Devil Colony is difficult to put down especially when the players converge.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

0446343129|5.0|Three cans of soda a day.  Nine cavities, low energy, nightly acid reflux.  One hugely rotten and very menacing cavity.    The only thing that could convince me (no not the wife's insistence, that fell on deaf ears) was the threat of pain.    Fat and seeking an insurance policy against the cost and pain of dental work, I found \\"Cure Tooth Decay\\" by Ramiel Nagel (Kindle edition) which  then led me to THIS book, Sugar Blues by William Dufty.    Sugar Blues does one simple thing devastatingly well: it merely points out the history of sugar. And it is a doozie!    I don't care about vilifying money-makers and I don't care about \\"subtle\\" health drags blown out of proportion (both of which this book contains).    What I DO care about is knowing the truth. And the truth will set you free of this additive that you will learn (and intuitively understand once you start doing it) NEVER had a place in human history and is utterly unnecessary.    Now, I take other peoples' consumption with a grain of salt. Do as you will. I have no interest in hitting people over the head with an anti-sugar book.     But sitting on my lovely perch of pleasure, I will state these demonstrable facts that happened to me:    - My nightly GERD / acid reflux sessions have completely disappeared.     - My energy level is consistent all day long. It \\"makes sense\\" relative to the quality and/or length of my sleep that night, which it never did before.     - Teeth sensitivity has gone away completely. Only the big nasty cavity has any sensitivy, if I kind of dig in there with my toothbrush vigorously. It too is less sensitive.     - This may sound kooky, but it's very real...I \\"feel\\" my body a lot more...muscles, movements, just the sensation of it...in hindsight it was clearly (familiarly) more numb, less sensitive, less aware of it's parts.     - (Bathroom related, skip this one if you don't want to hear this part) Through eating less white flour,  have been FAR more \\"regular\\" and no longer have episodes where I need to \\"strain\\" (or full blown constipation). Just comes right out, easy as pie.     This book is the one and almost certainly only time I'd take advice from John Lennon (Marxism kills!) but I did and it's been really, really rewarding. I am very grateful to be on this path.

B004QK5N5W|4.0|I have a 1st gen iPad and an iPhone 4, the adapter works great on the iPad once you find the app that works for you. I used it to watch netflix and worked flawlessly. Another great plus is if you have an iPad dock it can connect through the back and still works like it should. It's a nice way to keep the iPad standing up while watching a movie in case you need to adjust the volume or something.  I was a bit upset when I found out that the adapter works with the iPhone 4 as far as video but did not stream any of the audio from netflix. It's possible that there's something wrong with the netflix app but it would not play any audio from any of the movies from my iPhone. Maybe the next update will fix this issue but until then I am taking off one star.  Aside from the iPhone issue it's a great well constructed product. Does exactly what it is supposed to, just wish the price was a little lower.

0553386794|5.0|I've been admittedly slow in reading this book, but only because I have been watching the TV series on HBO at the same time and I didn't want one to get too far ahead of the other.  The season finale was last night on HBO, so I finished the book tonight and am ready to write.  I am absolutely in love with BOTH the book and the HBO series.  They are both masterpieces in their own right.  With this in mind, I will write my review first, followed by a few brief notes regarding some of the differences between the two formats.<br /><br />Robert Baratheon has been King of the realm for 15 years.  Although once a fierce warrior, the King has, by all accounts, let himself go.  The Kingdom is badly in debt and poorly run, yet Robert chooses to spend his time whoring, drinking, and eating rather than ruling.  Robert's right hand man, known as the Hand of the King, has recently died under suspicious circumstances.  With very few people he trusts enough to replace the fallen Hand, Robert journeys to the northern part of his Kingdom, to House Stark at Winterfell, to assign the duty to his closest friend, Eddard Stark.<br /><br />Eddard (Ned) Stark is an honorable man and has been serving King Robert dutifully since Robert won the throne.  He and his wife Catelyn have five children together (Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon) as well as Ned's bastard son Jon Snow.  When Robert arrives in Winterfell to request Ned's appointment as Hand of the King, Ned is hesitant to accept a position that will break up his family.  But ultimately, the decision is made that Ned will travel back to King's Landing, along with his two daughters, and resume the post.<br /><br />Robert's wife Cercei Lannister is not especially happy with Robert's selection.  Cercei has a few secrets that she would like to keep hidden, and she would certainly prefer to have one of her inner circle members in the position of the Hand rather than Ned.  Cercei comes from a powerful family as well.  Her twin brother, Ser Jaime, is known as the king slayer.  He was responsible for the murder of the previous king (Aerys Targaryen, known as the mad king) which resulted in Robert taking the throne.  Cercei's younger brother, Tyrion, does not possess such lofty titles as his siblings, but he is by far the most intelligent and well-educated of the family.  Tyrion is an imp, and has some very unique views of the world thanks to his lot in life.<br /><br />Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, the two surviving members of House Targaryen are coming of age.  Viserys and his sister Daenerys have been in exile since their family was murdered.  In the distant past, the Targaryen family ruled with the protection of dragons, but none have been seen in a thousand years because hunters have supposedly killed them all.  Viserys has grown tired of being at the mercy of others, and he has become obsessively determined to take back the Iron Throne at King's Landing at the first opportunity.  In order to gain an army, Viserys sells Daenerys in marriage to a Dothraki horselord named Khal Drogo who promises to win him the throne.  Although Daenerys is originally terrified of the Khal, she eventually develops a loving relationship with him.  They grow to respect each other as well.<br /><br />Although these are the primary players in this first book of the series, there are 9 houses (primary bloodlines) in all.  There are characters from each of the houses who are vying for more power in one way or the other.  Many would like to claim the throne.  Many have secrets to keep.  Many are scheming.  Many deals are made.  There is a new political enemy for every friend a character makes.  I've barely touched on the plot in this summary, but I think I'd have to write 2-3 pages in order to do it justice.  This book is an investment of time and energy to keep everything straight, but trust me, it is absolutely worth it.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, the HBO series is fantastic as well.  It was NOT done in the wayof the True Blood series in which there are very few similarities between the book and the show.  Game of Thrones on HBO is probably one of the best adaptations of book to film that I've ever seen.  There are some differences between the two, but in my opinion, the differences are minor and do nothing to change the story.  As an example, there are several characters who look different in the show than they are described in the book.  It really didn't bother me at all.  I was really more concerned with the actors being able to portray the characters the way they were described, and I felt they were mostly on the money in that regard.  There were also a few scenes (Daenerys's wedding night for example) where the show exaggerated the circumstances a little bit, likely for visual impact, but that didn't bother me either.  In the grand scheme of things, I felt that the show was truly the living version of the book.  And lastly, the tv series has all of the kids being a couple years older in the beginning of the series than they are in the book.  This part was necessary because the actors can't age on demand and need to be able to keep up with their characters over time.  Honestly, I didn't even notice the difference.<br /><br />If you are a fan of fantasy books like The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, this series will be right up your alley.  I absolutely loved it and cannot say that enough.  I HIGHLY recommend this book and I'm very much looking forward to continuing the series.very few similarities between the book and the show.

0756404738|4.0|First, let me say that I almost always HATE reading first person narrative. But Patrick pulls that off amazingly well, in this and the earlier book. I think it helps that it starts third person and moves into story telling. And, it really does feel like a story is being told. I loved it.    The descriptions are wonderful and emotions and interactions very believable, to me.    While the WRITING is superb, I agree with other reviews that the quality of the STORY really slipped in this book.    If you're going to take several chapters to describe an event, there'd better be an incredible amount of growth that occurs because of it. The time in the Fae world was tedious, to me. He walked away with a couple of valuable gifts but no real insights to justify spending that much time describing it. A single chapter could have covered it, nicely.    I also didn't really feel that Kvothe was much of a different person at the end of the book than he was when it began. His circumstances improved, greatly, and he had a few new skills, but essentially we didn't get to experience any growth from him. That made me sad. Made me feel I'd wasted my time, a bit.    That said, I couldn't put it down. I love reading this story and I'm very invested in the outcome.     **** SPOILERS ****  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Can anyone explain how Kvothe made money by having his tuition go up? I get that he got someone else to pay for it, so a high tuition didn't matter, but the University would be expecting to get the full tuition. If Kvothe and the bookkeper were splitting the tuition above $10, why wouldn't the Masters find out about it? The logic eludes me. \\"Any amount of tuition will be covered and I normally have $10 tuition, so if I get my tuition up higher than 10, let's split the difference.\\" I'm lost.    ---  What's up with Current Day Kvothe? Why couldn't he beat the soldiers? Why couldn't he open the chest? What was the meaning in the prologue of him taking oneperfect step?    ---  Bast wants Kvothe to remember who he is. Has he truly forgotten? Or, just stopped believing -- or caring?    ---  Are we to understand that Bast hired the soldiers to rob Kvothe with the idea that it would bring out the killer instinct in him and jump-start that \\"remembering\\" mentioned, above? And, that when that didn't work, he went out to kill the two soldiers?    ---  For all the toodoo about the shaede cloak, his use of it was pretty blase'. So, it helped deflect one knife stab. It's warm. Can make him hard to see. And, can change shape. Cool stuff, but so little is made of it it felt mundane. I was really disappointed.

0307477479|2.0|I don't get it---what's all the fuss? This book was almost unreadable for me. It was boring, disjointed, and purposely, I thought, confusing. A Pulitzer? Come on. It seemed at times like the author was trying to use up all the extra ideas and characters that she had hanging around.  I am very concerned that our literary scene is in in such bad shape that this book won all those awards. Did the critics actually read this book or just assume that it if won one award it was worthy.  It wansnt worth the time and effort to get through it.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|A couple disclaimers, up front.    One: I grade hard. In actuality, this book probably does deserve five stars; each little hint is well worth the five bucks. If the only question is whether buying the thing is a good idea, then the answer is simply Yes.    Two: I just read it--literally--in a single sitting, not bothering to get up even to grab something new to drink; the book is concise enough that I was through it in the span of a single can of soda. For that, and until I reread it [I intend to--probably a couple of times], it could be entirely my fault that I didn't catch what seems like an insanely important detail somewhere in the strategy. I'll get to that in a paragraph or two....    Overall--again--I'm certain that I'm better off for having bought this than I was a couple hours ago. Some of the information was reasonably obvious; some was less obvious, but I happened already to have known it; some was new and inspired. And all of it, as the sum of its parts, is an indispensable flowchart which, I agree with Locke, could stand to be patented, if that were an option.    I won't go into the spoilers here. Or patent infringement, as the case may be.    The one thing I didn't really get, exhaustive [yet short and simple] though the outline ultimately was, is how precisely to get started. Without going into detail, the basics are there: write a book [and some good ideas about knowing for *whom* you're writing the book], and let people--your fanbase, for example--know that you've done that, and so on. What isn't evident [unless it is, and I simply missed that sentence] is how exactly to get started. I don't doubt that, over time, the entire algorithm would do what it's intended to do [and it's replicable enough that, for your next book, it will be easy]; but I wasn't clear on a way to write a book today, without a fanbase, and start building up a following over the next couple weeks.    Not that I'm looking for a Get Rich Quick Scheme here, and not that I'm concerned that those who are might be disappointed, but I see a slight oversight in the strategy. Essentially, I'll buy that reading this book could lead to selling a million copies of your own within five months; I'm just not sure *which* five months those will be--I could expect it to take a year or more to reach the level at which one could begin to implement the plan that effectively.    To be fair, while I write books [good guess on the Target Market], I've had about ten minutes now to think toward implementing the system as described, so I can only assume that it works based on common sense; it's possible that I'll make a couple changes and reach whatever goals within days. If so, then I'll have been wrong to have given it only four stars.    Then again, based on the book itself, four stars are functionally as positive as five. Generally, I'd have to agree with that.
B003E8AF5U|2.0|This album is like one of those critically-acclaimed art movies where everyone pats themselves on the back for seeing it and calls it artistic and amazing, when what they're really thinking is man, I really hope i don't have to sit through that again.
B000OIBY4Y|5.0|When I first started reading `The Stranger' by Albert Camus it seemed rather dull. It's a first person account from a somewhat bland character named Meursault, the titular `Stranger'. While working my way through the book I had to wonder if an alternate translation, `The Outsider', would be more appropriate for `L'&Eacute;tranger'. Meursault is a Frenchmen living on Algeria but in no way is he a stranger. He has a circle of friends, a job and even a girlfriend. What sets him apart from humanity is his possibly pathological indifference to just about anything whether it be abuse of a dog, abuse of a woman or even the death of his own mother. Not that he engages in abuse it's just that he seems unaffected by the suffering of others. Other descriptions I've read on this book have described Meursault as honest to a fault with this being his downfall. I'm not sure that gives people the correct impression. Meursault's honesty is not the kind where you tell a fat woman she's fat. His downfall is more his inability to feign sorrow, regret or empathy. When his girlfriend asks if he loves her he considers it and answers \\"no\\" without any thought that the answer might be painful to hear. About half way through the book, in a bizarre set of circumstances, Meursault ends up killing a man and when asked by the police if he feels regret he says he never looks on the past with regret and in this case feels only vexation. There is no evident malice only utter insensitivity.<br /><br />Philosophically The Stranger is one of the most intriguing and moving books I have ever read particularly the final act where Meursault confronts the priest who attempts to lead him to the Christian God in the last days before his execution. Despite the perceived indifference he exhibits throughout the book Meursault has a consistent and well defined philosophy of existence. In this moment Meursault disgorges everything he has on the hapless priest and lays bare his soul (so to speak). Knowing that his death is but weeks, days or perhaps hours away, he achieves a moment of clarity seeing his place in the universe, a universe even more indifferent than himself. Camus never absolves him of his crime but in a sense Meursault rises above the simple act of killing a man, above his imprisonment and above life itself. He achieves full acceptance of his existence and place in the universe and in that moment transcends life and God. I`m genuinely saddened that I'm not able to read the final chapter in its original French. If the translation is this good I can hardly imagine how amazing the original must be.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that one could read and ponder over and over again and I have a feeling I will. There is a considerable amount of symbolism throughout particularly the scorching sun which seems to continually oppress Meursault until he can take it no more. It starts off very slowly and builds throughout. I've never been on trial and certainly never been on death row but Camus gave Meursault an inner dialogue that rang so true it felt more real than any other portrayal I've seen or read. Despite his crime and often callous view of the suffering of others Camus created a character so real and open to the reader that I couldn't help but pity him terribly for his situation but in the end Meursault found peace regardless of the outcome. If you haven't read this book you really should and it's a short read so if you don't find it as profound as I did at least you wont have to endure it for long.death is but weeks, days or perhaps hours away, he achieves a moment of clarity seeing his place in the universe, a universe even more indifferent than himself.

0521653975|4.0|It is a great book in fact, but be aware for what it calls 'advanced'. The vocabulary presented in this book is great for an academic student but almost useless for people who want to improve the day-by-day vocabulary. For those I'd recommend the less advanced books. The words you will find in this book will definitely help you in college but won't make a difference in your routine out of college.<br /><br />I'll give it four stars because the unclear description of the program fails to specify what I mentioned above.

B004RSCWZ2|2.0|Sorry, but a waste of money.  If you like Derek Trucks music rather just his guitar playing - you'll be a fan.  Apart from her voice, I can't hear much Tedeschi influence and perhaps that is one positive.  It's not a rock album, it's not a blues album - its a typically well played Derek Trucks album with jazz tinged noodling. , I don't know why I expected anything different.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|This memorial CD for George Harrison is pretty awesome,  it covers all of his hits from The Beatles, The Traveling Wilbury's,  and his solo work, I highly recommend this Album.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Though I came into the Symphony X fold rather late in the game, they have quickly become one of my absolute favorites in the ever diversifying metal genre.  Because Paradise Lost was my introductory album (and still my favorite), I do have a slightly greater affinity for the less symphonic Symphony X of recent years.  But it must be said that I do count The Divine Wings of Tragedy and The Odyssey as my other top X picks.  But regardless of the direction that the band is taking, the juggernaut that is Allen/Romeo is as unstoppable as ever.  Not that the rest of the band is relegated to obscurity, as they are all at the top of their game for this album.  Symphony X has always been about the group as a whole, and the musicianship these guys portray is nothing less than stellar.<br /><br />As for the LP itself, never let it be said that Symphony X can't think big.  This Deluxe Edition album is simply SPRAWLING...12 tracks spread across 2 discs (nearly an hour and a half of music!), with precise production values and a man vs. machine concept that connects the narrative.  Not surprisingly, one of the greatest strengths of Iconoclast is the mixing/production.  Everything is crystal clear; from the toms & cymbals to the solos and even the bass guitar, which is frequently subdued or lost entirely on other band's records.  Nothing is \\"lost in the mix\\" here, and the album is that much stronger for it.  Also, the progressive elements, somewhat underplayed on the last album, have made a grand return here, with many of the songs having significant shifts in time and tone.  As for the lyrics, where Paradise Lost focused loosely on biblical themes, Iconoclast rarely strays from the central story of the conflict between man and machine.  It's nice to see Symphony X tackling a concept album of this scope, and they acquit themselves splendidly.<br /><br />But enough of all that.  Let's get to the songs already!  The standout tracks for Iconoclast are as follows; \\"Iconoclast\\", the 11 minute title track opus that starts off the album, replete with chanting, extravagant soloing and a war cry chorus; \\"The End of Innocence\\", the first single off the album, similar in tone to songs from Paradise Lost, with a blistering solo; \\"Dehumanized\\", a take-no-prisoners musical march through hostile landscapes, with brutal lyrics and guitars; \\"Heretic\\", a stomping and rousing assault on the ears, with heavy drums and thrashy guitars; \\"Children of a Faceless God\\", with an epic opening and extremely catchy rhythms; \\"Electric Messiah\\", my favorite song on the album, with a captivating chorus and simply awesome instrumental segment in the middle; and \\"Prometheus (I Am Alive)\\", a majestic scorcher of a track, with great synthesizer sequencing in the background.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are almost all amazing as well, ranging from the piano-fronted power ballad of \\"When All Is Lost\\" to \\"The Lord of Chaos\\", with its stuttering opening and slow-burn chorus.<br /><br />Needless to say, the Deluxe Edition is the only way to purchase this amazing album.  You get 2 discs, 3 extra tracks, including the aforementioned \\"The Lord of Chaos\\", and the special edition packaging.  While the extra songs aren't tied into the overall concept of the album, they are still great stand-alone tracks.  Extra Symphony X is never a bad thing IMO, so don't be afraid to fork out the extra cash.<br /><br />All in all, I would say the wait was well worth it.  Everything we've come to expect from Symphony X is present in spades on Iconoclast.  Michael Romeo is still a guitar god trapped in a mortal's body, and Russell Allen maintains his reign as one of the greatest metal vocalists ever.  While the album Paradise Lost is still the crowned king in my opinion, Iconoclast is a legitimate and strong contender for the throne.  Epic, visionary and consistently amazing, Iconoclast was more than worth the wait, offering up 12 solid songs to amaze both old & new fans alike.

B002GYI96U|3.0|This book was ok.  It wasn't funny liked I had hoped.  It was full of stress and turmoil.  I really enjoy Sophie Kisella but have now read all of her books so I am stranded with Madeline W.  The Wedding Girl would have been better if I had expected it to not be funny.
B002X9GX4S|5.0|This CD has more than you pay for in it. You get poetry with lyrics and music. Also the art work inside the cover is fantastic! I am very glad that I decided to go with this album and not the older stuff. Although the older stuff isn't disappointing either.  Plus on Amazon you can listen to clips of each song to see if this is the CD you want or not so it definetly helped me decide to buy this one.
0316098329|4.0|Room is a book unlike anything else that I ever read. It is told from the point of view from a 5 year old boy whose world has thus far been limited to one room. The story is pretty good, but the premise of the book and the questions that it raises are the real strengths of this book. Many others have gone over the plot, so I will just give a brief run down of strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Strengths<br />* First half of the book is great. Suspenseful, believable, and redemptive.<br />* Great execution of a difficult subject matter. For 150 pages, the world is contained within one small room, and its still a very interesting place.<br />* The world as seen from a 5 year olds eyes will help you see things in new, fresh ways. This is true of both the small room and the enormous world Outside.<br /><br />Weaknesses<br />* First half is much better than second half. The climax of the book comes too early.<br />* The point of view from the boy is great, but the cadence and word choices get annoying at times.<br />* Despite being pretty realistic, some coincidences expose the fiction a little too much. Some things wrap up a little too fast, a little too easily.<br /><br />All in all, this is a book worth reading. I suspect that some people will steer clear of this because of the dark subject matter of a mom and boy being locked in a single room. Don't let that hold you back though, its very easy to read and one I would recommend to most people without hesitation. The subject matter is very real and very dark, but the view from the eyes of an innocent child lowers the suspense and elevates the joy. Recommended.
0439023521|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this story and these characters and Collins writing. I couldn't put this book down! One of the best books I've read in a while.
0679805273|4.0|What can be said? Seuss's simple visuals and simple rhymes are memorable and to-the-point; I hadn't realized at the time I bought this that it was a \\"Party Edition\\". It doesn't really change the contents at all, it just gives it a sparkling dust-jacking and two more words on the cover. The rest of the book is unchanged from the original printing.<br /><br />Good gift for grads, although, like most sentimental gifts, it's less useful than, say, money. Not a bad idea to tuck a few bills in the pages, hm?
0439023513|3.0|I absolutely fell in love with this series and the characters. I was so invested in this story and was pretty disappointed in the ending. Collins spent so much time and 2 other books building up to the events in the third book and then it was just suddenly over. I still love these stories and definitely recommend these books. But after two wonderful books ahead of it, the third was a let down for sure.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Simply put, this is the record of the year so far. As a follow to his 2007 debut and his 2009 EP, this is simply amazing. Some people are already grumbling that it's not just \\"him and a guitar anymore,\\" and they would be right. However, all of the yearning, soul-searching, and wistfulness present on his two previous records is fully intact here. What makes this record even greater than his debut in my opinion, is that it adds to all of that yearning and soul searching with a lush backing band. With a full-band in tow, Justin gracefully moves through this album and the entirety of it truly washes over you. Perth is a stunning and \\"raging,\\" opener and \\"Holocene,\\" may very well be his best song to date. This album even feels more personal than his debut with lines like this from \\"Michicant,\\": \\"aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out  nose up in the globes, you never know if you are passing out.\\" It's almost as if at every turn Justin is delivering lines like this and it's hard for them not to take root in your head. To say again, this is the record of the year so far and one of the most honest, open, and emotional records put out in some time. A must have.

1416583432|3.0|\\"Inside of a Dog, what dogs see, smell and know\\".  Horowitz has a pretty firm grasp of what they see and smell, but what they know... She has no more idea than I do.<br /><br />I didn't find much strong science in this book.  Amidst the ever popular \\"some scientists believe\\", \\"Dr. So-and-so's findings indicate\\" and \\"I've observed\\", the reader might find a few interesting ideas to mull over, but you have to wade through the author's extremely wordy sentiments to find a kernel of interest.<br /><br />The truth is that in order to get published or get grants, scientists and researchers must come up with something new or they are just rewriting someone else's previous research findings.  It almost forces authors to adopt the idea that bad science is better than old science.  None of these new thoughts are necessarily true but they better fit dog owner's desire to find `bonding' experiences.<br /><br />The one item of truth readers will hopefully take from this book and other books of the same ilk is that dogs do not think like people and are not motivated by `people' emotions.  Not a single day goes by that some pet owner doesn't tell me that his dog is doing something out of spite or that his dog thinks it is the boss.  Many, many pet owners simply cannot get their minds around behavior that is so different from human.<br /><br />In spite of all the questionable research, dog's motivations are still a mystery to people.  Scientists are just now beginning to get a glimmer of one fact that they have absolutely refused to consider for decades.  Dogs are a lot smarter than the scientific community has ever given them credit for.  They do have some form of very basic reasoning.  Once researchers can consider this possibility, some progress might be made.<br /><br />One of the most thought provoking things I have read recently are \\"National Geographic's\\" features on the minds and motivations of animals.  Very brief and to the point, yet it gives readers lots of new ideas to contemplate.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although geared for the teen readers, I really enjoyed the \\"soft\\" readability even at the mid-forty age that I am.<br />Author has created a real world with real characters. Many comparisons have been made between HUNGER GAMES and the Japanese classic, BATTLE ROYALE. They are similar, but distinctly different. ROYALE focuses on the violence more while GAMES deals more with the Katnis character.<br />Five thumbs up!

0425242099|5.0|I have read all of Ms. Singh's Psy-Changeling series, and while I have enjoyed some more than others, this is one of the best in the series.  I really enjoyed the romance between Hawke and Sienna.  The author has been developing this story for a while in her previous books.  The relationship between Hawke and Sienna could best be described as playful.  And Hawke's slow seduction of Sienna was scorching hot.  There is also a secondary love story between Dr. Lara and Walker, Sienna's uncle. It was also a sweet, very moving love story.  We also get to see many of the characters from previous books.  It was fun to catch up with what is going on with this growing group of characters.  There's a real sense of family in these books that I love.  But where Nalini Singh shines for me, is the emotion she brings to the romances between her characters.  You could probably read this book without reading the previous books first.  But be forewarned, it will be difficult to really understand what is going on with the characters from the previous books.  And some of the plot has been developing book by book.  If you do decide to start from the beginning, look for Slave to Sensation.
1416550550|3.0|I really like long books that draw me in, where I can dwell a little longer in those wonderful alternate realities great writers create.  I'm sorry to say the \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" did not turn out to be one of those kinds of books.  The characters did not come very much to life for me and the plot, shifting back and forth between characters and dates, almost had me putting the book down for good.  It wasn't a bad read, just very fragmented, fairly predictable, and borderline frustrating, due to the length and shifting about in the story line. I am really surprised at all of the five star reviews.  \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" was just \\"ok\\" to me.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game.  It's perfect for playing a level or two every day on the bus to and from work.    It started out a little slow for the first couple levels but got really fun and challenging as I started to get more plants and the harder combinations of zombies started coming.    I would definitely recommend this game.
0470876417|5.0|This is a great book, wonderful to read, and full of good hints, stories and a perfect, but yet simple methodology! I love it.
0345528581|5.0|I purchased this book several months ago and absolutely LOVE it!  Yes, a couple of typo's, etc, but overall content is top notch.  The book is packed with tons of bodyweight exercises (about 125 I believe) & photo illustrations.  Plenty of variety and exercises to last a lifetime.  I have been doing only bodyweight exercises from this book (and a few of my own) for a few months now and am getting very nice results.  It is amazing how much these exercises can work your entire body and supporting muscles.  It's great not having to go to a gym or rely on equipment to get a good workout.  I would highly recommend buying a copy for yourself and anyone else you know! I also purchased the iPhone app and it is great as well.  Awesome book Mark!

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I liked the first season, and the second is even better.    The ending that some were disappointed in seemed fine to me; it also left things open if someone were to pick it up (in 3 years) or make a movie.    What may have hurt the show was it connection to the previous Stargate ventures; all of which were entertaining, if not terribly substantive.   SG Universe was a very different show, much more like DS9 or BSG.  Why this show was canned, while something as poor as Sanctuary retained, is a mystery to me (unless the latter was that much cheaper to produce).  Aside from compelling stories and acting, what made the show a particular standout with me was the writers didn't adhere to the politically correct character assemblies that have dominated Sci Fi since the 1990's.   Their assemblage of characters worked, you believed them, and the less-than-stellar Captain Young was the best multi-layered leader since Frank Savage in 12 O'Clock High.  To me, Stargate Universe delivered what BSG touted, believability.  Sometimes it takes a while for a series to hit its stride; this one was just getting there.     If you like solid, deep-space science fiction, you may love this series.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Being a great fan of the first Tron movie I was happy to see that they finally made a sequel to that movie,  and while some have said that the movie lacked any real action or story I still feel that many people will get a great deal of enjoyment and entertainment from watching this movie.  The Effects and scenery were incredible as well as the soundtrack for the movie,  and for us fans who remember the Light cycles and disc combat those too have been vastly improved with this movie as well.  I'm glad that they got Jeff Bridges to do his character of Flynn again though it is sad that Bruce Boxleitner just got a cameo role in this sequel.  So if you've already seen the first movie than this one is a definite must have and if you're still undecided than check a few clips and trailers those I'm sure will more than help you make you choice...
159420229X|5.0|When I sat down and read this book I was soon absorbed into the tale Josh tells of his Memory Championship experience.  His writing was as if we were having conversation at the local pub.  I was drawn into his ever growing passion for establishing a greater memory and systems of recall.  The tale not only allows the reader to learn the basic principles of memory improvement and recall but, does so in a way that you are not completely aware of being taught.  Josh almost speaks through the book to you as you read, making the book that much more enjoyable.  You can visualize the story as you read and play it like a movie in your mind.  Though the book won't teach you everything you need to know to become the next Mental Champion, it does give you a great place to start.<br />Overall, I have recommended this book to friends and family.  It is a great story regardless of what you are trying to get out of it.
0061726826|5.0|This book was amazing. It was so beautiful and sad and different and...perfect. The idea of love as a disease infected me immediately. The world Lauren Oliver created is so like our own and yet frighteningly different. People go through their daily lives, talking and working and eating as if everything is normal, but they never laugh. They never dance. They never say \\"I love you.\\" They claim to be happy but there is no joy. Love was declared a disease because love causes hate and hate causes wars, but if have lost the ability to love or hate, what is left?<br /><br />I love Lena. She is shy, scared and very ordinary. She isn't a rebel, she doesn't want to break the rules, all she wants is to be happy and safe. There are so many rebellious, strong heroines out there that it was refreshing to meet one who is so very human. I can relate to her insecurities and anxieties so easily because I share many of them. I love that Lena is stronger than she thinks she is, strong enough to stand up for love when the world wants to take it from her, even when she has feared it all her life.<br /><br />Alex is wonderful, but you don't get to know him as well as you do Lena. You see his bravery and sweetness through her eyes, as well as his uncommon understanding and support. And at the end...*sigh* Perfect. Absolutely perfect.<br /><br />There were a few flaws in the story, but nothing that diminished my enjoyment. The fact that most of the secondary characters were nearly-emotionless adults was a little weird, but there were a few moments when I wondered if the \\"cure\\" was working quite as well as people believed. The romance was technically not very original, but the setting was totally new. Lauren Oliver's writing style was lovely. How long do I have to wait for Pandemonium???<br /><br />I highly recommend Delirium to anyone who loves a tale of love and sacrifice.
0345495004|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  For many years, I had been a fan of Wright's architecture but never really knew anything about the man...until a friend recommended LOVING FRANK.  I picked it up and could hardly put it down. Writing the book from Mamah Borthwick Cheney's point of view was genius.  Mamah is truly a tragic person, caught up in the need to remove the shackles of an oppressive era but forever a captive of her own naivety about her options.  The intellectual stimulus she received from FLW and her obvious physical attraction to him (contrived by the author or real)would surely destroy her in the end.  Though it is what one would expect from every really bad \\"B\\" movie out there (what happens to women when they stray from what society considers proper....in this case, a married woman with children who abandons everything for the \\"man she loves\\"), it was quite painful (and quite surprising, I might add)to learn that this brilliant, kind, gentle, loving woman would face hell on earth for going against the grain.  Though I could not ever leave my children for any man, I do believe she believed until the end that everything would work out well. In many ways, she was an eternal optimist who was ahead of her time...yet trapped by it.  Wright, on the other hand, obnoxious as he was with many people, remains a genius in his own right and his work represents far greater things than the histrionics of the person who created it.  One of the best books I have read in years.

There's no need for me to go on here about how fantastic the movie is, or how perfectly cast and iconic Christopher Reeve is. \\"Superman: The Movie\\" (and by extension Richard Donner's Director's Cut of \\"Superman II) remains the yardstick by which all other modern Superhero movies must be judged.<br />  This four DVD edition includes two versions of \\"The Movie\\" itself: The 1978 original Theatrical Release and the slightly Expanded Edition from 2000. I find myself watching the Expanded Edition exclusively, although both versions are fine. DVDS 3 and 4 are loaded with Special Features, including three documentaries.  \\"The Development Of Superman\\" and \\"Filming The Legend\\" offer insightful details into the exhausting eighteen month schedule required to shoot two films at once. Most upsetting is  how the Salkind producers fired director Richard Donner after the release of \\"Superman\\" but before he could complete \\"Superman II.\\" This is upsetting because it is so evident now that much of the film's timeless magic and appeal comes from Donner's energy, enthusiasm, and complete dedication (and Christopher Reeve's humanity).  A rough justice, of sorts, was served with the DVD release of \\"Superman II: Richard Donner's Director's Cut.\\"<br />  Also included are a TV Special hosted by Christopher Reeve, Screen Tests, Restored Scenes, Audio Music Cues, nine of Max Fleischer's \\"Superman\\" cartoons from the 1940's, and the 1951 movie \\"Superman And The Mole-Men\\" starring George Reeves.
B003VYAVGA|5.0|I bought this because I've always been a big Take That and Robbie Williams fan and I have to say, at first I was- what the hell am I listening to? It sounded nothing like anything that had come before. But I persevered, and I have to say that I think its one of the best albums I've ever listened to. They were really brave to make this album when they could've sat back and remade the past. They didn't. They created something unique, and even if Robbie Williams departs again, I will always cherish this album.
B004NS710C|5.0|Once this movie got going it was action to the end. New actor, Chris Pine meshed well with Denzel Washington who is becoming one of the icons of modern-day Hollywood. The story starts with Pine and Washington in a Locomotive going on a routine pick up of coal cars to transport them to another warehouse. In another location maintenance workers forget to connect a portion of the brakes on a two-mile-long train. As the long train moves along the tracks a careless engineer leaves the Locomotive with the throttle stick on to pull a malfunctioning track-switch. The problem is the train starts moving faster and faster as the out of shape engineer can't catch up to the train and it gets away from him. Throughout the movie the runaway train crashes into empty cars, horse trailers and train blockades. Nothing stops it as it heads toward a major city at speeds up to 70-75 mph with several cars full of toxic chemicals. I won't tell you how it ends but Washington and Pine in the first train devise a last minute plan to stop the runaway train as they risk all to save hundreds of thousand of lives who are depending on them including their respective families!

I learned more from Meg's class than any baking class I have taken. She is a wonderful teacher. I ordered the book months ago ~ I do not order many without looking them over and seeing if I really ~ need the book....why I have over 2000 cookbooks. Yes, I really do and I have been collecting them for 20 years or more so I have many, many cookbooks. I will say this is one of the most beautiful cookbooks I own. The pictures are beautiful. The pages have a scalloped edge, nothing has been over looked. The book has clear and easy to follow instructions. I love this book ~ it is one book I would give a 5 star rating too. If you ever go out to SF please stop by and take the time to enjoy some of the happiness at Miette it is a truly wonderful bakery!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I think they did a good job with this one. They diverted from the original stories, which is great-then they can't screw them up. Also, they did a splendid job with Watson. Watson, as readers know, is not an idiot. Also, the Holmes character was nearly spot-on. Holmes can take care of himself in a fight and tends to go nuts when left without work. (Loved the attempt at making a silencer.) Only issue I have is the \\"Irene Adler Romance\\", but I guess Hollywood has to fit love in somewhere.

B000003TA4|3.0|I like the record to some degree, but I think it's overrated. Kurt Cobain really didn't have that great of a range, in my opinion. Not to mention the whole record has been played back to front for YEARS. It gets old after a while. It has its highlights, however-'Polly' and 'Something in the Way' are fantastic. All in all, though, 'In Utero' was a much better record if you're seeking to try Nirvana for the first time.

0553386794|3.0|Epic fantasy is a favorite pastime for me because I love to lose myself in a land of the supernatural quest and adventure with a touch of wonder and romance. I was looking forward to settling into George R.R. Martin's series Song of Ice and Fire. A Game of Thrones promised to be the start of something outstanding and though it's very well written, its plot is sweeping and characters complex, I was only mildly impressed overall.<br /><br />I always viewed fantasy as a reflection of society and with classic Tolkienesque fantasy, the world is painstakingly constructed with good triumphing over evil, an epic love, and the inhabitants evolved into beings intent on making their world a better place.<br /><br />The core of contemporary fantasy is grounded so-called realism: violence, pointless death, brutal rape, and rampant amorality, wherein heroism is not the goal; here, it's the struggle for power that drives the story and whoever wins the shift in power is the hero.<br /><br />I have no problem with the depiction of realism in a story; there are plenty of grim fantasy stories that work very well. But when it comes to fantasy fiction, I expect to be entertained and to connect with characters that are likeable and believable.<br /><br />The world George R.R.Martin has created is very unpleasant and has very little fantasy about it. The over the top political intrigue, betrayal, greed, incest, and misogyny in Game of Thrones read like a huge soap opera. Reading it was like a rickety roller coaster ride, I enjoyed the first two hundred pages then the middle portion became torturous, and then the story swung back to being enjoyable near the end.<br /><br />As much I sometimes found myself caught up in the intrigue and melodrama of Games of Thrones, I wasn't left with a craving for more any time soon. This book left me with ambivalent feelings towards reading the entire series. For now I find the HBO production to be more visceral entertainment.
0316056863|4.0|There are just some books that you shouldn't read in public. Some because they have embarrassing covers. Some because they make you cry. And some, like Bossypants, that make you laugh until you cry. Let's just say that I'm very glad that I read this book mostly in the comfort of my home. I laughed a lot and hard. I had to keep reading parts out loud to the Husband so he could see what I was rolling on the floor about.<br /><br />In this fairly short book (ahem, too short for my liking), Fey goes through her dorky childhood and her road to comedy stardom. Fey has some very funny anecdotes. I really liked hearing about her honeymoon. I don't want to give anyway but Murphy's Law was definitely in play during her honeymoon. I also really liked the story behind her coming back to SNL to play Sarah Palin, by far one of the funniest impressions that I've ever seen anyone do.<br /><br />Fey also briefly touches on some of the sexism present in the comedy business. It was something I was slightly aware of but I wish she would have gone into more detail. She says that it's present but doesn't really say how she coped.<br /><br />Bottom line, this book made  me giggle, chortle, laugh and guffaw. I think it can be very difficult to write funny things but Fey has a way of writing that is absolutely hilarious. Fair Warning: If you don't want to be stared at in public, keep your reading of this book limited to your own couch.<br /><br />(This review was also posted at [...]

An accident occurs and he wakes up in a hospital four days later.  When he finally realizes who he is he heads back to find his wife.  When she claims to have never seen him before and meets the man that says he is him Dr. Harris begins his quest to reveal the truth.  This is the best kind of action-thriller movie.  Just when you think you have the truth figured out a twist happens and you are left guessing again.  To talk more about the movie itself will give too much away, but I am usually very good at predicting the ending to movies, but this one got me. Liam Neeson is excellent at playing parts like this and I hope he continues to do it.  The supporting cast is also excellent, as is the writing.  Very entertaining movie.  Not quite as fun as \\"Taken\\", but it's also a different kind of movie.  Overall, a must see for action fans, will keep you guessing all the way until the end.

B001IBIHQ4|2.0|The Marines who fought in WWII deserved a story similar to what the Army soldiers who fought in Europe received in Band of Brothers.  Sadly, this is no where near as good a story as that.  While the fighting stories are exceptional, this lacks the focus on the unit and the men that was found in BOB.  By the end of that mini-series we knew who each guy was and we could feel their feelings and cared about their survival.  The Pacific doesn't drive that feeling.  We just see a bunch of guys who fight in WWII but the soldiers are just blanks and we are not allowed to feel a strong link to them.    I would wait until History starts running it around the clock to watch it again.  But this is a weak follow up to Band of Brothers.

B001ECQ75A|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />When Kung Fu Panda was released in China, it was praised not only for the production values but its faithfulness to Chinese culture. Suddenly people in China were asking, how can an American production company outdo their Chinese counterparts in creating an animated film that sends such a positive message about China and gets everything right? It's akin to the Russians who launched the first man into space, only to see the American overtake them, eventually landing a man on the moon. For many Chinese critics, Kung Fu Panda is the American 'first lunar landing' of animated martial arts movies.<br /><br />But if the Chinese critics only had a bit of critical acumen, they could easily see there's nothing to be jealous about here. Sure there's a great amount of respect for Chinese culture seen throughout the film (down to the last Chinese character in the credits) as well as some sensational animation including the opening anime 'dream' sequence as well as that incredibly difficult feat of having tons of realistic looking confetti pour down at the Kung Fu tournament where the Kung Fu Panda, Po, is crowned Dragon Warrior. But how is Chinese culture honored by turning Chinese people into a bunch of goofy, self-effacing anthropomorphic animals? Surely kids under eight will dig it, but adults? I hardly think so.<br /><br />While the directors of 'Panda' are firmly ensconced in the world of martial arts and action adventure films, they are neophytes when it comes to comedy. It all comes down to one silly slapstick scene after another emphasizing Po as a good natured, bumbling fool with a decided inferiority complex. Whether he fails getting up the steps into the arena for the Kung Fu tournament, or shoots himself high into the air strapped to a bunch of fireworks and then unceremoniously falling straight down and landing inside the arena, only to be crowned Dragon Warrior, the idea that we should fall in love with his lovable loser is spelled out from the beginning and repeated ad infinitum. How many times do we have to see Po chucked around like an inflatable doll whether it's by Master Shifu, Villain Tai Lung or when he finds himself caught inside the mechanical torture chamber, a device that Shifu's Dragon Warrior candidates, 'The Furious Five', in contrast, have mastered.<br /><br />I do confess that Master Shifu's 'epiphany' in realizing that he has to train Po in a different way so that he can succeed as the dragon warrior, might have been the most clever moment in the comic arc of the film. And certainly Po's transformation from self-effacing masochist to gleeful aggressor as he embraces his 'appetite', is a welcome plot twist after being subjected to the one joke idea of Po as a bumbling clown. Yes, there's finally a method to Po's madness, as Tai Lung is unable to harness Po's new found manic energy. It's sort of like a dominant major league batter unable to master the completely unpredictable path of a knuckle ball.<br /><br />But if we view Po as representing a grownup who still acts like a kid with the particularly bad habit of overeating, then the message 'be yourself', should fall on deaf ears. In this day where smart educators are trying to control the epidemic of childhood obesity, Po's unbridled enthusiasm for that extra cupcake, would not lead to his triumph as dragon warrior. It's a wishful conceit on the part of the directors that Po would end up victorious in his confrontation with the evil Tai Lung. The filmmakers' message to kids here is be happy even if you don't treat yourself well. And things will turn out alright even if you've made no effort to change yourself.<br /><br />As for the action adventure aspect of 'Panda', I can't help it if it seems that the 'holy trinity' of Shifu, Oogway and Tai Lung, are pilfered straight out of the Star Wars play book. Shifu appears to be a Yoda stand-in with the wise, all-knowing tortoise Oogway, reprising the Obi-Wan Kenobi role (Oogway appears to employ his own version of 'The Force' as he is responsible for turning the slight Red Panda Master Shifu into a powerhouse). Finally, Tai Lung can go toe to toe with Darth Vadar any day as both have no problems mixing erudition with brute force.<br /><br />A good deal of 'Panda' is taken up by one Kung Fu sequence after another and you really have to be a martial arts fan to be enamored with all those repetitious action sequences. Less bothersome (but still silly) was the decision to make Po's father, Mr. Ping, a goose. There's also the Wuxi Finger Hold that leads to Tai Lung's destruction (at first it seems like a nuclear explosion but it really is a clearing out of 'bad energy' or 'bad karma'). Finally, The 'Furious Five' are not distinct enough as characters despite the conscription of such luminaries as Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan to perform the voice overs.<br /><br />I think 'Kung Fu Panda' would have been a better film had the films' scenarists decided from the outset not to make Po into such a hapless buffoon. That would have also probably meant that the sentimental Mr. Ping and his love for noodles had to go too. In its present incarnation, Kung Fu Panda is certainly suitable for kids (although Tai Lung's antics might be too strong a draught for children under eight). As for adults, ignore the dopey screenplay and concentrate on the visuals and the music, which certainly deserve the accolades already garnered throughout the film community since the film's release in 2008.ion of 'The Force' as he is responsible for turning the slight Red Panda Master Shifu into a powerhouse).

I kept wanting to know what happened next. I really enjoyed it. My daughter has told me the second book is even better, so after I get done with the book I'm reading now, I look forward to seeing if I agree.

Still, it's hard not to get drawn into the complex world of Freedom by Jonathan Franzen.<br /><br />Right from the first page the setup of the Berglund family is constructed with extraordinary detail. Thought and heart are put into nearly every phrase, with each interaction coming across effortless and real. The story is framed by stretching back and forth through several generations of Berglund family history though the soul of the novel is the connective single moments, which almost always relate back to the story's central characters, Patty and Walter. Along with their friend Richard Katz, these are profoundly flawed human beings.<br /><br />Give yourself time to fall into this one.

0756404738|5.0|This novel's predecessor, The Name of the Wind, was one of the signature reading events of my life. Coming back to Rothfuss' story in The Wise Man's Fear was like reuniting with an old friend. Here's what I originally wrote about the book over two years ago:<br /><br />\\"In The Wise Man's Fear, author Patrick Rothfuss continues Kvothe's legendary story as he travels across the four corners of civilization, from the relative familiarity of Imre and the University to the more distant lands of Vintas and beyond. This review contains some spoilers so consider yourself forewarned.<br /><br />\\"I spent over a month immersing myself in Rothfuss' magically crafted world, reading slowly and deliberately, not wanting to miss any details and not wanting it to end. I frequently laughed out loud as well as experienced Kvothe's profound moments of fear and sadness. I trust Rothfuss to complete his story exactly how he intends to, and I will suspend all judgment until the end in that expectation, but I feel like the story should have progressed much further since the next book is supposed to be the last. Perhaps I've been raised too much on the Empire Strikes Back, but I expected a more substantial confrontation with the Chandrian and more of a dark twist to Kvothe's story to end this middle book. It's arguable that these things did happen, but in a more subtle way. Maybe Rothfuss has plans for the story that doesn't follow some familiar genre standards. Still, I've been introduced to many fascinating characters that seem to have a larger role to play and I wonder if one more book (albeit, a massive one) is enough to tell the whole story.\\"<br /><br />Since this is book 2 of 3 in the Kingkiller Chronicles, Wise Man's Fear has neither a real beginning nor end, and you can tell I was preoccupied with \\"What happens next?\\" the first time I read it. Recently I found myself missing Kvothe & Co. and the larger world of the Four Corners so I picked up the book again and this time, without the urgency of plot revelations forcing me along, I paid closer attention--even more deliberately than I claim above. Professor Elodin might say I was \\"trying to see the thing behind the thing\\" because I kept uncovering new and subtle layers to this story that I previously overlooked. From his own corner of our world, I believe Master Rothfuss is trying to instruct us all in the art of naming. Here's to a beautiful game.e urgency of plot revelations forcing me along, I paid closer attention--even more deliberately than I claim above.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Ok at first I really was a little disappointed with the way that this book was written.  While I still think it was a bit of a political propaganda in itself, I am slowly coming to understand why she wrote the way she did and I appreciate it all the more.  This book dosen't present the stoic optimism that they other ones did and you really don't get the sense leaving this book that \\"they all live happily ever after\\".  Parts of this book even border on completely depressing, but I've come to really appreciate the reality that Suzanne Collins deals in.  ****IF YOU DIDNT READ THE BOOK, STOP READING HERE***      Much like the life of a war ravaged young soldier, Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, Annie et al. have been through war and they will never be the same for it.  This is reality.  Young men and women are going off to war every day and returning home.  We can't expect them to see the world the same way.  I was sad to see them such broken people at the end.  At first reading the epilogue gave me hope, but now after re-reading the end I think SC made a VERY large statement in not having Katniss refer to her children by their names.  She calls them the girl and \\"he\\".  It speaks volumes of how dead inside she really is if she can't even rejoice and find happiness and comfort in her family.  Its a sad reality but I felt like there was a larger message here that I give her alot of credit for.  This isn't the fairy tale that most YA books portray.  It was brave on her part because alot of people wanted the comfort of Katniss being put back together after all the tragedies.      I did think the end felt a bit rushed though and it definitely left me wanting more.  I'm hoping that when they produce the movies that they deal a bit more with the aftermath of Prim's death and the craziness that ensues in the outside world during Katniss's trial after she killed Coin.    All-in-all this was much less of a book about her BEING the Mockinjay and more about the battles itself.  Thecharacters almost seem like the subplot to the larger picture here.  Still a good read and wraps up the series fairly well.  Worth the read.
B004WJRF6C|5.0|I grow weary of reading reviews stating the obvious, that all of this material could've fit on one disc.  So what?  Personally, I'd rather have the original album material confined to one disc, unsullied by \\"bonus material\\" of varying quality.  For another thing...The price of this package is only 13.99, so stop crying \\"rip off\\"...your complaints hold no water.<br /><br />It's McCartney's first solo effort (discounting 'The Family Way' soundtrack).  I hate to resort to cliches, but it is what it is.  No one's going to argue that \\"Valentine Day\\" is as great a track as, say, \\"Jet\\".  But still, I love the record.  It flows, and makes perfect sense to me.  Hearing it is like visiting with an old dear friend.  The new remastering makes the material sound vital, present and clean (like Pauly's grandfather).  It sounds ALMOST as good as the original LP.  Ain't that enough for you?<br /><br />And besides...what have YOU done lately?

159420229X|5.0|Josh Foer is such a great story teller. His experience in training, the people he met, the research he did are what made the whole book so worthwhile, not just the memory techniques. He has one essential technique that was rehashed throughout the book and one chapter that describes the memory technique well. I will just let you find what what techniques he uses on your own. It's a non-fiction book that reads like fiction because the stories involving different master and expert using memory techniques are fascinating.
0756405890|4.0|This book was recommended to me by three different friends before I finally took the plunge into the series. Its a long first book - 700+ pages - and it starts out pretty slow. Around page 200, I was wondering if it was worth plowing through the rest. But, since I hate not finishing books I've already started, I decided to continue. And I am so glad that I did. The book is richly descriptive; Mr. Rothfuss has done an admirable job at creating a new fantasy world. There is a Hogwarts feel around the University, and the protagonist has all the regular trappings of a fantasy hero, but the story, the magic, and the characters are still unique enough to keep you from putting it down. I picked up Book 2 immediately after finishing Book 1 - the book is just that good, you can't read something else (even though the second book is even longer than the first!).
1594744769|4.0|This is a clever, original and wholly refreshing book for all ages (ok, maybe not for those under the age of 12-might be too scary).  Riggs has used old \\"Peculiar\\" photos he retained from collectors and incorporated them as an essential party of his book (I don't think it would have been nearly as good without the photos).   The story is about 16-year old, Jacob, who has heard tall tales from his grandfather about a home for Peculiar children all his life.  He didn't believe them until his grandfather's death, and his search to find the truth begins.  The novel is full of off-beat characters, adventure, mystery, time-travel, and even a little romance.      I think it is destined to become a classic.  The ending lends itself to at least another book perhaps a whole a series.        Note, I tried the sample on my Kindle, but the photos were dark and small, so I got the hardback edition; much better quality and worth the extra 50 cents.
1416583432|4.0|This is a great book for all dog lovers.  Horowitz provides a nice mix of information we already knew (your dog loves you!), information we thought we knew but really just made up (licks really are a sign of affection!), and information that shows what we thought we knew was wrong (dogs are not color blind!). Do not expect to be able to read your dog's mind when you finish, but you will likely find that you have a new appreciation for what your dog sees, smells, hears, feels, and knows. Brava to the Barnard professor!

There are some great songs on Amarantine. \\"It's in the Rain\\", the haunting \\"Drifting\\" (the album's only instrumental), the furious \\"The River Sings\\", the anthemic \\"Less than a Pearl\\"... Amarantine has its winners. There's even the haiku-like \\"Sumiregusa\\", entirely in Japanese, which is a pleasant grower.<br /><br />However, there are also some tracks which sound fairly, it must be said, unspectacular. \\"A Moment Lost\\" and \\"Amid the Falling Snow\\" are both such dull and uncreative tracks that I'm surprised that Enya put them on the album at all. Even the filler songs of The Memory of Trees were wonderful. That's the other thing, what about the creativity in the instrumentation? You can really hear, in each Enya album, just judging from the sound, what album it is. Not so with Amarantine. It lacks that special sound identifiable with itself. As good as the aforementioned tracks are, Amarantine lacks that \\"wow\\" factor which her other albums sport. Normally, Enya's music transports you, tugging at your heartstrings and mesmerizing you. I missed that feeling immensely when listening to Amarantine, and it's a real shame.<br /><br />Another problem is one that lyricist Roma Ryan is responsible for. Three tracks are in the fictional language Loxian, created by Roma herself. In the booklet, each of these songs has the lyrics in Loxian as well as the English translation, which is a welcome addition. However, Loxian, while beautiful to the ears, has an alphabet completely unrelated to the Latin alphabet, making following these songs, lyrically, impossible, which is quite off-putting. There are also no songs in Enya's native Irish, which is rather sad. Irish might have made some songs sound a bit more interesting.<br /><br />For those of you wanting more elaboration, I will go deeper into each individual track.<br /><br />LESS THAN A PEARL<br />A breahttaking composition, with a moody and yet gloriously inspiring atmosphere. The chorus of vocals in the Loxian language weave a haunting layer of sound. A very strong way to open the album; definitely one of the best tracks.<br /><br />AMARANTINE<br />This is the first time the album's title track is not the opener, and perhaps it was for the best here. \\"Amarantine\\" is very plain and \\"safe\\". And the lovey-dovy lyrics just sound unimaginative on Roma Ryan's part. A sadly prophetic taste for what's to come.<br /><br />IT'S IN THE RAIN<br />This is one track I am taken with; understated and low-key but steady. The melody is strong and gripping. A moody, introspective track that has its own way of gripping the listener.<br /><br />IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU ARE<br />This song's beauty is its simplicity - it's all vocal and strings, and is a haunting thing in its own right.  It reminds me of some of Enya's b-sides like \\"I May Not Awaken\\", only more hopeful and stirring.<br /><br />THE RIVER SINGS<br />The first track I was truly taken with - an energetic, fast and feisty song with a gorgeous, thunderous sound. It's especially a pity here that you can't really follow the Loxian lyrics because it's another of the strongest tracks on the album.<br /><br />LONG LONG JOURNEY<br />Not one of the album's worst songs, but it's to thank its charm and catchiness that it gets away with its painfully unimaginative sound.<br /><br />SUMIREGUSA<br />Another winner, slow and dripping with atmosphere. The haiku-like lyrics, in Japanese, are very moving.<br /><br />SOMEONE SAID GOODBYE<br />Maybe it's just because of the pure melancholy of this song but I've never been able to really warm up to it. It divides people, but I think it's one of the best English-language tracks on the album in that it weaves a mood so far removed from what one might potentially expect from Enya's work. I see some of Enya's emotion seep through here.<br /><br />A MOMENT LOST<br />Speaking of things you can expect, this song is so plain and unimaginative that it borders on plain boring. It doesn't even sound fully composed. Waste of disc space, a dire song.<br /><br />DRIFTING<br />Now we're talking. Perhaps my biggest personal favourite; a gorgeous, pristine instrumental (which this album could definitely use more of). The cello running through helps make this melody downright goosebump-inducing. This is magic, and proves once again that Enya doesn't need lyrics if the music is strong in its own right.<br /><br />AMID THE FALLING SNOW<br />This song took me a long time to warm up to. If anything, it has a great chorus and the final thirty seconds are very appealing. But the lyrics don't tell me anything, really, and the melody is fairly dire in retrospect.<br /><br />WATER SHOWS THE HIDDEN HEART<br />For a closer, this is a fairly anticlimatic song in the sense that for such a lyric-central melody, you can't follow the lyrics in question. And the melody, while nice and soothing, isn't strong enough to be a closer. While this is a moving song, it has to be the weakest closer to any of Enya's albums.<br /><br />Amarantine is certainly Enya's poorest release, but it still has it good songs to speak of. The principle flaw as I see it is the sing-songy element in a lot of the songs; I miss the powerful melodies that were above that. As it stands we've heard it all before, and portrayed much stronger, than here. The artwork, ironically, illustrates the album perfectly; a whole lot of dull whites with some delicious reds thrown in. And Winter Came... would see Enya return to form, but Amarantine is strictly for Enya's most devoted fans.emoved from what one might potentially expect from Enya's work.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|Downloaded and read this in one day - it's that good and compulsive reading.  Love John's writing style, doesn't take himself too seriously yet knows he has a real message to share to help other authors.  Can't believe he's giving away this information - there's internet marketers selling this information for hundreds of dollars, that he's practically giving away!  If you want to sell books on Kindle, buy this book.
0684823454|2.0|I am deeply dissappointed in this book. I had hoped to find a good detailed tale of a youngster in Victorian England. Instead it seems that the author wonders where his youth went. Very little is revealed of his childhood. As a matter of fact within his childhood what Churchill remembers most is the political successes of his father. He struggles thru school and hides that by telling us at length how much fun it was to play polo during his military career in India. When a battle occurs and he takes notes he does not forget to write particularly well about himself and how heroic he is. The book shows how Churchil loves himself. The book reads like he self-satisfies himself. He ends his military years without a decent prospect of a job in civil life. So what does he chooses for his future? Politics. If you fail in everything else, choose politics. Just ask Hitler, another minor military chum. Like his nemesis der Adolph, der Winston survives on writing and giving speeches.  How amazing, that i did not find in this book what i was looking for, but i discovered that, like Hitler, Churchill got on the steps of the world stage, not knowing at a crucial time in his life, of which wood to make his arrows.
B001ILHY1I|1.0|This is another horrible remake.  I hate action movies and chalk this one up as trash.  I can tell Jason Stratham is a one trick pony.  Why is he even an actor? He will probably be limited to these type of action movies.  It was boring and all the characters sucked.
0316056863|5.0|I purchased this book thinking that it would mainly be comedy sketches and stories.  It's that, but so much more.  This is a memoir that you will love, especially if you are familiar with SNL, Second City and 30 Rock....oh,  and if you're a mom, have a job you sometimes don't like, have too many things on your to do list, don't like your hips,  like to be entertained...in short, there is something for everyone in here.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version, read by Tina and it really felt like she was a girlfriend sitting next to me telling me stories.  Her combination of self-depreciating humor, while still being such a strong woman, is inspirational.  She shows how she struggles with the same issues you do, juggling a career and family.  Also, the parts on writing for SNL were so interesting, I had no idea how the process worked and this was a great glimpse into it.<br /><br />My only complaint was that it ended too soon, I could have easily gone on listening.  I look forward to another one in a few years to cover this stage of her life.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The game is a lot of fun.  I'm on level 5-9, and it's kicking my butt!  I do have one complaint with this game.  Why didn't it default to the SD card?  The game is 75 mb.  While I didn't have an issue with free space, and I just moved it to my sd card (16gb), this is just far too large to put on the ROM storage of the phone.<br /><br />Also, not to complain too much, since I downloaded the game for free, when it was the app of the day, but why is the app store so slow?  It took almost an hour to download this game, and my wifi gets bandwidth between 22-30 mb/s.  Plus, downloading other games from the amazon market seems to take longer than they would if there were in the Android market.  I hope Amazon upgrades its bandwidth, to allow for faster download speeds.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is extremely talented, and this CD is truly a work of art. Her voice is powerful and soulful; her lyrics are deep, moving, and sensitive. Although only 21, Adele's artistic ability is mature. This is an outstanding CD; every song is exceptional!

Apparently, my ability to find the answer to a tech question on Google is vastly superior to that of my co-workers ;-) So anyway that also means I'm the guy who buys stuff on Amazon. I've bought 14 of these so far and they work great with everything from 13\\" MacBooks to 17\\" MacBook Pros. They work so well that I bet they'll even work with a PC. See ya' later, off to go buy number 15.
B001TW68P4|5.0|This is a band that I admire since I was a teenager. They play romantic songs with the necessary musical strength to make you feel full of good rock. What can I say about the voices? Just outstanding. A wonderful compilation you can buy without hesitation.

B001HNE3NO|3.0|I won't recap the story here since it's been done in numerous other reviews. I will say my one complaint in what I felt like was an otherwise gripping narrative, was that what worked so well in keeping the pages turning, was the changing narratives between the young Sarah, and her harrowing experience in a Paris internment camp, and the contemporary Julia; an American expat journalist living in France, and uncovering the hidden past of this young Jewish girl, ignorant of the effect it would have on her family. once the first narrative is removed, the story, while still interesting, lost a bit of it's thunder, and became a bit pale in comparison to other books with the same subject matter, ' The Book Thief' for example. Despite this, it's still a good book, just one that resonates more because of Sarah.
B00004YX39|5.0|There seems to be endless debate among audiophiles regarding the subtleties of the sound of Vinyl versus CD's versus Computer audio, which I admit I get adrift in sometimes. Listening to \\"Gaucho\\" I remember that the overwhelming determinant of audio quality is the love that goes into the recording, mixing and mastering, as amply demonstrated by this CD. The love is all there: the balance perfect, the dynamics reach out and grab you without boxing your ears, the musical spectrum seems perfect (recognizing that, for electric instruments, there is no \\"natural\\" balance, nevertheless this album achieves a perfect blending of instruments and voices). Every note is just right; you cannot play this too loud! Wipikedia sez \\"it took Becker, Fagen, Nichols and Katz over 55 tries to properly mix the 50-second fade out of 'Babylon Sisters'\\" The list of almost 50 musicians who contributed to the album is astounding; Mark Knopfler was recorded for several hours resulting in around three seconds of guitar in 'Time Out of Mind'- you get the idea. Obsessive? Sure, it took Beethoven years to write the 9th, \\"Gaucho\\" is our An die Freude.
B002ZG981E|1.0|Very simply put, this movie had an intriguing premise but it was too, too much!<br /><br />The movie was too rooted in the subconscience to allow for a proper narrative rendering it was more trippy than properly entertaining.<br /><br />This is the perfect film to epitomize that sometimes too much is not good.<br /><br />An odd but [I feel] relevant comparison and far superior movie would be \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\". The limiting of entering into the subconscience would have enhanced this movie.<br /><br />While I love Christopher Nolan other works, perhaps his vision for this story was too bombastic.
0061537969|1.0|No character development.  Only injustice after injustice piled on the master while the dog dwells and bemoans each incident.  Using the dog as narrator allows the author wallow to in each injustice while keeping the main character going with a stiff upper lip.  I thought maybe the story would move on after the wife dies, but no, the man (and his dog) is kicked while down and the story continues in the same vein.
B004SEUJUU|4.0|Despite the flaws the film had, and I wouldn't lie it had them, I really enjoyed \\"X-Men: Origins- Wolverine\\". Not only was Hugh Jackman good, but so was Liev Schieber as Victor Creed and Danny Houston as Stryker. Tyler Kitsch was also good as Gambit, despite his role being more like an extended special appearance. Harry-Gregson Williams did the best \\"X-men\\" score I've heard to this film. And while I really had nothing against the way Brent Ratner handled \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\", but Gavin Hood did a better job here.<br />I know I alot of people didn't like \\"X-Men-Origins: Wolverine\\", there were definitly too many mutant characters to juggle in this story.  I am curious to see what its reboot \\"The Wolverine\\" will be like. The story of Logan in Japan with a double life is a very good and interesting story.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|super fun and addictive tower of defense game. works great on the EVO 4G.  Wish you could save progress on a level, but other than that great game.
B004ULEEY8|3.0|When I first heard about this film, I thought it sounded really cool, despite being familiar. But when I saw the final product, I couldn't help but find it to being lower than my expectations. \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" took itself way too seriously, when it should've been fun, exciting, and entertaining. And I'm proud to call myself an Action movie junkie, but I personally expected more and better from this film.  I guess for this generation if I want to see an alien invasion film where the military goes to war with them (particlarly if they're robots, like the one in this film), I'll just have to settle for Michael Bay's \\"Transformers\\" film for the time being. Say what you will, but at least \\"Transformers\\" never took itself too seriously; and  it was better than this.
1593272839|5.0|I bought this book after doing some programming in Python and C# as a way to start exploring the world of functional programming.  Haskell is an amazing language, great for exploring things like maths, but also practical outside of academics.  Miran does an amazing job explaining language concepts and making it easy to learn a language considered difficult to learn by most.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to explore Haskell itself, or functional programming in general.  I promise it won't disappoint.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Thor was a really cool movie. I think it's the absolute Best Film from Marvel Studios since the first \\"Iron Man\\" film. And that's saying something.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|I am loving this album, ive listened to it 3 days in a row at the gym. I pretty much like every song except the one with Mike Epps. Looking forward to another Slaughterhouse album, hopefully this year, the EP was just ok to me but im sure when they release a full album under Eminems label it will be real nice.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Though the subject matter may at times be too adult for a pre-teen to really \\"get\\", our pre-teen loves P!nk.  This was a Fathers Day gift for a step-papa who drives a big black truck that has seen its fair share of way too many construction sites.  Johnny Cash and Korn call this monster home, so who better to bring in than one of the toughest, most awesome female performers of this generation.  Having a female artist who sings, writes and brooks no BS  means my kid gets to hear someone who isn't showing her whoo-ha to distract from hard work and talent.  Neither embarassing to listen to at a job site for the manly man, nor too juicy for our impressionable future President, this CD compiles all the best of what is going to be a long career of rock hard validation that chicks can be beautiful, silly, irreverent and most of all, sexy without being a canned popstar.  Substance drives the listener from track to track, keeping the volume steadily going upward, so that by the time you hit So What, you'll be singing out loud planning to lighten your hair to within an inch of its life just to look a little like the chick singing about your life.  Buy this one, you won't regret it, I don't.  My only regret is that I didn't get one for myself.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I bought \\"Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series\\" and the \\"Life\\" series both narrated by David Attenborough on blu-ray.    The pictures are just stunning in quality.  Watching these in HD is the only way to go, and I highly recommend them both.    However, one thing I noticed after watching both sets of discs, is that there are a few bits of footage that are reused multiple times.  Its not a big deal, and even though I was close to dinging the product by 1-star for it, but if you go for a marathon viewing session, you will have very distinct moments of deja vu.    Even so, I still recommend both series.  These videos take you to places that are hard to imagine actually exist here on Earth - places where most people would not normally have an opportunity to visit.  Well worth the money, even if you have to sit through the Antarctica penguin scenes three or four times.    BTW, I noticed a few negative reviews regarding freezing or unplayable discs.  I am using a (relatively new) PS3 in the US, and playback has been 100% flawless...

0307272702|5.0|I was hesitant about reading WWGF because I had read \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" and figured it was just more of the same.  I could not have been more wrong. GCBC was very academic and is also a little dated.  It was not what I would call an easy read.      WWGF tells you in the foreward that it is not a rehashing of GCBC (did GT read my mind) and is also better written for the general public.  This book will help you lose weight and get healthier.  And it explains why other diets fail and why eating fat doesn't make you fat.  It is counterintuitive to think eating simple carbohydrates make you fat but GT explains how simple carbohydrates are a trigger mechanism that tells your body to store fat.    In six months I went from 230 lbs to 200 lbs and really don't feel or act like I am on a diet.  I limit my sugar and grain intake but eat everything else.  No one who eats with me thinks I am dieting.  Because I am not.  I just eat differently.    Read the book. You will thank me. You will thank Gary Taubes. I did.

B0013D8LOK|4.0|INCLUDES SPOILERS<br /><br />When I first heard the song \\"Pretty Women\\" from this movie, I loved it. When I saw who sang it, I flipped. Yes fellow fans; in this movie, John Christopher Depp the II sings! I was so shocked that I barely noticed all the blood. And anyway, most of it was shot in Johnny's face, so it was more funny then scary. The movie itself is actually really sad. People say it's scary, but if you look past all the blood,  past Sweeney's (Depp) menacing look, and past Helena Bonham Carter's crazy hair, right down in that hidden plot, you might just cry at the end.<br /><br />While a barber, Benjamin Barker, and his wife, Lucy, are out in the market with their 2 year-old daughter, Johanna, the powerful reigning magistrate of London, Judge Turpin, sees Lucy and falls madly in love. But when he sees Benjamin next to her, he realizes the maid is taken. Jealous of Benjamin, he sends him to prison for 15 years in Australia. Lucy is now his, but Lucy does not love him, so, in short, he rapes her.<br /><br />Feeling helpless, Lucy drinks arsenic with Mrs. Lovett (Carter), a close friend, near her. Turpin is now left with Johanna.<br /><br />15 years later, Benjamin is released. But in his anger, he gives himself a new, and menacing name; Sweeney Todd. Returning to London, he goes back into the barber business. He hopes his wife is still alright, and he will finally meet his daughter. But that fate is not to be. Mrs. Lovett tells him that Lucy killed herself with arsenic and that Turpin kidnapped Johanna and raised her as his own, keeping her locked up. Believing his wife is dead, and admitting that he may never meet his daughter, he felt it necessary to get revenge, by killing the Judge, but he can't. Later, a new barber comes in, intending to blackmail Sweeney. Sweeney responds by killing him. But what to do with the body? Mrs. Lovett reasons with Sweeney, saying you can't just toss people in a trunk, that they'd rot and start to stink, and then the police would come. She then suggests putting the meat from the blackmailer into her pies. The pies sell so well that she needs more meat. She asks Sweeney to help her by luring people into his barber shop and then killing them.<br />Thinking there's no other reason to live, Sweeney agrees, hoping to rid the world of people like Turpin (in his opinion).<br /><br />But is Lucy really dead, or did Mrs. Lovett lie to \\"Romeo\\" (Sweeney) about \\"Juliet\\" (Lucy)?<br />BUH BUH BUMM (couldn't resist).ould come.

0300169787|5.0|How can one describe Alexander McQueen?  His fashion was at times beautiful,and at other times quite shocking and aggressive.  I read one interview with him in WWD where he explained his take on fashion -- that his fashion exuded a \\"don't mess with me\\" attitude upon the wearer.  He was certainly a talented, and troubled individual.  This book is a tribute to his life and works.  The cover of the book is somewhat haunting, considering McQueen took his own life.  I must admit  a love/hate relationship with his fashion -- some  I love, and some I hate. He produced both sublimely beautiful and shocking and/or grotesque fashion.  What can I say?  Everybody has their point of view!  It's such a shame that McQueen took his life.  Underneath all the shock and beauty was a fragile spirit.  Adieu, McQueen!
0061784788|5.0|If you liked the phenomenal political thriller [[ASIN:1600200486 Gods of Ruin]] or anything by Preston & Child, you're going to love the latest by James Rollins. I'm a big fan of the Sigma series and I was glad to hear about them coming back home for a mission though that meant I wouldn't be able to travel vicariously through Team Sig as they traipse from Norway to Rome to Nepal.<br /><br />One constant in these Rollins treasures is the wealth of history and science that the author weaves into the story. It's seamless and feels right (like `Gods' mentioned before) and you get to take something away from each story besides some thrilling action. Also, Rollins likes to integrate multiple story lines and you never really know which character is the true protagonist. They all are.<br /><br />The Devil Colony is no different except the history is our own this time and the mysteries surrounding the story could be a big shock for the reader. This book explores the founding of the country and specifically the push westward and of course, the Mormon connection. Fascinating stuff.<br /><br />Rollins's stuff is not nearly as hokey as da Vinci Code and he doesn't get into crazy conspiracy theories. As Rollins said, the truth is pretty thrilling in itself! I highly recommend this one and if you want to go back to the beginning, get \\"Sandstorm\\". It's my favorite of the series.

However, Spacey stepped out at the last moment to film \\"Pay It Forward 2: Electric Boogaloo.\\" So instead we got this film about an actual orphan who directs wheat, to see how much it will yield. After meeting the pimp from \\"Hustle and Flow,\\" the young prodigy leaves and wanders into the woods, where he mistakes a wolf for a cello. Upon reaching the big apple, he meets Garp, who teaches him how to play acoustic versions of Tool songs on a wolf. I can't really recommend higher than five stars, because they won't allow me, but the score by Cannibal Corpse (working with famed rapper First Degree The D.E.) really boosts this film into a level of transcendence rarely seen in this era of big-budget blockbusters with no soul. The film is also filled out by U2 singer \\"Bono\\" who plays the young man's father. Pay it forward indeed.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|Simply put, a five-star read. The advice in this book is short, sweet and to the point - and all of it is relevant to the eBook market.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone thinking about self-publishing. John Locke, a man with credentials to back up his claims, should be sporting a long silver beard and a wizard's cap. His advice is not only clever, but wise.<br /><br />A pleasure to read, and at the low, low price of $4.99, what have you got to lose? $4.99, that's what, but you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />-Joe Ducie
0553386794|5.0|I had taken a reasonable hiatus from reading because I am a student and thus have enough reading on my own. But when I picked up Martin's first book, I simply couldn't put it down. It was thought provoking and engaging. For the first time in a while, I felt attached to the characters. I found myself asking a character why he would do something and literally yell at the book. That is the sign of a great author. He got me invested in the characters. Great job Martin! Looking forward to reading the rest of them.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|There has been a huge shift in Rihanna's musical style since Good Girl Gone Bad. Her music took a darker turn that hit the obvious extreme with Rated R. Her music became darker and the lyrics matched. Her voice spent a lot of time in the lower register. It worked for her in some ways, but in other it wasn't a perfect fit.     Loud is the perfect balance. It's dark, it's angry, it's dirty, and it's fun. It feels like Rihanna has fully come into her own.     Rihanna establishes herself as still being the tough force to be reckoned woman that she made herself out to be on Rated R. She takes control of her sex life and makes her desires clear in \\"S&M\\" (which isn't so much about S&M as it is about how awesome sex is, but whatever). She makes her demands loud and clear in \\"Only Girl(In the World).\\" She's sexy and confidant in \\"What's My Name?\\" and \\"Raining Men.\\" She somehow manages to be sympathetic and reasonable in \\"Man Down.\\" And yet she's vulnerable and honest in \\"California King Bed.\\"     Rihanna said once in an interview that she wanted to be making music that no one else could pull off. She might really be doing just that. A lot of artists make Top 40 songs about a wide range of topics, but Rihanna is pulling off honest, passionate songs that you don't hear a lot these days on the radio.     Rihanna has had a lot of changes in sound over the years, and if this is the sound she ends up sticking with, I wouldn't be complaining.
B004J73WZ0|5.0|The elves in the Membran workshop have been working overtime trying to figure out how to squeeze more cash out of jaded Mahler fans like myself who thought they would never buy another \\"Resurrection\\", to say nothing of yet another complete cycle of the symphonies. When I reviewed their earlier collection of symphonies 1,2,4,5,8,9,\\"Das Lied von der Erde\\" and lieder a few months ago ([[ASIN:B000GFKUDQ Mahler: Lieder- Symphonies Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 & 9 / Das Lied von der Erde]]) , I was able to resist buying it since I had many of the recordings, but this time they got me. Even though I had a couple of these in other incarnations, the combination of low price and the mix of conductors and repertoire was too much to resist. I'm really glad I waited, since the new set contains duplicates of four performances included in the earlier set (Walter's 5th and \\"Das Lied,\\" Stokowski's 8th,Scherchen's Adagio from the 10th).     Just finding out exactly what is in this new set required a bit of research; I found out about its existence elsewhere and had to dig deep before I located Amazon's enigmatically minimalist listing. For starters, five of the performances are vintage 1950s studio recordings from Decca, RCA, and Columbia which are legendary to the longtime Mahler collector; presumably they are now in public domain. I remember Kubelik's 1st as being one of the relatively few available Mahler recordings on LP back in the early 1960s before  the Mahler recording juggernaut picked up speed. Reiner's 4th, which I believe to be the only stereo recording in the present set, has always been among the top recommendations. Walter's 5th has been reissued numerous times on CD by Sony since I first encountered it on an old Odyssey LP. The Vienna \\"Das Lied von der Erde,\\" the second of Walter's three studio recordings, has long been famed for contralto Kathleen Ferrier's participation (Ferrier is  also heard here in the live recordings of the 2nd and 3rd). The Scherchen 10th has been available on DGG and Westminster. There are very enthusiastic Amazon reviews for almost everything here by knowledgeable Mahlerites; the Klemperer 2nd and the Mitropoulos 6th in particular have been highly praised. The Boult 3rd appears to be the same performance issued by Testament; the Stokowski 8th has been issued by Music and Arts and others. I wondered whether or not the Rosbaud 7th was the famous performance on the old Vox LP set which an old \\"High Fidelity\\" magazine reviewer trashed as a disservice to the conductor's memory, but that was with the Berlin Radio orchestra;this Sudwestfunk/Baden-Baden reading appears to have been issued with the 9th on a now out-of-print Andromeda 3-disc set.    Here are the nuts and bolts:     Disc 1 (78 minutes) Symphony no.1  Kubelik, Vienna Philharmonic (1953), Symphony no.10, 1st movement Scherchen, Vienna State Opera Orch (1952).  Disc 2 (72 minutes) Symphony no.2 Klemperer; Jo Vincent, Kathleen Ferrier, Concertgebouw (1951, live)  Disc 3 (72 minutes) Symphony no.3 Mvts. 1-5  Boult; Kathleen Ferrier, BBC Symphony (1947,live)  Disc 4 (79 Minutes) Symphony no.3 cont'd, Mvt. 6 ; Symphony No.4  Reiner, Lisa Della Casa, Chicago Symphony Orch. (1958)  Disc 5 (61 minutes) Symphony no.5  Walter, New York Philharmonic (1947)  Disc 6 (73 minutes) Symphony no.6  Mitropoulos, New York Philharmonic (1955, live)  Disc 7 (77 minutes) Symphony no.7  Rosbaud, Symphony Orch. Sudwestfunk Baden-Baden (1957,live)  Disc 8 (78 minutes) Symphony no.8  Stokowski; Frances Yeend,Uta Graf, Camilla Williams, Martha Lipton,Louise Bernhardt, Eugene Conley, Carlos Alexander, George London  New York Philharmonic(1950,live)  Disc 9  (75 minutes) Rosbaud, Symphony Orch. Sudwestfunk Baden-Baden (1954,live)  Disc 10 (60 minutes) Das Lied von der Erde Walter, Julius Patzak, Kathleen Ferrier, Vienna Philharmonic 1952    Hardcore Mahler fans will recognize that most of these are mono recordings and will not be the last word in sound quality, but none of them are unlistenable and most of the live recordings have no appreciable audience noise. The ten discs are boxed in individual paper sleeves in a handy shelf-space saving box. No notes, just timings and track listings. If you're listening on the computer, many of the track listings are mislabeled; fortunately the printed listings on the sleeves are correct.    Bottom line:   If you're not very familiar with Mahler your first recordings should be in modern sound; DGG and EMI have very tempting 'complete edition' sets, Solti and Bernstein's cycles can be had at very reasonable prices. If you want a second set of the symphonies with some of the most justly famed interpreters of the older generation, this one is a no-brainer even at full price and an outright steal at marketplace rates; I got my copy for around 15 bucks including postage.

B000RH0C8G|5.0|This will not become my favorite \\"inside baseball\\" book, a title which shall most likely forever be reserved for Bouton's \\"Ball Four,\\" but the behind-the-scenes look at the baseball establishment, and Billy Beane's crusade to do things a new and different way is a blast for any baseball fan to read.<br /><br />The author shares with us Beane's baseball history, through his own short-lived career through his success with the Oakland A's - managing to put together team after winning team simply by refusing to assume the existing mouse trap was sufficient, and building his own, better, version.<br /><br />Using statistical analysis of what really goes into winning games, Beane is able to play his own private version of fantasy baseball, trading for the stats which will make a difference in the standings, regardless of marquee value - and the results speak for themselves, he knows what he is doing and does it well.
1453624910|5.0|I wrote this review a while ago, but I'll post it here, because these short stories offer interesting glimpses into the lives of the main characters:<br /><br />Glimpses is a short story collection, which die-hard Nightrunner fans will be thrilled to read, because it's full of interesting details about the characters (I'm one of these die-hard fans, because I've liked Lynn Flewelling's books since reading Luck in the Shadows a few years ago). Glimpses is also a good collection for new fans, because it contains stories, which reveal several interesting things about the characters and their lives.<br /><br />If somebody hasn't read any Nightrunner books yet, here's some information about them:<br /><br />The Nightrunner series currently consists of five books:<br />- Luck in the Shadows (1996)<br />- Stalking Darkness (1997)<br />- Traitor's Moon (1999)<br />- Shadows Return (2008)<br />- The White Road (2010)<br /><br />There will be at last two more books. The forthcoming sixth book is currently called The Summer Players (2011), but it's a working title, so the title may change before publication.<br /><br />The main characters are Seregil and Alec. Seregil is a master thief and spy, who's known as the \\"Rh&iacute;minee Cat\\". Alec is a young man, who becomes friends with Seregil, when Seregil rescues him. They work secretly for Skala and do nightrunning (they steal certain items etc). Their glorious adventures take them to different places and difficult situations.<br /><br />Nightrunner books are entertaining, macabre and beautifully written fantasy books for adult readers. These books have become famous for the gradually developing homosexual relationship between Seregil and Alec, but there's much more to these books than that.<br /><br />There are several different kind of elements in these books: political intrigue, mysteries, war, magic, friendship and love. Although Lynn Flewelling's books contain dark happenings, there's also plenty of good and clever humour. These books are the best kind of fantasy entertainment for adult readers who appreciate fine prose, fantastic adventures, mysteries and macabre happenings - these books are fun to read.<br /><br />Now I'll write more about Glimpses:<br /><br />Glimpses contains the following stories (and an excerpt from the forthcoming sixth Nightrunner book):<br />- Misfit<br />- The Wild<br />- By the River<br />- The Bond<br /><br />Misfit: Misfit is a story about how Seregil becomes Nysander's apprentice in Rh&iacute;minee. It also tells about Seregil's first Skalan sexual liaison (everybody who's read Shadows Return will be thrilled to read this story, because it tells more about Seregil's affair with a certain person). It was interesting to read about Seregil, Korathan and Phoria, when they were young.<br /><br />The Wild: The Wild is a story about Alec's childhood (Alec is six years old), but it's also a story about how his parents met each other and what happened to their relationship. In this story Alec's father, Amasa, meets Alec's mother, Ireya, who's a Hâzadriëlfaie. The Wild is a beautiful, moving and brutal story.<br /><br />By the River: By the River tells how Seregil and Micum Cavish meet. Their meeting is interesting, because Micum first thinks that Seregil is a girl, but soon finds out that he's an Aurënfaie. In this story Micum is younger than in the books.<br /><br />The Bond: The Bond is a story about Seregil and Alec's first night as lovers. This short story takes place at the end of Stalking Darkness, when Seregil is an emotional wreck after the tragic death of the wizard Nysander. The Bond is an interesting and beautiful story about Seregil and Alec's bonding (tal&iacute;menios bond) and their deepening relationship. It's an emotionally satisfying story.<br /><br />It may be a surprise to readers that this collection contains erotic scenes. I knew that there would be erotic scenes in this collection, because Lynn Flewelling mentioned about it in her blog,but I never expected that she'd be this bold. The erotic scenes (there are homoerotic scenes in The Bond and Misfit, and there's one erotic scene in The Wild) are quite graphic, but in my opinion they aren't exactly hardcore erotica, because Lynn Flewelling writes about real sex. She uses nice graphic details, but the scenes are erotic, sensual and beautiful (and feelings are involved). She writes fluently and lovingly about sexual situations without preaching.<br /><br />All these stories are fascinating and well written. It's a pleasure to read this kind of fantasy prose, because Lynn Flewelling never lets her fans down. She writes exquisitely about different and difficult things (I'm sure that all readers will agree with me on this when I say that she's one of the best fantasy writers ever). I'm sure that her addictive writing style and storytelling talents will charm all the readers.<br /><br />I have to say that I like Lynn Flewelling's characters very much, because they're realistic, three-dimensional and memorable characters with their own feelings and traits. They're almost like real living and breathing people - that's why it's so easy to like them.<br /><br />Foreword by Laura Anne Gilman was an interesting essay. I also enjoyed reading \\"A Few Words\\" by Lynn Flewelling, because she wrote about the stories and illustrations. The excerpt from the forthcoming book was also interesting and it made me want to read the book as soon as it's published.<br /><br />The cover art by Anne Cain looks gorgeous and the black and white illustrations by professional and amateur artists are beautiful. I like the illustrations very much and I think that other Nightrunner fans will also like them.<br /><br />Three Crow Press has done a good job with this short story collection. It's great that these excellent short stories have been gathered into one book, because it's nice to read about the moments, which have so far been only hinted at in the books.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Lynn Flewelling's Nightrunner series, this collection belongs to your bookshelf. You won't regret buying it, because the stories are charming and fascinating. This collection can also be recommended to new Flewelling fans, who haven't read all the Nightrunner books yet.

B002ZG994U|5.0|The A-Team was one of my TV serials from the 1980s, along with Airwolf, Quantum Leap, Tales of the Gold Monkey, etc... that mixed adventure, action, drama and romance with a large, mostly male cast full of bad guys in high places and good guys in secret hideouts.  Few made it to the big screen, and many thought the A-team would never get a full Hollywood production.  But it did, and it came out very well.  Featuring the same characters as the original show, though updated to take place in the decade of Operation Iraqi Freedom, this movie is full of plot twists, character twists, gunfights, fistfights, ludicrous dialog, ridiculous action scenes, and all of the familiar hallmarks of the TV series, except overblown in every way possible.  The casting was spot on for all the members of the team, along with all the villains of the movie.  Clocking in at just around two hours in length, the movie has several climatic action scenes, hence moving the story along at a brisk pace.  Who are the villains in the movie?  Well, they are a combination of all the villains of the TV serial; drug lords, rogue military brass, the CIA, private military contractors, etc...  Overall, a great movie worth multiple viewings.  Probably the best part of this film is how it shows the origins of B.A. Baracus' fear of flying.
0316069353|3.0|This is the first time I have had to say I am disappointed by a Michael Connelly book. I have been a fan of his for many years, but my opinion of his latest book, The Fifth Witness, is that it is a snoozer.  The author uses the current economy and home foreclosures as the base of his story.  It made for a muddled mess of political ranting and long, drawn out explanations.  Mickey Haller just didn't appeal to me as a main character (he's no Harry Bosch) and he just doesn't have any depth.  For me the plot had a hint of about half a dozen other books I read recently, only it moved much more slowly.
0811870413|5.0|Stumbling upon Tartine Bread at my local library, I borrowed and read it, more quickly and thoroughly than I usually do with something picked up on impulse, and was inspired.    As someone who never made a dough of any kind before I assure you that even a determined newbie can turn out very acceptable loaves of Peterson's master recipe - the \\"basic country loaf\\" - in a matter of days; yet spend weeks on this one introductory lesson getting properly acquainted with capably producing a naturally leavened loaf.  I progressed quickly to the rye variation and a very good pizza crust.  I'll continue to work with this book (which I've now purchased), even as I move on to others.    This is not the compendium on bread that Hamelman's book (which I am now tackling as well) is.  I spoke with a very good professional baker (you'd probably know the name) about Peterson's method, and he mentioned that Jim Lahey from Sullivan Street Bakery is the guy who came up with the dutch oven approach employed for the country loaf.  Read Lahey's \\"My Bread\\" and you'll see a very similar product (editorially) and approach (tutorially).    Having purchased Tartine Bread, I'll surely own Hamelman & Lahey's books before long, and I'll mention Peter Reinhart's books along the way.  Perhaps I'll graduate to Calvel someday.  In the meantime, my foodie friends are quite complimentary of both my basic country loaf and the rye version, and I'm looking forward to producing Peterson's baguette soon.

B00475AUWW|5.0|Steven Pressfield makes a complex subject simple and easy to understand. The book created many 'ah-has' for me as I read (always a joy when that happens). After reading his book - I look at resistance through more patient eyes. Instead of letting it (resistance) call the shots, I simply recognize it for what it is and move on.<br /><br />Pressfield's writing is straight forward and no-nonsense which leaves the reader with no doubt or confusion...a skill that is most welcome in this world of complexities. A must read for everyone...strips the veil off of why we react the way we do, and gives us a strategy for changing that reaction.
