B008L1DNGI|2.0|i am not to satisfied with this game...i only played it once but my grandkids have played it and they were not too thrilled..with it...
B006MW3UZW|4.0|We have enjoyed the 1st and 2nd season of Downton Abbey. It is a well produced historically set soap opera, the integration of WW1 into the show has improved it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|i really love this game..it is fun and you can enjoy it..always trying to beat your time on the next puzzle...i have fun play on the kindle
B007REV4YI|5.0|very, very fine entertainment - Daniel Craig is so very good - acting great throughout.  Fabulous! the Scottish finale setting was awesome.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Writer Julian Fellowes has an absolute command of the history and cultural upheaval of the period, and an uncanny ability to communicate it to a contemporary audience. I have gotten many people hooked on this series, and deservedly so.<br />Alfred R. Newcomb
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie first, then got interested in the books... Man, I'm hooked! I love them! Wish they could make a new movie with all the details :p
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I love this movie. One of my favorite Christmas movies. It's clever and witty. And visually appealing. Would love to visit Whoville! lol
B0091REZMW|3.0|There is not enough action in each round unless you want to pay for it. What you can play is fun and challenging.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Don't like the ear plugs and these work great for my workouts! Hope I can still find them when I go through<br />The ones I've bought!
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Needed some humor while recovering from terrible car accident. Tootsie fit the bill! Terri Garr & Dustin Hoffman were adorable 25 years ago
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|Good tracks but poor graphics and needs better controls. Has a lot of advertisements that bother you while racing. Not as fun and is boring!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|never saw this classic film - we all enjoyed watching it over the holidays. Now know why it's a classic
B0086700CM|5.0|Perfect game. The graphics are terrific and wild how it never ends. As the the score gets higher the game changes. Wish the enviornment could have changed but is still a good and addictive game.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|This was an overwhelming experience to read this book.<br />It is  so long that in the chapters near the end, you think of chapters from the beginning of the book as a distant past...<br />The book is as good as the 1st in the trilogy: &#34;Fall of giants&#34;, but it has more deaths and sorrow than the 1st one.<br /><br />This is a kind of book you can leave aside until you complete reading it all.<br />It was so exciting, happy and sad in the same time.<br /><br />Catharsis at its best!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Brilliant work on the graphics and new temple. It's not the same like the first. You have zip lines and carts. It gets better and better. Great work!
B003VANOFY|2.0|UPDATE: The lifetime of this product is about one year of regular use. After one year there was a problem that started when moving the mic up and down also changed the system volume (basically simulates movement on the scroll on the side of the headphones). Shortly after the mic stopped working entirely. It was still under the 1st year so Logitech replaced it.  Now the replacement is developing problems. Sometimes only one headphone works, until I shake it a bit.  I also own another one. It is developing the mic problem (moving mic also causes volume change). It no longer mutes when the mic is all the way up. It is probably only a matter of time before it fails completely.  2 stars.   Original review: The first one I got had bad batteries and didn't work at all. Amazon sent a replacement promptly.  The one I have now is good, but not great..  Pros:  -Good battery life. -Comfortable -Durable -Good range -Noise cancellation is good  -Driver issues. Sometimes G keys and volume control stop working for a while. I've noticed white noise sometimes. I suspect driver issues here too. -Mic sometimes doesn't unmute the first time you bring the mic boom down.  EDIT: Apparently you can't use the provided drivers to change the wireless channel on this...this issue is again related to Logitech pairing great hardware with mediocre drivers. If you live in a crowded area like an apartment building, full of wireless networks and wireless devices, you're going to wish you had that feature because of interference. It is reallly bad in my apartment. I'm starting to look into something I can do to fix this...either I will go visit all my neighbors and offer to help them change their router channels, or I will look for 3rd party drivers or anything I can do to change the headset wireless channel. Additionally, the noise canceling support was bad or nonexistent on my Mac...normally I use the headset with a Windows PC but once I needed to record some audio with my Macbook, and discovered Igot less white noise by just using the built-in Macbook mic, so that was disappointing. Finally, the power button is sometimes unresponsive, and I have to try it a few times before it responds.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use a Kindle Fire HD and I find it so easy to use this app. I use it multiple times a day, just because there are so many neat ideas on here.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Good music, Good songs, Good performances, with a good cast IMHO with an entertaining presentation. I'd recommend people see it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed watching and am looking forward to Season 3! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a little history mixed with lots of drama and great actors.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very interesting information about wheat and all the health problems created by consuming the wheat of today. Everyone would benefit greatly by avoiding wheat as much as possible.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Who would've guessed I'd like this entire series.  Kept my interest and had lots of twists/turns.  Like CSI with some thinking out of the box~  Very enjoyable!
B00821PCJS|5.0|did get to see it very much when on tv so i like to be able to watch it when i can or feel like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game. It makes the time pass quickly when you have some time to waste.it could use some different levels earlier on to make it easier for those of us who are slower but still like game
B0091TGWYE|1.0|Within the first few hours of use, the covers stitching came loose. Will return the product. The fit is also a little to snug.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I bought this game for my son to play on my kindle fire. My son loves angry birds and star Wars so buying it was a no brainer. This is a very cute game and my daughter and I like to play it also.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this game daily.  It helps with strengthening my cognitive skills and memory as I have MS thanks.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|At first I was not going to read it because I thought he shouldn't have written it due to security issues.  But my curiosity got the better of me.<br />It gave me a new appreciation of the Navy Seals and how much training they have to do.  I did enjoy the book.  I did not give it a 5 star because it was a little slow in the beginning; but it got better and I enjoyed reading the actual mission to kill Osama.<br />They are some very brave men!
1592407889|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is so much more than a \\"Mommy Dearest\\" or a a Hollywood tell-all book.  Interviewers have asked Ms. Parker why she wrote this book.  Obviously, she wrote it because she had a very unique and entertaining story to tell us.  Although Ms. Parker shares some very painful memories with us, most of the book is very upbeat, and is infused with a good deal of humor.  I highly recommend this book.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|If you would like to witness cinematic storytelling at its finest--storytelling which makes you feel born again in its wake--please, dedicate the next two hours of your day to this brilliant masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Showgirls\\" tells the tale of the starry-eyed, spunky young dancer who hitchhikes to Las Vegas to become [SPOILER ALERT!] a stripper. Her heart is filled with the same idyllic fantasy that all little girls dream of: becoming the lead in a topless dance show at an off-the-strip hotel. Surprises are in store for our tragic heroine, Nomi, however--she soon learns that the life of a topless dancer in Vegas is not all it's cracked up to be. Beneath the romantic veneer of glitz and fame, behind the swaths of adoring fans, she is surprised to find a seamy underbelly of crime and corruption. In Vegas, of all places!<br /><br />The less sophisticated viewer might not be able to appreciate the avant-garde nature of the film's narrative arc, finding it \\"disjointed\\" or \\"incoherent\\". If this was your impression, however, you are simply not a part of the elite upper echelon able to appreciate the genius of director Paul Verhoeven. The fact that plot developments are introduced suddenly and without warning; scenes that appear to have no relation to one another appear back to back; characters are dropped inexplicably from the story--this just proves how brilliant the creators are.<br /><br />The stellar acting only serves to accentuate the complexity of this art film. Perhaps the most poetic line of the entire film was spoken by the female lead:<br /><br />\\"I like having nice tits.\\"<br /><br />This is far from the only brilliant soliloquy in the script, however. Other gems of effervescent prose include the statement by the owner of the strip club where Nomi used to work, upon discovering that she has moved up in the world:<br /><br />\\"It must be weird not having anybody come on you.\\"<br /><br />And let us not forget the sublime beauty of the romance which develops between Nomi and the club manager. Their relationship takes a thrusting turn towards the passionate side after he saves Nomi from a rapacious client. After an interminable scene of the two characters staring at each other with their faces a centimeter apart--the 85th such scene in the film--Nomi presciently states, \\"You go for it, don't you.\\"<br /><br />The stark, gritty realism of the film keeps viewers engrossed in the story's development, at no point threatening the structural integrity of the \\"fourth wall\\". The producers clearly went to great lengths to research the minute details of the film's backdrop, presenting an astonishingly accurate depiction of the world in which Nomi lives, breathes and strips. For instance, when a character falls down a flight of stairs, her condition is presented in detailed terms which only a medical professional could have provided. A paramedic arrives at the scene of the accident and, after raising the dancer's leg and staring at her bruised and engorged knee, states: \\"It's her knee.\\"<br /><br />The works of Dostoevsky, Twain, Bronte, Tolstoy and Hugo combined cannot hold a candle to the narrative complexity of \\"Showgirls\\". Perhaps the only oeuvre which comes close to the film's smooth  narrative flow and compelling dialogue is \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\". After you have watched the rise and fall of Nomi, the dancer, you will raise your head to the Heavens and exclaim, with a great shout, your thankfulness to the constellations for blessing you with such an engrossing experience.<br /><br />[See here for my review of \\"Fifty Shades\\": http://www.amazon.com/review/R32IZSQ7WT9N99 ]
B000HOMU98|5.0|Very good movie. Clarity in Blu-ray is watching it in Hi-Def. Pretty realistic. Lee Ermy adds a lot of realism to the bootcamp scene. Probably could use some more battle action, but is highly recommended for viewing.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I have enjoyed Marvel comics  ever since I was a child. The stories are clean and crisp, the ultimate good vs evil.I enjoy the Marvel comic hero's
0062515675|1.0|This book was remarkably missing the main points of Buddhism.  I was disappointed.  It was a self improvment book with no real wisdom to share about how to accomplish all the tasks that were set out.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game, its my favorite to play on my kindle fire!! username is PandaMONIUM play me if ur bored!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is definitely a character story and not plot. It's not something that I would think that I would like, but I do!
B00821OX98|5.0|This really is a very well written and well done sci-fi series. I love that the aliens are shown in the first episode and the realistic special effects are outstanding. The series has great characters which you want to know more about. You also never know who will die or be victimized by the invading aliens. The humans situation in this post-apocolyptic world is truly desperate. The contrast between human optimism and pessimism is wonderfully demonstrated. Most fascinating of all, are the conflicts between the different groups of humans. Who do you trust? As if the aliens weren't bad enough.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This show is very good at juggling multiple storylines and keeping them all interesting. Its an interesting look at england before WWII
B001NLKT60|5.0|A great book!!!! I loved the series so far!  A lot of characters and places to get straight but a great mystery so far.....
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked the story line. The intimate parts got me tired. But for the rest, I liked it a lot.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Friends and family told me of this games. hours of fun. And it makes one think about different angels too.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Excellent movies. It didn't matter that I am a fan of Anthony Hopkins. The movie itself was great. The characters as well as the story kept me on my toes.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Title says it all. A friend told mr about it and yes i would highly recommend this to others.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It definitely kept me wanting the next one. I couldn't wait to buy the second book. I loved the psychology part of it and how it kept me asking the why of things.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Brilliant app I . First used on my kindle fire. It was so useful I also downloaded it on to my android Samsungphone.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It kept me on my toes. The intimate parts tired me out a little but the story was interesting for me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|An engaging gamebthat is harder then it looks. Easy to loose yourself for an hour trying to get just get a little further.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is amazing. Kept me on my toes. It has excellent story line, characters and vocabulary. I have it with 5 stars on my kindle library.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its so fun and easy my 2 two year old son plays it and my husband and and I have to take turns with him. we've wasted hours playing it its so fun. recomend it for all ages
0345803493|3.0|only reading because i bought the entire series at one time and now I have to read it - Did not love it
B000MCADQ2|5.0|I had forgotten how great this album was and I had a blast hearing it again. The LP was in excellent condition and sounded like new.
0345803507|3.0|book nothing special - very disappointed was just a love story with a touch of s & m in it nothing spectacular
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I am currently separated from my husband of 12 years. We have 2 small children and before reading this book, I saw no hope for the two of us, our relationship was toxic and we definitely weren't showing eachother love. After reading this book, I have all the faith in the world that we can successfully love eachother in the language the other person speaks. I never realized how unloved my husband would have felt, but since he is an \\"act of service\\" person and equates love with a clean house, or coffee made for him, his lunch made before he goes to work, etc, he was definitely feeling unloved because none of that was important to me. Now that I know the love languages and have passed the book onto him, I know we will be successful in loving eachother until we're old. If your marriage is failing, I highly recommend this book and if you have a happy marriage, reading this book certainly won't hurt anything, it can only help if you're willing to read and learn from it. It's an easy read, it doesn't read like a text book, there are stories I know I could relate to and now I can't wait to show my husband in HIS language how much I truly love him
0345803485|3.0|did not enjoy this series at all - a lot of hype and was so disappointed it did not hold up to its reputation at all
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Didn't realize that I couldn't remember seeing some of the first season episodes.  Great programming for the entire family in my opinion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great adventure that was an easy read and I loved it!!<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who needs an adventure and a bit of romance of their<br />own! :)
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Of course love their hit song but enjoy the entire album as well. Makes me want to buy their original album....
B007THA4FI|5.0|I put off reading this book because of mixed reviews. I'm so glad I finally decided to give it a chance. This book shines a light on middle class-small town hypocrisy & prejudice, as well as the \\"under belly\\" of society. You will finish this book with a heavy heart & you may look at yourself a little harder in the mirror. Good on you Rowling......good on you!
B0037NVM1I|5.0|I love this movie and the experience on Amazon was better than I expected.  Picture and sound were excellent even on my medium DSL connection.  Will take advantage of this again in the future.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I loved the origianl series of Upstaris Downstairs.  This new season brings Rose back to the house, withe new owners and a new staff.  If is wonderful to be able to watch.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|I only watched a few episodes when this was originally broadcast, and I'm enjoying it now.  I think I would enjoy anything starring Amanda Tapping!  The picture and sound are good for an old broadcast TV show.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is another must see family classic Christmas movie, it brings all the Love, Wonder and Magic about the Christmas season to life.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I started off really loving the book because it grabbed my attention and held it until the end. I thought the end kind of just fizzed out. Wish it went in another direction.
B001AQT11M|4.0|This is another must see Disney classic for any one that hasn't see it or for those who haven't see in a long time, great family entertainment
B0015DWJX2|4.0|Great book, very heartwarming and interesting. Love the history of the Germans invaded the Guernsey Islands. Never heard of the Island before and love history.
0800141849|5.0|A great movie with a great cast.  Barbra Streisand is wonderful and it is a great story line/love story. I highly recomend this movie
B003VIWO9I|5.0|Terry Pratchett continues to enthrall and delight in the latest Tiffany Aching book.  It is simultaneously thoughtful, funny and insightful.  I cannot recommend his books enough.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Only wish there were more of these type of family value Christmas movies made today. This trully is a classic loved by anyone that waches it.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I have read this book before, and love it so much I had to read it again!  Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett make for a sinfully hilarious duo.
B00335EQ0E|4.0|An all time Disney Classic, it is just one of those all time must see movie, would highly recomend to any one who hasn't seen it or to anyone that has not seen it for a while
0679882820|5.0|The book was in perfect condition!  It's a smaller book, made for chubby little hands to hold.  I admit that I went through the book and read it. Reminded me of when I was a kid.
B005LAIGQE|5.0|A Great family movie and based on a true story that bought our country together on the fate of a trapped dolphin family, even got Russia involved
B008A36R2Y|5.0|I have been using this for a while now and I love it.<br /><br />Easy to use, program and VERY versatile!<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this purchase!
078881172X|4.0|I Bought this as a Christmas Gift and was able to also watch it .  A great Disney classic, highly recomended
6305428042|5.0|This product shipped pretty quickly. I bought it as a gift for somebody. The product is what I thought it would be.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Love baseball movie and this one was very good. Was interesting to see how a team was put together in a way that no other team had done.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to use and FREE! You can't beat that. It does all that I needed it to do.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is sure to become a classic, great story Sandra Bullock and Betty White were great. Story line is great as well as the beautiful scenery
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Really good book. Hoping there's a second one to wrap up some loose ends. Would enjoy continuing in her life.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Another classic Barbra Streisand movie with great story line and wonderful soun track. A must see for all Streisand lovers.
B00AQKEPMI|3.0|There are many good things going on for this film. It's very touching and emotional at times and will probably make you shed a few tears. The animation is fantastic, with some amazing and beautiful effects such as those from the Sandman. However, one thing that really bothers me about the film is how quickly and easily the boogie man was defeated. Everything was going well, but then it felt like they just ended the film in a sudden moment. For what was suppose to be the climax of the film, the final battle was a bit too quick and lackluster for my taste.<br /><br />Despite the rushed ending, it's an enjoyable family film, and kids will have a great time watching it.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />The Boogie Man was at his strongest, having practically the entire world fearing him, just to be defeated when a few kids say they aren't scared. His defeat just happened way too quickly to make any sense to me.
B0099114WO|5.0|A great movie, especially for married couples that have been married a long time, helps to bring a little love and romance back into a marriage
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such an adorable little game. I had a horse in Mexico but she was so old and  past away :(  I kid you not the first horse given looks just like my Kelly! So it brought happy memories. And the game itself is great quality and easy to follow ! Don't get bored of it &lt;3
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I've read Discovery of Witches three times and found something new each time. If you're a fan of this genre, I highly recommend it. You will simply fall in love with Diana and Matthew!
B007SGM084|5.0|I had NO problem reading this trilogy a second time. It keeps you right there in Ana's and Christian's live until the end Good book!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I love action shows and this one had a lot of that. Stalone does a great job at giving action shows
B00846REIS|5.0|When I started this book, I was blown away .Just imagine how Mr Cross handles himself when he wants whatever he wants. It keeps you reading!!!!
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|I love horses anyway and I do not like to see them hurt. This movie was amazing on the horse part
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|It was a good movie lots of action based on true story Excellent!!!i  savages was aussome would tell all my friends!
1449410243|5.0|I didn't know the online comic strip that this book is the collection of. However, I loved the simple animation and cat insights that this book provides. It's not one to read in one swoop but rather to enjoy in small yet potent doses. I highly recommend this to any cat owners. I bought it for my Kindle and also in hard copy as a gift to a fellow cat owner ^__^
B008HTQ28K|5.0|I have read most of John Grisham's books and have enjoyed them all - but this one was different as it was not set in a court room and it kept you guessing right until the end
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This story has a lot of controversy around it (the kids killing kids thing) but is a great story of a government gone wrong and doing what it takes to survive.
B00006LLLN|5.0|The best, wonderful music, Allison krauss the angelic voice, some of the best music I've ever heard, very captivating, I could listen to it over and over again.
0399157565|1.0|I've read all the Scarpetta novels and the last couple have been disappointing to me. The author's writing has changed in my opinion. I forgot how disappointed I was in the novel before this one, had I remembered, I would not have bought this one. The verbiage now is convoluted and too scattered, too many irrelevant subplots, to much misdirected drama. Somehow the thrill of forensic discovery and deductive reasoning leading to believable conclusions seems missing. I read about 2/3 of this one and gave up, I had lost interest, and will not be following any further Scarpetta adventures.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much!!! So good that I bought all three. I am on the third one and don't know what I will do when its all over. :-(
0061478784|5.0|The book was amazing,<br />the package arrived safely, and I managed to get hold of the book as quickly as possible.<br />Diana Wynne Jones is a gifted writer for sure
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Have you ever dreamed of traveling in time? To another place, another epoch? Most people have, and it is only natural. We wonder how life would have been in the last century, or in the Antiquity, in Rome, Egypt or even Paris?<br />Woody Allen must have had that fantasy, too, and he has the means to at least put it onto celluloid, so that he can share it with us. The story line is lighthearted, and that is a good thing. After all, fantasy travel is not real! In this story, our hero tackles more than one issue: his personal life (should he or should he not marry his rich-Daddy girlfriend?), his professional life (should he remain a fast-writing Hollywood slave or become a serious author?) his life style (Malibu Beach or Paris?)...<br />and luckily for him, the time-travel fairies smile upon him, allowing him to slip into the 20s, and meet now famous people, whom he admires, in person, helping him reflect on the goals in his life and solve his conundrums.<br />I can assure you, if I had a chance to meet Picasso, Monet, Rodin, Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway up close and personal, I'd be gone in a heartbeat! All these celebrities and some more are portrayed very nicely, and the photography of Paris most beautiful sites and sights is extraordinary. Woody has a master's eye for that!<br />I enjoyed very much to let Woody walk me through the streets of Paris as if I had been there in person!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so realistic. I love the graphic details. The best part us that this game is free! So all those horse lovers better go our and download this game...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|this series is so engaging and not something i originally would have thought i would have been interested in. check it out! excellent!
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I love it and have seen it at least a million times, no movie could possibly be better than this
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you want a wonderful, romantic and suspenseful read from an unexpected writer read this book.Stephen King is a wonderful romantic..who would guess? For all ages, especially for those who might want to revisit the past.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a journey to a different world with more suffering and you can really feel or connect with the characters it has romance action all in this book I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B003INBOEM|5.0|Enjoyed it a lot and watched it several times already<br /><br />You must watch both IP Man & IP Man 2 together to appreciate the full story
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is en enjoyable game.  It has wonderful. Graphics and good.clues.  I am going to recommend this game to.all of my family and friends.

B002ZG98UK|1.0|I'm not going to say much cause theirs not much to say. But I will tell you that the live action RE movies went really downhill after apacolypse. Their's really no plot in this movie, just pointless mess. The acting sucks and they did a really good job screwing the live action series. Please don't buy this trash.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Good clarity.  Exercises are stimulating.  Trainer is easy to follow. The exercises are challenging.  This makes exercising easy when traveling.
B008476HBM|4.0|I READ  the book some time ago and then saw the movie and wanted to refresh. My memory. It was just as good as I REMEMBERED.
B006H5120E|2.0|Finally watched movie.  There were 2 separate spots on DVD that stopped the movie and was very hard to get it playing again. Missed parts of the movie because of it.  No reason for a new DVD to do this.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I'd heard Doctor Who mentioned in various contexts over the years but didn't pay much attention.  When I saw it on Amazon Prime I gave it a try and boy am I glad I did!  It is fun, quirky, sometimes scary and some great acting.  Sure the aliens are a little cheesy, but that's part of the fun.  Christopher Eccleston is a great Doctor- I wish he would have stuck around longer, but David Tennant is hard to beat too.  Give it try (watch a few episodes) and you'll be hooked too.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|One of the best games I ever played!(20 years gaming). I can't wait for a PERSONA game for the PS3
B006MW3UZW|5.0|How refreshing to be able to watch a soap opera that compliments, rather than insults, our intelligence.  Highly recommended for all.
B00B3MN65K|3.0|I've been a Josh Groban for some time. Closer is my favorite. I like this album better than Illuminations but not nearly as some of his earlier work.
B000FC1JEO|3.0|Fast Read, not funny or it was it an assumption it would be do to his profession. Read it for a book club.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|The English really know best how to produce a Jane Austen movie.  A story for the whole family.  So well done!!!!
B0042J6VUS|3.0|We had to buy two of these because the first one quickly broke.  They are made of cheap plastic with a very cheap tripod.  That being said, for mounting the iPhone on a good tripod, this little item can't be beat for the money.  Just be careful - it is delicate.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|I really enjoyed this true life movie!!  To know it  actually happened is very moving. I thought the characters they chose to play the parts, was very welled planned!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|AS A VIETNAM VET I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO KNOW SEVERAL SEALS AND HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR THEM AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD OUR FREEDOMS.  THIS IS A NO HOLDS BARRED AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A TRUE AMERICAN HERO.  IT IS SO SAD NOW THAT HE LOST HIS LIFE IN SUCH A BIZARRE ATTACK AFTER SURVIVING ALL THAT HE WENT THROUGH IN IRAQ.  A MUST READ.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|He sounds just as good (if not better) than he did on American Idol!  This entire CD is awesome and is 100% Phillip Phillips.
B00821OX98|5.0|Kept our interest  with lots of very good characters and acting. Got us all hooked in spite of it being unreal or surreal. Actually unreal in plot. But they somehow manage to make plausible!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game and very fun, but my daily challenge isn't working.  Please fix! Otherwise, it's great. Very addicting and very fun. It has never glitched on me (except for the daily challenge) it is a very good game for its for its price, free. Great app for kindle fire.
0345803485|4.0|I can see why women like books like this.  It gives them a totally unrealistic situation in which all their sexual desires are met. It's a little too unrealistic though, if you ask me.  But I feel that it could be good for women in relationships to read since it'll satisfy all their sexual desires and then they can go back to their &#34;boring&#34; life and still be content.  If that makes any sense.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I actually loved the whole Trilogy!!  Very good story, very well wrote!!  It didn't end like I suspected it would. But I really did like the ending.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|I did enjoy the CD but not blown away. I wasn't dissatisfied because I purchased as a gift. Overall, the CD has that typical smooth jazz feel. Not bad..just not WOW.
1416550550|5.0|I managed to read this book in less than a week, which is saying a lot since I do not get a lot of time to read.  I could not put it down.  Morton keeps you wondering how the ends tie together.  There are a few sub plots that she does leave unresolved, but I would re-read it in a minute!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Very tastefully done, very human, outstanding acting and an important subject many people are probably unaware of.<br />Really brings home our humanity.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Well worth the money. Very complicated . Requires memory and deductive reasoning. Several glitches need to be fixed.  Took 3. Days to complete.
1616890835|5.0|A wonderful collection of oral histories about an under-appreciated form of communication. The numerous accompanying photos are insanely vibrant and really bring the subject matter to life. This is definitely the kind of book that will force a person to be more aware of their visual surroundings as they move throughout a city.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to our new favorite show.  Easy to access on Amazon Prime! Great actors and fabulous costumes!
0765325950|4.0|I was a little disappointed in what felt like a rushed ending to a story that has spanned over 14 books.  It felt as though the prologue could have been a bit more verbose.  It seems as though it is short as to allow for additional books...
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Always entertianing, well thought out and easy to follow.  Ferris writes about things I've always wanted to learn or try.<br />I wonder what he will do next...
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is a fantastic and well designed game. The concept is simple but puzzles keep you on your toes as you progress. Along with the fun game play, I was very pleased with the art and design of the game. The soundtrack is also a well done, relaxing and pleasant, just how a dream should be. Well worth the purchase.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a dramatic show!!! i went ahead and check the authenticity of this show and find out it is not biographical. Very dramatic, upset with the season ending.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a story that draws you in from the first pages.  I read the entire book in 2 days.  Lavinia and Belle gave me a glimpse into what life was like for them that I had not thought about before reading this delightful book.  My daughter told me to read it - so I think it has generational appeal as well.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Great plot line and acting.  The characters are unique and complex, which makes it easy to get sucked into the storyline.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|First of all, I will say the same thing as many other people. There should have never been a part two. The producers of this movie could have tied everything up all in the first movie, and not bored everyone with all the pointless stretching out of Harry's avoidance of capture.<br /><br />The movie was enjoyable if not anti-climatic as was the ending of the series. Okay, not many authors have been able write such a long series, that have been turned into movies. Although you could go to a library and you will find hundreds of books with sequels.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Seems as though Tina has just filled the pages of this mildly amusing tome with a certain detachment. I became quite bored at the repetition of how exhausted she is at  juggling work and family. So What?! This is not a unique situation for thousand of women....just get over yourself Tina!  This seemed to have been written with the purpose of merely getting the thing finished. Her book is padded with a lot of whiningly and annoying complaints. Did she really just try to squeeze out enough pages to make this book long enough?? I get the impression that her editors had to push for input from Tina in order to fill the pages.  Love her work. Hated her book. The 2 star rating is for me, quite generous.
B009A87ZQU|4.0|Love it. Many people thought this movie was to bleak. I tend to think they grew up on either Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan's versions of James Bond. To get to the original feel of the movies, pick up Ian Fleming's books to see how gritty and slightly sadomasochistic they really were. That said, I really enjoyed the re-boot of the James Bond movie franchise with Daniel Craig.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I wanted a good game after searching all day.When I played this game I loved it.There is no doubt adout it this game is the best I- have ever played in my whole life.

B0069JBKHI|5.0|We travel with it, and my wife watches the baby from work while I work at home.  When I travel--anywhere in the world--I can log in and see and talk to baby.  My only request is a desktop app so I can watch on my computer screen while working.  It works great, though, and the sound and light fixtures help with sleeping in the crib.

B0036T31YY|2.0|The movie kept getting stuck.  It was so annoying to watch.  The movie itself was okay.  I don't know if its just me, but I didn't get the ending.  I don't wanna spoil it.  I had to think about it, but it just didn't make any sense.  The peices don't fall together as they should.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Again, got this book and the recommendation of my daughter, a book blogger. It is based on the fairy tale Cinderella, but is so much more. Cinder is steampunk, future scary, and totally enthralling. I've already snagged the second in the series, Scarlet and that does not let up on the plot twists and new revelations. Buy it!

1451695187|5.0|I was fascinated by Dr. Alexander's description of his journey into the after-world.  I accept his story, but I am not sure if I would call it &#34;proof&#34; or &#34;heaven.&#34;  I think he has offered strong evidence that there is life after death.  He is convincing and clear.  I appreciated his sense that he was called back to earth to let us know that we are loved and we are all connected.<br /><br />I liked the fact that he is a neurosurgeon and a scientist, but was able to come back after his near-death experience with the vivid awareness that there is much more to this world than just the &#34;material stuff,&#34; but that consciousness and spirit are real.

0785163174|3.0|This is a fun story. In the kind of way that a Arnold Schwarzeneggar movie is fun, meaning fun to watch, but not much in the way of story. A lot of things came off as rushed to me in this. The art was awesome, but good art with a so-so story doesn't mean much. There's a forward written by WWE Superstar CM Punk who is a long time comic fan, that's pretty cool if you follow wrestling. Professor X's death came off a little clichéd. We saw him die so many times already I just couldn't care less when it happened. I remember when he was shot in the head during \\"Messiah Complex.\\" Thought he was dead then, but he was back next issue. He's not back yet, but expect that to last all of one year, maybe two.<br /><br />I like what they're doing with Cyclops after the events of this book, but in this book he just comes off as a tool. The whole Phoenix story is frankly tired at this point. It was a great story in the 80's, but this is 2013. Some things should be put to rest after a while.<br /><br />I'm beginning to ramble, so I'll just repeat the \\"this book is fun.\\" IT's a fun read, but if you're somebody who likes a very good comic story, this might not be for you. I give it a 3 because I enjoyed it, just wasn't immersed by what was happening. Plus the whole hero vs hero thing is a too recent idea for Marvel to be doing it again so soon. Civil War was just 6 years ago, so I think it's a little soon for Marvel to be yelling, \\"CHOOSE A SIDE!!!\\"<br /><br />I think the reason this story suffered is because Marvel's burning themselves out on all of the big events. There's just one after another. Civil War, then Secret Invasion, followed up the next year with Siege, then Fear Itself, then Avenger vs X-men. If you notice, the quality has declined each event. There was a big build to Civil War and the pay off was pretty awesome. Great build towards Secret Invasion. Siege was so-so at only four short issues that had little in the way of major character development. Frankly Fear Itself was terrible in my book. Now we have this so-so story. Frankly Marvel needs to take at least 5 or 6 years break from major stories and just build towards something eventually. Then the next big event will be amazing. But with Age of Ultron coming this year, I don't see that happening.

1611134226|2.0|The basic plot was interesting but just too far fetched.  I listened on CD and finally, just started fast forwarding...too laborious.  Their first two or three books had a little supernatural and the plot was believeable without being forced.  I'm tired of Aloysius Pendergast.

1907590331|5.0|Of Mice and Men, a book written by John Steinbeck, is a book about how agricultural workers suffered during the Great Depression.  When Steinbeck wrote this book, ranch workers were slowly beginning to be replaced by machinery.  Steinbeck portrays the lives of two migrant workers George Milton and Lenny Small.  George is a migrant worker who dreams of having his own ranch someday.  Lenny is also a migrant worker who is infatuated with soft materials and petting soft animals.  He likes petting soft animals so much that he keeps a dead mouse in his pocket.  This behavior is due to his intellectual disability.<br />Throughout the book, George watches over Lenny.  He reminds Lenny to let him talk when the boss or the boss's son, Curly, asks questions.  He also tells Lenny who he should stay away from.  He does this because he wants to protect Lenny.  He also wants to protect him because Lenny wants to be a part of the dream of having a ranch with George.  George has allowed him to be a part of that; however, since he's allowed him to be a part of that, George doesn't want to risk losing that dream because of something Lenny did.  Needless to say, George loses his dream anyway because Lenny killed Curly's wife due to his strength that he was unaware of.  George does what he feels is best and shoots Lenny in the back of the neck.  He knows that if Curly finds him, he'll kill him inhumanely or torture him.  George now is forced to stay at the ranch since he won't have enough money.<br />Lenny is accepted in this society to a point.  His strength comes to an advantage for him when it comes to working.  People don't seem to bother Lenny that much, except of Curly.  Curly used to be a lightweight fighter and feels that he needs to fight everybody that's bigger than him.  Unfortunately for Curly, he decides to hit Lenny.  At first, Lenny doesn't do anything, but when George tells him to fight back, Lenny ends up crushing his hand.  Here, his strength is a disadvantage and cancause harm when he doesn't even mean to.  Luckily for him, Lenny is embarrassed to admit that Lenny crushed his hand.<br />I would use this literature piece in my classroom.  I would have it a part of an English/Reading lesson if I were in a class with the same students all day.  If I were in a middle school, I would make this a part of the unit plan directed towards certain themes, such as loneliness, powerlessness, dreams, and even barriers.  I would also discuss how Lenny's name is ironic to his strength and disability.  His name, Lenny Small, does not describe his size or strength.  It describes his childlike traits due to his intellectual disability.  These are a few aspects of this book I would discuss with my class.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|Rebecca Hamilton's `The Forever Girl', surprisingly, thoroughly and deeply hooked me into its vortex of a tale about love and painful longing, set against a world contaminated (or should I say made more interesting) by paranormal phenomena. At the heart of the story is, of course, a girl named Sophia--the pariah of her own small town. And is if it isn't bad enough, she is hounded by a self-proclaimed \\"crusader\\" against evil and noises (voices?) in her head that serve as the first clues that something's up.<br /><br />And when Sophia finally finds some answers to her lifelong questions--answers that turn out to be double-edged--she begins to use her long-latent powers just as when she's starting to make sense of her real, unique, if weird place in the world. She encounters beings outside normal reality that ranges from truly strange to exceedingly sexy--the latter makes the story a much more compelling read.<br /><br />If you're a fan/believer in Wiccan, you should know the author painstakingly describes Wiccan ritual, which excellently serves to provide some emotional/spiritual resonance to the events of the story and also lending a startling sense of honesty and authenticity.<br /><br />Overall, `The Forever Girl' is a delicious read, a guilty pleasure, something you take with you to curl up in a corner on a nice afternoon. It has been compared to the `Twilight' series, and for good reasons, but I assure you the writing's better, and the book pushes all the right buttons. The author, Hamilton, also has a knack for snappy, unforgettable dialogue, which left me chuckle and laugh out loud and basically continuously turn the pages. Seriously get this book and see.

Of course their final solution boarders on hilarious and leaves you feeling upbeat and chuckling.  Good acting and i refreshing sense of the ridiculous.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|I love this cd, I never got into Within Temptation before, but I can't stop listening to this one...songs get stuck in my head.  the DVD 3 short movies are interesting, not sure I get the concept completely, but the music is rockin'.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Written in language that is easy to follow whether or not one has medical training.  It reads like  an historical novel, with drama playing out page after page.  Having had first-hand experience with cancer I wondered if I had the guts to read this, and I am pleased to say I do and I did.  The author is a craftsman.  He made the study of cancer and its researchers come alive.  It gave me an...  appreciation for the enormity of the disease and for those who are searching for treatments in the lab.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Breakthrough rock album with unique qualities to balance the retro roots inspired rock.  If you are older than 40 then this album is bound to make you remember riffs from bands from the 70' and 80' but the KEYS are truly modern rock artists with no other comparison to present day music.  After listening to it for many months now and appreciating its qualities to evoke emotion all that I can hope is that these two guys from the midwest 'keep it real' and remember their roots.  Don't stray guys and definitely don't let the music industry machine alter your beings.<br />This album reminds of the days when I looked up from my high school bed and watched the sky turn purple and listened to entire albums from beginning to end like Jethro Tull or Led Zeppelin or Jimi Hendrix or Blood Sweat & Tears or ELO or The Moody Blues or U2 or Deep Purple or Blue Oyster Cult or... well you get the idea.  I am sure you could apply the same logic to groups from another period 10 years later like The Red Hot Chili Peppers.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Incredible use of historical elements in a fictional narrative.  Very earthy and &#34;lived in&#34; like &#34;The Stand&#34; without the length and the freakishness of that book.  If you every wanted to know what it would be like to go back to the late 50's / early 60's and try to fit in...this book is your ticket...and with lots of intrigue.  The story draws you in and instantly you are living in that era.  Great read!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a pretty fun game.  It's can be very addicting at times. I would recommend it to my friends
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'll admit that after the first few pages I wasn't really \\"into\\" the book, but after Sky meets Dean...sigh...I was captivated indeed.  The author does a wonderful job of reeling you in...and then you don't want to leave the book.  Finally after reading for a few hours, her description of the food being cooked by Dean forced me to set down the book down and eat...otherwise I'd probably have delayed another few hours.  I truly enjoyed this book even though it covered many horrifying topics.  Great hero + great story line + great dialogue = two thumbs up:)

B003TT2X72|5.0|Anyone who's seen TLOTR knows its amazing- especially in Blu-ray.  For those of you who have yet to experience this amazing story, watch it on the biggest screen possible and in Blu-ray.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am not one for love stories and I believe Nicholas Sparks is a love story writer - now I could be completely wrong from my estimation, but this book was so much more than a love story.<br /><br />The book moved along perfectly from the beginning - providing just enough detail, but not getting caught up in detail.<br /><br />Half way thru the book - the story really picks up with suspense building, love building, and the reality of what it might be like to restart a life over.<br /><br />I was touched by the wife who died - and just the thought of accepting her husband having to start a new life...this is where most my tears developed.<br /><br />I only had wished, I knew more about the life happily ever after - but i guess I already know it was normal.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|You cant help but love these characters. the actors & acting are incredible- story lines always fresh,<br />Best &#34;crime show&#34; on t.v.

B00009027K|5.0|I first heard YES in 1973, a freshman in college. Someone was playing THE YES ALBUM..who is that?  The more I heard the more I knew it was a magical piece of work. I saw YES live in 1973, CLOSE TO THE EDGE tour, I was forever transformed that night. I now own all things YES, but my early memory of hearing YOURS IS NO DISGRACE and STARSHIP TROOPER still burns bright. Those songs opened my mind to the wondrous possibilities that music can become. The YES ALBUM is a great introduction to YES, a must have album for all YES fans and those that are seeking the beautiful journeys that YES music can take you on. No 3-4 minute songs, heck some YES intro pieces are several minutes long, but that is the point. Some journeys take time, enjoy the time, go with the music...it will guide you.<br />The three core YES albums that should be in everyones collection: 1. The Yes Album 2. Fragile 3. Close to the Edge<br />Those 3 albums alone should have put YES into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Shame on them (R & R H of F), when someone says Prog Rock..well Yes is what started it all.

0765325950|5.0|Hey This book was great and truly lives up to the high bar Robert Jordan set in his previous novels.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This watch was exactly what i was looking for. Being in the military, i like to have a timepiece that is practical and durable, yet still have a bit of class to it. This watch is excellent. I like the fact that it is a normal size and not the size of a pocket watch on your wrist. The automatic movement works great and as long as you are somewhat active it keeps great time. I would definately recommend this watch to anyone.
B005WTR4ZI|3.0|The title definitely communicates a &#34;us versus machines&#34; and therefore the anecdotes further down reinforce the point again and again with a whole lot of statistical publishing gathered over the years and across a variety of industries. The point of view falls flat with a lot of &#34;paint the sky&#34; thoughts on how to &#34;race with the machines&#34; instead of &#34;against thee machine&#34;.<br /><br />I did not see much of &#34;systems thinking&#34; being applied to the &#34;possible solutions&#34; world and therefore feel that the right perspective has not been built for such an amazing topic of interest.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Great movie, great way to show how Batman became Batman. Christopher Nolan is an awesome director. His trilogy is just spectacular.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Time killer, as that it works good. I would get it a again for sure.  You should too.  Free is good.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I read this book just days after the author Chris Kyle was murdered by a PTSD-stricken Marine (or so says the press). While it isn't a literary masterpiece, it does offer a glimpse behind the scenes of SEAL operations in Iraq. Are there better stories out there? Yes. But in light of the very last chapter in which Chris explains his desire to help other ex-servicemen and women as they try to integrate back into a civilian life, it put everything into perspective. Due to the timing of my review and Chris' death, it would not be appropriate for me to criticize his book. My sincere condolences go out to the Kyle family for their loss of this hero.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Was a very good season but the William Bell in Olivia line was not very good. Ready for season 4.

B005QPMB2Y|5.0|If your looking for Swannview for your Kindle Fide hd this app will do the job beautifully until Swann releases swannview for the kindle fire. I have used it with the first gen kindle fire and the kindle fire hd and they both worked great.<br />Setup was easy, took about 5 minutes to setup 4 cameras in the local network.<br />I'm still trying to figure out the internet settings to view outside the local network but that has nothing to do with this app.<br />I tried out the free version of this app and it worked great so 10 minutes later I purchased the full app.<br />Give it a try if you have a security camera system.
B000002AVF|5.0|I love Mariah Carey's music from the first ten years of her career and I think this album epitomizes the best of that time. Not only do the hit singles that catapulted this album to the multi-platinum seller and infamous Grammy-nominated status that it was capture her at her best, but the album's non-single tracks are just as good... Really!<br /><br />\\"Fantasy\\", \\"One Sweet Day\\" and \\"Always Be My Baby\\" were the official singles that were released in the U.S. and the production is state of the art and her vocals soar to the fullest. All 3 of these singles are catchy and classics of the 90s that capture the R&B/pop/emerging hip-hop sound that was on the radio in the mid part of the decade - \\"Fantasy\\" is an upbeat, pop masterpiece that has elements of R&B; \\"One Sweet Day\\" is a timeless ballad which pairs Mariah's soulful vocals with those of Boyz II Men who were also at the top of the charts during this era; and \\"Always Be My Baby\\" is a sweet song that lends itself to R&B fare as well, while still remaining poppy and radio friendly. I can't say enough how good her voice sounds on all 3 of these songs so it's no surprise they were all hits on the radio. \\"Forever\\" was a radio-only single but is another classic ballad song that showcases Mariah's excellent vocals and range.<br /><br />A few of the other tracks were also radio only and got some airplay on rhythmic and R&B radio - \\"Underneath the Stars\\" and the Journey-remake \\"Open Arms.\\" \\"Open Arms\\" is probably my least favorite song on the whole album because there isn't much to it and it's almost impossible to ever top the original, although she sounds great. \\"Underneath the Stars\\" is one of my favorites - her voice so soft and luscious over the laid-back, groovy sound of the song. \\"I Am Free\\" is a classic Mariah ballad that could have been a radio hit solely based on her soaring vocals. \\"Long Ago\\" also sounds like it was possibly intended to be a single - with it's R&B sound, Mariah sounds confident and sexy throughout.\\"When I saw you\\" is good, although not one of the best on the album - acceptable, though, if nothing else, for her pitch-perfect vocals. \\"Melt Away\\" is one of my all-time favorite Mariah Carey songs, just like \\"Underneath the Stars\\" - they are both sensual love songs.. \\"Melt Away\\" especially. Her voice is in the lower range on this song which fits perfectly with the theme of the lyrics. The last track, \\"Looking In\\" is an eerie track that captures perhaps exactly what she was going through during this time in her life behind closed doors in her marraige that eventually ended not long after the release and promotion of this album... very convincing.<br /><br />One of the best things this album has going for it is that all the songs tie so well together, not only by sound and production, but also the content. It's an album about love and relationships on multiple levels. There are a handful of songs on her about breaking up or splitting apart but they still have a positive spin on it (\\"Always Be My Baby\\" and \\"Forever\\"), so they fit well with the happy, falling-in-love tracks (\\"Fantasy\\", \\"Melt Away\\", \\"Underneath the Stars\\", \\"When I Saw You\\", \\"I am Free\\")... and then of course tracks that explore maybe a deeper, darker side of love - losing a loved one (\\"One Sweet Day\\") and feeling trapped and depressed (\\"Long Ago\\")...<br /><br />I recommend this album to anyone who was listening to pop and R&B radio around 1995-1996, or someone who wants to hear Mariah before she sort of underwent the metamorphosis into the huge superstar diva that we know today.  Also I have to say once more - her vocals sounds so perfect and crisp and fresh on this album which is why I think it's her best one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! Absolutely loved it!!! It's an easy read and very fun! It's not a book that you really need to put much thought into its simply for your enjoyment!
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|This movie is about a pilot who has a drinking and substance abuse problem. Denzel does a great job portraying the role of an airline captain who is a functional drunk. Not an easy role to play. However, this movie is mainly about substance abuse and how people with a substance abuse problem live in denial. The story about saving the lives of passengers and the dedication by airline employees to passenger safety gets lost. A movie worth watching once, however like the movie Jaws, it may make you think twice about ever flying again.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I read it while I was in middle school for the first time! If you are in the 6th grade these books are great!
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|I bought this game for my kids for Christmas, and upon opening it discovered that even for me (a 35 year old woman who loves a challenge) this game was frustrating more than fun.  My kids, ages 4, 6, and 8 couldn't build most of the designs, and ended up extremely frustrated.  I stepped in to help, thinking that I, an adult, should be able to build these when the game is rated for ages 5+.  Well, think again.  The blocks are built in something like an I-beam style, so the longer ends of the blocks are open.  This makes it virtually impossible to stack anything on the long side of the block.  This ends up in getting nothing built to completion, everything falling over mid-build, and no fun for anyone.  I would suggest Mattel send this game back to the drawing board and redesign the blocks.  Then, yes, this would be a really fun game!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I got this game a while ago. I loved it! but then I go on it and it started me over! all my progress and coins are now GONE. I am very confused as of why this would happen. VERY upsetting.<br /><br />unicorn lover OUUUT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are nice. The game is simple and straight forward, but easy to play. I really like this game.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is a helpful app for anyone needing an organized place for their words and drawings. Very happy with it!<br /><br />Only downfall is that there are ads on the bottom.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|It was on time and what we ordered. We started are collection a while back ago now sorry for the late review. We did find the pricing to be a bit higher than we can find at our local video sales here in town though and the Special Edition after the first season isn't really needed.
B0037QM8YA|1.0|This was nothing like I thought it was and was very hard to follow and to understand the consept of the movie. I dont know if it was because I only watched it once or what...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is really realistic with its brilliant graphics, accurate noises, and activities. If you love horses and wish you had one, this app makes you feel as though you have one and puts you in the riding saddle and helps to develop your knowledge of horses! It is really good quality which is free!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I bought the UK version for season 2 for the same reason as I did for season 1.  It had more scenes and I want as much of it as I can get.
B0058W74UY|5.0|I really appreciate this added feature.  It is a feature that brings improvement to many other apps that I enjoy.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Reminded me of a mix between The Catcher in the Rye and Curious Incident in the Life of a Dog.  I would've liked it more if there wasn't an Epilogue that explains everything and attempts to tie everything up in a neat little package.  I guess I just liked the ending without the Epilogue because it felt forced.  However, I enjoyed the last scene of the book (in the tunnel).  A quick and enjoyable read.  Charlie is a well-developed character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP!!! So fun xD it rocks would<br />Play it the rest of meh life look LOVE it xD
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works fairly easily, and haven't had any trouble so far.  Plus it lets me play Civ V on my Asus tf300.  Nuff said.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good, I'll give it five stars. I wish there was a little bit more to do on it though.. but still, it's pretty good :3
B005LAIGP0|5.0|I'm not one for scary movies, but I'm a big Daniel Radcliffe fan, so I sucked it up for this one. (When I saw it in the theatre, I did, indeed, take my blanket to hide under... just in case) I read the book beforehand, and was surprised at some of the literary changes that were made, but once I got past those initial discrepancies, I enjoyed the heck out of the suspense and getting the pants scared off of me.
1400067820|5.0|\\"Antifragile\\" is a book that is difficult to summarize. I'll try to mention a few major ideas. If they come out confusing, it's my fault - read the book :)<br /><br />Unlike many books of this genre, which spend 200 pages padding a 5 page idea, Antifragile is a fractal of a book, taking it's central ideas and examining and applying them in myriad ways. In that way, it as rich on page 400 as it is on page 2.<br /><br />Taleb is an independent thinker who is almost impossible to categorize. In fact he revels in question some of the most basic assumptions of modern life. There are times I find him pompous and nearly conceited, and times when you realize that in going after the people and ideas that he does that he needs a very thick skin a quite a bit of confidence. He backs up views with layers of research and technical material. When I find him at his best though, is when he takes an idea that you've taken for granted and finds a dozen ways to show you why it's farcical.<br /><br />If you've ever seen him on television or on video, do not take that persona as the one in this book. Although he defends his style, I've found his public appearances on the whole pretty awful. I saw him on Fareed Zakaria's show the other day, and even though I was 3/4 through his book, I could still barely understand his points. Taleb though, would say that's by design - that by having to work for understanding, his viewers are forced to stay for cognitively engaged - I don't buy it. He is a much better author than he is a speaker, and he probably likes it that way.<br /><br />\\"Antifragile\\" is about fragility and it's converse, antifragility. In fragile systems the benefits are small and visible, and the the side effects are potentially severe and invisible.<br /><br />Taleb illustrates the basics of fragile/antifragile with the example of package to be shipped. If you were to pack glasses in the box, even carefully, you would still know that the box would not respond well to disturbanceslike being dropped or mishandled. Glasses are fragile. If you were to pack a steel cube in the box, you would have no such problem. Drop it or whatever, the cube is \\"robust\\", not changed by disturbances. However, imagine if there was an item you put in the box that was improved by disturbances, that was made stronger or more capable by being mishandled. That is the true opposite of fragile, or as Taleb refers to this property - antifragile.<br /><br />What are real life examples of antifragility? Evolution for one, functions better when being put under stress. Entrepreneurial ventures too, are made better by an uncertain environment, because they are organizations designed to learn and change from stresses. Sometimes, a system is antifragile, even though it's components aren't; organisms might die because of stress, but the entire ecosystem is made stronger over the long run.<br /><br />A key point he makes is that in our rush to help, fix, or support system - in short, *do something*, we often make systems more fragile in the long run. One of his primary examples is medicine. In our efforts to make relatively small improvements to peoples lives through intervention, our health in the long run becomes more fragile, subject to the long term effects of drugs and therapies, and by the lifestyles that continue to enable.<br /><br />His point is that you bet on the most tested system, and the most tested system we know of is Mother Nature and evolution. Anything we do needs to be judged against systems that had millions of years of stresses. This is not to say that modern medicine is a bad thing, because when it is helpful, it is *very* helpful, but when it it used for relatively minor improvements, the risks outweigh the rewards.<br /><br />Because of this, he is a strong advocate of intervention by subtraction. Instead of finding better cures for diabetes, modify diets to remove sugary foods. Indeed, stopping smoking has been one of the most successful medical interventions of the last 40 years. He introduced me to the term iatrogrenic - making things worse by doing something.<br /><br />The essence of the Black Swan - the event that is so rare that it's never been observed (or maybe maybe never occurred) before, is the fallacy that the absence of evidence is evidence of absence. These are not the same thing. However, we often treat them as synonymous, until something totally unforseen happens. And that's part of the point. Unforseen events are not failures of prediction - they are simply unforseeable. We need to ready our systems that we cannot anticipate - that is, built systems that are at least robust, and that are hopefully antifragile.<br /><br />Finally, he feels that the major cause of fragility in modern life is lack of \\"skin in the game\\" when one set of people become antifragile and transfer the fragility to another set of people. Some examples include managers of large corporations who do well no matter how their company does or the effect it has on the general economy. Writers and pundits who push views but have are in no way affected no matter if they are right or wrong. Politicians who enact complex policies but who are in no way affected by them, and who in fact use this complexity to become highly compensated once they leave office.<br /><br />This last point should especially be taken to heart. Keep an eye out for who is saying and doing things, and how much stake they personally have in whether they are correct. If the answer is zero, or even worse, they are betting against themselves, then they are not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Overall, this was a book that made me re-evaluate who sets of assumptions I've made about how the world works, which for me is the ultimate test of any book of this type. It's not an easy read, and there is material in there to challenge almost any reader (philosophy, mathematics, business, economics to name a few), but it is well worth the trip.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This was a good fantasy book, completely unrealistic and not what I was expecting, but entertaining nonetheless. The plot was decent, would make a good Hollywood film.
B003OBHZ3W|2.0|I was disappointed to see that many of the performances I wanted to see were not included in the Amazon Instant Video version. (61 minutes runtime vs the DVD version at 154 minutes runtime) I did not compare the runtime of the Instant Video against the DVD when I was shopping for this video but I will in the future. Looking at the product description and the graphics it certainly implies it is the same content as the DVD. Had I known this was an abridged version I would not have bought it.<br /><br />The performances that are included are all good, some are very impressive like David Gilmour and Gary Moore. When you see the end where they have the huge mega jam you'll see a lot of performers not featured in the Instant Video version and might ask yourself why they are onstage for only one song at the end. Well as it turns out they played during the concert, and played well, but their performances were cut from this video. Spend a few bucks more for the DVD, it's much better.[[ASIN:B003OBHZ3W Strat Pack - 50 Years of Fender]]

B00A8ECU24|2.0|At first I loved this game. My 5 year old daughter &amp; I would play it together. But you have to have friends to get hearts so we made some sent the request. the request were accepted but they are not showing up. I reported it twice with no response. they only responded to another problem. and thats the thing there are other problems. it is a great game concept but gameloft does not have it running right. I will change my review if it is fixed.

B001UGB1X8|4.0|Wasn't great, but very good. I watch all Tommy Lee Jones movies. Was not disappointed. Old guys still hit hard!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Best mars book I have read.  Filled with a lot of science and very plausible.  Lots of action.  A real page turner.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|This is one I paid to download several months ago. It did not completely download and half way through the movie,<br />it quit. The whole movie was never there to see to start with. Is there anyone to complain to about that to be re-imbursed?
B005Q1W0ZQ|1.0|I was not able to play the DVD. This DVD is the wrong region settings for the USA, making it impossible to play on the average Blue ray DVD player. Very disappointed.
0399160450|5.0|this is a lg book--over 600 + pages--very techno orientated--alot of which has to do with computers and such equipment. a great read suspenseful,
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Mr.McEwen is such a good writer, but he takes so long to get to the gist of his tales.  It becomes so, so boring.  He just goes on and on and on and on..........I found myself wondering what the story was about,until about 100 pages into this book.  I was so tempted to forget about finishing it. But onceI start  something,I have to finish.  This could have been about 100 less　pages。
B005PK56TA|5.0|It keeps you on your toes!!  The best cable series I have ever seen!!  I'm excited for season two!  Watch it!
B00003CXAT|5.0|Dude, it's Jurassic Park. Who on this Earth doesn't love Jurassic Park? And in widescreen format? Shut the front door. Yes, please!
0312330863|5.0|I love all of these books and know most of them by heart I never get tired of reading them.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|There's nothing really surprising here, it's a typical Woody Allen flick: great scenery, a writer obsessing over stupid things, and a main character that has dialog that is meant to sound like Woody.<br /><br />This one is great if you love Paris, because the scenery is so beautiful (and there's plenty of it) that you'll forgive the other parts of this movie which aren't so great.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I read this for my book club. I thought it was written for teens. It completely held my attention all the way thru.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|It really felt like the graphic novel had come to life.  Wonderful story and artwork!  This was bought for my boyfriend who is the ultimate Batman fan and he loved it.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Where's my perry is an ok game. It gives me something to do and is kind of entertaining when you don't have anything else to do.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've been searching for a good book since some months ago, found Gone Girl and simply loved it!<br />The way it's written between his and her history makes it easy to read and to imagine all what was happening in their life.<br />Don't miss it!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I went to see this movie and I really enjoyed it. I would definetly see this movie if you love musicals. There are only a few words spoken but the rest is singin. I love the characters in it. I love the songs. I just bought the soundtrack and love it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I thought this was one of the better hidden object games. The story was interesting and it was challenging but not to challenging to figure out where to go. The challenge games were hard but not to hard where you want to give up. I would like to see a sequel.
B00881VLCE|1.0|have some of these magic puzzles on my blackberry tablet and love them. many more offered here and lots of them free! great deal and great puzzles. wish blackberry would take note.<br /><br />Update has just finished. All the puzzles I have purchased have disappeared and I can no longer make this app work on my kindle. Am devastated, and feel like a fool for paying for all those puzzle packs!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Beside the fact that Halestorms songs are amazing, the CD was also in great condition and was everything the seller claimed it to be and more. I would definetely recommend this to any Halestorm fan!!!! I love it!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a great love story and one that everyone should read. I can't wait to see the movie as well!
B00881VLCE|5.0|a blast to play. my grandkids. will love it.  heck so does there grandma.  ok 20words is too long to write.
B002N44XSG|4.0|This book, according to me, is the most essential book in the series. It provides the background of all the characters and their way of thinking. Overall, it is a must-have book.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|You will love this book even if you're not a runner (yet)!<br />Fascinating stuff. The best book I have read in a long time...
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I am a HUGE Bruno Mars fan and this album was AWESOME!!! So go buy the album right now people!!!!
0143122010|5.0|I could make some critiques, but compared to other books in the field they would be unsubstantial nitpicking, and others would probably choose different complaints.  I personally skipped past some parts about torture, I've heard it before and though I'm sure the experience is worse, hearing it again isn't fun.  Otherwise, the fairly technical yet intelligible use of statistical methods, as well as the broad historical expanse utilized, made this a very interesting book that I recommend highly to anybody interested in modern politics.
0307595579|5.0|I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he loved it. We read all the books together and these hard cover books were very sturdy and awesome. The only gripe I have about it is that the pages/binding is sort of ugly. the pages look uneven, haha. but other than that, the series itself is great and I don't regret this purchase.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Great movie to watch with kids. We watched it over and over and over again.<br />We love Adam Sandler movies.
0393057240|5.0|I watched the movie first and its in my top 5 favorite movies list, so I decided to read the book. The book is awesome, if you give yourself the time to get through the accents but it just adds to the book experience. I highly recommend.
B008K9UZY4|3.0|This app is great but not really for beginners it is a little challenging but its ssssoooooooo fun! Its a must have for sonic fans!
B000HLDFM2|5.0|Got the tin and it looks so cool on my shelf. I love the movie, and I hate the fact its being remade for American audiences, no doubt will be whitewashed and not as brutal as this version.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great!  Must read when you have no interruptions.  All you need for a rainy day and then some.  Enjoy and pass it on.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Yea, awesome badges. Simple, cool, well made. I have no complaints whatsoever. They're even the right size so you can just tack it anywhere.
B006JPML7K|4.0|My kids all enjoyed it...I did too!  It was a good sequel to the first.  It wasn't a down grade from the first as they usually are.
0393327345|4.0|watched the movie first, and of course loved the movie. the book is very much like the movie, and you don't have to read the book to watch the movie. but if you're like me and you love to read, I highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the best thing since sliced bread or temple run or some other cool thing this makes at least 20 right?
B0051QIGP4|3.0|it has some good songs but Lady Gaga is getting a little too much for my tastes. She's old news.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Hello all, Did you love the 80s? If so, you will love love love this soundtrack!!! It has all of the greats and you will catch yourself singing out loud everytime you listen to it! I turn my car radio up as loud as it goes and just rock out, not caring who sees!!!<br /><br />Let me just say that Tom Cruize sings amazingly! I have not been a huge fan of his the past few years but he did a great job in this movie and he sings the songs AMAZINGLY!!! (Almost better that the original) So great to have soooo many great songs all in one nifty spot!
0307454541|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It starts off SUPER super slow and it really drags but once you get past all the financial mumbo jumbo, it gets really interesting real quick. the second book is the best though.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|its works fine and is easy to use and great to keep in touch with friends. I use it in a daily basis. get this app!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think that everyone who enjoys Greek mythology would love this book. Rick riordan is ny favorite author. You ricj
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. All if the dash games are good. I think that I like the counter better than tables though.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Fans of the original &#34;Total Recall&#34; will have a very different take and the ability to compare.  I on the other hand, picked this up because a) I like Colin Farell on screen - he can be intense, fun, and cocky, b) I like the tech-period of this brand of scifi.  This production is almost the partner to Spielberg's &#34;Minority Report&#34;: a &#34;in the near future&#34; kind of scifi, not the &#34;we're trying to blow your mind&#34; or &#34;this is totally out there&#34; kind of scifi.<br /><br />The upsides of this movie are:<br />1) it keeps moving.  Not really much downtime.  The producers use quieter moments to pull their conceptual &#34;wows&#34; and their up moments for the action &#34;wows&#34;<br />2) Visually diverse.  There are small venues, like clubs and apartments and then there are rooftop chases, mag-car chases, and some city-scape views.<br />3) Real scifi - although the headline concept is memory manipulation (the Rekall thing), there are other scifi aspects that are explored that relate to the plot.  The tech stuff pops pretty well (the phones, mag-cars, intra-planetary train, etc).<br /><br />There are some downs for scifi fans - I will try to explain sans plot spoilers.<br />1) remember the rules of your scifi elements, they may dictate the plot predictably<br />2) hydraulic despotism is always predictable.  Let me define - hydraulic despotism is the control of everything through a single source.  Good example is the Phantom Menace/Independence Day plot holes: blow up the mother ship and all the babies die.<br />If you can identify a source of hydraulic despotism (by the way, a Frank Herbert concept from the original Dune), then you know that you know that you know that the writer intended for it to be key to the plot.<br /><br />These two elements made the movie much less of a mystery than it could have been.<br /><br />Final synopsis: fun movie, good era, relatable tech-level, good plot, average twists, not mind-blowing.<br />This was fun, but no nearly on the same page as the first Matrix or Inception.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|This was my first exposure to Joe Bonamassa after watching part of his special appearance on a PBS fund-raising TV station.  After reading reviews of his music online I decided to order this CD, and it's become one of my favorites.  It really showcases his vocal range and guitar virtuosity.  I always take this one with me on road trips so I can turn it up and sing along.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Daniel Craig makes a great Bond, but unfortunately the writers aren't up to speed. There are great action scenes, great visual effects etc. But what lacks in this Bond, is what made the older Bonds so unique. There was no romance and there was no great \\"one-liners\\" by Bond(which were often humorous, to say the least).And the music was just OK. Now \\"View to a Kill\\" and \\"Living Daylights\\"(to name just a few) did it all.  Skyfall was entertaining, but wasn't something I'd care to watch again.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|It was a very good happy entertaining movie. I enjoyed it very much. I would recommend this movie to anyone
B005EWDA9M|5.0|With time, Haruki Murakami has only gained momentum as a creative talent. 1q84 is an exquisitely layered master work that never fails to maintain the suspense of a good story. As usual,his ability to weave magic into realism is so seamless it feels natural.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is great, it has more action, more adventure, and more excitement. I'd really recommend this game to anyone that loves any one of these things.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|Diana has some great keyboard chops . Would have loved a more traditional Jazz Album .  love the  other Canadian jazz composer ,singer Brigitte Zarie , Michael Buble etc .  Another great record is Harry Connick Jr. new cd.  Also a more artistic approach . Not his usual Jazz . Just as Diana is trying to do here .I understand the industry forces these artists to make changes in order to remain currant and they have bills to pay . I still love her and her talent is not to be denied.
B00AVIPXKI|5.0|I love all the underworld movies but this one is by far my favorite. Great picture and sound. Loved it.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I loved this book a lot and i enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />I like the idea of a vampire falling in love with a human (with special powers).  But I think it's also interesting that the people chasing after her are also a part of the group that the Vamps are trying to get.  It's a thrilling romance that makes you fall in love with all of the characters.<br /><br />My only issue is that they only knew each other for like a few days and they want to get married... it must be love at first sight then?
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Sure, Sorkin takes some liberties to tell a compelling narrative, but it's a great movie Fincher directs.<br /><br />The blu-ray has some good extras on the movie and a bit on making the soundtrack for the NIN fans out there.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time on television, however I came in halfway through the movie.  Later, I watched this for class and instantly loved the vivid colors the director used for each &#34;memory/story&#34;.  It also gave a small view of the old days with a ruthless emperor and the assassination plot for him.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed the flying fighting scenes :-)
B004T4KQJS|4.0|This book tries to describe the latest findings in cosmology, in a way that tries to answer how the universe happened to pop into existence out of nothing. Perhaps you've heard of the Big Bang theory. Well, this book tries to explain what we know about where the Big Bang came from. What was there before the Big Bang? Was it nothing, and if so, how did something arise from nothing? Believe it or not, Science now has answers to these questions.<br /><br />I loved the book, but it is partly written as a response to God people, so at times I feel like it is engaging in a debate that I don't care about. I've already decided that I'm somewhere between agnostic and atheist and I don't care. I've listened to the God people, and I've decided their faith is illogical at best and dangerous at worst, so, I've moved on. I don't need cheerleading from other agnostic atheists or atheist agnostics to feel good about myself, or to defend myself against the Catholics et al.<br /><br />OK, that said, the book is a fun read, and it was exciting to learn about some of the most recent discoveries about dark matter, dark energy, the inflation of the universe after the Big Bang, whether space-time is flat, closed, or open, and stuff like this.<br /><br />It even gets into the theory of multiverses, and tries to explain how our own universe could be just one very big example of how quantum mechanics -- as a matter of course -- allows matter and antimatter to blink into existence out of nothing, and then inflate to enormous 10^28 orders of magnitude larger size in less than a second, before exploding into 100 billion galaxies.<br /><br />And it is Science. Not theology. Evidence based, and he explains some of the evidence. Theories that have supporting evidence down to several decimal places.<br /><br />This alone was worth the time and the price of the book, I sped through it in just a few days. The anti-religion stuff, maybe you'd like it, maybe you'd find it a turn off. I just don't see the need to muddy a great Science book with repeated bashing of Religion, but in today's America maybe Science has to do some punching back once in a while. Last I heard, a majority of Americans still don't believe in evolution.
B000I9YWN4|5.0|Wow, this is a super movie. download it on my iPad 2. only good movie are load on my iPad 2.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game has pleasant graphics that scale well to a large screen without getting in the way of gameplay. The controls are intuitive and accurate, and their introduction is handled without breaking the flow of the game.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Love this movie! Came quickly, and newly sealed just as the description said! Definitely deserves full 5 stars! I recommend.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|I actually passed on Season 1 of American Horror Story when it originally aired, but I watched the entire second season. After that, I had to go back and see where it all began. Having watched about half of the first season now, I can understand why it got so much buzz.<br /><br />I'm not much of a fan of horror. I don't like blood and guts for the sake of blood and guts. This show, however, I've found is not over-gratuitous with the gore. It is, however, chock full of weirdness, mystery, suspense, sexual tension, and character and story development. While still certainly not for the squeamish, I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys the strange and macabre and to anyone who enjoys a twisted tale of mystery and intrigue.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I loved it, I strongly recommend this book if twisted is what your looking for. Beautifully written, but slow starting out
B0081336FO|5.0|Awesome show!  Great pace. Cumberbatch is amazing!  This is an excellent modern take on the Sherlock Holmes legend!  Do yourself a favor and watch it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My husband died  last Sept., and I found this book to be a great comfort.  It was well written.  Even those who are skeptics of life after death would have a hard time disputing the fact that death is not the end after reading this book.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I think this is a good app the downloads are a little slow but it's worth it you should get this app.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Shows what you may not want to know, but NEED to know.  Amazing that this is where our food really comes from and who controls it all...
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is so cool but a little pricey at 6.99 but still is worth it but it randomly makes you start over from the beginning
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It let me do all the things I wanted a non-apple tablet for:  especially adding flash.  So glad I found it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|the game is fun but every week or so it resets everything but my highscore, the game is very fun and would be better if it didn't do that, is anyone else having the same problem as I am
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Terribly boring and annoying having to go out and catch two of each species (unless you cough up real money).  I want a zoo game more like zoo tycoon (original or 2), where you build a zoo without silly chase gimmicks or &#34;mini-games&#34;.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I play this every evening to relax.  Great game.  When I finish all the levels. I just reload the game and play them all again.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Love the graphics and detail, but more horse variety would be nice.  Maybe some randomization of the horse coats? That could help.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Great movie and the kids love to watch it over and over, it has instantly become a Disney classic for years to come.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I heard Emeli on Ellen and her voice really grabbed my soul. Before she quit singing I was on Amazon buying her album.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|It starts out slightly slow but it's very worth it to stay with the movie.  As soon as the character is developed then the action starts and continues for the rest of the movie.
1401322786|4.0|Wonderful way to explain how time came to be...Dor and Allie are memorable characters. The contrast between Victor and Sarah also adds to the story of time. Mitch Albom delivers once again!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I am a death angel, helping people cross over so I read most things in this topic.  The doctor was pretty through and I liked the fact that he followed his son’s advice about writing of his experience before researching any other info., which made his story pure.  js
B008Q08580|3.0|This movie starts out good.  it is entertaining and then it turns into a 48 hours mystery.  You start to think you are watching a news program rather than a thriller.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|I have seen this movie countless times due to the fact that my 2year old is in love with robots.  It is a good movie and great to watch, lots of action
B006M3JVD6|5.0|Jaycee is a very strong girl, now lady. Its a sad story wha Jaycee went through and I hope she feels better by writing here story. You are a fantastic women may the rest of her life be full of happiness.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I have seen this movie a lot.  My 2year old is crazy about all of the avengers, separate and together.  It at least is good to watch
B000FA5TTW|4.0|Kind of confusing at times but a good book nonetheless, not as bone chilling as I'd hoped it to be
B007UXT6T6|3.0|I liked the action but I didn't think that it was the best in the series, but at least it was better than MI III
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This thing manipulates electrons like its nobodies business. I usually build a new gaming rig every 4 years, and this is by far the most noticeable speed jump since I went from 75 MHz to 233 MHz in the 90's. (I went from an Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 Conroe 2.4GHz) Anyways, I love this thing. It cuts through large file encodes and handles data processing with ease. It also handles all recent games at max settings (Borderlands 2, Far Cry 3, Dead Space 3,...)

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|this book is very interesting . After rading first page i could not put it away. Cannot wait until the end how the whole story turn out
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Love the entire Stargate series.  Atlantis is great fun.Wraith are great villians!!  Of course, replicators aren't bad ones.  Wouldn't want to meet either of them!
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is a must for the holiday season for my family and it was great to be able to order it and receive a wonderful product being in perfect condition.
B001HN6918|4.0|I was happy to see that this movie is as funny and well animated as the first one. My kids and I laughed our way through this movie from beginning to end (except for a brief sad spot near the end. The animation in this movie was even better than the first one. The colors are vibrant and the audio is nice and loud. This would make the perfect family movie for an evening in. I'd recommend it to other parents. There is nothing gross in it and the humor is appropriate for even young kids.
B008Y6WPXC|3.0|There's not a lot of plot here, but it is fun to watch all these 'oldies but goodies' in action.
B0083Z614S|5.0|My new favorite book! I want to plant a garden now :) I will probably try to keep it a secret though, so the Magic can grow. Heehee
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun but not too easy.  fast play.  pop up ads are the only downside.  good on kindle and iphone. word.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Enjoyed banter and different personalities! First time telephone is used! Felt frustration between Matthew and Mary! Really enjoyed the costumes of the times and the automobiles!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|If you enjoyed the first Temple Run, then you will enjoy this sequel as well. It's basically the same as the first, but with better graphics, a lot more power ups (that you don't have to buy) and a lot more obstacles thrown in. Plus, instead of a group of monkeys after you, you get one big gigantic monkey! Who doesn't like that? This sequel is as enjoyable as the first one, keeps you engaged and a great way to kill some time.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Great movie for the kids , if you liked the other movies from the chipmunks you'll like this one too !!
B006GECE9Y|4.0|This is a great browser for my android tablet. It doesn't freeze up on me and the sites are uploaded pretty quickly for me. I like the shortcuts for my bookmarked pages. This is just a reliable browser on my tablet.
1451695195|5.0|This was a book I couldn't put down. Particularly interesting was the original but different experience Dr. Alexander had in the Realm of the Earthworm which I wonder, if to some degree, is what people call &#34;hell&#34;. The beauty of the &#34;heavenly&#34; realm also befits the majesty descriptions of other NDE. But most of all the emphasis on the indescribable &#34;love&#34; that permeates that higher realm. Fascinating is in his words &#34;there is not one universe but many - in fact, more than I could conceive - but that love lay at the center of them all.&#34; and &#34;I saw the abundance of life throughout the countless universes, including some whose intelligence was advanced far beyond that of humanity. I saw that there are countless higher dimensions......&#34; (both quotes from page 48).<br />Maybe we can learn to look forward to the next realm Dr. Alexander talks about by living a live here full of integrity, peace and service to humanity.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|If you're looking for a game that will keep you preoccupied for quite a while, then this game is for you. You wouldn't think it would take up your attention, but once you start playing you find that you can't stop. It has great graphics, can be challenging (regarding how quick your reflexes are), and keeps you preoccupied. This is a good game for those times when you are bored and just want to kill a little bit of time.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|great show! third season is my favorite so far! can't wait to watch the fourth season as well. i love it!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|For a person like myself that tends to keep records of things and have information that I may need at a future time, this app is a great way to keep everything organized and simple. It has options such as the look of the notebook and whether you want lined or non-lined pages to make each notebook unique and personalized. It has made keeping information easy and quick for me to look up.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This is alot better than the first movie. you can't say that for to many sequels. but this is one of them. this movie is awesome. and i was so happy to see that they got chuck norris and arnold shwartzaneeger and jean claude van dame in this movie. i thought that the action was ten times better than the first one. don't get me wrong i love the first one but this was better. i hope they  do a third one and have jackie chan in it. that would top it off. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like to keep little notes and lists, so this is a great app for me. I like the ease of use. I can put down as many notes/lists and have easy access to look them up. I appreciate the different ways to organize your notes/lists which makes it very convenient for me. I like the other options it provides, such as the option to lock any notes with a password so only you can see it. Overall, this is a very useful and convenient app to keep notes for yourself.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Omg I love this game very much! I have been playing it for a month now and I am already a level 21! I literally redesigned my park every day! I have a Kairos dragon, 4 Flower dragons, 1 Lava and Obsidian dragon, 2 fire dragons, 1 Mountain dragon, 1 cold dragon, 2 poison dragons, 2 plant dragons, 1 Hail dragon, and I am going to get..... Air dragons! :D I have almost 5 million coins!!! OMG I am halfway to get my 5th island! I already have 4 islands and 1 gemstone island! This is my favorite game!!!!!!!! Get it! The best part is that it's free! It goes slow, though. You can buy the food, gems, and coins but I like going legit and earn it. Have fun and get as many dragons as your park can hold! My park can probably hold many already!  What are you waiting for?! Get it!!!! Don't just sit there wasting your life! Do it while playing this game! WARNING: You need wifi to play! Don't worry, though. When you get to a wifi hotspot, you can play and your park won't delete! Have fun! Get the rainbow dragon! Breed &amp; get! Go get it NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great:-)  really enjoy using it to read.  Lots of books available.  Using with my zoom .  Great and speedy. Wonderful!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Can't wait to read the next book. Highly recommended this book.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was a great dog story, even tho it was made to happen here in the states, it really happened in Japan and the dog was a very loyal animal.  I recommend this to everyone.
B0095P31L6|2.0|I hadn't heard much about this movie but thought I would give it a shot.  I went in with low expectations and was still disappointed.  Not much to say about it other than watch something else.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought I was too old for this book and it was meant for young adults.  This book was so good, I couldnt put it down and would probably read it again next year.
0765325950|5.0|Great book. As all Robert Jordan's go it is longer than necessary, but still good. I would certainly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Game is entertaining.  Graphics are very good.  Horses look realistic and the tasks are things you would do at a real stable. The only bad thing I can think of<br />is that it hasn't updated so I can't visit my neighbours.
0817439390|4.0|made clear explanations educating a first time novice and something that i enjoy referencing. Clear easy to understand explanations. Definitely recommend for someone learning the concept.
B007VPLNGW|4.0|Don't start playing unless you can play for a LONG time! It's VERY addictive!!!!  I just started and I'm already halfway through the first stage. :)
B005CMSDKA|5.0|Great action and intrigue movie, Gran pelicula una niña encantadora y letal te trasnporta a varios paises del Viejo continente y accion q nunca para.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Everytime I am doing well the game comes up with me failing the level when I just cleared it.  with plenty of balls left to play.  Frustrating!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I always enjoy playing this games like Diner Dash. I recommend this game to everyone who like to serve in a restaurant. This game is a excellent way to past the time.
1609613937|5.0|Very interesting read.  Both of us enjoyed the book and love the recipes!  Eating Vegan style is easy ... and very tasty.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super I play it all the time!!!!!!!! Some times times I have to take my kindle off my brother because he will not stop playing!!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet.  This set contains everything that a Matrix fan would want.  All of the movies have been upgraded with a deft hand and just makes for better viewing.  In any case, if you're buying this collection, then I don't need to sell it to you.<br /><br />However, there is some confusion in the description and reviews about how many disks and formats, etc.<br /><br />Here is what you get:<br /><br />3 BD disks for the trilogy and the \\"Revisited\\" extras for each movie.<br />1 BD disk for the Animatrix and extras.<br />2 SD disks for The Matrix Experience.  There is a double-sided disk that has The Burly Man Chronicles and The Roots of the Matrix.  The second disk is single-sided and contains The Zion Archives.<br /><br />So, there are 6 physical disks in the set.  The description on the product page states 7 disks, but I think that Amazon is inaccurately counting the double-sided disk.  There are also some reviews that state that there are 10 disks, but that is actually the number of \\"chapters\\" in the entire set.<br /><br />All in all, I love the collection and got it for a great price.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like subway surfers, but sometimes it is really unfair. So, is you have a bad temper, I would not recommend playing this. Overall,Subway Surfers is a fun game.
0765325950|4.0|Except of the too much battles it was great ending. I wish someone start to add new volumes, novels. Way too good story to finish it here.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This was a very good book. I would recommend this book to read. Can not wait to read the next one in the series.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|If you miss rock from the 70's with a bit of blues...check these guys out! I've bought the other albums as well.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|So much of how people experience a movie has to do with their expectations before seeing the movie.  That explains many of the reviews here.  This isn't an action movie, though there is some action during the \\"Flight\\" that gives the movie its name.  This isn't really a movie about flight, though, or at some level even about a pilot - while that element gives the movie its dramatic tension, it could be about anyone.  Almost all of the movie happens while the lead character is grounded, after the crash.<br /><br />Flight is a good movie with a very good performance by Denzel Washington.  If you go in expecting a realistic movie about alcoholism and addiction, with an often wrenching story, you'll be better able to appreciate the movie for what it is - rather than being surprised at what it is not.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|More challenging than the first. Really enjoy the new obstacles and slides. Still same great upgrades and options as the first but with the great new additions
B001D0DQUC|5.0|The  movie that started it all for Matthew Broderick.  Fast delivery for the DVD and a road down memory lane of one of the classic John Hughes films.  Brings you right back to the 80's and still enjoyable to watch today.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed this story very much. The writing is easy and the content is sexy and new. I would be very careful about recommending this to a young woman who may be too impressionable regarding her sexual experience. This is a great book for the 35-50 year old woman.
B00ARIO7PO|2.0|This release is utterly devoid of the range, complexity in elegant simplicity, nuance, and emotion that defines the music of Mike Oldfield.<br />Mike Oldfield's magnum opus \\"Tubular Bells\\" is a story told by dozens of highly diverse and dissimilar elements lovingly and artfully woven into a tapestry of almost unimaginable complexity and profound beauty. Forty years after it's first release, it remains as meaningful and breathtaking as any of the works of the classical masters. A few years ago, Mike himself recorded a few arrangements of his more well known compositions for dance club play; lively and 'organic', some of them were quite good. This 'cover' replaces that intricate tapestry with a homogenous symmetrical mediocrity best left to elevators; more like \\"Tubular Bells\\" as performed by \\"101 Strings\\"...soulless! Someone should have their copy of 'FruityLoops' confiscated.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVE ALL  3 books! The writing isn't the best. But, great storyline. Lots of steamy sexual situations. If you are in a relationship with someone, this can really help the bedroom;)
B0094K1QR8|5.0|This a great movie if you like funny, entertaining love stories. It's a fun laid back movie. Predictable, yes, but we still loved it. It's just a good feel-good movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Like the title says, I finished the novel in a single day and I NEVER do that with books.  It's not that the book is an easy read, though that is true too, but the narrative of the main character is riveting from the very beginning and never gets boring, not even for a minute. Charlie's letters explore the themes of bullying, sexuality, family, and experimentation with an uncanny, but believable, sense of understanding.  I highly recommend everyone pick up this book. It's a quick read, and you won't regret it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|excellent book. I love that it is right there for me to read whenever i want on my telephoone. I recommend all three books. they were great.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a good game. I just wish you could choose western or English and just free ride. It just needs more.
B00406O7YK|4.0|Movie for all family, good old fashion style, it is my firs timeviewing this movie, I recomend it very well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book! I loved the way it was written, even though at times it made it hard to understand. I have not seen the movie yet and am almost afraid to now.
0891419063|5.0|i wanted to read this because of the HBO series just to see how it compaired,.eugene was my pick.kowning alot about his life already .i found it to be very good read.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|It took me a little while to figure out what was going on in this story, but once I did I couldn't put it down.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|It's fascinating to see how the characters (and the actors) develop and mature over the time period encompassed by this set.  Of course, the story and cimematography are excellent as well.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|neat game reminds me of original Mario brothers game. Easy to play even my granddaughter likes it. Awesome graphics fun
B00942G4UA|4.0|While I didn't order this recently, I did see it several years ago and found it very interesting. It has information we all need to know.
B0007DFJ0G|4.0|dvd works.  package not disintegrated.  it is as it claimed to be, who wouldn't be happy with such an outcome?
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My 4 yr old thought it was great except for a couple scary bear scenes.  We Would definitely watch again.
B00005J9PB|1.0|dvd won't play, says something about being from the &#34;wrong region&#34;<br />rather disappointed about buying a product and finding out it doesn't work
1400067820|1.0|I really tried to finish this e-book (I might not have picked it if I had realized it was so long and would be so hard to stomach). I hate to give an opinion on any book until I've finished and given it every possible chance of redeeming itself. I struggled through almost half the 500+ pages before calling it quits. It is just not worth wasting the time.<br /><br />The author has such a pompous view of himself that the first quarter of the book was practically nauseating. I do not associate true wisdom and insight with a need to offend and debase anyone not groveling at the feet of the author. I tried to put personal feelings aside, giving the benefit of the doubt and focusing on the ideas. I read on because of so many positive reviews.<br /><br />For a while the book did get better. We got past the author talking about himself as brilliant, misunderstood, or resented, and more into his actual ideas. There were some good concepts, though I found little that has not been put forth before, using other terms of definition. Perhaps some of these concepts aren't common knowledge, but neither is it the first time anybody had an insight on these points. Maybe it is an issue of what books one has read previously. I just know the author's ego continually popped up to overshadow the message.<br /><br />If I'd read the author's earlier books perhaps I might have better appreciated his intellect (giving credit to other negative reviewers who picked up this book because they'd enjoyed an earlier book). Maybe the book just needed serious editing. Unless the positive reviews are written by an extremely dedicated and loyal fan-base, I am mystified. Is this another version of the Emperor's New Clothes, where the author has convinced readers that not being impressed reflects shortcomings in the reader, rather than the author or the editing?<br /><br />I'd suggest saving your money, reading the reviews, and gleaning the few interesting ideas presented in place of buying the book.
B001TLZRZW|5.0|I've been listening to Lamb of God since their first album, and have enjoyed them all in their own right.  I clearly favor As the Palaces Burn as my favorite album of theirs, and was a tad disappointed in Sacrament (follow up to Ashes of the Wake).  Ashes of the wake which is another amazing album of theirs marked a new found clarity of sound for the band, where the lyrics, guitars, and drums come across much clearer, and you can barely hear the bassist unless you really listen.  If you listen to their first album its a lot like having your face kicked in my something awesome, and  As the Palaces Burn is only better.  A very rough raw, almost primal sound from the band on those albums -- Wrath is admittedly an attempt to return to form, and for me - it was another kick to the face of awesome.  It is surely different than New American Gospel and As the Palaces Burn, which I am thankful for as I already have those albums and more of the same would be akin to Pop culture music where a &#34;new&#34; album is released every 3 months but it sounds exactly the same as the last 5.  However, their sound has returned to that raw, energetic, primal sound that I loved from their first two albums and yet Lamb of God found ways be creative still and release a new album here.  It is a quality album which I'd rank 4th among their catalog (As the Palaces Burn / New American Gospel / Ashes of the Wake / Wrath / Resolution / Sacrament), although admittedly topping As the Palaces Burn would be amazing if they do it, but for me that album is one of the best metal albums ever and just simply nigh impossible to top or match.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed other Lamb of God albums, particularly earlier stuff, give this a listen.

B008OOYALE|1.0|Surely not made for adults.  Boring and nothing very entertaining about it.  Won't play again if it was my last option.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|I've enjoyed Robert Downey's resurgence in the Sherlock Holmes and Iron Man series. I don't want to watch movies that require me to think, just carry me to a different place. This movie did so.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|It has a country western feel with a scyfy twist.  The acting was pretty solid and the screen writing was also well done.  Highly recommended series wish they gave it more run time!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This show has so many different parts - at time very touching or moving and, in many places, quite humorous in a terribly proper old English manner! Can't wait to watch all of the other seasons.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good story, surprise ending but I liked it.  Didn't see it coming.  Loved the story.  Mr. Sparks is so good at painting a picture with his words.

B007ZXK08C|3.0|This book was okay, I found there were too many explanations of everything and sometimes too difficult to follow...<br /><br />I guessed pretty early on the plot and was desperately disappointed with the ending....
B005I4JG80|5.0|Very insightful and fun to read! It was fun learning about the differences between cultures and it points out some of the silly things we do sometimes.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read. Written concisely and easily understood. The physical and emotional challenges were described honestly. It was difficult to put down even though I knew the outcome.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app does not try to persuade you into getting upgrades or buy coins I think that you should try it out!

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Everything that you need to format your Kindle manuscript is in this book, and it's free.  Straightforward and easy read.
0896760839|5.0|This is the best book for late 1500's thru early 1600's costuming EVER!<br />Gangs of photos of existing garments and artwork with extensive commentary and patterns and materials scaled from original pieces.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I absolutly love this game but it has a couple problems<br />1. It glitches<br />2. It mistakes some of the actions you do.<br />3. When you go to press save me it will close out.<br />4. I already had to uninstall it and install it again but this time I had 24 gems, I cant get those back now!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|good read . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .you want more words well maybe its not so good
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|Was anxious to see this DVD in 3-D and it was fair at best.  I seen that Robert Redford narrated part of it and thought it would be better, especially with him tied to it.  Nice scenery but expected a lot more.  Probably will not watch it again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|my favorite app!!!!  it is the best game ever!!!!!! 5 stars. i would never ever trade this app. awesome game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|When I read Bared to you I thought it couldn't get better than that. I was so wrong. Reflected in you, which is like book 2 of Bared to you is not only hot but the story line is remarkable. If you&#34;'re a Fifty Shades fan you would love the Crossfire Novels. Awaiting book 3!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book I truly hope this story keeps going seems like I was wanting to know what happens after she read the letter
B00846REIS|5.0|A must read! Simply put this book would keep you wanting more. I love the characters, especially the strong and powerful Gideon Cross. This book is much like Fifty Shades Trilogy but something in the Cross Fire Novels gives the reader wanting more. If you loved Fifty Shades then you would love this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have minecraft on my computer and I have to say that this is a little different but still a masterpiece. Thank you Mojang

B0000931QA|5.0|Queensryche's third full-length album, \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" is unquestionably the Washington-based group's finest hour. It is, more or less, heavy metal's standard-bearing concept album, as it boasts a very complex and intelligent story. It details the life of an absent-minded mental patient who escapes from the hospital to join an underground cult whose life purpose is to assassinate political figures. This album was released in 1988, so this story takes place during the Ronald Reagan era. And another really unique characteristic about \\"O:M.\\" is that it was almost miraculously able to release singles while simultaneously not disturbing the set's flow or storyline.<br /><br />But even if you disregard the lyrical content, \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" is still incredibly noteworthy from a musical standpoint. Full of inventive guitar work (including crunchy licks and stellar solos), wailing vocals, and steady bass lines, the album mixes sprawling, lengthy progressive metal epics with shorter, punchier songs, and does so to excellent effect. And its influences include everyone from Judas Priest, Dio, and Iron Maiden to King Crimson, Rush, and even Pink Floyd. The end result is a wildly innovative, original, influential, and memorable effort, and one that Queensryche have not ever been able to top.<br /><br />Following an intro skit, \\"Anarchy X\\" becomes a short but sweet instrumental opener with some cool melodic lead work anchored by a martial drum beat and grumbling bass lines. The song then closes by sampling a speech at a political rally at Occidental Park (complete with cheering crowd noise). Next up, the fiery, piercing guitar soloing, pronounced bass, and Rob Halford-worthy, power metal-like vocals of \\"Revolution Calling\\" lead into the song's huge, infectious, sing-song-y choruses. And these, in turn, give way to another epic, winding, complex, and positively blistering solo section. The title song, then, is a power ballad-type track with soulful, soaring vocals, some noteworthy bass work (including a couple mini bass solos/interludes), and a terrifically epic, lengthy, and melodic guitar solo.<br /><br />\\"Speak\\" is a nice `n' speedy -- yet simultaneously restrained and in-control -- bruiser. It is a hook-heavy number, too, and one that is saturated by enchanting, clean backing vocal hooks, and highlighted by another blazing, vertigo-inducing solo. \\"Spreading The Disease,\\" however pulls out all of the stops, and just plain rips from beginning to end in typical, Dio/Priest/Maiden-inspired speed metal fashion. It is bolstered heavy, driving guitar leads, chunky, fiery riffing, bubbling bass lines, nasty, nearly growled vocals, and surprisingly profane lyrics. It features a bouncy drum intro, and a wealth of smart, staccato vocal hooks, too. \\"The Mission\\" begins with a nice, Eighties-thrash-derived acoustic intro, before morphing into really catchy, vintage power/glam/hair metal-esque territory, with an adherent, propulsive groove and hooky, galloping rhythms threaded by solid bass work, and topped off by Dokken-style shredding soloing.<br /><br />\\"Suite Sister Mary\\" serves as the album's epic centerpiece, since it is a symphonic/operatic-tinged piece that clocks in at over ten-minutes in length (even if the first three minutes or so of it are highly skippable). And following that comes \\"The Needle Lies,\\" a melodic speed metaller which boasts a creepy intro clip, catchy, soaring, Bruce Dickinson-like vocals, meaty, blistering riffage, shredding solos, and a rhythmic, speed punk-esque thumping drum beat. Irresistibly infectious and concert-ready choruses also highlight this song, a very fiery and intense fist-pumper. \\"Breaking The Silence\\" is the record's next real song, and it is another terrifically catchy and fist-pumping piece that is filled with Judas Priest-y guitar pyrotechnics (including gobs of tasty licks and blazing solos).<br /><br />Lead single \\"I Don't Believe In Love\\" is another especially heavy tune, and one that has infectious, sing-song-y choruses, hooky, galloping rhythms, and more strong lead work (including one particularly wailing solo). Then, after two interlude-type tracks (\\"Waiting For 22\\" and \\"My Empty Room\\"), we get the album's closer, \\"Eyes Of A Stranger,\\" which is another really catchy, contagious, and nearly danceable tune, and one that practically screams out to become a concert-staple sometime soon.<br /><br />\\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" is like the definitive progressive metal album. There are some other progressive music releases that rank right up there with this one in terms of musical quality and importance (i.e. see Rush's \\"2112,\\" et al), but \\"Mindcrime\\" gets the slight edge over most of them because it is so darn intelligently written. And it was re-released by Capitol Records in 2003 with two added bonus tracks (both of which are live recordings), thus making it the essential issue to own.s infectious, sing-song-y choruses, hooky, galloping rhythms, and more strong lead work (including one particularly wailing solo).

B005LAIGW8|2.0|Nicolas Cage's Johnny Blaze is back in \\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,\\" but for what? Apparently Johnny is given a chance to reclaim his soul if he succeeds in retrieving a boy name Danny (Fergus Riordan), and Danny is kidnapped by a young gangster Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth enjoying the role) in the pay of evil Roarke (Ciarán Hinds replacing Peter Fonda). Will Ghost Rider take his soul back? In that case, what will he be? But are you really interested?<br /><br />Unlike its predecessor, which may not be a masterpiece but is still entertaining, the sequel directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor of \\"Crank\\" fame, seems not to care about its story. Curiously, the least interesting character in the film is Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider himself, for which the film has been made. David S. Goyer's story (screenplay by Goyer and Scott M. Gimple & Seth Hoffman) just goes on and on, not knowing where it is going.<br /><br />I know Neveldine and Taylor's restless filming style and I enjoyed their \\"Crank\\" I thought their unique camera work might work in an action film featuring an anti-superhero on a motorcycle with a flaming skull, but somehow the result was underwhelming. Ghost Rider just needs better editing, better writing and most of all a much stronger enemy to fight.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" is just mindless fun. That's fine, but the problem is, with cahracters and story we really don't care, it is not enough fun.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|There's really nothing to day other than that I really like this backpack. It's durable, it has a lot of space, and it looks nice. I have had it for about a month now and nothing's wrong with it. I would recommend buying it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The original Temple run was fun but eventually, you get to the limit of your abilities and can't seem to get further. It was nice to stumble across this new version and find that there were more obsticles and things to get around, under and over. The game adds more challenges and takes it nicely to the next level. The zip line is fun too.<br /><br />Definitely takes a little getting used to compared to the first one but worth the effort.
B000LB7G00|5.0|finally a #D mouse that works! the only issue i have is that i wish they base was a little heavier, since everytime i grab the thing i feel like i'm close to lifting it off my desk
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This takes up quite a bit of memory on my Kindle Fire, almost 54 MB, so you will need to keep that in mind if you are low on space.<br /><br />It offers a number of different play modes, including regular (classic), quest, and endless. I tend to go for the classic where you are given even more options - you can chose your tiles, shape of the layout and the background image.<br /><br />I actually like that it isn't timed. I hate playing games like this when they are timed. It shows which tiles are available for pairing and gives you a one shuffle per layout option.<br /><br />A pretty good Mahjong game but could be a little simpler.
B0001WGIBW|3.0|We were looking actually for a starter-pack for our nephew this Christmas and figured we could not go wrong with providing more track. We felt Brio was the standard and glad to find this item.
1401324649|5.0|A very easily readable and enjoyable book which is a combination of the holistic detective Dirk Gently's approach to life (go with the flow and see what happens next), and the historical fun of the Flashman papers. A hard-to-put-down book which at the same time is a brillaint way to learn about 20th century history. Read it to have fun and learn!
B007W8S2MG|4.0|It is a great game and I recomened it for anyone who likes RPGs it gives you the ability to do whatever you want to do each day
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I very much enjoyed The Hunger Games.  Once I started I found it hard to put down.  I'm half way thru the second book of the series and still enjoying the story.  The Harry Potter series comes to mind: good characters, rated 'G', with a continuously interesting story.

B00006LI4S|5.0|This 5 star review is for \\"David Gilmore In Concert / Robert Wyatt Meltdown.\\" There appears to be a mix up of these reviews, in that, as you read through some of the older reviews the subject matter is for other concerts.<br /><br />This DVD subject matter has been pretty much \\"beat to death\\" over the years, so I will mention what I see as seldom touched on sweet spots. Cello player Caroline Dale is indeed a master at her craft. At age 13 she won the String Final of the BBC's \\"Young Musician of the Year\\" in 1978. The final song on this DVD is Comfortably Numb, sung by Bob Geldof (one time lead singer of the band \\"The Boomtown Rats\\") and David Gilmore. Miss Dale is especially fascinating to watch on this final song as she generally rocks-out to David Gilmore's electric guitar and further reacts to Bob Geldof's ending animated dance to the song. Caroline Dale's left hand movements are like some \\"bionic appendage\\" that has been attached to her left arm. A sight to be seen!<br /><br />The best of David Gilmore's singing, that I have heard, is on his Blue-Ray version of \\"David Gilmore, Remember That Night, Live At The Royal Albert Hall\\"  2 Disc Special Edition. Be it the blue-ray sound quality, or whatever, I hear a rich tone in his voice that is not heard on other recordings. Maybe he had gargled with good bourbon just prior to the concert.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first hunger games and instantly bought the next two. But after reading them i found that they got a little depressing because people who mean something such as finnick and gale either die or betrayal and it is sad.<br />What is wih the rather depressing ending???? Dont read this if u dont want to read about people having depressing amd gruesome deaths.

B008QTVNUI|3.0|My daughter loves this, so I gave it a try. The show is well done with interesting twists, but the subject matter is difficult for me to enjoy. The intensity of the pain and suffering of both the main characters is extreme, the action is edgy, with all the characters reacting to their sharp, unintelligible, emotional fears. The whole show is in free fall and it is frightening to think that this might actually be what is happening in our world due to the seriously scary threats of terrorism.
B00005JO20|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie with Jack Black.  The scenery and special effects are great.  Although we were fans of the original, this one takes it's place!

0307352153|5.0|QUIET is a book that should be required reading for...well, for a lot of people I know. I think I've raved about it enough that my husband will read it. Or at least glance through most of it. I found it to be applicable to parents, businesspeople, teachers, and introverts of all stripes. Reading it as an extrovert, I found it gave voice to many of the things I've long admired about others and hated about myself.<br /><br />My hot temper and flash responses? No, I can't blame them all on extroversion, but that doesn't help. Living with Mr. Self-Discipline is quite a school in introversion and the good side effects.<br /><br />As I was reading through the schooling Cain provides throughout the book, which took her at least five years to research and write, I couldn't help but realize that I'm more introverted than anyone ever thought.<br /><br />\\"I think I'm part introvert!\\" I announced one night, almost triumphantly, as I was reading one of the chapters.<br /><br />My husband was unable to speak because he was laughing so hard. When I shared the same sentiment the next day in the parish office, one of my colleagues was struck speechless (I'm not sure I've ever had that effect on her before).<br /><br />But it's TRUE. I AM. And maybe we all are, to some extent. Cain uses nearly 300 pages and countless real-life examples, case studies, and research references to examine what it means to be introverted. She looks at how introversion affects the way both those who are and those who are around them approach the world. She considers ways we can better tap into the \\"power\\" of introversion (our own and others').<br /><br />This book fits nicely into a category of reading and research that I barely restrain myself from just disappearing into (probably because I'm NOT an introvert?). It helped me understand myself as an extrovert and those introverts I love. It made me appreciate even more the strengths those introverts bring to the table--Cain gave voice to things I have observed and noticed but haven't articulated.<br /><br />Have we made the Extrovert Ideal something that hides the power of the introverted way of life? I suspect there's no ideal in being far on one extreme or the other. The loudmouths do usually get the attention (and I am guilty of being one of that band), but I'll bet the people who aren't piping up don't have &lt;em>nothing&lt;/em> to say. In fact, if those of us with all the energy would harness it to listening to the other half, our world would be a much more interesting place.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended. I'd lend you my copy, but there's a (they don't know they're on it yet) waiting list. :)rved and noticed but haven't articulated.<br /><br />Have we made the Extrovert Ideal something that hides the power of the introverted way of life?

B00A6D5GBE|3.0|Installed like 66MB not so much an issue on a Tablet with 1GB of space, but major real estate eater on most phones if even room to install.<br /><br />Really should be half the size as are most other similar things like the Angry's, Stpid Zombies, etc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app. Its really fun and very unique. the whole idea and graphics are great. I've. nothing bad to say. Now I really want my own horse!

B009PMB3CI|4.0|I was disappointed you couldn't keep the dog dressed all the time but other than that it's really fun. The graphics are fantastic!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I first played the DVD on my television.  On there the background instruments were too loud, but when I put on my &#34;Bose&#34; radio it was great.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very good reading. It was a very fast moving story with a unsuspected ending. Lawyers are very interesting people always.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|IT is soo fun and cool . It has horses and you can buy different horses. The horses are 3D too and they act like real horses. You also have clothes to put on yourself and the horse. They also have championships for you to compete in.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a great game. I like it makes you think and it relaxed you after a long day.<br />The little pudding blobs are so cute. When the sound is down they look like their trying to talk to you; and a person could under stand them guys. The only thing that is bad it that you have to wait for the up grades or new levels to be avalible.
034580404X|5.0|this was for my wife and she loves it.this came in fast and was not harmed i will def tell others .
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought Gone Girl started out a bit slow, but hold on because it really blows up.  It is told from such a unique perspective that I can't say I've experience in another book.  It alternates between the male and female main characters.  They are narrating from their perspective, but never fully revealing the truth to the reader.  What results is that you are constantly changing your opinion about the characters and what actually happened.  Gillian Flynn creates the some of the most complicated, flawed and disturbing characters of any author writing today, and this book is no exception.  Highly recommended!
1780387105|5.0|Love Justin and his updated Beginners Song Book.  Works great with his online videos.  I can actually play some tunes and all I had to do is follow Justin's suggestions.  Thanks Justin!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just what I expected from Grisham. Read all the lawyer books he's written and this one is another suspense thriller.
B0091REZMW|5.0|a lot of people are complaining about how the game is pointless when you run out of diamonds. well, if toy use them carefully, you won't run out! *gasp!* this game is so much fun and I absolutely love it. It's difficult, but that makes it more fun! 5 stars!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Has many different animal families!Uses dialog between some of main characters of the show, which gives it a personal touch.I have enjoyed playing it for the last month or so!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My grand daughter loved it! She was only 7 months when she got it but still interacted appropriately. She is advanced for her age. It was the perfect size and the vanilla scent is so nice rather than a vinyl smell.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The app is easy to use and works well. Very pleased with the selection if music. Use it every night
0802130208|5.0|Excellent works by definition...held back from public view for so long, by short-sighted &#34;literary cogs,&#34; in the strange wheel of the publishing industry by their very own &#34;elite&#34; society.  Not until a tireless mother of the Author, hammering away for years (long after his tragic suicide) does this masterpiece become available for all to enjoy. I discovered it only by means of hearing this very sad story behind the story.  It is hilarious and a great deal more!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've had friends rave about Dr Who for a long time. Now I know why. It's a funny show with pleasant and amusing characters and the show has all the elements of sci-fi I love (other than a large budget). I enjoyed these adventures and look forward to watching more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Beautifully written. Endearing and complex characters. Exquisite erotica. A book to keep, yet one to keep on the top shelf to save young eyes.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game I hope the second one is just as good or even better. I love these kind of games!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I've had my eye on The Night Circus for awhile. There has been a ton of hype around it since it was released a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, I failed to see what the hype is all about.<br /><br />The Night Circus is about a mysterious circus that is only open in secret locations at night. Two main characters, Celia and Marco, are in a magical competition with very vague rules.<br /><br />I started reading this book with very high expectations based on all I had heard and read about it and that may have led to its downfall. I failed to connect with the characters and didn't feel they were developed in any way to provoke emotional attachment. The mystery surrounding the circus and the competition was a little too far-fetched for me and none of it was ever really explained. Overall, I felt it was an \\"ok\\" read. Nothing magical for me.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I read Die Trying immediately after finishing Killing Floor. I was not disappointed. Jack Reacher is the perfect hero in every way and I love the fact that I can't put this book down.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the game, very addicting but I have found it likes to turn off on me when I uses save me sometimes. Other then the random shutting down the game is very fun... Only thing I would like is a shield that lasts the whole time like invincibility on Temple run 1.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The Mr. Gray may sound extreme in this story but he isn't really that unusual... there are a lot of Mr. G's out there in other shades of colors.... you just have to want to recognize them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is so exciting. I love the era and the contrasrt between the help and the estate family. I like that they are so good to their help.  I always look forward to the next episode.  It is good clean wonderfully executed tv drama.  I love the show.  iN FACT, i HAD NOT BEEN WATCHING THIS SHOW SO I HAD TO GO BACK AND WATCH THE EARLIER EPISODES AND SO GLAD THAT I DID.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This was the first 3D movie we were able to watch on our TV.  It was like we were there.  We loved it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Compelling story line, strong acting.  Maggie Smith has some of the best dialogue ever written. We will be watching for as long as it's airing.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I would like a 24 hour format similar to what I use in Europe. The weather option is very nice.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Compelling story line, strong acting.  Maggie Smith has some of the best dialogue ever written. We will be watching for as long as it's airing.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I've been a dropbox user for several years using it as my way to transfer large files across my devices and business associates.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Too many of the main characters (and there are many) seem to be on an endless journary to nowhere. Very disappointed an end to the tale is not forthcoming. I liked the first three books - the story moved along fairly well inspite of Martin's excessive descriptive writing technique. A lot of what Martin writes does nothing to advance the story. I do not think I will spend the time and money reading the fifth book.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Loved the classic Neil Young with great lyrics. Quality was excellent. I would recommend even if you arn't a Neil Young fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very addicting! Haven't been able to stop since I got it!  Definitely keeps you playing and looking for new tasks to perform. Good graphics, great app!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks does an amazing job of infusing culture and polotics into his book about a slow zombie outbreak and how the world failed to stop if for selfish reasons. I read this book right after reading a military novel called The Outpost and found the transition between non fiction and fiction to be disturbingly seamless. Brooks is a deep and entertaining thinker.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow! Graphics great and an amazing game. Addictive! Worth the money and so fun to play. Anyone will be hooked!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|This set is done well. It's been a long time since I saw these shows.  Lee Majors is great in this role.  The run time per episode is about 50 min. wow todays hour shows are 40 min how times have changed.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Its the Big Bang Theory nothing more needs to be said...Awesome, Amazing, Bazinga, Cool, Star Trek, Star Wars, Nerdvana, Heaven.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Everything is as it should be, would recommend this movie to everyone...  It is just a wonderful movie... Would do it again....
B000W91RUG|5.0|OMG if you dont love this show you are really missing out. This is the best show on TV and if you disagree you have no taste.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I chose the rating because Of Monsters and Men is one of my favorite up and coming bands. Also delivery was very fast i ordered it on 2/5 and got it by 2/8. And I've been listening to the cd non-stop. This cd is for people who enjoy pop-alternative music like me
B009UWYFFK|5.0|The wife and I loved this movie. YThe characters were very funny and the voice acting was great. Selena's character was very fun and lovable. recommended for the family... blah blahblah blah
B00004W221|5.0|if you're ever feeling down, watch this film.  You will always want to cry and scream when Rudy gets to run onto that field!
B004DHUAZQ|3.0|It is very cool to see all these past (and some current) action stars taking out all the bad guys. The violence is basically what you'd expect (much gun play, explosions, etc.) and although they could have gone over the top with slo mo damage, but some of the back-lit blood & knife throws were a bit much for me.
030796664X|2.0|Like the title I am a cautious about reading anything in newspapers or in this case books by \\"journalists\\". i prefer the non-pc word \\"reporters\\", you know, the people who use to ask : what, when, where, how and why. Also digging in deep getting answers from different people and experts and so on. Just fact finding and no political smearing and grandstanding.  Not anymore do we have that and this book is another example.  The book is o.k. at first even though the concepts talked about can be easily found in any college psych 101 book or marketing 101 book.  The big beef i have is where politics are not appropriate but are squeezed into a topic.  For example the author talks about how bad habits led to a fire that turned into an explosion in the London Underground and how govt leaders saw this as an opportunity to fix problems. Fair enough, but he goes on to Rahm Emanuel's comment to \\"never let a crisis go to waste\\" meaning the financial crisis and how congress in a bold and brave move were able to push thru legislation they could not do otherwise.  I dont care about an author's political leanings when it comes to topics outside of politics but this is ridiculous.  Also I wonder about the naivete of reporters -- for example he does not mention anything about the possibilty of a move like that to be totally political and having nothing to do with process improvement within an organization  lets say a company reviewing safety standards after a fire. (many of those bills passed had nothing to do with reviewing standards, but on spending of tax dollars etc)  Either he is naive to think thats what those bills were for or childishly believes he can somehow from a scientific approach validate completely his political views to the reader.  If you want to hear how great someone's political party is, or be somehow convinced that absolutely nothing could go wrong with big corporations building dossiers on their consumers that have all their personal info - read this book .  If not and you want to learn about how  operant conditioning can be used to help you diet, exercise, etc.  Pick up any other book on developing habits on amazon
B008N9AASC|5.0|Beautiful cinematography and music , strong message about the world and humanity- I love these kind of movies, i have watched koyaanisqatsi about a billion times, and this is in the same vein. It is made by the same guys that made Baraka, and is kind of an updated version. I found my self sounding like an idiot while watching this, i kept going ooh, aah, look at that.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very easy to use and watch conventiently to get caught up with Season 3 of Downton Abbey!  I would highly recommend this way to watch DA!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not what I expected. Just a romance novel to me. I was hoping for a little more depth and, stylistically, it just wasn't for me.
B005H9B44A|3.0|If movie is free to watch ok, I wouldnt pay for watching this movie. There could have use more action and drama.
B008OTTRXU|4.0|I bought the CD for my grandson and granddaughter but I even love this song and catch myself singing the catch line all day long. Its so catchy that I am  drivinag myself crazy :)
1449305172|5.0|\\"Running Lean: Iterate from Plan A to a Plan That Works\\" is a great book for anyone looking to start their own company and is looking to validate an idea, solve a problem and create a successful company. Product development is one of the most important aspects and the book really guides you on how to create a product customers will want to use and therefore buy. The book is very well written and easy to read. It provides actionable guidance for applying lean principles. I've read several \\"startup\\" books but if I would be forced to keep only one book it would be Running Lean. I'd encourage this book to anyone trying to get a business off the ground.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is so amazing. This book is mysterious and keeps you thinking and glued to your book I can't wait to read the next book!
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|eye-opening details that will make my recordings really shine! So glad that I made the small investment on this book!
0425252868|5.0|Very moving book. There were and are true heroes in wartime.  Led me to purchase other books of pilots in the Luftwaffe that were heroes in their own right.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I have to admit when this show aired on the SciFi Channel I lost interest after the 1st Season. I felt betrayed by the changes they had made from the original. But after hearing that the series improved fiollowing the 1st Season, I gave it a second chance. This time I did not compare it to the original. After watching Stargate Universe I gained a greater appreciation for this show. Like SGU, the makers did not pull any punches when it came to killing a popular character for the benifit of the plot and story line. The special effects were second to none. Concerning the contents of this set. You get the entire 4 Season run of the show including the Pilot, Razor and The Plan. Razor is easy to find included in the 4th Season (though it takes place during the 2nd Season. The Plan is 'hidden' in a 2 DVD Case in the 4th season, so you'll need to look for it to find it. Most of the 1st Season Episodes has audio commentaries. After that there are audio commentaries on all of the remaining season's episodes. If you are a fan of the original (such as I a am) do not try to compare this show to the original. Treat it as something totally new, but using the frame work of the original show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's amazing.I recommend this game to all ages it's amazing...best game ever.when you first start game it can be hard but it gets addicting
B004A8EI9M|5.0|Netflix has this cheaper if all you want to do is watch it, not own it. I wanted to get that out so it wouldn't get buried. I stream Netflix for $7.99 monthly, and they are hands down the cheapest when it comes to watching shows. Seasons 1 & 2 of the Walking Dead are available. If you want season 3, then you have to stick with Amazon.<br /><br />I am not a fan of zombie shows, but this show is INCREDIBLE. AMC is better than HBO, which I used to love their serials. The Walking Dead is cutting edge, and no one is safe. I think that in itself keeps the show fresh. Things are changing constantly, which as a viewer gives that sense of dread, of doom. There is no feeling of safety for anyone, which is scary. Other TV shows have their cast of characters and no matter what they encounter, you are assured they will make it out alive. You can have empathy, but there is no real mystery. Not so with the Walking Dead. For almost an hour each week, people are put through the paces of \\"what if\\" and how would I handle things? The characters are in a constant state of survival. There is not time to settle down and grow food. So they have to constantly look for what is left, as more and more has already been plundered. Each week we are made to live the dread with them. We are pushed to change with them, because their personalities are changing week to week as they deal with the nightmare they live in and try to survive.<br /><br />Bravo to the people who took this from a great comic book to an award winning television series (because of this show I began reading the comics. I can see why they made the show.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|If you like historical novels you will enjoy this book.  It follows several characters whose lives are all somewhat intertwined from before WWI to just after the war ends.  It is a LONG book so if you are easily distracted this might not be the best book for you.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|Ok, this is really really cute. A very well done and refreshingly original side-scroller, with awesome HD graphics and sound! I really appreciate some of the little things that make this game different from most side-scrolling platformers, like the \\"rewind\\" button that lets you back up time if you make a mistake, and the option to \\"revert\\" if you die (instead of having to restart the level from the beginning). This game is more focused on solving puzzles than on developing \\"prefect\\" timing (you get a bonus for completing a level perfectly, but there is no requirement to do so in order to advance). Instead of the usual mode of this genre of making your character jump/duck/run through the level, the focus is mostly on interacting with the various elements in the level (sliding platforms and doors around, connecting and cutting tightropes, turning fans on and off, etc) in order to arrange for the character to take the path you want him to and collect all the stars and moons in the level. A very fun, addictive, beautiful game.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I realize this novel was written for adults and not children but I found it to be gloomy and depressing.  I am sure that some might say that this is a true literary piece that was intended to show the darker side of life and how our choices affect others, however, I am already a student obtaining my Master's degree and when I read for pleasure.....it is intended to be for just that...pleasure.  This book is okay if you read to have something to discuss in a book club but if you want to enjoy a book this is not the one to read.
B000YDG5X4|5.0|The durability and workmanship of these Earthkeeprs is first rate, but more importantly, the footbed is the most comfortable I have ever worn. I am on my feet almost all day, and these boots keep my feet comfortable, and above all, cool.<br />They are also extremly light because because they're not packed with cushie liner, or heavy outsoles. As to size, they run true (for me) I should wear a 10 B-width narrow, but the Timberland medium is a true medium: not as wide as boat, and the toe box and length are absolutely perfect. Bravo, Five Stars!
0307346617|5.0|This is probably the best book that I read in 2012.  I am a huge zombie fan and this book definately satisfied my hunger for apocolyptic destruction.  Some people have not liked that the book was chopped up and written in so many different short sections from different points of view, but I loved it!  This was a multi-dimensional view of a zombie invasion on a world wide level.  Max Brooks so vividly painted in my imagination how it would feel to first experience our nation deny the existance of zombies and then have them coming in through your windows.  He illustrated through this book how each country in the world would react to such an event based on their military, politics, and geographical demographics.  This book was a rivieting jaw dropping ride.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book made me love Katniss. This reluctant hero struggling to find herself in a world where that isn't easy to do. I longed for her to connect with the right guy and I wasn't sure who that was at first.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I haven't worked out in a really long time but I thought, &#34;Hey, it's 20 minutes, I can do this!&#34;  OMG, dying.  She kicked my butt!!  This is a real workout, not some frilly pretend workout.  It gave me immense satisfaction at the end knowing that I managed to stick with it for the whole 20 minutes and yet even though it's such a short workout it definitely made me sweat.  I am so pleased with this purchase, I was afraid it would be a waste of money, but this is a short amount of time out of my day and it's easy to stick to.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book pulled me in and kept me there until the amazing climax.  Wonderful!  Please do not miss this book.
030758836X|5.0|This is a book you wil not be able to put down.  Just when you think you have one or other character figured out the author pulls the rug from under you.  I highly recommend this book.

B00881VLCE|3.0|I was loving this app, but I went to play this morning and it only lets me go up to 52 pieces. That is too easy and unless I can get my 143 piece option back it will be deleted.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I've heard people talking about SOA Show and was always like not for me.  Then I found it on Amazon in HD and figured why not try it.  I'm already on Season 2 and finding myself watching it every chance I get.  GREAT SHOW!!!  I thought it was going to be a stupid motorcycle show but it turns out to be a really good story and the characters do a great job.  i can't wait to see all 5 seasons.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book has been a great read..I would recommend this book to any older teen or any adult. This book keeps you interested and I could not put it down. The book is not boring in the begining like most books. I also like the way Sparks sets up the books so different chapters are different peoples thoughts so you know what is going on with everyone and not just certain people! GREAT BOOK! a must read!

B003VANOFY|5.0|I love good audio, I have a Logitech 5.1 computer in my home, but I play more at night than during the day, so I decided to buy them and recommend the nitides is very very good, are comfortable, the battery lasts 10 hours as says, I like the G button operation the distortion of you is great, if you are gamer or just like the music, I recommend them
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. I could not stop reading. I have got to read the next book.

B0044C3RB4|5.0|The third season is not as good as the second, but still moves the arc along, while having some really nice individual shows.  The heir to x-files, Fringe is a great show that I came to pretty late.  I finished almost  seasons while out with the flu, not a bad companion for illness, or just plain fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a fun and entertaining game for children and adults. With challenges and tricky moves it takes real skill to move as fast as you need to good hand eye coordination to help you consecrated to the game fun and addicting
B007N8RULO|4.0|As a free version, ads are expected.  However, they appear in different forms, with different ways to dismiss or clear them.  That's annoying, as the ads often are poised to link to some place you might not want to go.  You need to find the often elusive or even hidden means to prevent the unwanted behavior.<br />It's a compelling reason to switch to a paid version.<br />I also find the placement of one stack below another a bit difficult to control sometimes.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I didn't think I would finish reading it but my curiosity would allow me to quit. The movie version of Wuthering Heights was deceptive in regards characteristics and behavior of the characters. To love someone can be a beautiful experience but to misuse it like Heathcliff did was horrible and mean.
B000PY52EU|4.0|Black Snake Moan (Craig Brewer, 2006)<br /><br />I've been trying to figure out how to review Black Snake Moan for months and never quite came up with the proper angle. And now it's been too long since I've seen it--though I do still remember this tale of redemption through the blues very, very well--and I still don't have an angle into it, so it's time to just start typing and hope an angle presents itself. For in case you somehow haven't yet heard and have been waiting for me to hold forth on the subject, Black Snake Moan is an excellent, excellent movie that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. This is must-see TV of the highest order, a movie that is entirely different than what you thought it was, but unlike most cases of such things, it is something indescribably better.<br /><br />The movie centers around the relationship between Rae (Monster's always-fetching Christina Ricci) and Lazarus (the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson). As the movie opens, Rae--horrifically abused as a child and thus now what would have been called in more proper times a \\"loose woman\\"--has had her life turned upside-down by the news that her fiance, and the guy that keeps her stable, Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), has joined the armed forces and is shipping out. He has the best of intentions, of course--they need money to survive, even in the dirt-poor little hamlet where the story takes place--and there's none comin' in any other way. But this leads to something of a mini-breakdown for Rae, who ends up sleeping with a bunch of people, getting beaten to within an inch of her life, and abandoned on a back road--where Lazarus, a highly moral blues guitarist, comes upon her. Now, Lazarus has his own problems, seeing as his wife has recently left him for his younger brother. Against his better judgment, Lazarus takes a liking to the girl, and decides to find a way to save her--which involves wrapping her in a forty-pound chain and attaching her to a radiator. Tough love indeed, and easily misinterpreted by others.<br /><br />This could have--and I can't imagine how much temptation there was to make it so--ended up as some sort of low-rent kinky softcore flick. And come on, let's face it, that's exactly what the trailer promised us, with a steaming-hot Ricci wandering around in nothing but panties and a too-tight half-T-shirt, and then ending up chained (by a black man, no less) to a radiator. That's a trailer that plays on a lot of cultural tropes. As does the film, of course, but there's a whole lot of selective editing going on here to make this into a bait-and-switch. And usually when that happens, you're going to get a lot less than you bargained for; the trailer promises you cheap, kinky sex and you end up getting the barest suggestion of something that might end up being erotic. Instead, you get this pristinely-written, perfectly-acted, brilliant meditation on salvation, music, and the four types of love (you know the drill if you were raised in the Christian church, right? Eros, philos, agape, and storge?). Normally I'd be annoyed by this, but the movie is strong enough that I just sat there in awe, watching two fantastic actors in one of the most interesting situations I can imagine bringing their best work to the table--this is easily Ricci's best role since Monster and Jackson's since, well, I don't know when (The Caveman's Valentine? Eve's Bayou?). Just to add insult to injury, who knew Justin Timberlake could act? That's just one surprise in a movie full of them. This is an incredible cinematic experience. If you missed it the first time around, catch it at your earliest convenience. ****easily misinterpreted by others.<br /><br />This could have--and I can't imagine how much temptation there was to make it so--ended up as some sort of low-rent kinky softcore flick.

B005JE1KFG|5.0|Incredibly fascinating saga.<br />This series of novels is extremely well written. Robin Hobb has given all her characters depth and realism.
0316224588|5.0|Welcome back John Rebus.  Oh, how I have missed the Scottish detective since retirement.  Now he has returned better than ever with old familiar habits and characters.  I enjoyed the highlands tour and relished his always right on comments on modern life and habits.  Long live John Rebus!  I will ignore any and all foreshadowings of his imminent demise.
0439023513|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone! I love it! It's a great book to read if you like the other Hunger Game books.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I am a huge Dave Grohl/Foo Fighters fan. I knew months ago that I would buy this movie and that I would love it.<br />I was, however, prepared to possibly watch and enjoy it by myself because the guy I'm shackin' up with is a fan of the Foo music, but is not usually interested in any outside projects by the band's members. He doesn't really dig documentaries either. I was pleasantly surprised that when I started the flick he was just as interested in it as I was. Why was that, you ask?  The stories are great. They are well told by the participants themselves and the film was edited beautifully. Very, very well done Mr. Grohl. I try not to worship you, but you make it so hard.<br /><br />I like the tracks I heard in the film from the upcoming album and will no doubt buy that as well. If Dave Grohl is selling it my only question is \\"How much do you want Dave?\\" as I stand at the cash register with my wallet wiiiiide open. Luckily he has yet to take advantage and sell me something crappy.  However, it's a bonus that the preview of the music sounds great.
B000U0O9FM|4.0|Don't get me wrong,it was a good book but this is one of those rare occasions where the movie exceeds the book.
1908117230|5.0|Nice macaroni ideas. I'm already an \\"italian\\" method macaron maker like Herme so don't find it hard to understand like some other reviewers. Have made them the french and the italian way and find the Italian is more reliable. Can't wait to try his flavor pairings
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really do like this game!  It is the best game I have ever played.I play it all the time after school and before
B003TSEEDY|5.0|All throughout the book, you tend to wonder who this \\"friend\\" is reading the letters from Charlie. I kept thinking that we, as readers, would soon find out. But it turns out, Charlie was just looking for someone who would listen... And he found me.
098555780X|5.0|I enjoy JD's YouTube videos, but I really prefer the printed page for craft instructions. This book has beautiful photography, clear instructions, and a mouth-watering variety of knots and braids to try. Thank you, JD!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. It is very entertaining with daily challenges. Good practice with hand eye cordination. Lots of fun for evey age. Great game.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I find that I much prefer the version found on computers (as opposed to the tablet version.) as that version just seems to have more features, is easier to navigate, and doesn't have graphics download problems as I'm experiencing on my Kindle Fire HD.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|There is some interesting information in here, but it is incredibly confusing to access it.  I have to read it in short bursts, or I get a headache!  Still trying to sort through it.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|This was the first preorder movie for me it came on the day of the realease the behine the scens an deleated scens were great along with the commentary.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|There still is no way for you to take pictures of other things  only can take a self portrait  should not have purchased the app
B0063GORYU|5.0|Not the usual solitaire. Challenging and lots of fun. Great download. Works like solitaire but I think its more challenging..
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is addictive.  I cant stop playing it.  If you want entertainmment this is the app to get<br />Awesome
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Was a little slow-moving in places with a lot of drama, but I enjoyed it and thought it was necessary to give you Sarah's perspective.  The show keeps you guessing which, in my opinion, makes a great sci fi flick.  I found the series pretty great all things considered with lots of action and pretty great fight scenes for a televison show.  Kinda wish it had lasted longer, but the last season wrapped things up nicely given the cancellation.  I liked it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This app was the perfect one.  I love to play this challenging game and can not get enough of it.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I absolutely love the product, I was using the free versions, but then I decided to just get this one instead... now if I could only find time to use it!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Cords are longer than needed, but it functions perfectly.<br /><br />If you have a microphone jack on your camcorder and want to put sound narratives with out external noise, this is the microphone to buy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I was looking forward to puzzles that would take me a little while to finish, puzzles where I would have to move each pipe one or two squares, and then figure out where that would help me.<br />Instead, while a few puzzles will take me an attempt or two, for the most part, within a few seconds, I already know the entirety of the puzzle. It might just be me, or it might be that the puzzles are all ultimately the same. There are only a few patterns to learn the rules of, and once those are grasped, the only challenge is figuring out what rule is used where.<br />I will say however, that these are good puzzles. There have been a few challenges, though not severe ones, so I will say I liked Flow Free.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Watched the series on prime and enjoyed it.  Acting is good and the CGI on the sci fi stuff is great
B000JIN3J8|5.0|I had never known this version of Pride and Prejudice existed. I decided to watch it on Instant Videos, and I liked it!
0446580848|5.0|Excellent story....Yemen is not a place I'd want to be, but see little snippets in the newspaper all the time about that country.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|I had to read this for a book club, the humor seemed forced and I was bored by most of it unfortunately.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|Watch the whole thing including the &#34;making of&#34; for the most spectacular revalations about this great movie.  I love it and the shipping was fast and it arrived in perfect condition and way ahead of schedule!
1451695187|5.0|Credible Explanation of actual experience. Saw Eban on Don Imus and decided immediately to purchase his book. Gave one as a gift also !
B003VS0CXS|5.0|The most classic avaiable in BluRay!!!!  Even forty years later it is better than when I saw it in the theatre as a child!
B000PXUA5W|4.0|Gift for relative, didn't see it but received thank you note from them that thanked me for the gift, they liked it!
B000JCSBU0|3.0|This movie was incredibly bleak. Do not watch it if you are looking for a pick me up. The story line is interesting enough, but be prepared for the blaring feeling that you are watching a movie from the 90's. After all is said and done, I appreciated the raw representation of drugs and addiction.
B008Y73940|4.0|Worth a couple of hours of your life....Wish ending were a little different...was waiting for more....but still good. I'd recommend.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|I appreciated the story line of this film. I would have rated it five stars, however the first half is a little disjointed and slow. It takes a while to get the story line moving. The movie would have been better if it had another hour to set up the characters and story because the concept is very complicated. By the second half I was completely sucked in and I loved the ending. I would recommend this movie to someone that is looking for a unique movie that is thought provoking and exciting.
1455121924|5.0|This is a great book however it has a lot of medical terms and has to be listened too carefully.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I got this to read because my son brought one home from school.  It is relatively harmless and rather humorous.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey at the suggestion of a friend. I was hooked after the very first episode. I watched Season 1 in one weekend and immediatley started on Season 2, watching 1 or 2 episodes each night. I love the respect that is shown within the hierachy of the staff.  My favorite character is Grannie and the characters that I love to hate Thomas and O'brien.
0375507256|5.0|I want to see this movie, but thought I'll read the book first.  Book is well written and very in-depth.  Book arrived in great condition!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|being a horse owner and rider. I have to say this app is great. plus you have no vet bills with this horse. wish I could say that for my real horses.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent view of the roles played by the aristocracy and their servants in early 20th Century England.  Add to this the elements of romance, plots to undermine others and the resulting vindictive behavior, a glimpse as to how WWI and the economy started the change in social structures, and enough comedy to bring on hearty laughs. The acting is superior.  Do not buy this unless you want to be &#34;hooked.&#34; I have zero financial or social gain by making this review.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Once I started this book I couldn't stop. I absolutely loved it. The most exciting part is that there are so many more to read.
0307744434|5.0|I was completely enraptured from the first page of this book. Morgenstern creates a visual, engaging, lively and incredible world that the reader can't hope but want to be a part of. By alternating between time periods, as well as between plot narration and description of various aspects of the circus, she keeps her readers equally mesmerized with the characters and the world she has created. Celia and Marco are fascinating as they grow in awareness and love for one another through the \\"love letters\\" to one another that they create within the circus. This alone would make for a fantastic book, but a multitude of complex and engaging minor characters provides the foundation to make it an unforgettable one.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It certainly is easy to use and I really like the spectrum of color choices.  This will come in very handy.
B00338QENI|4.0|I liked the historical aspect of this book.  But this book reveals a lot of not so pretty things about the family and is very assuming of the author's 'friendship'
B00AQK4EWY|4.0|Come on!  This is a classic of French and of world literature. Who am I to complain that its characters are extremes of good and evil, like Dickens's characters? It's wonderfully gripping, and I'm delighted that it's available in the original French.  I wish all French language titles were available on Kindle in the U.S., so I'm always happy when I find any one that is.  Victor Hugo is one of the world's all-time great writers, as the string of translations, stage plays, musicals and films based on his works attest.  I've just watched the film version of the musical based on this novel, and I wanted to refresh my mind as to the original story.  Thank you for making it possible!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Very funny and insightful. I am reading it little by little.  It's very entertaining and I am glad I bought it
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really liked this book and remained glued to it till the end. My only problem was the ending. It did not wrap up the story and left me hanging.
B000002P2W|4.0|This is a more introspective album from a more mature band who were all well into their 30's when it was recorded. It's not Who's Next or Quadrophenia, but there aren't too many records ever recorded that are. By Numbers is still a good record. The writing is good overall and great in spots and the production is superb. I would argue that man for man, The Who were as talented a rock lineup as any that ever took the stage. And if you never saw them live, well, too bad. Roger Daltry's vocals really stand out on Slip Kid and How Many Friends Have I Really Got. John Entwistle was the greatest rock bassist of his era and shows why throughout this record. Pete Townshend is reserved on this record, playing a lot of piano and not so much power guitar, but the arrangements are beautiful. He plays a heck of a ukelele on Blue, Red and Grey. Because the record is a bit quieter than the previous Who records, Keith Moon has to adapt his drumming, which he does with his usual flair. The cover art is by John Entwistle.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|The movie Coraline  kept my seven year old grandson occupied the time of the whole movie. He sat still and never made a sound. So he must have really like it.
B0095VPAVE|4.0|Pairing this proc with a msi motherboard was so simple to put together.  Together they are not the fastest machine I have but the bang for buck is there.  I did not want to break the bank on this purchase.  I had spare guts laying around and just wanted a simple rig that would play Star Wars the Old Republic and it does that just fine.  Loaded up Borderlands as well and it handles that good.  My eleven year old and i are spending an hour a night playing Star Wars free to play mode during these winter months and that has been a blast.  I highly praise this combo, but if you want real quality you may not care for this, but if you want bang for buck this is your ticket.<br />Update......<br />It's now summer and everything is still strong.  Loaded steam to it and so far anything we have is playing great.  League of Legends is a big hit and this rig does that fine.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Classic Wes Anderson film.  Style and substance reminds me so much of the Life Aquatic with Steve Zizou.  Romance between the two young children is so true for that age range.
B005XN0SGU|5.0|There may be some free versions out there, but i did not want to hassle with them.  Loaded this up and now my son can read some Comic Books on the wifes Kindle Fire.  Well worth the money.
B001G70M6S|5.0|i don't know how to review this film. i'm absolutely in love with it. it makes beautiful black and white photos in my Polaroid Land Camera. but it's not like i could choose another option for black and white so... if you need film, you'll be happy with this.
B00422LESO|3.0|I was very disappointed by this book, it was nothing like I thought it was going to be like and it was a bit of a struggle to get through it.
0385343248|5.0|My favorite genre is historical fiction, and this is one of my favorite novels in that genre. Shogun is an epic tale set in ancient Japan. The author has extensively researched the subject matter, and by the end of the book, I felt like I was half Japanese! What an amazing tale. I just loved this book.
B004KSRPX8|5.0|I love Julia Quinn, I thoroughly enjoy every one of her books, I fall in love with the charters and wish I was there with them enjoying the love and romance of their lives......
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and couldn't wait for season three!!  If you liked Upstairs, Downstairs and PBS/BBC classic then you will love this!
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Great old sci-fi movie from the past. It shows that even after the years anything can be done with the future
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I was very pleased with this album. It is everything that I had hoped it would be. An excellent CD.
B008GX3W8K|4.0|This book was an unexpected pleasure.  Yes it is all about the author, but about him during a brief period of time when history was being made.  He diarised atrocities and political manoeuvring in an easily assimilable way.  He gave inside information that would not have been available to the wider general public and in an entertainingly informative way.<br /><br />For anyone interested in the Spanish revolution or who has spent time in Spain or, as I did, served in Gibraltar (RAF,1957-1959) whilst Franco was still in power and entry to Spain was still restricted, it is short enough to avoid overkill and interesting enough to fill in knowledge gaps about the beginning of a world shaking (and shaping) period of history.<br /><br />I had NO idea that George Orwell had put his life on the line to oppose Fascism.  Possibly I was just not well informed, but then, how many others are similarly badly informed about the 'early times' in the Spanish Civil War.  I would buy it and read it.  It won't take long and I expect that you might wish that it had been longer.<br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br /><br />Ian Cameron
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Gets the job done if you need to do transfers of large files, as the gigabit speeds are much better than you can get over even the fastest wifi.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Its Ken Follett's usual to the point, adventure.  I love immersing myself in Ken's books, going on an adventure with him and his cast is heaven.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|This movie has some good comparisons to the way we live our real lives.<br />Justin Timberlake did a great job in this movie.  I really enjoyed some of the messages communicated in this movie.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend it to a friend.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Another great Ken book, so glad he is back, i've missed these adventures with him.  Although adventure is probably not the correct word as it touches so closely on fact or history.
B009HELT3C|4.0|The best MIB movie was the first one. The second one, wasn't that great. This one is better than #2, but not as good as #1. Josh Brolin does a bang-up job as Young K, and his performance flows smoothly with Tommy Lee Jones as Older K--you can easily believe they're playing the same character at different ages. That was my favorite part of the movie.
B0098460O4|5.0|Great CD -- thoroughly enjoy this duo.  Purchased after watching their try out on the BBC.  I hope they have a second CD coming out soon!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Like many, we got introduced to Lindsey by her awesome YouTube clips of geeky music--Zelda, Skyrim, etc. This is a great album despite the lack of geek themes. My step-daughter really likes to listen to it; she just started violin herself at school this year. I think Lindsey is a great musician for kids because she makes something that can seem strictly classical and/or boring, a little more exciting and fun for younger listeners and musicians.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|This is awesome but the plastic is kind of cheep<br /><br />Great for the price<br /><br />Good Buy<br /><br />Overall if your a armature its perfect
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor is hot, but that's not the only reason I love the movie. It's my favorite of the Avengers movies. I like the Norse mythology angle because I'm a geek and, aside from that, I like the cast of this movie a lot. They do a great job, and they all have a good on-screen chemistry with one another.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved this game! The story line was great and so real, I had to stop playing a few times because the graphics are so good it started to scare me lol! The HO games were fun and as the story progressed became a bit more difficult. The other puzzles were pretty fun as well, truly gives your brain a workout I truly can not wait until part two.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I love Batman. I love Christian Bale as Batman. That being said, this movie didn't really settle too well with me. There are a lot of plot holes, and if you think about them too long it almost ruins the movie. Also, what was up with Bane's voice? He didn't sound intimidating at all to me; he just sounded kind of... goofy, really.

1594487154|3.0|I have never considered myself a salesperson. While I have altered my viewpoint slightly in that regard since reading Mr. Pink's book, I am not convinced that \\"selling\\" is the word for what most of us do in our everyday lives to influence others. Persuasion is perhaps a better term.<br /><br />What I found interesting about this book was that, as with most motivational seminars and self-help books, Mr. Pink asks his readers to think about the act of selling from a different perspective (which is always a good thing, in my view). However, again as with seminars, the self-help genre, and horoscopes, the path he cuts is broad and sweeping, lacking in depth.<br /><br />The most successful salespeople I know already practice the suggestions Mr. Pink sprinkles throughout the book. For those of us who do not consider ourselves salespeople, I found those suggestions helpful, but light. The read is quick, the book well-written, but I doubt it will help those currently in sales to do a better job nor render the amateur much wiser in the long run.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I have always enjoyed the movie, and thought it about time to read the book. I was amazed on how many others stories, and details there were. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I actually enjoyed this sequel much more than the first in the series, in large part because many of the unanswered questions were finally tackled in this book (such as why Ethan was able to do some of the things he could do).

B008RV5K5E|5.0|In the early 1980's, comics veteran Frank Miller penned what many critics claim is one of the greatest graphic stories ever.  It was called THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and it told the story of an old and gray Bruce Wayne.  He'd long ago given up being the Batman - not because of any one reason in particular, though there was an obvious combination of events that culminated in Wayne hanging up the cape - and the streets of Gotham City quickly regressed into lawlessness.  Alleys once safe were now havens for murder, theft, and rape.  Based on the title alone, the reader knew that it was only a matter of time before Wayne threw off whatever reservations he had about serving his cause.  It was only a matter of circumstance before the Batmobile's engines were fueled once more, and, then, the dark night would belong once more to the Dark Knight.<br /><br />Warner Bros. recognized a good thing, and, based on the reaction to Miller's work, studio executives immediately authorized creative folks to begin thinking about a Batman movie franchise - something that had long been in limbo - and ... well, the rest really is history.  1989 saw Timothy Burton's BATMAN movie, loosely playing in the same dark, gothic style introduced in Miller's earlier work.<br /><br />(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few, modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)<br /><br />Bruce Wayne has grown old.  Batman has retired.  It's been ten years since the Bat has been on the streets, dispensing whatever form of justice he deemed necessary, and Gotham City has suffered because of it.  On the verge of his retirement, Commissioner Gordon faces a new threat - a crazy army of street toughs calling themselves `The Mutants' want the policeman's head on a silver platter - and only the return of the cape and the cowl can bring about an end to the madness.  But ... what will Batman's return mean for the city-at-large?<br /><br />For the record, I've been reading Batman comics since the early 70's - yes, kiddies, I'm that old - but I was never that huge a fan of Miller's tale.  I thought it was inspired.  I thought it was ground-breaking.  I even thought it was a tale worth telling.  But Miller had incorporated some artistic and political messaging throughout much of TDKR's that just didn't tickle my fancy.  I much preferred the first half of his epic - the one detailing Wayne's more personal discover that he couldn't sit by and watch himself and Gotham decay any longer - as opposed to the second half, which dipped into heavy political allegory.<br /><br />Thus, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS (Part 1) is just what the doctor ordered.  It explores exactly those elements that rung my bell back in the 80's when I first read the story.  It's an excessively faithful adaptation, even incorporating Miller's ongoing `talking heads' storytelling of having news anchors, pundits, and pop culture psychologists sounding off on the state of affairs - the story within the story.  These are high personal stakes - ones that pit Wayne against himself as much as they do any physical adversary - and that's why the reward is so great.  Plus, there's an underlying element - a wonderful hint at things-to-come - because everyone knows that the Batman's return will prompt a parade of the lunatic criminal element to follow suit.<br /><br />I'd be remiss if I didn't point out how stunning the voice work was in Part 1.  Peter Weller (of ROBOCOP fame) does a masterful job balancing out Bruce Wayne and Batman; he sounds perfect in the part, bringing with it the stellar mix of wisdom and enthusiasm one can imagine the playboy millionaire might possess at this ripe age.  And I was surprised how much I quickly took to ABC TV's MODERN FAMILY star, Ariel Winter, as Carrie Kelley, the next incarnation to don the suit of Robin, the Boy (now `girl') Wonder.  There's a delightful blend of youthful ignorance back up by just the right smidgen of contemporary snarkyness to pull it off, and Ms. Winter deserves accolades.<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS (Part 1) is produced by Warner Premiere, DC Entertainment, and Warner Bros. Animation.  DVD distribution is being handled through Warner Home Video.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds exceptional.<br /><br />HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  It's a direct-to-DVD-DC-movie, and, so far as this reviewer is concerned, their track record is solid enough to make this worth a single view.  THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS (Part 1) is the best part of Frank Miller's THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.  It's a smart adaptation - faithful as it could be - and it shows how one could easily imagine an aging Bruce Wayne refusing to accept anything less from himself, the Batman, and Gotham City.  Plus, the vocal talents are some great, inspired choices, giving these characters the needed dimension to bring animation to life.  Beware the Bat, indeed ... especially when he gets older.LY star, Ariel Winter, as Carrie Kelley, the next incarnation to don the suit of Robin, the Boy (now `girl') Wonder.

B009AMALGM|2.0|Who knew it was so easy to spot a ghost?  The last I knew those knuckleheads on Ghost Hunters Uber-Global have yet to definitely catch so much as the shadow of a legitimate spectre on tap - EVPs not included - but these PARANORMAL ACTIVITY folks just have the spirits popping up left and right.  Granted, maybe they're not all demons - at this juncture, who can tell?  Still, if you're looking for some harmless fun and equally harmless scares, this is probably the `found footage' franchise for you.  It's certainly blossomed into its own cottage industry, that's for sure.<br /><br />(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of character and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)<br /><br />Katie (the lovely Katie Featherston) was last seen - in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY time - five years ago, the night she vamoosed with her nephew, Hunter.  In this fourth installment, she's taken up residence across the street from the average American family, and (wouldn't you know it?) she and her would-be son are about to turn up the heat on Alex (played with solid charm by easy-on-the-eyes newcomer Kathryn Newton), Wyatt - or is he? - (Aiden Lovekamp), and her feuding parents, Doug (Stephen Dunham) and Holly (Alexondra Lee).<br /><br />Does anyone ever make it out alive of these pictures?!?!<br /><br />Let me be frank, movie lovers: despite what you might think of these PARANORMAL pictures, they're a veritable goldmine for the folks behind them.  With an average budget of $5 million, this fourth episode grossed over $50 million in the US alone.  That's no chump change.  So you can bet that if there's so much as a heartbeat trapped inside the `found footage' industry, they're gonna do everything they can to wring it out as far as they can.  (Yes, sources confirm that a fifth one is in the offing.)<br /><br />And, in their defense, they are mostly harmless fun.  There is some minor magic at work in these frames.  I often find myself studying the edges of the screen, watching for things going on in the background, looking for shifting shadows or watching for items in motion that shouldn't be.  That, after all, is the allure of any ghost story, good or bad, and PARANORMAL has performed some small wonders in bringing that genre back to life.  Just look at how many imitators there are in the megaplexes or straight-to-DVD production houses today, and you know it's a money-maker.<br /><br />Now, NOT in their defense ...<br /><br />So much of 4 has been done before, and, shamefully, it's been done even better in earlier chapters of this franchise's history.  When that reality starts to rear its ugly head, maybe it's time for (A) taking some time off or (B) find some way to amp up the interest alongside the creativity once more.  Now, I doubt that'll happen - certainly not any time soon - so let your cards fall as they might.<br /><br />To their credit, the producers have incorporated some new ideas into the watered-down plot.  There are far more devices that can produce video - laptops, cell phones, gaming consoles, etc. - and they're used as creatively as they can be within this format.  You can find comfort in knowing that, if it films anything, it's going to find its way into this franchise.  At some point, this stretches the believability of the whole `found footage' idea - at what point does the audience fully comprehend that what they're watching isn't so much `found' as it is edited together from multiple audio/visual sources?  Methinks it has a shelf-life, and, presently, they're nearing the expiration date.<br /><br />Lastly, I've honestly given PARANORMAL some kudos for trying to think outside of the box so far as characters go.  In parts 1, 2, and 3, the screenwriters avoided a lot of the typical traps and trappings of the broader horror format; this time out, they aren't nearly as competent.  It's one thing to predict the scares (of which most in here are easily predictable), but it's another thing to have the legitimate violence excised by the producers' edits.  Sure, some scares are better left unseen; but when you give us so few unforeseen ones, you should at least let us see them in their entirety, not cut away right before the glass breaks, the knife drops, or the neck breaks.  The final few minutes of the film spool out to unprecedented developments that defy logic as well as the franchise's central mythology.  Where are the possibly going with this?  Only the man behind the curtain knows, and methinks he's now making it up as he goes.<br /><br />PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4 is produced by Room 101.  As for the technical specs, it all looks and sounds as credible as any of the previous `found footage' installments.  Sadly, there's not a single special feature.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.  Look, if you're this far along in hoping to understand all of the mythology at the center of the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise, then you're going to see this one whether I give it a thumbs up or not.  I'll admit that I find these mostly a guilty pleasure - not quite all that entertaining, but, like a car crash, I just can't force myself to look away.  I'm figuring one of these times I'm going to see something that'll truly inspire me to know all of these spirits biggest secrets, and then (and only then) will I be able to look away.  At best, it's only 90 minutes, and, at worst, it's only 90 minutes.  It's harmless fun, if you enjoy it, though I'll admit that the scares this time around were pretty thin.e typical traps and trappings of the broader horror format; this time out, they aren't nearly as competent.

If, however, you're accepting of a few, modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)<br /><br />After vanquishing the Mutant Army (or did he?), Batman now only seeks to settle back into his role of dispensing justice to the streets of Gotham City, but a chance development on the global stage - a nuclear showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union - brings out the worst in an aging United States President.  President Reagan orders Superman to take down the Dark Knight at whatever cost!  Who will be the last man standing, and what will that mean to those left behind?<br /><br />Frank Miller's source material - the graphic THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS - is a revered work, but, on some points, I diverge from considering it the `gospel' most Bat fans do.  It's entirely a personal issue, but, when it impacts my enjoyment of either piece (the book or this animated adaptation), I think it worth mentioning.  Politically, Miller chooses to display both America's democracy and the Soviet's communism as two different sides of the same coin: fascism.  (Yes, this is my opinion, and I stand by it.)  The island paradise of Corto Maltese is set as the fictional battleground for the two superpowers, and, despite what some would argue, I don't think there's a clear enough explanation.  Granted, it's heavily suggested to be some parallels between what happens there and what happened (in reality) with the Cuban Missile Crisis, but too much of this fictional history remains nebulous; the end result is that both countries appear to be engaged in military posturing, and neither side seems concerned about the greater world outside.<br /><br />Miller - in the source material that influenced this adaptation's script - plays fast and loose with even these nebulous facts, and even Superman appears reduced to little more than a President's errand boy for the sake of the reader's amusement.  There are even suggestions that - to enforce his personal campaign of ridding the world of superheroes - Superman engaged in what could no less be considered torture.  Given the fact that Miller chose (as did the animators) to represent the U.S. President as Ronald Reagan - and even a farcical Ronald Reagan, reduced to gaunt features so prominent that he appears skeletal in much the same way HBO's `The Cryptkeeper' did - it's clear that these United States is no friend to the world.  I think that's a huge disservice to history.<br /><br />Also,there's a bit where Batman and Robin go riding out into the night to restore `law and order' to the streets of Gotham City after the resulting electromagnetic pulse has disabled the electric grid.  Chaos reigns as the `Sons of the Batman' - the remnants of the Mutant Gang have now taken up policing the streets out of deference to the Bats - instills their own form of anarchy against the pillaging citizens.  Once the Dark Knight gives the word, however, everything falls back to normalcy ... and, sorry, Frank, but that's not quite how Batman works.  See, Batman was never truly about law and order.  He was a character about justice.  He came into being by virtue of wanting to right the wrongs he perceived, and the only way he found this possible was by operating outside the law.  As much as it might rings true to one Bat-fan, these moments - both in the graphic novel and in the adaptation - ring false.<br /><br />I realize that, against the scope of things, maybe I'm nitpicking, but it is my nit to pick, after all, and I stand by it.  These complaints serve to cheapen the character and what he's stood for historically.  No, they don't destroy the entirety of the work, but I don't see them as serving any purpose so noble as Bruce Wayne or Batman did in their day.  Take that for what it's worth.<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS (Part 2) is produced by Warner Premiere, DC Entertainment, and Warner Bros. Animation.  DVD distribution is being handled through Warner Home Video.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds exceptional.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.  As I've tried to be clear, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS (Part 2) is where I diverge with the more traditional Bat-fans, and I find much of Miller's prose - and its obvious influence here - to be more than a bit stilted away from graphic storytelling into the arena of politicized speech.  I have no problem with this adaptation, per se; I just wish certain elements could've been lessened, allowing the Bats to take center stage in this grand epic the way he should've.  It's a small gripe, but a real one, nonetheless.  No doubt, most folks will enjoy this just fine.  Me?  I'm cut from a different cloth.

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Ben Affleck's latest bit of Oscar bait effectively balls up the tension, drama and political tripwires of the Iranian hostage crisis without feeling overly dense or inapproachable. An impressive, authentic collection of '70s wardrobe and scenery is partially to thank, with bad hair and cigarette smoke billowing about freely, and goes a long ways toward immersing its audience in the era. The abundance of distinct, colorful characters and speedy editing, though, are what I found most appreciable. At times it almost feels like one long montage, with a short attention span and lots of quick cuts, but a nose for pertinent info and several key performances from its cast add enough substance to flesh things out nicely. Although Affleck's grim, game-faced leading character is often subdued to a fault, his Hollywood contacts (Alan Arkin and John Goodman), Washington supervisor (Bryan Cranston) and scared-stiff American refugees make up for those inadequacies with vigor. Alternatingly funny, adventurous, powerful and intense, it's a melting pot of emotion with a hectic, exhilarating third act.

0765325950|1.0|This is purely a protest view based on Mrs. Jordan's stance on the ebook version.<br /><br />Honestly, forcing fans (myself a fan for well over a decade) to purchase a non-environmentally friendly and more expensive hardback copy just to cash in on a franchise worth millions is shocking.<br /><br />Sanderson and Tor books both wanted to publish the ebook version at the same time but were over-ruled.

B0040I09RM|5.0|Was looking for something to watch and came across this series.  The show didn't intrigue me when I saw the ad for it, but it got such great reviews I thought I'd give it a chance.  The show doesn't disappoint.  I'm actually glad that I didn't start watching it until now because I don't think I could wait a week to watch each episode.  This show is filled with twists and turns and gets better with every episode.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|way better than the first temple run!!!!! this one is sooooo adicting it is not even funny. I love it ssssoooo much.
B001AW156U|1.0|The triggers usually help for thirty seconds until they pop off. These triggers constantly pop off by themselves and end up flying through the living room. These triggers are a hazard and I am very disappointed. What made this product worse is when I contacted the seller, to inform them that the product I received is defected, I found out that I have to pay to ship the product back to them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is really a &#34;can't put it down&#34; book!  It is futuristic, but sucks you in.  You will need books 2 and 3 quickly!

B0058YPGSY|5.0|If you are a SOA fan, this is a must but. This season is full of twist and turns, ups and down, jaw dropping DVD's. I can't wait to buy season 5 when it comes out.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I'm using this with one of my laptop computers and a marine navigation program.  I'll be able to plot and review my trips in real time and use it as a backup to my on-board GPS.  I am totally amazed at the sensitivity of the receiver.  My other GPS, car and boat, do not receive signals in the house.  This does and the size is less than a hockey puck.  When the first GPS receivers were invented, they were the size of a small TV and required a large antenna.  I love the technology.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator that looks great on the larger Kindle Fire HD (8.9&#34;) and works great on the screen of my phone.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|What can you say.  It's a cable and it works.  I still don't know what happened to my other cable.  I think my girl friend hid it.
B006LL0UZW|3.0|It's a pretty nice little &#34;idea book&#34;.  It doesn't go into a lot of detail on technique, but if you're already familiar with strobist techniques, the book is a good way to see them in action and get ideas.  The author has a bit of a glib style that some may find off-putting, but I didn't mind it.
B007IK44CK|3.0|I prefer the slightly more down to earth spy thrillers like the Bourne series. Some of the scenes like the Dubai building climb are great though.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator app is quite accurate &amp; smart. I even like how it shows the history of my calculations ...even if I press 'c ' to clear it out. I choose to use this app over other devices.
B00821PCJS|3.0|First of all, I watched the 1st and 2nd seasons in their entirety, so that says something (good). However... there are huge logical gaps in the story line and in the premises of this show. Admittedly, any science fiction movie or TV show demands suspending disbelief - that's fine, however a GOOD show requires that you do very rarely and, once you accept a certain reality, events are internally consistent and follow the show's logic. This is unfortunately not the case with Falling Skies. To name just a few of the big ones:<br />* If critters and overlords so advanced be they, why heat sensing do they not use to people (and trucks) find?<br />* Since critters control the sky they do, how convoys move around can?<br />* When night it comes, and dark it is, and humans light up their camps like frigging Christmas trees they do, why so hard it is to find them must be, especially from spaceship yes?<br />* If Mason family gets to make all rules they do, and save all sons they can, and vicariously run 2nd Mass they do, how ignorant civilians must be to think heck they give about anyone else?<br /><br />In short, good action, bad bad writing...
B00992CF6W|5.0|how do you update it? great game. i love to play it wherever i go. me and my friends love to use multiplayer but again how do you update it?
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|WARNING: Spoilers within. Do not continue to read this review if you don't want the film spoiled.<br /><br />While I had high hopes that Skyfall could redeem the Bond series in a post cold-war era world, truth be told this is one of the weakest Bond films I've seen.  I'd compare this to near Living Daylights and Octopussy in story quality. In actuality, Living Daylights and Octopussy were both a bit more entertaining than this film. I don't envy the writers, though. It's going to be difficult to write engaging stories when the there's not really a single world power that is a threat. Although, the writers should bring back SPECTRE.  At least that would give Bond a worthy nemesis instead of some rogue ex-agent.<br /><br />Story<br /><br />The story is all wrong for a Bond film and very linear. Bond is never about keeping M safe (or any other operative).  In keeping with what Fleming designed for this character, it's about retrieving whatever data is necessary to keep the world (or at least Britain) safe.  If the best that the writers could come up with for a complete story is threatening and then the death of M (Judi Dench's character), I'd have preferred it to be as a sideline story, not as the main story. Meaning, the whole M story should have been a side story in among the main narrative. Yes, she was in danger, but it's more important to keep Britain safe than her.  That's what the agents signed up to do. It would have been a whole lot more relevant if Bond had had to make a choice between M's life or keeping his country safe.  That's the kind of story that makes sitting through a Bond film worthwhile.<br /><br />This is, by no means, anywhere close to what Ian Fleming would have ever written for Bond. Skyfall begs the question, is it time for the Bond film series to end?  If the best the writers can create is an entire story about M's death stretched out to 2h 23m, then there's really no hope for this series. This film's plot completely underscores the lack of story inventiveness in today's storytellers and screen writers.<br /><br />On top of this, Bond should always be portrayed as suave, debonair, dashing, sophisticated, humorous and deadly. He should never be portrayed as an aging, has-been agent who's nearly washed up and can barely fire a gun.  Again, an extremely poor story choice unless they're planning on firing Daniel Craig after this film.  Seriously, 3 films and you're gonna fire Mr. Craig?  Worse, how do you even explain off this has-been storyline now? They've definitely written Bond into a bind.<br /><br />Actors and casting<br /><br />The main villain choice in this role is a gay ex-MI6 operative named Silva (Javier Bardem) who's bent on revenge because he damaged himself by breaking open his cyanide tooth?  And, he's going to blame this on M?  These agents know what they're getting into. Worse, we're supposed to believe that MI6 is really stupid enough to not be able to locate a missing agent, track down his remains or know whether or not he's alive? Again, more deranged story choices. I digress. The actor chosen for this role is very miscast. He's no where near villainous enough, especially with that silly and awful wig. Specifically, I could barely even deal with his out of place smirks and mannerisms. It makes him silly rather than ominous. I'd have preferred to see Tim Curry in this role if I wanted to see that.<br /><br />In fact, the replacement M actor, Ralph Fiennes, would have made a fantastic villain. Unfortunately, he's also miscast and an extremely poor choice as a replacement M.  Q is way too young and doesn't fit the part. About the only actress who works in Skyfall is Ms. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris).  Even though, most scenes between Moneypenny and Bond were just awkward enough to not really work.<br /><br />What worked?<br /><br />Not a whole heck of a lot.  The gadgets were sparse, the guns were sparse, the plot devices were thin and Bond's choices in dealing with Silva were completely questionable. The best parts of this film were the scenery, the cinematography, the soundtrack and the car chases. At least the chases were engaging, if not for the silly story reasons they were involved in them.<br /><br />Stars<br /><br />At best, I'm giving this 3 stars.  It really deserves about 2.5 stars, but I can't give that on Amazon. The only reason I'm giving Skyfall 3 stars is because Daniel Craig did his level best to make the story work, even as poorly written as it is. I'd also give it 3 stars because for what story is there, it does work on a very simplistic single-story-arc level. Other than the main story, there's not a whole heck of a lot else going on.  There are no substories, no innuendos, no famous bond humor. Just a lot of one-tracked chasing, running and dying all to a very simple end premise. Sad that Bond has come down to this.<br /><br />Version Watched: Streaming version. While I couldn't watch the SD version and I couldn't watch the HD version via the web, I was able to watch it on my Roku.  Amazon needs to broaden the watching choices even for these pre-release streaming films.tionable. The best parts of this film were the scenery, the cinematography, the soundtrack and the car chases.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is one addictive show.!  There is an extra disc with features too, which is nice.  It is something that will be viewed over and over.
B006N9KFPC|4.0|I wanted to give this album a bit of a listen before a review.  Well, I've done that.  So, here we go.<br /><br />Where Adam's first album [[ASIN:B002WMJKBY For Your Entertainment]] feels like an ode to Queen wrapped in a techno synthpop sound (e.g., Aqua's [[ASIN:B005QN3ANK Megalomania]], Britney Spears' [[ASIN:B004TLM284 Femme Fatale]], Kelly Clarkson's [[ASIN:B005HQ5S3G Stronger]]), Trespassing is more of an ode to Michael Jackson.  Gone are the Queenisms of the first album.  In replacement, there's a funky disco type sound with alternating Michael Jackson / Justin Timberlake style vocals.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that Trespassing is better than For Your Entertainment, but the songwriting is much much stronger here.  The songwriting on his first album ranged from excellent to mediocre.  On Trespassing, the songwriting is consistently good throughout.  With that said, it must be stated that this is, once again, in the synthpop genre, but more danceworthy than For Your Entertainment at least on the beat heavy tracks.  The production has improved a lot and the vocals are more rich.<br /><br />Now to the downside. Adam has a great vocal style and seems quite talented.  Unfortunately, with the vocal overproduction, this leaves his vocals hidden behind layers and layers of processing and intentional digital glitching.  So, while he's there, it's a bit over-processed.  In fact, it's much more over-processed than his first release.  Maybe by his third release he can temper the engineers a bit more to let his vocals shine through more singly.  Now, that's not true on every song (i.e., Underneath), but definitely true on most of the digibeat tracks.<br /><br />As an artist, he's definitely coming into his own with this release.  You can hear that he's definitely taking control of his own artistry on songs like Underneath. He's adding his own personal flair and interpretations rather than just 'singing' the melody. It's not just singing on key that's important. It's throwing in all of those little vocal nuances that make the songs take on a life of their own and Adam is definitely beginning to do a lot more of this on Trespassing.<br /><br />Now as to why I can't give this album 5 stars.  There are still some tracks that are a bit too rough for my liking (i.e., Kickin' In).  Kickin' In definitely heads back to that quirky pop that resembles some of the quirky pop tracks on For Your Entertainment. While he definitely performs it well, the song just doesn't really congeal as well as I would like or as well as many of the other songs. This can also be said a little of 'Pop that Lock'.  'Pop that Lock' has an awesome hook.  In fact, it's easily one of the best hooks on this album, but just doesn't take it far enough or last long enough.  The lead up to the hook heads back into the quirky pop territory.  I'd have preferred a more solid melody which leads up to that awesome hook.<br /><br />There are just a few too many misses on here for me to say that this is a 100% perfect album worthy of 5 stars.  If I could give it 4.25 stars, though, I would. It's about a quarter star better than 'For Your Entertainment'.  Let's hope he can keep up the momentum for the third album and he doesn't take an unexpected detour like Kelly Clarkson's [[ASIN:B00157NQ7Q My December]].<br /><br />Overall, if you like Adam Lambert, it's close enough to For Your Entertainment that you won't be disappointed.  If you're expecting a less electronic sound with more real instruments, then don't look here. I'm hoping that he'll grow out of the synthpop sound at some point and start working with more real instruments (i.e., orchestra, piano, guitar, bass, drums, etc).  I don't mind synthpop, but it can be a bit too much the same when it's all over a single release. What I'd like to hear is him cut loose on an unplugged album. I'd like to hear his vocals with limited electronics involved.ng in all of those little vocal nuances that make the songs take on a life of their own and Adam is definitely beginning to do a lot more of this on Trespassing.<br /><br />Now as to why I can't give this album 5 stars.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|Who couldn't like this movie?<br />Gripping story, great characters and solid performances by most of the cast (Sorry Thor, this was not your day).<br />Would have loved it if they went the extra mile and got some nudity in there...especially with the beautiful women available to them.<br />All in all, well worth seeing.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|In my experience, very few of the albums that are labeled as being amongst the greatest of all time live up to their reputation. When I was 19, a family friend who lived her most influential years during the mid to late 1970s loaned me a pile of her old LP's. Among them was Rumours which, she advised me, is one of the bestselling albums ever released.<br /><br />I'd listened to the album on and off over the years, and admired its consistently high quality of songwriting without ever really appreciating what it was that touched such a deep chord with the greater public. I was already familiar with most of the songs from the radio as well and, while I liked them well enough, it did take away some of the element of freshness and surprise. Sure, there isn't a weak track on Rumours, but nothing particularly grabbed me and shook me up emotionally in a way that would make me understand why this record is so special.<br /><br />Nothing, that is, until years later, when my heart was broken in the most difficult, bittersweet circumstances. Suddenly, these simple little songs of love and jealousy and short-lived joy shone with a new light of wisdom. It was as though Fleetwood Mac were describing the emotional texture of my floundering relationship. \\"Go Your Own Way\\" has risen steadily in my estimation to become one of my all-time favorite tracks, for its first five lines bespeak a simple but profound wisdom that has deeply shaped my own views on love and life.<br /><br />Our family friend had gone through a messy divorce just a few years before, and I wonder now what role Rumours had played in her life during that period. After all, this is an album that you will never appreciate fully if you just look at it with the cold eye of an aesthete. This is a break-up record not only for those whose heart is breaking, but also for those who find within that sorrow a new and wiser perspective on life.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I own this film and have shared it with several friends who did not even know it existed.<br />It is a great popcorn flick with an interesting plot and message.<br />Well worth the time and money...buy it or rent it, you won't be sorry.
B008Y5OWSO|4.0|good,nothing spectacular but entertaining and beautiful landscape.i can only imagine the harsh conditions the first settlers did endure.well made film
B0045I3EJC|5.0|A lot of movies have great ideas, but are ruin by poor directing or tangent story-lines. This movie, however, does everything right. I enjoyed all 2 hours and 30 minutes watching it! And will not spoil a second of it for you.
1844256383|4.0|Like any manual you gotta know what you reading and looking for. The manual give some very useful and helpful tips on small repairs you can do if you are DIY. However, major repairs should be left for the pro's. if you don't have the proper tools.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Can't remember what life was like before stumbling upon this movie in the middle of the night channel surfing.  The ending is really stays with me.  Dream life has always engaged me more than the average person.  This film gave me a lot of appreciated insight into the many stages of consciousness which my life seems to be divided.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Very good album. I like to listen to this music every day in the car. It is pleasant to me....
1609611543|3.0|I'm using this book as a counter weight to pretty much eliminate baked goods from my diet. That said, it's hard to go too long eating pure paleo, and it's hella expensive. One can only eat meats and cheese and mustard for so long, before one gets tired of it. I only use high grade french bread and sprouted grains now, even though there are mixed reviews on whether or not sprouted grains are healthy, I just like Ezikiel bread cause it is frozen and does not have junk preservatives in it.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I was at Nickelback concert in Moscow 2012 on world tour of Here and now where songs from this album sounded. It was pleasant to me.
B007SGM084|3.0|I read this out of curiosity because of all the stir. Some of the parts with the \\"whippings\\" really bothered me.  It seemed more abusive than sexually desirable, no matter how good looking Mr. Grey is. After I read it all; thought it was interesting and disturbing at the same time. \\"Take an intelligent insecure virgin and beat her and turn her on as you introduce her to lovemaking if you can even call it that?\\" I thought the story was very cheesy and could have been better written...way too unrealistic to believe. Not a fan.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|It is an amazing story that is beautifully told and I love how it is told from the viewpoint of Buck
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I am sorry I rented it. It was a bunch of actors out of their prime trying to make money off their reputation from the past. Waste of time and money.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Slow to start but worth the wait. The ending is so unpredictable and I cannot wait to see the movie!
B004GFN11A|1.0|This app was not compatable for my table irulu, so I had to uninstall it. I wish there was an app for mine.
B009YDAUJ0|1.0|I spent hours trying to get this video to play, it never went passed 44 seconds.  Huge waste of time and money.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have no complaints or anything bad to say about this app, there are adds but very little so it doesnt bother me, It passes the time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have never played such a game it's toataly awesome for free games. every one has to get this game. I love it
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I'm a huge twitter fan works great with my tablet no adds, I don't have any complaints about this app
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Great series taking too long to write this evaluation thought it would be just a few clicks and I would be done!
B006LMMN8I|5.0|This song speaks to the guy that has that beautiful lady that stays out of reach. &#34; Does she know what she does?&#34;. That is the question many men want to ask women. I love this cut. Gregory Porter sings it soooo elequently. The accents are wonderfully placed to paint a picture, if you have ever experienced what the words convey to me.
B008PZZF4S|4.0|This is an excellent paranoid thriller; well-constructed and well-acted.  I recommend you find it on DVD since this Amazon version IS NOT LETTERBOXED!  There is no excuse for this.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Now I have to admit, it's free, so it's hard to complain. However, if I have to open the cover of my Kindle, turn it on, swipe the screen, and THEN turn the alarm off, how am I supposed to ignore it and go back to sleep?  (Kidding really, I was just terribly annoyed at having to do all those steps just to turn the alarm off when I was trying to get up without waking up my husband.)
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Cable was exactly as described, very pleased with purchase. It arrived very quickly and in perfect order. I would buy it again.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|This was a fun movie. The actors caught the essence of the old characters quite well in most cases, while obviously not being the same. The romance between Uhuru and Spock was not very believable - when seconds are counting down, are your communications officer and commander really going to be standing on the transport pad kissing, and wasting valuable time? But other than that, I thought the movie was well done and worth watching.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is really fun. I like it a lot. It works pretty well on my kindle fire. My sister and my friends that have iPods say it doesn't work very well. It is lagging and crashes a lot on iPod. It does take a little getting used to. Different from Temple Run 2. Overall, it is fun!
B00263HWM8|3.0|Mission: Impossible II wasn't as good as the first Mission:Impossible, but it was still fun to watch. It has a good soundtrack.
142314189X|4.0|We love the books, but we really thought the series would come with the original box the books belong it. That was a disappointment.
B0053O89KG|5.0|As usual, Castle hits it out of the park with another amazing season.  What the fans waited four years for finally happened and both actors deserve an Emmy for their performances.
B007EECSCS|5.0|Touching story almost like a confession. Ian proves himself being not only a great swimmer but a great person too.
0307454541|5.0|Steig Larson is a remarkable author.  I wonder what else he could have written had he not met an untimely death.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|This is truly fun for the kids.  As for parents we are not to sure.  It's not that it is dangerous, but can't be used outside, you will lose the bullets.
0307269981|5.0|Steig Larson is a remarkable author.  I wonder what else he could have written had he not met an untimely death.
B0073XVUZG|5.0|Just wonderful all-around....great characters, flow and storyline...Very original and vivid. Couldn't put it down; devoured it in a few days. One of my all-time favorites.
1603425381|5.0|I think this was an excellent choice of books on crocheted borders.  The full color illustrations were so attractive. It will be an often used book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Have read the previous two Fifty Shades books and ordered the last book in the trilogy. Love the love story.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Its a typical Clancy novel, big on the acronims short on plot. Before half way into the book you know whats going to happen.<br />MFIC, HC, the shorthand language is too...well shorthand to be believable. Still I'm a sucker for this type of book. Borrow don't buy.
0765325950|5.0|Wow. Just, wow! What a great conclusion to a sometimes tedious series. Never before have I read a book that delved so deeply into a single, fantasy, battle than this one. It seemed like nearly one third of the book was one, giant, glorious fight. It may not be everybody's cup of tea, but man was it good. Mr. Jordan and Mr. Sanderson had me up way too late several nights in a row because there was simply no good place to stop for a few hundred pages. I love that the final battle, climax, and ending of the series was in proportion to the whole series. If everything was wrapped up in a tight hundred pages or so, it would have felt rushed. I thank you Mr. Sanderson for taking this on. You did a fantastic job of lifting up the banner and completing the task in epic fashion.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|great,great,great. Will recomend to friens and family. For years I have enjoyed the ease of google search and plan to try google chrome.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome and fantantastic game.  It looks so real too! Everyone shoulld try this amazing game! Do you like horses? Then this is a game for you!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|awesome app...gives alerts for items I'm about to miss out on and easier to communicate with sellers...highly recommended 5 stars!!! :-)
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|great game with nice gameplay, good dragon selection, and decent graphics. only complaint is that the opening screen and thescreen to visit a random persons island takes an obnoxious amount of time. otherwise great game.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|the game is not what i expected. the visuals are some what blurry and it is extremely slow. not good for my expectations.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I was a little worried that it went straight to DVD. That usually tells you that it's not good, but NOT in this case! Forward Unto Dawn was Awesome! The cg (computer graphics) in the movie was great, you can tell that a lot of effort went into the making of this film. It's a must own for any Halo fan.
B00A757EFW|5.0|awesome app......highly recommended 5 stars!!! :-) Worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you my daughter loves to play it and i like that it is an old school game.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The fact that Blue Ray is becoming popular,  now I can get the DVD for super cheap! Especially the Lion King! I've always loved this movie, great for the kids!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|my daughter loves this game it is alot of fun, and I enjoy it too! Thank you, it is funny as well.
B005F6NA5G|5.0|Bought this after hearing &#34;I Want To Hold Your Hand&#34; once!  Have been so happy with this CD.  It's a favorite in our office.  We listen to it aat least once a week.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have not read the entire book yet, but it is not something I am rushing to return to.<br /><br />Seems sort of draggy.<br /><br />I started it over a month ago, and am still reading it.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade is awesome! Couldn't ask for more in a concert. She is simply wonderful incrediable and what more can you say!
B008AWBQGW|4.0|I am a 35 year fan of Skynyrd. I have been waiting for a new CD and this one is GREAT. I have been playing songs from this CD in my favorite tavern and someone always ask me who this is. As I see them moving thier head to the song. They usually are surprised that it is Skynyrd.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This is the single best book I've ever read I can't wait for the next one called the last Olympian
0446573027|4.0|I have read \\"Zero Day\\" and the sequel \\"The Forgotten\\". If you are a Jack Reacher fan you will enjoy these novels, and actually if I had to choose one, I'd choose John Puller.<br /><br />The writing style, the plot, the characters are all well put together. If you enjoy this genre you will enjoy this series.
1400049628|5.0|This is the original zombie survival guide and even though it can be laugh out loud funny, its actually full of well thought out practical advice.  Well practical as relative to the actual likelihoods of a zombie apocalypse.
B005QUQP76|5.0|This mouse is sleek and has all the functions I desired.  If you are in the market for a programmable mouse this one is great.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is a lot of fun-my 5 year old granddaughter talked me into getting this game for my Kindle Fire, and we play ours, respectively, when ever we are together, and it is a lot of fun to play with her!
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|Always loved it on my pc, but am disappointed that I can't choose game number on my tablet. It's okay.

B007REV4YI|1.0|Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig seem to be watching too much Harry Potter. First of all the initial action sequence is ridiculous. James Bond runs out of ammo and gets in the driver seat of a backhoe with no cover, real smart right, shooting fish in barrel doesn't even cut it. Hes gotten into several types of construction equipment with some sort of cover, but a backhoe, with a tiny bucket REALLY?. Maybe he wanted to dig a hole while on a moving train so they could burry him after his incompetent partner(Naomie Harris is Moneypenny, Really?) which he's not supposed to have in the first place shoots him. Then there's the scene where bond sneaks up on Patrice while sniping to just watch him kill a random guy who Bond gives no importance to, he then manages to get into a fistfight with Patrice who he had the upper hand on in the most foolish of ways. Now we add Javier Bardem to the mix. The villain who just wanted to grab Bonds Sack. Oh, I forgot to mention that Bond gets to visit his Hogwarts lookalike mansion with his Hagrid lookalike housekeeper, who does no housekeeping at all. Remind me why was he hanging around the place again? Oh, it doesn't make any sense either. I forgot to mention that Bond went Mcguyver on us setting shotgun shells under the floorboards.    I'm just really disappointed in this film. It's clear that the goal was to revitalize the series by adding elements that would attract the crowds that don't normally support a bond film. Hence all the hype that was built up before release. Well congratulations Mendes, you accomplished your goal and you pissed off the majority of the loyal fans of the series, throw some \\"Twilight\\" into the next one and I'll stop watching Bond until they drop you!    While I welcomed with open arms the unpolished Bond in casino Royale, much needed after 20 films, and I enjoyed Quantum of Solace, this film just insulted every ounce of James Bond fan in me. I almost walked out of the theater. Now I can never have a Complete JamesBond Set because this atrocity will never get near my shelf.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Excellent story...follows the movie...knowing what she is thinking makes the movie stronger.  Would recommend this book to young and old alike.  Makes you think about our world.
B000026C3T|5.0|For all us Zep lovers this is one of the &#34;best of&#34; collections I have ever owned. The quality is great and the hits and favorites are well selected.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Liked the suspense<br />Good read<br />Like this author have read a few of his books<br />Was a very easy read
0553062182|5.0|I have been buying and reading books about introverts, which I am. Those have helped me learn to like me better. One of those recommended this book. I had resisted buying it (figured it would make me feel labeled weird), but I did. I wish now I had found this a long time ago. Now I can understand those feelings of being an 'oddball' in my family, school and life in general. Being an introvert is a challenge, but an HSP is a whole different ballgame. I now understand (better) why certain situations, certain people, LOUD NOISE,SMELLS,LIGHTS can make me feel as if Im gonna come out of my skin!! I can deal with loud, noisy groups of people only so long. This book will be a lot of help, just in daily living. She writes this as easy to grasp too. Thank you for this book!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. This game is well animated. It's wonderful and addicting. This game is well recommended for those out there
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game was great until it wouldn't load. I was so angry. It was so fun. Imangi Studios please fix
B00821OX98|5.0|My Mom referred me to this show and I loved it. It was just a fun show. Good stories and good action.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Love to have the news at hand, specially what I choose to read about. had problems with it on my cell phone, none so far on my kindle.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it wont open so now I cant play it anymore and when I was able to play it it wasn't that good anyway. I would not suggest this to any kindle User. it might work better on an apple product.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for.  Blu-ray really makes the picture come alive and with this movie you can feel and see everything that you need to.  Very powerful movie on Blu-Ray.
034580404X|4.0|At first I thought the book was superficial brain candy, filled with a main character's angst and over-thinking.  But as I read further (2nd and 3rd volumes) I actually saw how she grew as an individual and developed her self-esteem through their relationship.  Am amazed how aspects of this book keep popping up in other media and popular culture.  Spanking on Big Bang Theory anyone?
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Never seen any of the movies before, saw a good deal at the time for the Blu-ray collection, bought it and loved every minute of these movies PLUS all the extra stuff that comes with it.  Definitely worth the purchase.
B008XKT9FG|1.0|This was too slow for me...just wasn't my type.  Th is more of a lady's movies, one for a very slow day.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Fun game, lots of levels. Birds do cool new things not seen in other angry birds games. Use of gravity and planets' &#34;pull&#34; for 3D-action is pretty cool.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you are a horse lover get you will love it I'm a horse lover and it is the best horse game I have ever had ever.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Multiple versions (I'm using the NIV variant), an &#34;audio bible&#34;, bookmarks, highlights, take notes, more - this has it all. If you only buy one, this is it.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|It is greater than the kindle it self. It works with the kindle fire/hd. Hard backs are better than anything. Don't share it. You may never see it again
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's so cool I play it all the time I can't get over it it was awesome
B00881VLCE|3.0|good selection of pics even at extra downloads. Put several together then went back to them to look &amp; they were disassembled.  Also would like to save to gallery.
B0083WLKBA|5.0|Very entertaining I love all the old English drama, they are very prim and proper one minute and the next their is a big scandel, but no worry they are able to talk their way out of almost any perdicament.
B008M7JODC|5.0|a cow, trans-dimensional beings, conspiracy and a badazz female protagonist! What more could you possibly want! One of the few tv shows I look forward to.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is so inspiring and so well written. This a must read for any age. I truly think that this book is one of those books that you finish an go  \\" wow, I am actually in awe with this book\\" and that doesn't happen very often.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|mystery -fantasy- fiction-adventure are the words which describe the plot of this book!! I like it very much it keeps me iintrigued!!! i recommend it to you all!!
0316044695|2.0|I've given this book two stars because, from the jacket, it sounds like there's an interesting story in there somewhere.  However, I couldn't get to it.  I realize that, when you read a book written by a member of an elite military group, you're probably going to get a conservative viewpoint.  After all, without conservative warmongering, this guy may not have a job.  Nevertheless, I got tired of the slavish support for George Bush and Republicans and the decision to go to war with Iraq.  A quote from the book:  \\"I am certain liberal politicians would defend their position [in support of recognition of the human rights of enemies] to the death.  Because everyone knows liberals have never been wrong about anything. You can ask them.\\"  What the hell does that mean?  It seems to me that the Republican party's failure to acknowledge that they were very wrong about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction is just about the biggest political blunder our government has made in a very long time - and it has cost us a lot of money and countless dead bodies.  I prefer my books to be more narrative, and the snipes contained in the first couple of chapters of this one totally turned me off to reading more.  Thank goodness I got it from the library and didn't spend any money supporting this guy.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Great if you have a friend who loves racing, sebring and has followed racing for many years. Great Biography movie
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This is an exceptional time-travel film. There is a certain amount of suspension of disbelief that has to take place to understand and accept the possibility of the premise, and a lot of the plot elements lack continuity when carefully examined, but I doubt more has been done with a thirty million dollar budget for a long time.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Our 4 year old daughter loves this movie (and mom and dad can watch it too) funny movie with lots of adventure. We downloaded it it via instant video and can watch it on all our devices.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We loved the lushness of the production values and the complexity of plot above and below stairs. Our favorite series so far.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|Racing fan or not, this movie is amazing. Senna was a true inspiration, and an example of perseverance against all odds. I highly recommend this movie
014241039X|5.0|My 7 year old son enjoyed reading this story.  He thought the humor was great, especially the part where Mrs. Twit puts worms in her husband's spaghetti.  Ronald Dahl has written many books that are entertaining and very funny....highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and I love to play it I've gotten my family to play it and they seem to like it then selves :)
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie in the theater and again, and again!  Cheesy entertainment but definitely worth watching :-)  I rented it but will definitely be buying it!
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|Glad I waited until it came out on Amazon Prime for free. It was definitely not worth the cost of admission at the theaters.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|Neat idea of a game, but the graphics are a little too crude. I understand they were going for a rough look, but even the lettering is a little to crude. Not my favorite app. Not sure if its worth 2.99
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|We get to see a new, flawed, Pendergast. Very exciting and a page turner. The ending obviously sets up Alban as an ongoing antagonist. Will he firm an alliance with Diogenes?
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I got this as an amazon app of the day (best feature) and really enjoy this game. It has a really creative adventure and its a very cute game. The graphics are very good on it and its really well thought out. I would actually pay for this game! It is a very good mobile game! One of the better amazon app of the day apps. Great job to the developer and thanks amazon for promoting it! I recommend this product. Any questions please ask i am always looking for advice so i enjoy giving it when i can as well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 has a lot more depth to it than the first,  the graphics are amazing and it runs very smoothly on the kindle fire, other then the occasional lag. I would rate it 5 stars, great job Imangi Studios!
B0086700CM|3.0|I just am not in love with the temple run game. The graphics are very nice and the gameplay runs well on my galaxy s3 but just a boring game. No real point but this just may be my opinion.
B008F5YDRI|2.0|I liked the premise but it really didn't hold my attention. The cinematography was beautiful as were the actors which made it more enjoyable.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is very fun to play and has a great graphics. The interface is nice to play with. Well worth the purchase and would recommend this puzzle game.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|A lot of G-rated Disney movies shock me with how nasty people are to each other. But Tangled is quite tame and has quickly become our whole family's favorite. Even Rapunzel's &#34;mother&#34; isn't too bad when she is at her worst. And the horse is hilarious!! Would highly recommend.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|This game has very nice graphics and it is a very creative game. The first few levels introduce you to the game and are pretty simple, but then it does get challenging and fun. I enjoyed this game and it was the app of the day so it was even better that it was free but it is worth the money to buy.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|My 4 year old loves this movie. I don't usually let her watch movies because inevitably there is a character that is mean or acts in a way that a 4 year old doesn't need to see. But all the characters in this movie are kind and understanding, even when Tinkerbell makes a mistake. We didn't get the HD version and it was remarkably brilliant on TV still. Would definitely recommend.
B00701L5XS|5.0|it's a knot tying app with very nice graphics and simple design. If you need a quick reference to tie knots this is a great 3d app that shows you how to do it. If you do not need to know how to tie knots then this may not be the best app for you.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I thought the book was &#34;hopeless&#34; about very self absorbed people.  The book had no lasting value once you finished it
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love doing sudoku and playing on my phone is awesome on the go. Great app and graphics are very simple and pleasing. The interface is very nice to work with. Overall great app.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|they need a free version.  I am. 10 yrs old and I have a friend who has it.  its very adicting
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is such a unique game! I fell in love with the PC version of this game and ended buying it on my Galaxy S3 to play on the go. It may not have all of the features as the PC version but it is very close! You can get so involved in this game it is amazing. The graphics are great on the mobile version. The controls once you get used to them are perfect. The sound on this version are great. Overall this app is one of the best mobile apps i have played. Very creative game and great job!! Well worth the extra $$ for the app.
B001B3MCQK|4.0|If you watch the documentary, you'll want the music. It should have been the other way around. Great voice, great lyrics, great musicianship. A lost 1970s treasure.
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|The dvd was unwrapped when it came.  The dvd was fine, looked new... but the fact i was giving it as a gift this was a problem.  It looked like i was giving a used dvd as a present.<br />not happy about it
B0040I09RM|5.0|I started watching this series when it started a few years ago.<br />Afer season 2 ended it was taken off of Hulu. Now Prime has up to<br />season 5 avaliable for streaming. Just watch a season and you will<br />be hooked on the Sons!
B0058HDHHI|5.0|I adore this album, it is actually playing right now. I purchased this album as, what I thought at the time, a drunken mistake. I was going to return it but I liked the kooks with &#34;Naive&#34; and &#34;Love it all&#34; so I decided to give it a shot. Glad I did! There is no vinyl I listen to more and it is one of my favorite albums of all time now. From start to finish it is great starts off wonderful and up beat and the mood ebbs and flows throughout beautifully. If you are a fan of The Kooks, or have seen them pop up on the recommended lists and have not heard this album. I suggest you do.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The original material was what got me in to comic books. This is an amazing end to the adaptation of Frank Miller's vision. Even with the fact it's the second part, the story can stand alone, but is even better with the first installment. The dark knight returns parts 1 & 2 quickly became my favorite videos in my Batman collection.
B005TKC2P2|5.0|I loved every page of it. The characters, the plot, the setting. For me, being from Europe, a totally different world and yet the basic needs are the same; to be and to be loved.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|too many words are required to say that this is a good product at a good price.  it met my needs.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|well acted and produced, for those who know the story, you won't be disappointed.  filled with some very cool extras.
B001KL0WJW|4.0|The Warriors a great action movie of an era gone bye !!!!!!!! done beautifuly with excellent cinematogrophy !!!!!!<br /><br />watch it you won't be sorry !!!!!!
B001AFF25W|4.0|Very applicable ideas; easy to read; no waste - every page has meaning!<br /><br />I plan to also kiss the frog!<br /><br />:)
B0084YCKMU|5.0|For the longest time I thought that Martin Freeman was Sherlock when I saw images and references to this show over the years. Only after seeing The Hobbit did I actually know who Freeman even was. I came across the show on Amazon instant by chance yesterday and less than 40 hours later I've completed the series. Well, apparently season 3 is on its way this fall.<br /><br />It's not what I expected from a rendition of Sherlock Holmes. I never was fond of the original story or the new film with Robert Downey Jr. So this was an unexpected surprise. The performances from the two stars as well as Mariarty were brilliant and I'll certainly be awaiting their return in the fall.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of my favorite games either with cards or on my kindle but the app makes it so much fun for a quick game any time. Love the winning deal
B005LAIHZE|4.0|Great Movie<br />Bought this on Black Friday which saves a lot.<br />This movie is not the actual thing that happen to Lincoln but it is a fun movie to catch on. Those who like Sci-Fi and Drama films, get it and watch it.
0307279189|4.0|one of the best running books i have ever read. also a great insight into a lost culture.  teaches that some people can achieve great things with hard work and determination.  have read it 2 times and am about to read it again.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Great song with great people playing it. If you do not know who these guys are, look up at YouTube and watch a few of their videos and get this copy of CD.
0897241649|5.0|I was pleased with this purchase.  It has a lot of the good James Taylor songs and is easy to play for piano.  The price was right!
B009JBZH54|5.0|A 5-Star Kick-ass movie. Why? Because you will not see any superhero movie with great script writing and story. Get this set of Trilogy and you will never watch another Superhero movie the same again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i think that they shoud make  a app that you can be able to change your skins its hard playing with 3 players and  not noing who is who
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|most awesome game ever you  have to try this awesome building military game you get your own base and attack rebel forces
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Very fun, if you like Super Mario you will like this. It's basically the same thing but with a leprechaun. There are regular blocks you bust and blocks with goodies in them. When you get a hundred coins you get an extra life. Arrows on the screen are used to maneuver through levels, one each to move left and right and one each to move up (jump) and down. Press up twice to double jump. Me and my 9 and 11 year old boys love it. I would recommend it to others, I got it for free on my Kindle Fire.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love  Downton Abbey!! Love this time period and they do it so well! The writing, and acting are amazing!! Will be a fan forever!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Very addicting. I haven't paid for any apps except Angry Birds because my 11 & 9 year old boys asked for it nonstop when I got my Kindle Fire, and this one. I think about .99 maybe $1.99 and it was well worth it. The whole family is hooked on it, even my husband. I definitely recommend to others. Makes you use your brain and is challenging.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love the people, the place, the era, the series length. Love to escape into another time:) Again if you like Dowton Abbey you will love it!
B007SOQBCM|2.0|They really need to fix some things with this app. I want to be able to login, and search channels. It's not that much to ask.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|To me Fifty Shades Freed was the best of the series.  It did, of course, hold my interest throughout the book.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|A real classic that has a lot to say about war and the contradictions of society. Still an important read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book to read. I truly enjoyed it.  It was suspenseful and had an ending I loved but did not expect.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is the real deal. It is so sad and tragic what happened. I purchased this when I heard of the death. Well worth the price.
B0086700CM|1.0|temple run<br />i want to download this because it fun i like to play games like t h is and fun and i will like it on my kindle
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I have never read it or seen the movie. I think my son and grandchildren will  like it I want to say thank you
B000VUCIZE|4.0|RELIGION WILL REMAIN AS LONG AS THERE IS NO ANSWERS TO WHAT HAPPENS TO US WHEN WE DIE.EVERY ONE LIKES A SECOND LIFE SOMEWHERE.REASON AND SCIENCE HAVE NO SOLUTIONS TO THOSE WISHES OF EVERY BEING.I THINK RELIGION STILL HAVE A ROLE IN THIS WORLD.ISLAM IS TRICK.IT HAS TO GET OUT OF THE 14TH CENTURY MENTALITY.
B00448SE4S|3.0|i hope this will  be goog for somebody I know. I don't know what it is about it maybe my grandchildren will enjoy ir as they grow or one of my children.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|THE STORY IS NARRATED VERY WELL.THE JOB OF THE SEALS IS RISKY THOUGH.WILL THE DEMISE OF THIS CRUEL MAN HELP TO REDUCE TERRORISM?
B0049J0CTM|5.0|my granddaughter will love this.She likes nemo. it is very colorful and a lot of fun. it also has a good lesson for all of us. i loved the movie I hope she will see it. I can;take her to see it because of mr. parkinsons and his friiends.
0374214913|5.0|Picked this up at the local library, in the \\"large print\\" edition, which soothes my poor computer-strained eyes. It looked interesting and it did not disappoint. Clay was once a Web and advertising designer for NewBagle, before it and thousands of other business tanked in the latest financial crisis. He needs work to pay rent and eat. He doesn't care where. His pride is shot. Wandering around San Francisco, seeking any \\"Help Wanted\\" sign, he stumbles into a job as the night clerk at Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. The rules are simple. He must ALWAYS be on time and work his 10 PM to 6 AM shift. He must NOT read any of the books in what he dubs \\"the Wayback collection\\". He MUST make careful notes in the store's journal about the members of the club that are allowed to read the books in the Wayback collection, including their state of mind, any comments, their dress, and even the weather at the time of their visit. Weird but it pays the rent. Too bad Clay can only last so long before he starts to get curious. Using his technological background, he first Googles titles in the Wayback collection, only to discover they are not mentioned anywhere on the 'net. A near impossibility! Then, he builds a virtual copy of the book store on his computer and makes another interesting discovery. As Clay digs deeper into the mystery that is the book store, he engages his friends including Mat, who works for an FX studio, his new Google employee girlfriend, his childhood friend who is now a millionaire thanks to the computer industry, and other compatriots he meets along the way. He even gets Mr. Penumbra himself involved in a bit of espionage. With terrific insights into Old Knowledge and New Knowledge, old technologies and new, Robin Sloan creates a wonderfully magical world well hidden in the dusty shelves of a seemingly out-dated book store. This novel was such a pleasant surprise.
B007HACDLK|4.0|My husband liked the book.  I ordered it for him. That is all I can say. I didn't read the book.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Ive enjoyed Cornwells writing, except for a few she seemed to lose focus, but she is back and keeps you on the edge of your seat again.
1451673442|5.0|Got this book for my daughter for her birthday.  She loves the book series and she finds it very inspirational.
0151008116|5.0|It came quickly and it worked. Extra words to meet the requirements. Even more words to meet the requirements. Apple.
B007EECSFA|4.0|The Secret Keeper will keep you guessing until the very end. I usually can figure out what is going on but not in this love story.

B00A8ECU24|1.0|This thing does not work at all on the kindle fire.<br /><br />What a disappointment, but then I heard it has a downright disgusting cash shop so I'm glad we didn't get it
B008220DGE|3.0|After watching The Master, I came away with the clear sense that Anderson was less interested in exploring the inner workings of Scientology, or of cult mentality in general, than he was in shaping a profound and personal character study with mythic dimensions (as he attempted with Blood). But as with Blood, though not to the same degree, he failed to develop his characters enough to fill out and drive the story, or to carry the deeper abstract meanings which he wanted to communicate, his \\"mythic narrative.\\" The result, like Blood (though again not so critically), is that the film's storyline and its characters don't quite seem to meet. The film lacks the symbiotic flow of all good narratives, in which characters direct story and story shapes and brings out characters. As a result the movie, despite some brilliant scenes, never quite finds its momentum.<br /><br />Anderson's mythic narrative has to be guessed at, but it seems to have something to do with the sand mermaid at the film's start and with the opening two images of the ocean (femininity) and of Freddy's (Joaquin's Phoenix) helmet poking up over a sandbag, which is probably meant as a phallic symbol. In a subsequent scene, Freddy is given a Rorschach test and answers each time either by citing \\"pussy\\" or \\"cock.\\" His sexually obsessive nature has already been spelled out in the first couple of scenes, when he mounts the sand mermaid and then masturbates into the ocean. The masturbatory scene is echoed later when Dobbs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is masturbated by his wife, as a grisly kind of psychological conditioning, ostensibly to get him to quit alcohol. The film implies throughout that Dobbs is dominated and controlled by his wife, and that she is the real force behind \\"The Cause.\\" In one scene, she is even seen dictating to him while he writes, material that presumably goes into one of his early books. Anderson has these Freudian and Jungian themes and images running through his movie, but they aren't especially well-shaped or brought sufficiently to the surface to deepen the dramatic tension between characters. It's not so much that they seem like an afterthought as the reverse: it's as though he is more interested in abstract themes, and considers story and character to be subservient to them. This is only a guess however, since these themes are never allowed to show themselves fully.<br /><br />Freddy's sexual addiction goes hand in hand with his alcoholism, a weakness shared by Dobbs and which bonds them together at the start of their relationship (when Dobbs has Freddy make hooch for him). Scientology partially established its reputation by claiming to cure alcoholism, so this may be intended as an ironic commentary. All substance addictions (if we include sex, which produces hormones that can be addictive) have to do with a desire to lose oneself, to immerse oneself in blissful, oceanic otherness, whether the otherness of a lover or a drug. The original blissful immersion is with the mother and the all-nurturing, all-comforting womb. Perhaps this is implied by the way Dobbs, for all his apparent mastery, is actually mastered by his wife, i.e., is still in thrall to (immersed in) his mother's psyche. These are all compelling readings of the film (for me at least), but since they only occurred to me while writing this piece, they perhaps shouldn't be seen as intrinsic to the film's meaning, especially since they aren't ever fully developed.<br /><br />The main problem with The Master is that it lacks a third act. The reason it lacks a third act I think has to do with the fact that the relationship between Freddy and Dobbs, the film's main element, is insufficiently developed. I presume that what Anderson is shooting for is a father-son story. If we allow this to be the overriding theme of the movie, that naturally incorporates all the other ones too. The major tension between a father and son is competition for the mother-wife's attention, and Dobb's wife is shown to be the hidden \\"master\\" of the film's title. But Anderson seems to have deliberately undermined his theme by casting Phoenix in the son role. Freddy has been written as a much younger man; he is shown as being in love with a sixteen year-old before going off to the Navy, seven years earlier. So by this logic, Freddy must be in his mid-twenties, where Dobbs is probably in his fifties. Joaquin Phoenix is just shy of forty and looks older.[1] Because of this, the two men are more like unequal brothers than a father and son; more critically still, they don't ever seem to be rivals, for Dobbs wife or anything else. We are never shown what draws the two men together, or what creates such an intense and passionate bond between them. (Or even exactly what Dobbs sees in Freddy that no one else does.) The core of the movie, where all the psychological tension, conflict, passion, and meaning should be found, is mysteriously empty.<br /><br />There are three levels (at least) to a great movie (and probably to any work of art): there's the story, the underlying mythic narrative, and then, sandwiched between text and subtext, making the whole thing cohere and giving it flavor, there's the psychology of the characters. Movies like Taxi Driver, The Godfather, Blue Velvet, or The Wild Bunch possess supreme coherence. There's no sense of the three layers existing separate from each other: it's a sandwich and you don't pick it apart to see what's in it, you just eat it (and let it consume you). The Master is not only missing a third act, it's missing that central cohesive material that fills out the sandwich. It's two-thirds of a great movie, which makes it less satisfying than even a really good movie. (For example, Killing Them Softly is a much less ambitious work than The Master, but it's all the more satisfying because of it.)<br /><br />Based on his last two films, I suspect Paul Thomas Anderson is falling prey to the Kubrick Syndrome. The Kubrick Syndrome is an often fatal disorder which happens when directors become consumed by their own desire for greatness and start to lose sight of the ordinary, everyday details--the nuance--that enrich a story and make it compelling, not only at a mythic level but at a more intimate, mundane one too. The Master lacks nuance and intimacy and as a result feels claustrophobic, stuffy, impersonal. It's missing a narrative arc or a satisfying climax because Anderson hasn't brought his characters sufficiently to life for them to tell him how the story should end (or, put differently: so he can tell his own story through them). Maybe it has to do with Anderson's own relationship with his father. Perhaps he felt drawn to explore the subject but, when it was time to go all the way in there, he shied away? We can only speculate. But considering the courage and audacity which Anderson must have summoned to tackle his subject at all, the movie feels timid. It shows us the torrid surfaces of the ocean, but it never drags us into the depths.<br /><br />For the last chunk of the film, Freddy wanders aimlessly about until Dobbs lures him back for a final showdown, only to tell him that he's not welcome there anyway. Did Dobbs feel rejected by Freddy and bring him back  to reject him, to ease his own sense of impotence? Was it Dobbs' way of regaining a feeling of dominance, of reassuring himself that he was still Freddy's \\"master\\"? That would be in keeping with the father-son theme, and it's implied, even stated outright, by the final dialogue between the two men. Dobbs challenges Freddy to exist without a master, saying he will be the first person who ever lived to do so. He tells Freddy (rather petulantly) that, if they do meet in another life, he, Dobbs, will be Freddy's sworn enemy. This is father and son stuff, but since that Oedipal tension hasn't been properly developed between the two men, it never comes to an emotional climax, only an intellectual one. The final showdown seems flat,  shapeless, and inert.<br /><br />Anderson had a compelling enough story, and a plenty ambitious enough undertaking, to keep him busy without straining after subtext. If he had simply stuck to exploring the makings of a world-wide cult, and if he'd trusted his subject matter instead of trying to deepen it and mythologize it, the psychology and narrative drive would have naturally grown out of it. Like Kubrick, Anderson may not be satisfied to be a \\"mere\\" storyteller. He seems to be after bigger fish, even if they are the fishes of his own mind.<br /><br />This one got away.disorder which happens when directors become consumed by their own desire for greatness and start to lose sight of the ordinary, everyday details--the nuance--that enrich a story and make it compelling, not only at a mythic level but at a more intimate, mundane one too.

B00AHSINKO|5.0|This movie hit very close to home.  I recommend this movie to ALL couples regardless of the length of their relationship.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I ordered this blu-ray set because it was a good deal!!  We just recently changed to a blu-ray player so I'm starting to get a few more blu-ray movies.  Amazon shipped this really fast.  I'm always thrilled to buy movies from Amazon.  I have never been disappointed in them.  I haven't watched this movie yet but I'm confident it will be great.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Its a bit of rock and roll, with a neo-soul vibe along with it.  He has some great songs with some cuss words in it.  I don't mind that.
B000J103OI|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  It was a great price with fast shipping.  I'm glad to get it in the full screen format.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best show ever!  Best setting, cast, plots!  Costuming is fabulous, as well.  Can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great! I read this book in 4-6 hrs after purchasing as I couldn't put it down.  There are a few points in the book that were difficult reading from a mother's perspective, but worth reading til the end.  Definitely would recommend this book!  Can't wait to read more by Colleen Hoover.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|5 stars!!<br />I could not put it down!!!! This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. A MUST read for everyone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|SPOILER ALERT - I do describe some of the surprises in this book during this review.<br /><br />Some may find this book disturbing or juvenile.  My guess is that those people are not suvivors of childhood sexual abuse.  This book is a rare story that deals with the impact of both the trauma of the abuse and of being abducted at a young age - not from a clinical standpoint, but from a very personal standpoint related to one young woman's developing sense of self and her sexual development while also exploring the attachmets and love relationships in her life and how they are informed by her experiences as a child - even when she does not directly know how or why.<br /><br />The characters are real and the scenes of intimacy between the two main characters are steamy as well as realistic given the history of abuse.  The mixed feelings of love, hate and confusion about the perpetrator are also realistic and a common source of guilt, shame, confusion and self-loathing among survisors.<br /><br />I recommend this book for a number of reasons.  It's just a \\"fun\\" book on one level - with the love scenes and twists and turns of the plot, but also because it is nice to read a story about a survivor of abuse that isn't all about the pathology and trauma, but about the awareness and healing and how others help in that process just by being present.  It shows the mistakes and wrong turns taken to try and cope with a devastating reality.  It may be just the thing some young person needs to know they are not alone and can have a healthy happy life and love life despite their early experiences.

It was so much fun.  It is great for addressing the fact that change sometimes happen but that is ok.  It can be a good thing and we have to learn to 'roll with the punches' sometimes.  Great fun!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey brings to television a great story that evolves around a British family as they strive to protect their estate. The character development reels you right in, and early on the viewer begins to cheer for some and loathe others. The cast includes  both new and well-established British and American names, and the chemistry in the ensemble works like a charm. It's never tiring, and always leaves you wanting more.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I've been a big fan of the &#34;Resident Evil&#34; series. Up to now that is. As the subject of this review says, there's nothing to say about this flick that isn't negative. I guess that's not true. The actors and actresses did a decent job considering what they had to work with.<br /><br />For an entire movie, the plot sucked. This should've been something briefly touched on in one of the movies. It was good for 10 or 15 minutes at best.<br /><br />The screenplay sucked.  To say I've seen better by college students would be a stretch at best. By high school students is more accurate.<br /><br />Knowing what I do now, I wouldn't even watch this film if it was free on cable.<br /><br />As a matter of note, this movie was nominated for a 2013 Razzie Award. If you're not familiar with the Razzies, they're properly known as &#34;The Golden Raspberry Award.&#34; For 33 years they've been saluting the worst that Hollywood has to offer.<br /><br />There's a strong possibility that this film was terrible enough that it could cause the end of the series.

With that being said, this is my favorite book series of all time. It is unpredictable, you never know what happen next. The dialog between characters is great and the descriptions of Westeros is awesome. They are thick books, but is a easy fast read. I don't know what I am going to do when I finish A Dance With Dragons.

Yes, it is a soap opera, but the acting is on par with an &#34; A &#34; movie.  Once you start watching you will be hooked.  The beautiful landscapes, excellent dialogue, and - Maggie Smith,  create a series that cannot be missed.

B005LAII80|5.0|This simply must do well on DVD and Blu-ray to get the sequels it so richly deserves, because what happened in the theatres is an absolute crime, especially when you consider what terrible/crap movies like Michael Bay's disgracefully bad (not to mention hideous and totally inaccurate) \\"Transformers\\" or should I say \\"Giant New Zealand Tattoo shaped monsters movie\\" took at the box office!!! ... It just boggles the mind????????<br /><br />This movie is so damn good, especially when the low budget for it is taken into consideration, that I have bought both the standard DVD and Blu-ray versions of it just to do my bit to put towards the more than deserved sequels.<br />There's no point me going on about the story in this review to you because you can read up about that on Amazon's synopsis, or via most other people's reviews on here - but - if you're looking for an absolute \\"Barnstormer\\" of an action movie to add to your collection, then look no further than this masterful production because it's a real hardcore a**-kicker that's surely destined to become a cult classic.<br />Action packed, gritty, and most importantly, true to the comics with regards to Dredd's character. Dredd is like Eastwood in the future (an uncompromising - law enforcing butt kicker) he was pretty much based on Dirty Harry, and this movie gets that aspect completely right (unlike the appalling Stallone version!) Robocop was based on Dredd, the influence is clear in those movies, even down to the use of classic stereotypical Dredd words like \\"Creep!\\" And to all you misinformed people who think that Dredd copied \\"The Raid\\" ... think again, because Dredd's post production dates way back to 2006, development was announced in 2008 and 3D filming began in 2010. Dredd's script was leaked a few years ago. \\"The Raid\\" was in post production in 2011, and was released very quickly after news of Dredd's release was finally on the cards! So, you can draw your own conclusions but it's pretty obvious what actuallyhappened here!<br />This is without a doubt, the best movie that I have seen in years (and I have seen plenty in my 30 + years on this earth) it's even got that good old 80's feel to it, especially with the music (Paul Leonard-Morgan did a superb job with his score!) I just simply can't recommend this movie highly enough to you!! Brilliant story, brilliant cast, brilliant soundtrack, brilliant movie (even if you just like action packed movies) then this is a \\"MUST/ESSENTIAL\\" purchase for you!!!

If you're a fan of weird indie hop hip mixed with a little dubstep/ club music, they are definitely for you. &#34;Enter the Ninja&#34; is an awesome song reminiscent of that Butterfly song from Dance Dance Revolution mashed up with some hip hop.

Alright, this recording has always been sonically brilliant, but SACD jumps light years ahead. I have a very moderate system, and I can say that this is what you want to play to dislay the capabilities of SACD music. I love the very first track, Love Lies Bleeding/Funeral for a Friend. That only scratches the surface, Social Disease, and all other lesser known tracks have a live in your listening room feel about them. You cannot go wrong purchasing this disc for home theater. Sweet Painted Lady, oh my gosh, I've never heard sound like that. Buy this disc!

B0093LFGMO|5.0|Fun Fun Fun Great Cd Robbie still got it. Sounds great and the music is great too. He totally takes the crown.
B004SIPAJG|4.0|I saw the DVD recently and liked it even more than when I'd seen the VHS years ago. It's not just about dance, but about the freedom to create, the freedom to love whomever you want, the freedom to do what you want without being constrained by silly rules... but still produce the best product. There's also a wonderful intercultural sub-theme. And on another level, it's a comedy / farce.

B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|Title of book: Everville:  The First Pillar<br /><br />Author:  Roy Huff<br /><br />Genre:  Epic Fantasy<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />Readability:  I found it a fairly easy read hampered only by slight editing errors.<br /><br />Hook:  After a nice introduction of duality we are left to wonder and want to know more.<br /><br />Editing:  There were minor editing issues interspersed throughout the chapter.  Nothing was major or took away from the meaning but it was enough to be noticeable.<br /><br />Characters:  We are introduced to two main characters.  The first is the main character.  To this point, and I went back through real quick to be sure, he has no name.  He is referred to as either \\"I\\" or \\"you\\" in the first chapter.  I myself will often hide a person's name from the reader until such time that it has been revealed by someone saying their name.  So this did not detract.  \\"I\\" is confused through the entire chapter and does not have much character development.<br />The second person we are introduced to is simply The Keeper.  He appears to be some kind of wizard or technologist.  There is a little bit of development with him in you get his level of intelligence and no nonsense attitude.  He got right down to business.<br /><br />Understandable:  In a very short time the book travelled between two different worlds and at points appeared to have some intermesh between them.  Through this through it was written well enough that I was able to understand and follow what was going on.<br /><br />Visuals:  Visuals were very good in this chapter and helped you to keep track of where you were.<br /><br />Relatable:  I related with the situation of the main character in school and found myself wanting to know more about him after the chapter was done.  The level of reliability may have been enhanced by the fact that the main character does not have a name yet.  It is easy to slip into the character's shoes because there has not been that demarcation that he is in fact not the reader.<br /><br />Fun:  It was a fun read of discovery and confusion.<br /><br />Overall:  From step one through to the end of the chapter there is something happening to the character and it flows through and comes out well leaving me wanting more.  I found myself wearing the shoes of the main character and experiencing his tribulations. Except for some minor editing issues, it was a good read and I plan to read the rest of the book based on my experience.<br /><br />Synopsis:  A kid is sick and goes to the nurse's office.  As he arrives he passes out but instead of the darkness of unconsciousness he finds himself transported into an entirely different world.  Before he can get his bearings he is whisked back to his original reality without a clue as to if what he just experienced was real or not.<br /><br /> Favorite line:  We are somewhere between here and there, sometime between yesterday and another day.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a great series. I was bummed when they only did one year. Am glad they did a movie.

B0038P59A0|1.0|First of all, let me preface by saying that my husband and I love a good action adventure movie, and I adore Downey and Law. But like so many movie versions of pre-existing characters and stories, this one is too dark and violent. Add to that, the humor, and you have something that feels sick. I don't mind movies that re-invent or re-interpret characters and stories -- if they are done well and have integrity. The first Batman movies were terrific, but the later ones became too gruesome and perverse. This movie feels like a destruction of the original Sherlock Holmes. I feel sorry for the young people whose first (and maybe only) encounter with the great Sherlock Holmes will be this franchise. BTW, My husband hated this movie more than I did and he's not even that familiar with the original books.
B002UWH8SS|5.0|Being a huge Stargate fan since the movie came out, I was SO thrilled to see this one emerge.  Sadly, they cut it short, just like they did with Atlantis.  I'm glad to see it is available like all the other wonderful Stargate shows! Will forever be a fan!
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|One of my all-time favorite films. Not to be missed by anyone that loves movies, and appreciates great acting, writing and directing. Thoroughly engrossing from start to finish. At turns, moving, funny and painful. A masterpiece.
0141034599|4.0|\\"All swans are white\\" was an unassailable truth up until the discovery of Australia -- it was something everyone knew to be a fact. But it was neither true nor a fact. All it took was the sighting of one black swan in the new southern continent to turn the Old World upside down on its head. Taleb, a cagey Lebanese-born philosopher and thinker, has grabbed onto the \\"black swan\\" as a synecdoche for an abruptly appearing, totally unexpected event which has a great impact on the world, but for which the world conjures up ex post facto explanations which makes it all sound reasonable and predictable. Sure, antiseptic procedures for doctors sound reasonable today, but the black swan Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was imprisoned in a mental institution by the head of his hospital, even after his procedures had saved over a hundred-thousand women in Vienna from dying in childbirth! I have made a vocation of seeking out such black swan innovators, both those like Semmelweis whose contributions grace history books and some whom I have been fortunate to meet and or converse with, such as Immanuel Velikovsky, Richard Bandler, John Grinder, Joseph Newman, Andrew Joseph Galambos, Doyle Philip Henderson, and Kaisu Viikari. Those that I have met only through books constitute a longer list, and I will mention their names in case you wish to look up their contributions as outliers in their unique fields of innovation and discovery: Alfred Korzybski, Rudolf Steiner, Gregor Mendel, Owen Barfield, Anastasia, Barbara McClintock, Carlos Castaneda, Jane Roberts, Thomas Kuhn, Paul Watzlawick, Gregory Bateson, Richard Feynman, Robert Axelrod, and Thomas Paine, among others. It is only fitting that I add the author of this book, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, to the list of black swans I have met through books because his coined phrase black swan will echo down the halls of time, much as Tom Kuhn's word paradigm which he rescued from obscurity and pumped new life into in 1962.<br /><br />In New Orleans in the Fall of 2005, my wife and I lived through the Black Swan known as Katrina. It appeared overnight and left in its wake a devastated metropolitan area. How did we react to Katrina? We restored our home on the West Bank and our fourplex apartments in New Orleans. I had ridden out Hurricane Betsy about 40 years before Katrina and seen the devastation left behind then, and I had heard of the Great Flood of 1927, about 40 years before Betsy. Knowing something about batting averages, it seems to me that the City of New Orleans needs a catastrophe about every 40 years. The first generation after the catastrophe remembers it and expects another catastrophe like it every year. The second generation only hears about it and never expects one, but the new third generation forty years later gets shook up by a new and unexpected catastrophe and the cycle starts over. I doubt that Taleb would accept my simple baseball metaphor of batting average for predicting a city's experience with catastrophes, but I offer it in the absence of any other explanation. It can bring a certain measure of comfort to those who might otherwise spend Spring through Fall of every year worrying about another Katrina.

0060734191|4.0|I especially love the second book because it's less gory and more about her personal journey through self-doubt to find her true identity and gifts. I think these books are empowering for girls, but not recommended for the squeamish or easily scared. (Except the second book!)
0307742997|5.0|Another serial murder mystery by a Scandinavian author, this time a Norwegian, and Detective Harry Hole takes us through a labyrinth of Norse names and Oslo places before this 454 page novel winds to a climactic end. Actually I counted about four climaxes before the final one. There's no Girl with a Dragon Tattoo in this one, no journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and no Stieg Larsson stringing out the plot and fleshing out the characters, but there is a detective Harry Hole known for being the only Norwegian who worked on a serial murder case, and there is the most unlikely object of horror, the eponymous Snowman, whose appearance after a snowfall presages the downfall of another innocent victim. If you've read or seen any of Larsson's Millennium Trilogy and enjoyed them, you will be delighted to find Jo Nesbø, unlike Larsson, is still alive and kicking out marvelous mystery novels, like The Snowman, the one Sara saw when she looked out the window of her bedroom.<br /><br />[page 6] Sara pulled herself up onto her knees. Got up and looked into the garden. And there, there was the face.<br />  She laughed out loud with relief. The face was white, with eyes and a mouth made with black pebbles, probably from the drive. And arms made from twigs off the apple trees.<br />  \\"Heavens,\\" she gasped. \\"It's only a snowman.\\"<br /><br />\\"Only a snowman\\" -- those words will never be repeated again in the course of and the curses of this novel.<br /><br />. . .  This novel is a book gripper, so if you're reading on a Kindle, be careful not to break the delicate screen. Don't start it unless you have a day or two ahead with nothing planned. I would not want an air traffic controller to start this book one night before going to work on the graveyard shift and not be able to think of anything but whether the latest strawman is the Snowman. Or whether Harry is going down the hole as a scapegoat on this escapade. Or whether Rakel, his main squeeze, will survive her turn on the E-Ticket Snowman Ride. It's all in here. Don't do as I did with Stieg Larsson's book and wait for the movie. This book is by far more interesting and more fun than any movie. And its movie, when it inevitably arrives, will be more interesting if you have first suffered through the enjoyment of the book.

030758836X|3.0|Spoilers within. Ye be warned.<br /><br />My book club chose this book, and I was excited because the reviews made it sound so amazing. Everyone raved about how the surprises were so surprising and the twists were so... twisty. I'll admit, I really enjoyed the first act, where we were only getting Amy through her journal. I loved Nick's flashbacks especially, deliciously implying that he was as guilty as sin.<br /><br />When we hit Act Two and got the real Amy, all I could think was, \\"Of COURSE she did. Of COURSE she is.\\" But I still strapped myself in and went along for the ride. At the point where we were getting more Amy than Nick, I was ready to give up - particularly once Amy found her \\"hideout\\" and started planning a way to get back to Nick. I kept on.<br /><br />And finally we get to the third act, where we plod painfully to a resolution.<br /><br />Nothing happens. I mean it. Nothing. Nick, Go, and Boney sit around waiting for things to happen, and then Amy is up to the same old Amy antics, as usual. While that very end bit surprised me, again, all I could say was, \\"Of COURSE. Why didn't we see this coming?\\" (Especially Nick. I mean, I thought you were a smart guy, Nick. You should have known this was going to happen.) The ending was terrible, unsatisfying, and made everyone look weak and spineless and pathetic. I'm sure that was the point, but why spend hundreds of pages building characters just to hang them all out to dry? I'm not going to pretend to know a lot about writing, but I felt like there were just no characters to care about here. Nick was maybe the most sympathetic, but he was also the most pathetic (heh, lame word play. Sorry). I felt like the author just gave up, or decided this was the only way to get out without killing someone off. I would have rather seen a main character die (either one, take your pick) than to see them remain together. Ugh. Cop. Out.<br /><br />All that to say the book was just \\"Meh\\" with an unsatisfying ending and unlikeable characters. I think I'll be passing on the rest.
0982954328|5.0|After watching so many of Sherlock Holmes' adventures in the Black & White films over the years, it was sheer pleasure to hold in my hands a small red-covered cloth-bound book of 124 pages which contained all the original words of Arthur Conan Doyle. No longer did some script-writer come between me and the master detective story writer and his creations. I was back at the helm of my adventure into the dark moor. With my inner ears I could hear the howling of the fearsome hound, and in my imagination observe the deer sucked into the great Grimpen Mire. My heart rate was the up tempo background music letting me know that the \\"game was afoot.\\" I could follow the very thoughts of Dr. Watson as he attempted to assist his colleague, Sherlock Holmes, in uncovering the mystery, striving ever to stay alive while doing so.<br /><br />The game begins with a cane left behind by a visitor the night before. Watson shares his deduction with Holmes and is greeted with responses of Good!, Excellent! \\"Perfectly sound!\\" and when Watson finally says, \\"Then I was right!\\" Holmes replies \\"To that extent.\\"<br /><br />[page 2]\\"Has anything escaped me?\\" I asked with some self-importance. \\"I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?\\"<br />  \\"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous. When I said you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.\\"<br /><br />Apparently Sherlock Holmes, like God, never wastes a mistake. Later when Holmes inquires of the cabman who his fare was that day, he identifies him as \\"Sherlock Holmes.\\" Dr. Watson records Holmes' surprise, which in movie fare would only be hinted at by the actor playing Holmes. Note the use of the word \\"foil\\" in Holmes' response to his surprise. It is a fencing metaphor about being touched by an epee, a foil, during a fencing bout. Holmes was foiled in the sense of an opponent slipping in a touch during a fencing match and also in the sense being thrown off the track of his prey. A subtle and poetic use of ambiguity by the master author, Doyle.<br /><br />[page 36] Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabman's reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he burst into a hearty laugh.<br />  \\"A touch, Watson -- an undeniable touch!\\" said he. \\"I feel a foil as quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily that time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?\\"<br /><br />Another gem of literary note is when Dr. Watson comments in a letter to Holmes about his complete indifference to whether the Sun moved round the Earth or the Earth round the Sun. (Page 55) This would be precisely the position one might take who was versed in Alfred Korzybski's Science and Sanity. Both ways of describing the motion of the Sun and Earth are merely maps, and whereas the maps may represent the territory, it can never include all of the territory, and more importantly, making a map does not change the territory one whit!<br /><br />Soon an escaped convict who murdered someone, and another stranger, who is spotted in a tower by night, are loose on the moor, which is a most inhospitable place with no means of acquiring food. All this heightens the mystery as we move into the second half of the book, in which Dr. Watson is mucking about in the moor along with Dr. Mortimer, Stapleton (a naturalist), Stapleton's sister, and of course the unseen, looming presence of the great Hound. One feels like the plot of this book has gotten stuck in the great Grimpen mire, and cannot be extirpated. But just then, there's even more: a lady's initials L. L. shows up on a crumbling note and must be identified.<br /><br />Dr. Watson undertakes a daring plan to ensnare the murderer, Seldon, who is apparently living in one of the ancient stone dwellingsin the moor. Gun loaded, he waits through the night, and instead of Seldon, he ensnares the strangest quarry of them all. We catch a hint of who this quarry may have been in this next passage. But who can it be?<br /><br />The tale winds to a dramatic conclusion and all the loose ends are tied up. If it can be said that, \\"All writers can be found under Gogol's Overcoat\\", then surely all mystery writers can be found breathing in the smoke from Sherlock Holmes' pipe. One can spot a close similarity to the way the mystery is revealed to us, deepens, spreads out in many directions, and then is all pulled back together neatly in both Sherlock Holmes stories and the modern TV series, The Closer.<br /><br />We have closed the book on the mysterious Hound of the Baskervilles. He has led us on a merry chase through the pages of this novel, howling dreadfully right on cue. We have been interrupted by no TV commercials nor had to watch obnoxious previews of coming attractions. The projector bulb did not burn out and the projector operator did not miss the third reel. Our popcorn was popped fresh a few feet from our comfortable seat. No one answered a cell phone the next seat over and began talking during the chase over the moor. All in all we spent a marvelous couple of hours in the magical world woven by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. We have gained a new respect for his marvelous writing. Actors and directors may come and go, screens may turn Technicolor and High Definition, but the original handwritten words of Arthur Conan Doyle will ever conjure their magic for all future generations of readers.<br /><br />This is a condensed version of the full review which can be found via DIGESTWORLD ISSUE#089 by Bobby Matherne.in the moor.

B009EBLCK8|5.0|Best Sherlock Holmes format to date..moves, shows etc. Brilliant idea of depicting Holmes in the 21st century. Wish Benedict Cumberbatch played this role in the movie instead of Robert Downey Jr. ( No disrespect, hell of an actor). Cumberbatch is just made for this role

But the best part about this version is the window, that you slide with each page.  So as the child learns what is next he/she begins to reach for the window.  So cute.

Overall this is a must have for Zelda fans anywhere.

006441034X|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle (1986) is a standalone Fantasy novel.  It is set in the Kingdom of Ingary.  The royal wizard and the king's brother have both disappeared within the Waste.<br /><br />In this novel, Sophie Hatter is the stepdaughter of Fanny Hatter.  Sophie is oldest of three sisters.  Naturally, she realizes that she will never win a prince.  Yet she is good natured and better at making her sisters mind than her stepmother.<br /><br />Lettie Hatter is the second stepdaughter of Fanny Hatter. She also knows that she will not win a prince.<br /><br />Martha Hatter is the daughter of Fanny Hatter.  All know that she will probably win a prince.<br /><br />Howl is a wizard who lives in a moving castle.  He has a very bad reputation.<br /><br />Michael is an orphan who was allowed into Howl's home.  Now he is Howl's apprentice.<br /><br />Calcifer is a fire demon.  He has a contract with Howl.<br /><br />The Witch of the Waste is a very evil person.  Even Howl is afraid of her.<br /><br />In this story, Fanny cannot afford to keep the girls in school after their father dies.  Sophie had just graduated and was ready to move on, but Lettie and Martha had to drop out.  Fanny gets Martha apprenticed to Mrs. Fairfax, the local witch and Lettie apprenticed to the bakery shop.<br /><br />Sophie was trained to take over the hattery.  She already knew most everything about the shop and took over trimming the hats.  She worked long hours and spent most of her time talking to the hats.<br /><br />The hats she trimmed were well received and attracted the attention of marriageable men.  One customer married a count and the Mayor's wife has very contented with her own.  Yet Sophie was working very hard and going nowhere.<br /><br />Sophie wants to visit her sisters, but keeps putting off the trip.  Then on May Day, she goes to visit Lettie at the bakery.  Yet the sister she finds is Martha.  She had swapped places with Lettie and both were much happier.  Still, Martha says that Fanny is exploiting Sophie.<br /><br />Then the Witch of the Waste comes into the hattery one evening and curses Sophie.  The girl grows old and gets the aches and pains of the aged.  So Sophie leaves the shop and goes out into the night.<br /><br />While she is wandering, she frees a scarecrow from a hedge.  Later she cuts a trapped dog from another hedge.  At least she gets a walking stick out of that encounter.<br /><br />When she gets to the top of the cliff overlooking the town, she discovers a tall, thin, black and ugly castle rumbling toward her.  Sophie imagines a warm hearth inside and orders the castle to stop.  She hobbles up to it and tries to reach the door, but something keeps her away.<br /><br />She walks around the castle and finally finds a door that she can reach.  The castle starts moving again and she hits the door with her stick.  The door pops open and Sophie gets one leg through the door.  Then she pulls herself inside.<br /><br />Michael is standing just inside the door. He is only a little older than Martha.  Sophie pushes him aside and dives into a chair.  Her aches and pains are worse after all the walking and the chair is blissfully comfortable.<br /><br />Sophie notices that something is moving in the grate.  It is Calcifer eating the logs that Michael has provided.  Sophie later converse with Calcifer and agrees to break his contract if he will release her from the old age spell.<br /><br />Sophie starts cleaning the castle, despite vehement comments from both Howl and Michael.  Howl orders her not to touch his room or the back yard.  Everything else is finally spick and span.<br /><br />This tale puts Howl into a bind between the King and the Witch of the Waste.  The King wants Howl to find his brother.  The Witch wants to have Calcifer.<br /><br />Sophie was fairly timid as a girl, but now she is a cranky old lady.  The sequel to this novel is [[ASIN:0061477958 House of Many Ways]].<br /><br />Highly recommended for Jones fans and foranyone else who enjoys tales of magical arts, kingdom politics, and a bit of romance.  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin

At first I thought oh man another over styled auto runner  by a dev with a stupid bit reference as a name. watched intro with lame humor and was about to uninstall. the game is really solid and starts getting challenging shortly into it. the levels are really well thought out and the ability to move plat forms and interact with the level are great. the controls are responsive and the art design is nice.  The ability to rewind the game on the fly is great for those of us that do not have time to keep playing a level over and over. Give this one a shot.

B00ANW33CM|4.0|The 3-d aspect makes it more interesting than the regular mahjong game. It starts off easy and get more intersting, which is good. I like it.
