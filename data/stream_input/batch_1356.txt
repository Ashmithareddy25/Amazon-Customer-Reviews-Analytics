B005FNGAD8|5.0|Sigma Sound Studios review:<br /><br />With limber fingers, a young-sounding voice that's perfectly in tune, a harmonica in tow and a good band behind him, Billy Joel effortlessly flies through the 1972 performance at Sigma Sound Studios for WMMR FM in Philadelphia. Recorded in an age when the audience couldn't text their friends while watching, the Sigma Sound concert highlights a fresh-sounding Billy Joel, an already-seasoned artist who knew how to work the crowd. Between songs, it's cool to hear Joel's heavy New York accent as he jokes around and sips frothy beer in front of a polite audience. Joel, a classically trained pianist, sounds sure of himself but also a touch unassuming, like he hasn't forgotten his roots by a longshot. The recording is boxy but also very real. (Apparently a bad drumming mistake by Rhys Clark during \\"Captain Jack\\" was sadly fixed by Frank Filipetti in the 2009 mix.) There's a subdued ambiance from the crowd but excitement in the songs -- and an aura from the featured artist that conveys superstardom is not far away.<br /><br />All these early songs in the Sigma performance are classics -- reflective, tuneful and honest. As the performance winds down, the musicians are at their best. \\"Josephine\\" is a rollicking number dedicated to \\"an old rock `n' roll chick\\"; the somber \\"Rosalinda\\" is a lullaby dedicated to a chick who happens to be Joel's mother; and toward the end of the contemplative closer, \\"Tomorrow is Today,\\" the band is at its loosest. From the beginning to the finale, the special live radio show captures a natural and emerging star in his hopeful and talented youth.<br /><br />\\"Piano Man\\" review:<br /><br />The frenzied but beautiful banjo played by Eric Weissberg on the \\"Piano Man's\\" opener, \\"Travelin' Prayer,\\" sounds like the start of a new, hopeful day. The song is a prayer from Billy Joel to his girlfriend, sung in a rushed, heartfelt way. It's a country-oriented ditty that is a pleasurable mix of fun and worried foresightedness, as Joel lists off the potential hazards that could befall anyone. \\"Travelin' Prayer\\" is a spirited start to a timeless record.<br /><br />Spun incessantly on my parent's turntable, the album \\"Piano Man\\" marked my introduction to music as a youngster (it was released the same year I was born). Its storytelling songs, surprising eclecticism and elegant quality made quite an impression. Hearing the lyrics of \\"Piano Man\\" (the song) may be blas&eacute; for many people these days (due to its constant rotation on the radio and jukeboxes), but it's still a powerful, poignant tune. Like \\"Piano Man,\\" many songs on the rest of the record are narratives that stem from an astute raconteur musician who had already done some serious living by his 20s. Most often Joel's stories on the record relate phases of life, usually through the eyes of the young and invariably depressing -- thankfully periods people grow out of.<br /><br />Billy Joel would rock harder at times later on in his career, but in 1973 he seemed to be aiming for essence and style. Listening to an album like \\"Piano Man\\" takes you back to a time when songs possessed less audio aggression and overly processed elements such as compression. Producer Michael Stewart made an airtight, crisp-sounding record full of dramatic highs and lows in the choruses and an intimate feel. Joel's sensitivity and old-soul tendencies give \\"Piano Man\\" further charm. Joel, of course, is a one-of-a-kind talent who shined on every album of his career in various ways. \\"Piano Man\\" showcases him at the top of his game, espcially side one.<br /><br />Thanks for the rock and roll inauguration, Billy.zards that could befall anyone. \\"Travelin' Prayer\\" is a spirited start to a timeless record.

B00064WSOQ|5.0|Mr. Fripp and his team of musicians (Pat Mastelotto - Drums, Trey Gunn - Bass, Adrian Belew - Guitar) are forces to be reckoned with.  They are on point for this incredible album.  I absolutely love to turn up the volume very high on track 2, \\"Level Five\\", track 4, \\"Elektrik\\", and track 7, \\"Dangerous Curves\\".  I like Bill Bruford, but Pat Mastelotto's style is amazingly tight, elusive, strange, Hypnotizing, and uncompromising.  Trey Gunn's basses are also on point, using sounds so different from your typical bassist.  Adrian Belew's guitar and voice are just as impressive.  Robert Fripp's guitar is better than ever. I never get tired of playing this album all the way through.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|Well thought out, good balance. Very fun game. Worked great on my fire! Looking forward to more from this dev.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun game, needs at least a few directions however (like, what are the different kinds of nuts?). Also something is missing with depth perception,&amp; there are invisible boundaries that prevent you from avoiding a tree if it is at the edge-but nothing to indicate that an edge exists til u try to zig, and too late find you cannot. That being said, it is really, really addicting. The goals are just challenging enough to keep you trying, not so hard that you give up,&amp;u have a choice of 3 goals.has a lot of potential.
B006ON41FC|4.0|pretty fun and immediately addicting! easy to play. fun for the whole family. my husband and children all love it.
0312641893|5.0|Cyborg Cinderella in the setting of a Dystopian New Beijing! I never imagined such a fantastic twist to the classic tale.  Cinder is a mechanic, and a cyborg. One day, Prince Kai shows up at her workshop to have his robot repaired & there starts her love story. Same day though, Cinder's sister (Cinder is adopted) contracts the plague & is sent to the disease wards to die. Her adoptive mother, enraged, gives Cinder up for research purposes & is sure she'll die of the same plague. Instead, Cinder happens to be immune & is sent back home after agreeing to become voluntary research subject.  Cinder does fall in love with the Prince & does go to the ball, too - but instead of a glass slipper, she leaves behind her robotic foot!  Really good book - best of 2012 yet.

B006UG90RM|4.0|Ok, let's face it.  We were all prepared to be let down by this album.  For the past 5 years the internet has been chock full of tales of David Lee Roth's vocal demise.  Youtube videos of a less than stellar Eddie Van Halen have also been found in abundance.  The last tour with Hagar was a disaster.  The last tour with Roth got inconsistent reviews depending on what shape Eddie was in on any given night.  With the announcement of a new Van Halen album in the works I think most of us were hoping for greatness, but thinking that the reality would be far less than that.  Well.....guess what......this band has got it's groove back and \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" is a damn fine heavy rock album.  No synthesizers or ballads to be found here.  This is an all out rock n roll assault that barley slows down from beginning to end.  Roth is in fine voice, Eddie and Alex have never played better.  Wolfgang holds down the bottom end just fine.  The album does miss Michael Anthony's background vocals which is too bad, but not a showstopper.  Yes, some of these tracks are resurrected old outtakes from years gone by that have been dusted up and re-wired, but to my ears this does not really matter.  The first time I heard the single \\"Tattoo\\" I was less than impressed, but damn if the song will not leave my head after a couple of listens.  Other highlights include \\"She's The Woman\\", \\"You And Your Blues\\", the rocking \\"Bullethead\\", and the sequel to \\"Ice Cream Man\\" called \\"Stay Frosty\\".  I only have two problems with the album.  My first is an old gripe that I have had with Van Halen for years.  Considering they have one of the best guitarists on the planet, they never branch out much musically.  Most of the songs are in the 3 to 4 minute range and I wish they would stretch out and jam a bit more than they do.  Oh well, they have never really done this, so I guess to expect it at this stage of the game would be too much to ask for.  My other problem with the album is the recording.  As others have mentioned this is yet another modern album that is compressed to death so the drums and bass sound like they are buried in mud.  I realize this is for the ear bud generation, but it sure takes away from the enjoyment when played on a good stereo system or even a good car stereo system.  Other than that though, this album is solid and a very nice comeback from the VanHalen crew.  Solid four stars from me.others have mentioned this is yet another modern album that is compressed to death so the drums and bass sound like they are buried in mud.

B0071QIN00|3.0|The game isn't bad, but some of the difficulties are through the roof and the glitches that cause you to get stuck inside of an object or on the edge of a ramp are numerous. I finally stopped playing out of sheer frustration. At least Trails HD is balanced on its difficulty and relatively bug free. This game is no Trials HD...not by a long shot.  On the plus side it runs very smoothly on my TouchPad with Cyanogen and the graphics are not as bad as other's make them out to be. As for people who complain about it not being for kids, there is some cleavage. OH NOEZZZZZZ!!! Get a life. There is no reason to not let kids at least try to play this unless you're an obsessive prude of a parent. Don't be surprised if the kid gives up out of frustration, though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I simply loved this book the moment I starting reading. Katniss having to provide for her mother and sister really made me think about how much I have. Having three books in one is such a steal for he price. I recommend this book to everyone, young or old, because of how real the characters are. Read this book!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is so fun too play on my kindle fire and it is challenging but it still is very fun. ;)
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Extremely easy to use and figure out. Really aids in pinpointing dead coverage spots in your home wifi network, as well as finding the most powerful publicly-accessible hot spots when you're out and about. Easily one of the most useful apps I've found for my Kindle Fire. This one is a 'gotsta-have'!

B0030ZOYHC|4.0|A few years back, I heard the Evangelion anime series described as \\"the Watchmen of anime.\\"  I rented the first disc (episodes 1-4 of the original edition) and thought \\"Eh, it's okay.\\"  A couple of months ago, I decided to give the series another shot by buying 1.11.  Wow.  The story is pretty much the same as before (of episodes 1-6, I gather), but the animation quality is so much better.  I would call it \\"state of the art\\" if I knew what the state of the art is, but the CGI and painted animation blend together beautifully.  The Sixth Angel in particular...but I suppose I should describe the story.<br /><br />In the near future, the Earth has been under attack by giant beings called \\"Angels.\\"  During an event called \\"The Second Impact,\\" half of the population of the world was destroyed.  The NERV organization has built an enormous base underground in Japan from which they operate the Evangelions (Evas for short), which are apparently gigantic mechanical-organic robots.  These Evas can only be piloted by certain teenagers (for reasons which may be explained later).  Most of the plot of this first film deals with Shinji Ikari (pilot of Eva unit 01) as he fights the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Angels.<br /><br />If the series were nothing but giant robots (or mechas) fighting giant monsters, it wouldn't be as interesting as it is.  Some people complain about \\"whiney Shinji,\\" but how would you feel if all of a sudden you were required to pilot a giant robot, having had no training of any kind, and if you fail the human race will end?  And the man who created the Evas is your father and your mother died when you were a baby and now you're living with a hot 29 female year old Lt Colonel and this kid at school puched you in the face and there's this other Eva pilot who you kinda like, but she has blue hair and she's so spaced out she seems inhuman and...well.  Also, behind NERV is a secret society called Seele, whose members speak of \\"Lilith\\" and \\"the Human Instrumentality Project.\\"  What are they up to?  Well, you'll have to continue with the series to find out.<br /><br />Ratings-wise, I suppose it would be PG-13 due to violence and a few moments of fanservice.<br /><br />I suppose if someone told me Watchmen was the best comic of all time and then handed me issue #1, I would have thought, \\"Eh, it's okay.\\"<br /><br />Blu-ray extras:<br /><br />Rebuild of Evangelion: two 15 minute clips that illustrate how this new version was animated (actually, it's the same clip with different music.  The second clip is to \\"Bolero.\\")<br />3 preview clips of this movie, with the \\"Beautiful World\\" theme song.<br />8 trailers for other anime series/films.roject.\\"  What are they up to?

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game! its really cool to have so many games in one app. it also has some rather fun games not just bad lame ones.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|After I received my Fire, I spent a rather large chunk of time researching cases- I poured over reviews, googled, and watched all the 'how-to' type videos. I liked this case from marware right off the bat, and it still stood strong at the end of my investigation. As I type this, I am holding my Fire securely tucked in to the case in question.   The quality exceeds my expectations. Those who said otherwise, I firmly disagree. The material is extremely strong and durable, lightweight, comfortable to hold, and protects the Kindle to my satisfaction.  I chose the color in white, and there is no odor nor defects.  As far as the cases' ability to stand in a horizantal position, it does its job. Like other reviewers have said, the flexibility of the creases needs to be broken in- this is one of those common sense 'duh' things in my opinion, so I don't understand people who complain about it.  I highly reccomend this case, I'm absolutely 100% happy with it. It exceeds my expectations as far as functionality, feels good and looks sleek.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I am not sure how long Ive spent playing this game in one sitting. I also like the fact that you can shop for extra apparel after collecting the acorns. Its so fun!
B005HSL626|5.0|I really thought that this game was awesome on the iPod so I know it'll be good on my kindle fire! and I agree, the bombs look cool! it looks like the whole screen is cracking an
B002IYEQR4|5.0|Yes, it is not Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons Watchmen; but it's the be all end all film version of Watchmen.  Zack Snyder described it in Wondercon as the fans cut, and truly, this deluxe edition is simply meant solely for fans of the comic.  Impatient viewers will not likely tolerate the addition of 45 minutes to the theatrical edition, especially if the animated scenes do not necessarily \\"make sense\\" to some as a foil to the fall of Ozymandias.  This of course is also a reference film for presenting the quality of picture that Blu-ray can give.  Definitely worth owning.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This glad rocks i use it all the time. it is my new obsession i recommend this to all my friends. If you ever want a good virtual card game get this one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love these games...they are fun and they pass time very fast. i would recommend to anyone! some of the games can be kind of hard but overall its a great game.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|After watching this movie, I rate it as just good at best. The original is so much better than this one. The original was just plain scary and had better charactors. Watch the first one with Kurt Russell first then this one and you'll see what I mean.
B006ON41FC|2.0|its ok but the items cost to much personally I think they should have made the acorns worth more with each pass through the loop and that's another shortcoming this game has its loop is so short that it becomes repetitive quickly
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the app is okay, it more of fun lil quick games, some r a lil Corney yet some r kinda fun!
B005TBWN0K|5.0|cute app love to send notes to people. easy to use. have it on kindle and on droid phone so can use it on bith
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the solitaire. we all know and love to play. It is a good game for relaxing from your daily routine. It also have a healthy addictive quality. If you enjoy solitaire you will enjoy this game.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|When I first began to watch this movie, I saw the V character and was immediately put off by the campy nature of the character, and stopped watching.  But after hearing rave praise from friends, I decided to go back and finish it.  I am SO glad I did!  This movie has a superhero vibe about it, but the message of human dignity and the triumph of human spirit in the face of heinous authoritarianism is wonderful, honest, and an important message.  This movie seems prophetic in light of the Arab Spring!
B006ON41FC|5.0|one of the best games I have ever played in my life very entertaining. game espically when you are into adventure.  if you like angry birds you will like this
B006NFKUF6|4.0|This is a cool game. The demo is short but I think for $1 its worth it. A lot of fun if you like throwing shuriken at ninjas. I didn't get the health system tho, you could just stand there getting hit and it doesn't matter.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I played for 4 days straight and couldn't go to work because I was so engrossed, I love it! I also think they stole the red bird from me because I lost mine and now its in the game
B006ON41FC|3.0|although this may be fun, with the powerups and goals, this game really needs to work on the way you play it. Although it has the little circles at the beginning where you put your fingers, they disappear after a few seconds, making it hard to control the squirrell.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|How have I not heard about this film? This is a family film at heart but as a fantasy storybook movie this is tops. I rank it up there with equals from the same genre like Legend and The Princess Bride. This is definitely worth the watch regardless if you have a significant other or children. Give it a try you will not be disappointed. Oh and by the way Roberrt DeNiro's role is funny as heck even to the end.

B006ZEDZNY|5.0|The &#34;Rum Diary&#34; takes us to 1960 Puerto Rico, as we fly in - to the tune of &#34;Volare&#34; - aboard a small engine plane with Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp).  He's the &#34;fresh meat&#34; for the local paper, a journalist and self-proclaimed &#34;failed author&#34;, although throughout this film you will find him quite dedicated to his post in his own laughably risible style.<br /><br />The first day of his new job, he is still quite fueled from the previous rum-soaked night and the editor-in-chief Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) is already questioning his morals and his capability to do the work. Of course, we are seeing Johnny Depp portray an interesting character that is intoxicated the major part of this movie and I felt is hilarious while dishing it out.<br /><br />Kemp is introduced to Rob Sala (Michael Rispoli), the 'staff recorder', and later to Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi), the 'religious correspondent'.  These job titles are certainly a laugh in themselves as they are not even close to what these guys are up to - if they even know themselves. They go in and out of the paper's office, argue constantly with Lotterman and go out in whatever misguided direction that they came in from. Keep an eye on Ribisi's character, Moberg, as I think he steals the show in several places. Kemp was brought into this sinking ship of a paper to appease the locals and try to keep it afloat. This is a kind of slack-off position for Kemp to have to handle, one he does genuinely with an 80 to 151 proof gusto.<br /><br />The 'problem' arises when Kemp and his buddies begin to care about the paper and sympathize with the people of San Juan, then start to believe in their rights as readers of it.  Aaron Eckhart hands in a great portrayal of the arrogant cad and filthy rich entrepreneur, &#34;Sanderson&#34;. Amber Heard is &#34;Chenault&#34;, his beguiling girlfriend and also Kemp's object of desire.<br /><br />Depp's mannerisms, facial expressions, and sarcastic humor are all spot-on. I definitely can see why he was personally behind the project.  One does not have to be a Hunter S. Thompson fan to enjoy this movie whatsoever.  It is not like &#34;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#34; as it may appear to be compared to. Same author - Different situation (semi-autobiographical account) although one hallucinogenic type scene does take place. Moberg floats in and out of the head-state he is in to end up really enjoying Kemp, and gains a respect for him also.  Eventually, these three are sharing an apartment for a while.  Their delusive conversations are priceless. Directed by Bruce Robinson who adapts from his own screenplay, we have a plot which I enjoyed very much by just taking it for what it is; a Johnny Depp comedy/drama.  The characters in this film turn in much regional color and flavor while Kemp's two cohorts (Sala and Moberg) add shot after shot of liquor-fueled comedy.  Some of the situations that these three get into are over-the-top and make you think, Is this really based on a true story? - Yep.definitely can see why he was personally behind the project.

B005BY3XHC|4.0|I've really enjoyed this book! It continues to help me to connect knowledge with practice. I finally feel like I'm creating a deeper connection with my mind, body and soul. I love most of what Deepak Chopra has written and I'm adding this book to my list of favourites (like [[ASIN:1400054311 The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence (Chopra, Deepak)]], and [[ASIN:B002X4BBK4 Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind Body Medicine (Bantam New Age Books)]]) This book also reminds me of another fantastic book I'm reading, which I'd recommend: [[ASIN:B00720LKKU From The Chariot: Yoga Wisdom For Modern Living]]

1439102813|5.0|This is an amazing and thought-provoking read.  Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease from the prospective of the 50-year old patient and her family.  The story is intense, yet easy to read.  It offers an insight into the progression and heartbreak of Alzheimer's.  I am looking forward to reading the author's other books.

B0050DIWHU|4.0|I read this book in one sitting after hearing Reid Hoffman speak. I bought it without even looking at the ridiculously self-serving blurbs from the authors' pals that feature above these reviews. That's a good thing, because the blurbs actually are the first thing that make me think less of Mr. Hoffman.  Other than the corny title and the overused statement that we're all entrepreneurs, I liked the tone of this book. It doesn't go into mushy self-help territory but just states in a direct way how to best navigate the realities of the modern job market. The combination of focusing on your skills, your aspirations and - the key - market realities makes a lot of sense. The hints on how to best use your network, even though a bit heavy on the use of LinkedIn, are also helpful.  As other reviewers have said, nothing here is really new. That's true, but it's much more straigthforward than most other career books which dwell on the job seeker's dreams without taking into account that dreaming ends when you hit the realities of the job market. It's a tough world out there.  There's one key weakness in the book, though. It's the fact that the authors' buddies are featured over and over again. Most of us don't hang out in Silicon Valley with a bunch of succesful entrepreneurs, as the authors do. I'm not sure that the lessons drawn largely from experiences within these narrow confines are always adaptable to the realities of others in a more balanced middle America.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Entertaining! Challenging without being frustrating. Doesn't get boring - not only are there different levels but also various modes, like puzzle and rampage. Clever and funny game titles. Adorably animated characters.

B004LWZW42|5.0|Gone is the campiness that has plagued many of the previous Marvel movies. The writers of this flick deserve to be praised for their mature, intelligent take on the origins of the X-Men and their enemies. I know many die-hard comic fans will not like the movie, but for the more casual fans like myself, this movie is a great take on the world of superheroes. There are, of course, many scenarios that require a suspension of disbelief... but if you can't do that, you probably shouldn't be watching a movie about comic book characters, right?<br /><br />Of particular genius is the relationship that is explored between the young Magneto and Xavier. Their friendship is genuine and heartfelt, and by the end of the movie, you are convinced that they have become spiritual brothers... although they must unfortunately become enemies due to irreconcilable differences in their fundamental beliefs. You actually feel that each of them is justified in their philosophical views, considering what their life experiences have been. In fact, many viewers will be more sympathetic toward the future \\"villain\\", Magneto, than to Professor X.<br /><br />The actors that portray Magneto and Xavier are brilliant. They give an unquestionable dignity and credibility to the characters. It would have been real easy to screw up an origin story of these legendary characters, but the actors and writers nailed it.<br /><br />I especially liked how there were no big name actors in this movie (other than a hilarious cameo by Hugh Jackman). The lack of recognizable faces was a welcome breath of fresh air... It helped to establish credibility in this fictional universe, and honestly, the actors did as good of a job as anyone in Hollywood.<br /><br />It also bears mentioning that the character of \\"Azazel\\" - who is essentially the Devil Incarnate, is incredible. I'm not a huge comic fan, so I've never even heard of him, but... jeez, he's \\"effective\\". I dare say he would give Wolverine a run for his money!<br /><br />On a final note, the manner in which the story is weaved into the Cuban Missile Crisis and the height of the Cold War is brilliant. Once more, the writers deserve great praise for their efforts!ory is weaved into the Cuban Missile Crisis and the height of the Cold War is brilliant. Once more, the writers deserve great praise for their efforts!
1405677864|1.0|I was hopeful that this performance would be as entertaining as other radio-plays I've encountered in the past (Dr Who, Sherlock Holmes, and STAR WARS for example).<br /><br />I couldn't have been more wrong.  These people took Clarke's novel and striped it to the minimum facts.  The play covers the basics of the novel -- but that's all.  Many many things are cut from the story.  Most notable being Jan Rodrick's stay on the Overlord's home world.  He had an extensive stay in the novel -- here he almost immediately breaks down and they ship him back home. When he arrives, he learns about what happened to \\"the children\\" and then only a few DAYS later, the climax of the novel takes place; in the book he was back on earth for years before that happened.<br /><br />There is no mention of the Overmind -- a major plot element in the novel.<br /><br />Stormgren's smuggling of a device onto Karellen's ship in an attempt to see Karellen's true form -- a significant event -- never happens.<br /><br />The two major speeches by Karellen to mankind -- \\"the stars are not for man\\" -- don't occur.<br /><br />The suicide destruction of New Athens by atomic bomb never occurs; instead one of the characters swims out to sea to drown herself.<br /><br />And there were things added that were definitely NOT in the novel to begin with.  The biggest of these is a series of mass murders of children -- like a set of instances that happened (off screen) in the movie VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1963).  No such event occurred in the novel.<br /><br />Chuck Jones once said that he took the 17 hour opera \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen\\" and cut it down to 5 minutes (\\"What's Opera, Doc?\\") -- this work gives me the same feeling.<br /><br />So much was cut out; too much.  If I had know what was on this recording BEFORE hand, I would not have ordered it.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|been looking for this album in stores for weeks before I thought to order it on-line. Super fast arrival. Probably gonna wear out my CD player listening to this music so often
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is realy fun and it doesn't get old. I don't why people thought openfeight didn't work, because it hasn't been a problem at all.
B006ON41FC|2.0|I was gonna rate this game 5 stars... but the on screen control do not response to my touch most or half of the time.

B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is much more fun than I initially thought from my first few plays. It is subtly clever and the animation is nice.
B006ON41FC|5.0|the game is super fun but my permanent helmet wont activate. good time waster though. the graphics are great with very little lag
B006ON41FC|2.0|the open feint sucks and the review us thing is annoying. game itself is good but bugs need to be worked out. lags some. drives me crazy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|unlocking the games is a pain but also it is rewarding. I just wish the games weren't timed. Very rewarding game otherwise

091581112X|5.0|I truly love this book. The meditations are easy to do and they work! I feel A new power within. I am a new, improved version of me.<br />I have read other books on the subject but this one just gets deep into ones soul. A must read and practice!<br />Love Sanaya!!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I noticed a lot of complaints about the vocals on this one being too laid back, low key and breathy. I think it's sexy as all get out! I grew up listening to her type of music played and sung by Sinatra, Bennett, Mantovani, Julie London, Nelson Riddle, Jack Jones, Mancini, Percy Faith etc. I love that era even though it's gone I still enjoy listening to swing, jazz, vocals, soundtracks and other music from the fifties and sixties. Krall is a great performer. I've seen her twice (15 yrs ago first time) and I swear to God she was the sexiest woman (next to my wife..) I've ever seen or heard. Great voice. She just sat there at the piano and did her cool thing. It was magic both times. She's a great jazz pianist as well. I don't care if some think she's become more commercial. What the hey does that mean? It's all a dream anyway, just enjoy it..<br /><br />This album is very cool and easy. Easy living and loving, and made for just that. Her vocals still turn me on. I have all of her work. This album is right there with her best. It's just a little slower groove, that's all. I'm still a romantic sometimes, what the hell, why not.<br /> I will say that as good as her version of Quiet Nights is, Sinatra's is still the best to me. It was written from a male perspective so it's harder for her. The only other thing I can add is.....Elvis Costello is a Lucky Dog.....
B006ON41FC|2.0|sometimes free isn't even worth it! I'm so over the flying through the woods games. or running through the.woods. weak sauce!

1451627289|5.0|I had given up on Stephen King years ago - I enjoyed Misery, Needful Things and others but recently didn't like his newer works.  WOW!  11/22/63 was fantastic!  Very interesting premise and very well researched and told.  I was a little freaked out to see some characters from 'It' appear (that book STILL gives me the willies after 15 years!).  I've recommended this book to many family and friends.  Would definitely recommend to Stephen King fans AND JFK buffs!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love this game! Great! Love to play. Have had zero problems. Kind of addicting. Seven-year@old likes it as well. Two thumbs up.
B004QQWA84|5.0|I put off picking this album up for some time - big mistake.  Really excellent craftsmanship here - a solid album top to bottom.  Influences are early 80s, though its certainly not a knock off album.  The guitar/bass sound recalls Killers-era Iron Maiden, maybe Cirith Ungol.  Mercyful Fate often gets cited, but I hear this less.  Vocals are quite different than all of the above - I actually like In Solitude's front man better.  Much smoother.  There is a certain polish and melodic sensibility to these guys that recalls country mates Ghost, though the sound is different.  Definitely pick up the album - I listened to song snippets and was uninspired but when you hear the whole thing song-after-song you'll understand why this album was on so many top of 2011 lists.
B006ON41FC|4.0|it is a good app not to good not to bad graphics are good but shouldnt have fient all in. all a average. app

0307959856|2.0|When P.D.James pens a book, I read it; all of them, with great anticipation.  Of course, being a Jane Austen lover I think....Oh my! This will be good. But, never the twain should ever meet.  I began to be disappointed when Elizabeth and Darcy never interact!  The rehashing of all the \\"backlooking\\" becomes boring and frankly unnecessary.  I think the author should have caused someone who had never read Austen to think....Wait! I better go read this Pride and Predjudice first.  Even then, Death Comes to Pemberley has no spark.  I'm so sorry to say that it offended me when Ms. James also plugged in Persuasion and Emma characters almost haphazardly as if trying to beef up the storyline when it fell flat..  I love Ms. James writing in everything but this and would not recommend your buying it.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Very frustrating...fun and annoying. The controls are at one moment too sensitive and the next moment not responsive. Still I keep playing in spite of the anger...I'm totally addicted.  This would probably not be the best thing for kids.  For them (and my petty self), I predict horrible meltdowns and tantrums!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is loads of fun I recommend it for people of all ages. it has a good story to it you should buy it seriously
0307888908|5.0|Given that most are living in tumultuous times these days, it's good advice to prepare yourself to deal with it like a professional.  In this case, entrepreneurs are among the best prepared to deal with whatever is thrown their way- be they obstacles or potentially game-changing opportunities. Startup of You helps translate principles that entrepreneurs use in their start-ups to how individuals can leverage in their personal career. The book is a no-brainer for students given that they are graduating into a work-world that is very different than what they were expecting. But it offers a lot of practical advice on dealing with risk, tapping into our personal networks, and taking advantage of \\"breakout opportunities\\" that should be helpful to anyone regardless of age who is looking for personal strategies for a leg-up. A very good, quick read that is easy for me to recommend.

1582701709|4.0|First, let me state that this book and this review of it are intended for the audience of spiritual seekers who are interested in metaphysics. If you belong to that audience then this review is intended to help you decide if the book will suit your needs: whether you want an overview of \\"the law of attraction\\" or a more in depth study of one or more of its processes and principles. This book and this review are NOT intended for any other audience - including scientific materialists, and fundamentalist Christians. If you don't believe in the law of attraction, then you should not read this book and the rest of this review is not intended for you.  I try not to \\"grandstand\\" in my reviews. I try to write fair and balanced reviews that will help the (most likely) audience for this book to make a decision about whether or not they want to read it. Selfish reviewers use their reviews as a soapbox to promulgate their (often very nutty) ideologies, at the expense of the readers, the authors and Amazon. I do not. I write with the book's audience in mind.  To begin, this book is the perfect companion to the DVD. If you searched for this book after seeing the DVD, you will not be disappointed. It is not guilty of the vast majority of criticisms it receives from other Law of Attraction authors and coaches, who usually accuse it of missing one or another element in the metaphysical process of manifestation. If it is flawed, it's perhaps because it crams so *much* information and so *many* experts  into less than 200 pages that it is difficult to digest it in one read. This is a book you will need to read several times to absorb all the principles of manifestation. The DVD is the same way, although if you take notes while watching it you might come away with a better understanding. It's also very episodic and anecdotal, so that also makes it difficult to follow the entire line of thinking.  \\"The Secret\\" does *not* leave out important elements in the manifestation process. It justdoesn't have the space - since it is less than 200 pages - to delve deeply into each separate topic. Some readers have criticized it for \\"leaving out\\" the most important part of manifesting: getting yourself into the state of *feeling* as if the thing or experience you want is already a reality for you.  The book/film actually does a pretty good job of this, in Mike Dooley's segment. He gives a (facetious?) example of manifesting a car by imagining yourself actually driving the car, using all five senses. This example is often the target of criticism against this book because some people find it offensive or overly materialistic to manifest a luxury automobile. Whatever. Manifest a butterfly if you don't want a car. The basic principles are same, so try not to get hung up on the examples which are *only* examples. You can use the same method to manifest a relaxing, stress-free Christmas family gathering, with no bickering, and everyone's flights arriving at the airport on time. You could use it to manifest an acceptance letter from the university you want to attend. You can use it to manifest a job you love. Mike Dooley's DVD \\"Thoughts Become Things\\" [[ASIN:B00304YLMG Thoughts Become Things DVD by Mike Dooley]]gives several such examples from his own life. He also gives some tips he doesn't have time to cover in his short segment on \\"The Secret\\".  I also encourage you to seek out the individual web sites, books and DVD programs put out by the other experts on \\"The Secret.\\" Marie Diamond, for example, has a wonderful skype-type video podcast on her site, and you can search the archives and watch all her wonderful programs. If any concept in \\"The Secret\\" seems too simplistic, it's probably just because the format of the book/film doesn't allow space to really drill down on the concept. Take the resource list and recommended reading lists in the book and do some research on the concepts that confuse you.  This is a very good overview or introduction to the metaphysical Law of Attraction. Another good book, that might help you with the practicalities of putting it into practice is Michael Losier's book \\"The Law of Attraction\\"[[ASIN:B004Y6MTWS Law of Attraction: The Science of Attracting More of What You Want and Less of What You Don't]]. It contains worksheets you can use to help you focus on your own goals. His workbook format is a little more practical than \\"The Secret.\\" His newsletter and blog have lots of helpful articles that help to clarify sticking points for people trying to apply this mental training to their own lives.  Whether the \\"Emerald Tablet\\" ever existed or not, I don't know and I don't care. I'm very skeptical of the book's claims that people in power have ever attempted to suppress \\"the Secret\\" throughout history. The Law of Attraction is a metaphysical law or concept which apparently has its roots in James Allen's \\"As a Man Thinketh\\", Robert Collier's \\"The Secret of the Ages\\", Wallace D. Wattles' \\"Science of Getting Rich\\" and Charles Haanel's \\"Master Key System\\" (I recommend the Ruth Miller editions of the last 2, since she writes a version in updated language, and you can read them side by side with the original text, which is helpful). [[ASIN:1582701881 The New Science of Getting Rich]] and [[ASIN:1582701903 The Master Key System]]None of the writings of those authors predate the American Civil War, so I really don't  think the Law of Attraction came into being as a complete philosophy or system until the late 19th century.  Also, the New Thought Movement organized this philosophy into a religious and philosophical system that is currently represented by the Unity Church. The New Thought movement had close ties with the development of the women's suffrage movement at the turn of the 19th century, and an interesting book on that topic is [[ASIN:0520229274 Each Mind a Kingdom: American Women, Sexual Purity, and the New Thought Movement, 1875-1920]]  Somehow, social conditions in the USA after the Civil War, and during the time leading up to women getting the vote, created a kind of religious, spiritual and metaphysical stew that resulted in the philosophy put forth in \\"The Secret.\\" There aren't many relgious movements that are completely native to the United States. Mormonism is one, and New Thought another. It would have been nice to have a historically realistic assessment of the development of these ideas in that context, but I suppose this book would be less marketable as an academic treatise on history than it is as a mythology of positive psychology.  You can believe whatever helps you to apply the metaphysical Law of Attraction in your own life. The importance of the Law of Attraction is not how scientific it is, but how it can change *your* life, and that's all that matters. Don't get hung up on the \\"how's\\". As Mike Dooley says, \\"the how's are the domain of the Universe.\\" Just focus on the end results and feeling good.  This book is beautifully formatted, and an enjoyable read. The \\"Secret Summaries\\" in bullet points at the end of each chapter are helpful for remembering the main ideas. The \\"biographies\\" in the back of the book include information about each coach or speaker interviewed in the book and DVD, and information about other books and resources that might interest fans of \\"The Secret.\\"

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I have everything Michael has released and this package is so nice! It is worth the money Amazon has it listed for because I have seen at Best Buy for $59.99 and for sale on Ebay between $79.99 and a couple hundred bucks! You know if you do not get it now.......they will go out of print!  SOON!  So glad I purchased this item as it will be a collector soon before all us will know!  I am rating this item HIGH and along with my Michael Jackson Opus Book!
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun enough to play and easy enough to shut off sound and openfeint.  Kept me busy for the morning.  Good time waster.
B006ON41FC|4.0|its a pretty fun game if you are in the mood for it...but if you are not, it will eventually get really boring
B00314VYNE|4.0|I bought this for my toddler for Christmas, and overall it's good for not costing a lot. My main complaint would be that she is hard. I was hoping that she would be soft like the Jessie in the movie, and something a kid could cuddle with, which you would think would have been cheaper to produce anyway. But, she has hard plastic molded body and limbs. Her hat really doesn't fit either, if you are holding her upright, you can set it on her head and it stays but it doesn't really grab it at all. I'm guessing it was to preserve proportions and make it look right. Her hair is real yarn, and gets a little roughed up after a bit, but thats more my toddlers fault not the toys. As long as you are expecting a hard toy, it is a very nice quality option, and it was a good price. Still on the look out for that authentic version that isn't costing too much though.
0743277708|3.0|This was a tough book to review. At first glance, some of you may question how could a book with life-like rabbits be an interesting read? It was an interesting read, no doubt about it, but the long descriptive runs took a toll on me. It was one of those books that I wish I could like a little bit more.  The amount of characters in this book were tremendous! It was tough to follow all the rabbit's names and only near the end did I finally get accustomed to the warren present. Likewise, some of the names of the rabbits were so difficult to pronounce or read, but I pressed on because it was an enjoyable book.  The story in some ways was overly descriptive for my taste. I'm more of a straight to the point reader and I love books that are fast paced. Watership Down, on the other hand, focused a lot more on the visual experience. It was great storytelling indeed, but like I said earlier, it was a bit too much for me.  Overall, I'd recommend this book to those who would like a reading challenge. It wasn't that bad and I wouldn't mind reading it again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Some games are good, some games are bad.  I wish you didn't have to play some games at all, but you kind of have to.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|How cool is it that I no longer have to remember where I put my stuff? As long as it is in Evernote, I can find it!
0375842209|3.0|The book was a little disjointed and choppy.  Sometimes it seemed like a bad imitation of Kurt Vonnegut or like the author was trying to please me with his free associations as though they were this \\"out of this world\\" brilliance.  At points the work seemed mentally stultifying, not gratifying.  I found myself wanting to quit the book many times but it was required reading for our book club.  The 550 plus pages could have been cut to 200 I think.  Some things I liked about the book....  I thought it was kind of cool having \\"death\\" be the omniscient narrator.  That is very unique and was certainly a risk for an author who had been moderately successful already.  Kudos for courage on that one!  I also admire how the love of books and the power of words is put front and center.  I think that is a huge message for the youth of today with all of these laptops and cellphones and Call to Duty games, etc.  The ideas in the book reinforce the theme that reading is great and that people who read and take the time to deeply look into concepts in life are the winners.  An unexamined life is certainly not worth living, that's for sure.  I also liked the general message about the evil and absurdity of Hitler and the message against totalitarianism, much like George Orwell's take, it's highly dangerous for any society trying to evolve in a civilized manner.  Thought and knowledge control is totally absurd in a free society and that point is driven home in the work.  I would also agree with the critic who said the book crawled subtly under her skin.  I would agree.  I would say the book grew on me as I invested more time in it and rationalized that it was worth my time.
B006ON41FC|3.0|going nuts is a fun game, very entertaining. but it freezes a ton, and the noise is very annoying. overall good game though, 4stars.

B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is a blast to play. Awesome graphics and smooth gameplay. After playing for just under 5 minutes I was hooked. I have found a new way to pass the time during those long boring business meetings.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I do love this game. BUT they have an ad for the new space game and I cant get the game to start. I have a kindle fire. it keeps closing. ive tried six times.
B006ON41FC|3.0|its fun just don't like how you have to opt out of open faint ever time u start the game
B0076D20E8|5.0|A wonderfully written movie introducing a very controversial theory. The film is presented in a very witty and thrilling way. This movie is highly original and definitely deserves watching.

B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is really fun. It's great for kids because its a problem solving game.  You have to figure out how to get the candy for Om-Nom. This can is sort of similar to Where's my Water because in that game you have to get water to the alligator. If you like Where's my Water then you will more than likely like this app!!!!!!! Everyone at my school lives this game!
B0007X9T5M|5.0|Nice collection of songs including hits like White Flag and Thank You. Just a straightforward concert of great music, that distinct Dido voice and good musicianship.  No fancy wardrobe, elevated stages, leaping about (not that I don't like that from time to time with the right band); just one nice song after the other.  Dido does a little intro before some of the songs explaining the origin or a little about it -- nice touch.  There are some audio imperfections here and there, but nothing to worry about.  Just a slight drop or change in volume or equalization as the engineers spliced together various clips.  Most folks won't even notice.  I heartily recommend this DVD if you have any interest in Dido's music or career.  She truly stands out as a fine songwriter.  I enjoy these live songs as much or more than the studio versions.  She sticks quite close to the studio version, as much as you can live, but there are a few surprises, like the last half of See You When You're Forty -- rock on!  And Honestly OK -- jam on!  If you're a die-hard metal or rap fan, well, maybe this isn't your cup of tea.  Otherwise, this DVD won't disappoint.
B006ON41FC|4.0|very fun and entertaining game. have played most of the day, and like the increasing leveling the game has. it can get redundant in the beginning, maybe the developers could have changed the scenery after so many nuts had been collected. one big problem I have is the store where you buy upgrades l, sometimes when you buy them, they will not show up! obviously this is a glitches they need to fix.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|it is an ok game  there are a lot of choices but many have the same concept with a different theme. I got bored quickly.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I do b not have to worry about my kids tearing the pages and have the option not only to chose the version I want to read but can chose plans.
0307165485|1.0|I thought this would be a great book with a lot of stories, but the pages are random about numbers and letters and objects, but only about 5 actual stories that are not good anyways.  Very boring book, but if you don't care if there are actual stories then you may like it.  It is very thick, just not what I expected.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's missile command with upgrades, if you can remember that classic . Fun time waster, with pauses between levels. Good play for the money.
B007857FOO|5.0|From the raised, reproduced lace on the DVD package that matches Bellas Wedding gown, to the simply gorgeous, delicate silk commemorative flag/poster of their wedding photo, this is a no-brainer, must have edition to build your collection, ladies!<br /> Included is the music from the film, the movie disk, a documentary disk that shows how they used a dummy to make Bella appear so emaciated as her pregnancy with<br />Renesmee progressed, and so much more.<br /> I was gifted this from my brother who works at WalMart and hid it away for me a week before the release/sale date, and I had no idea it was a wedding version.<br />Upon receiving it you feel like you are truly apart of the Wedding, and that this rare DVD set is your wedding favor!<br /><br />The movie is beautiful, the packaging is beautiful - It truly is one of those instances where you need to buy the rare edition, in this case, this very Wedding Dress Edition. Its worth whatever you have to pay for it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|needs more levels and it would be a 5 star game needs more levels and it would be a 5 star game needs more levels and it would be a 5 star game
B006ON41FC|1.0|I think this is a good but bad game. it is good because it is fun. and it is bad becquerel it takes foreverto load and get started.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Kindle fire, openfeint keeps popping up and eventually crashes the game and dashboard. Guess the quality control fell asleep on this one.
B006ON41FC|3.0|so I was reading the opening material and found I could DISABLE Openfeint (for all you whiners who need to learn to read!) so I went ahead and disabled it.  However, playing the game was slow, and my fire kept getting stuck, so I ended up removing the game. was fun while it wasn't freezing my fire.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I recently purchased this item to use as an amp for my DT770 pros. I was looking for a cheap amplifier just to give me a little bit more clarity and some more gain (because my MacBook pro and iPhone obviously don't put out near enough power to push 250 ohm speakers.) I had done a little research on FiiO's products and heard decent things about the e5. The only reason I went with the e6 was because I thought that the EQ options would be nice to have. I was wrong. When I received my e6 and immediately put it on the charger. While it was charging, I started to test it out. It definitely gave me more gain, it doesn't give a CRAZY loud amount of power but it got loud enough for me. As far as the gain goes, I was satisfied...but when it came to the EQ..I most certainly was not. With each EQ setting I tried the low end became more and more distorted and nasty sounding(maybe this wouldn't be as noticeable on cheaper quality headphones) But...what could I expect from a $30 product? Honestly, I probably would have kept it just to use it for the gain it produced and not turned the EQ on, but after awhile of charging the red charge indicator light started flashing red...I looked up what this meant on FiiO's site and they said that is a warning light that's basically telling you your battery is unable to charge properly. I returned this item and am going to get a e7 or e11 instead. It's not a BAD product...but just remember to not have super high expectations from a $30 product.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and addictive just like angry birds. I love it so ignore other bad reviews and get this app right now
B006ON41FC|3.0|ok game to kill time with.  but can be annoying with wanting a review an stuff. almost ready to delete because of it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a really adicting. You need this app if you have a lot of free time. IT IS SO AWESOME.
B006ON41FC|4.0|its really funny but sometimes it can be a bit clitchy. other than that, its worth the long download time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love the game, I play it all the time. would highly recommend it to all. The app works great and I haven't. had any problems. with it at all
B00632HWOG|5.0|I installed this app on my Kindle Fire and have not encountered any of the issues described in the other reviews. I am able to scroll through the messages, read messages, delete or move messages to other folders including the list of custom folders that I created in Yahoo Mail. This app is better than its 3 star rating.
B004QO9WVO|5.0|I haven't done much reading of the Kindle version on my Thunderbolt. However, the audio book that comes with the Kindle version is awesome - the reader does an amazing job. I feel like I'm right alongside Holmes and Watson on their adventures.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Simply fun, just a tiny bit laggy at times. Watch out for the red acorns!  My son loves to play.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Great!Outstanding edge of your seat nail biter.A thrill a minute! Angelina Jolie truly does reigns as THE action-heroine supreme. I can't wait to see Salt II.
B00005JLIU|4.0|I saw this when it came out, remember it vividly and loved it.  I'm about to order a copy.  But except two of the songs, I disliked the music very much, hence the missing star.  I thought the title song's lyric was Cahn's best creation in a career of mediocrity written usually with Styne and for Sinatra.  I think Van Heusen wrote this tune.  The other exception of course is Gerswin's \\"Do It Again\\" which believe it or not actually IS written up-tempo, despite Garland's sexy tear-jerker version (which I love).  Bea Lillie.  Coward called her the funniest woman in the world.  And I've heard a couple of her own remarks and they were hysterical.  But aside from these, I have never felt like laughing at one single thing she ever did or said, not TMM, High Spirits, Inside USA or An Evening With -.  I can imagine her singing Porter's \\"I'm A Little Cuck-coo\\", and it's legend that Rodgers had to buy back his own song (\\"My Heart Stood Still\\" I think it was) and quickly find a show for it to keep her from singing it!  Anyway I loved TMM and agree with everything good said about it - from fragile Mary Tyler Moore to hysterically funny Julie Andrews to tempermental elevator to a plot that is briming with imagination and white slavery.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Worked great til latest update. Now crashes after &quot;space&quot; ad.  Why can't I play it anymore? Please update your update! I'm not the only one with this issue, obviously!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I loved it.  Elizibeth Gilbert is awesome.  I loved her TED Talk also.  Not at all what I was expecting. That is all.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Openfeint spyware auto loads, and despite what the game says cannot turn off. Lag on A500 ics which runs much more intensive games flawlessly. Verdict is, get rid of Openfeint. Uninstalled until then.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Its a great game with good graphics, but the open feint thing is a little annoying. Still, it's worth getting.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is an awesome app with great graphics and is one fun game!!! I am now playing this game 24/7!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game may be a little silly but it is a lot of fun. It is a fun game.that can keepp you entertained.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!!  There are so many verisons available for free.  It is easy to highlight a verse then switch translations.  There are plans you can sign up for to help you read the Bible.  Even audio verisons that can read the Word to you as you go through your day.  Thank you for this app!!
B006ON41FC|2.0|tho i like this game it starts to get annoying after a while. it's probably not a good idea for short tempered people to get this app
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive is one of the most original films I've seen in a long time, even though on the surface of things there doesn't appear to be too much about it that hasn't been done before. The first time I watched it I was unsure about certain parts of it because it wasn't ever quite what I was expecting. However this film gets better every time I watch it. The soundtrack is brilliant and the slow mo's that accompany many of the songs in the movie really add something to the viewing experience. The minimal dialogue is recovered by the lyrics in whichever song is playing at the time. The style is brilliant too, cool without much effort. The violence is pretty unpleasant at times so if you're squeamish you might be best off avoiding it, or looking away when you think something nasty is coming.  This is definitely the coolest film to come out of Hollywood in a long time.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love bag it! my sis takes my kindle to play on it when she has her own kindle but just doesn't want to pay
B001239HFI|4.0|That's right. I found James Blunt on Top Gear! He was so funny, and had such an awesome personality I had to look him up and that lead to looking up his albums. I found the .mp3's on Amazon and was so impressed I bought most of his songs. My husband is going to get such a kick out of this. He hardly ever knows who the celeb of the week is, and I just bought his music!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It protects the Kindle and holds it up in landscape mode, but my cats leave hair everywhere and the cover was quickly matted since it folds under and either lays flat, or forms a prop for the angled viewing. I came up with a workaround that is ok, but I'm still looking.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Gosford Park is an excellent combination of period drama and mystery.  The all star cast is wonderful and an added treat was Jeremy Northam singing.  I can't say enough about Maggie Smith.  She is perfect as usual.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this is great! it reminds me when I went to India with short round and Indy,but,  the bugs are fake!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|You can play a few levels, then your forced to watch the Angry Birds Space commercial.  After that, you cannot play any further levels as the game just keeps rebooting.  I uninstalled free version and downloaded again just to experience the same thing. Very maddening!!!  I am using Kindle Fire.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I Love this game it is so awsome the thing that suck s is that yo cant get out of open fient other than that I love this game
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This movie is awesome. It was great to be an owner of the movie myself. I received the movie in great timing and it was packaged very well. Thank you for such quick and awesome service. Thank you
B006ON41FC|5.0|I say very very very very very very very very very very very very godlod in very many ways with lots a goods stuuf. ya KNOW?
B004AFFZNI|2.0|just got the case in the mail and it looks used, the back door it chipped and the mounts are harder to attach then the original case i got with the camera. the base where you mount from looks fogged as if it was used and i purchased a new item
B0054JZC6E|5.0|tons of variety in this game, easily put 20 plus hours into this game cant believe it's. free recommend farm.land
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are fun and I like the free points you get when you do well.  I recommend this game to any one.
B005D4Y4H8|5.0|These gems that were readily available to Canadian television audiences -- and a sporadic list of other locations -- is surely to excite and entertain any Gould fan. I love how his eclectic mind comes through on these recordings.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Wow! I just looked at the price (18.Feb 2012). What happened to it? It's $109.98. I bought this set three weeks ago for $59.99.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a very fun game. It's good to pass some time without a long commitment. Easy to figure out.
0920668372|1.0|Creepy I agree with all the bad reviews. The mother is sneaking in the older boy's room and then adult's house??!! Should've kept it a baby theme since it is meant for them. Also \\"as long as I'm alive\\" not only makes it obviously implied that the mom dies in the end, but what happened to always watching over your kids even when you are not alive- which would be too mature and still sad of a theme for a young childrens' book-- which brings me to- why even add \\"as long as I'm alive???????\\" How do I explain that to my kid? I think I will stick to \\"mommy and me,\\" \\"daddy and me\\", \\"mommy hugs\\" and \\"daddy hugs\\"...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game does not need wi fi to play it. Other person ur wrong! I LOVE THIS GAME. IT IS MY FAV GAME EVER. ADDICTING!
B005K17RU0|4.0|good app. much detail. best i found for android. would most definitely recommend to anyone with kindle fire. get it.
0064430227|4.0|This book is a timeless classic,Great to add to any collection.  only thing is it was smaller than i expected but not a real issue
B005FITIGO|2.0|Margin Call, 2011 film  The movie begins with a time-lapse photo of lower Manhattan, the financial center of America. Grim-faced people leave their offices carrying their belongings in a cardboard box. Another down-sizing? A young woman walks around checking names on a list. Most people are being \\"transitioned\\" from their company. They can take their personal belongings, their access is revoked. [No warnings at all? It's always best to keep very little of your personal belongings at your office.] A man's phone doesn't work either. The manager talks to the survivors. Later he grieves over his sick dog. [Harry Truman said if you want a true friend in Washington buy a dog.] One office worker gets a surprise when viewing his computer and calls his co-worker. \\"Look at this!\\" A projected loss greater than the value of the company? The top manager is called at 11pm!  They learn about the projection of volatility. Can they find Eric Dale? There is a meeting with upper management, they look over the reports. There is a problem. It can't be hidden! Can the figures be verified? These Mortgage Backed Securities were popular, but increased risk in case of decreased value. [Were they examples of fraud?] The top manager is there because of his judgment in predicting the future. Can they avoid big losses? By selling to suckers at the current fair market value price! Will they ever trust them again? \\"Remember this day.\\" Will somebody have to take the blame for their problem? Who else? Eric Dale reminisces about a bridge built 22 years earlier. Will he come back.? Who will be let go next? Does the cigarette smoking symbolize their unhealthy actions? \\"Is it the right thing to do?\\" [The story has slow spots.] Eric Dale returns to the office! The guys below take the blame.  There is a meeting about unwinding the assets of the company by liquidating its holdings of fixed-income MBS today. There is a promised big bonus for this fire sale. They unload big blocks as soon as possible, takinglosses. Sam wants out. The top manager mentions the dates of previous crashes and depressions since the 18th century. Sam will stay, he needs the money. Will there be new opportunities in getting out of this mess? Sam's dog died. [Does digging the grave symbolize self-punishment?]  This is not as dramatic (or educational) as Oliver Stone's 1989 movie \\"Wall Street\\". This seems like a lower budget production (filmed at night). It really doesn't educate the viewer about the swindling in the Wall Street Jungle that caused the implosion that caused the worst economic depression in seventy years. Mortgage Backed Securities were a sophisticated swindle where low-rated mortgages were magically transformed into high-rated mortgages and sold to investors abroad and at home. When people couldn't pay their mortgages (due to low wages and high taxes) they defaulted on payments. This caused the value of MBS securities to crash. [Did this also cause the debt crisis in European countries?] In the 1930s FDR's New Deal passed laws to prevent the swindling that preceded and caused the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Since the 1990s Congress repealed many of the New Deal laws that prevented frauds. Novel financial products were created to swindle investors by hiding the risks. That can't go on forever, and there was a day of reckoning. Overvalued securities plummeted down to their true value and wiped out many investors. Will Wall Street ever learn the value of honesty?
B005HSL626|5.0|This is the greatest app besides angry birds. It is addicting to play. They need to come out with an Fruit Ninga 2. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My fav app!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I was lucky enough to win a copy of The Forever Girl from the author, and I really enjoyed it! I think my favorite aspect of the novel was the writing--I loved the author's unusual, apt metaphors and evocative imagery, as well as the flow of the writing. Her descriptions brought the characters and the setting of Belle Meadows (and, later, Damascus) to life. I also loved the creative way the novel combined elements of Wicca, various mythologies and supernatural creatures, and aspects of American history (specifically, the Salem witch trials.) All of the characters were intriguing, both major and minor. I particularly felt for Ivory and would love to read a novel or short story from her point of view.
B005LAIGP0|1.0|I really expected more from this movie as a Radcliffe fan and after watching the trailer. Sadly the trailer was the only thing that I ended up liking about this awful film. At the theater, as the movie tried to progess, I realized that it would never going to get any good. All my friends felt the same disappointment at the end of the screening. Trust me and do not waste your precious time and money with this garbage or you will be as disappointed as me.
0312427999|5.0|Even if you are not the biggest reader in the world, this book is an obligatory read for anyone who would dare call himself or herself a responsible citizen.  I am not joking or exaggerating.  Even for those of us who live in the United States and have not suffered the ravages of the IMF and World Bank, do not be so naive as to think that you will forever be safely ensconced from \\"free market\\" economics.  Just look at the austerity which is being forced down the throat of Greece contrary to the will of the people there, who democratically elect their government.
B006ON41FC|5.0|cool I don't know what you are complaining about this game is outstanding on my Kindle Fire. fun entertaing but I got it for free
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liked gaining points to unlock the other games. A lot are really fun, some kinda boring. Even my 5 yr old grandson has beat some of them and loves it!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Save your kids and your money from this movie! One of the worst sequels ever made! Very disappointing experience on the theater...
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I actually stumbled upon the DVD for this at Target and just had to buy it.  It is brilliantly done and while it isn't the same as being there in person you can still feel the emotion from each individual who is part of the production.  Personally I am more then happy with the casting choices for the leads.  There are a few things that I wish was different but I don't wanna spoil anything.  I enjoyed the DVD so much that I came on Amazon after watching it, found it on Blu Ray and purchased it. (that makes 2 purchases of the same production in one night)
B0071QIN00|5.0|this game was totally wicked I mean the graphics are just awesome Hrh vsu eye ehdg ehdg she ehd whet dgegd std dcvze ss dgxyecesgdcsud
B001HN6940|5.0|Alice in Wonderland is already a great Movie! A great acting job by Johnny Depp (Hatter) and  Mia Wasikowska (Alice) makes it even better than the original! But looking at it on Blu Ray...... WOW!!!! The colors are beautiful and accurate and it really gives a theater-like experience! I highly recommend this GREAT Blu Ray! You won't be disappointed.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Cute enjoyable game.  I'm using Kindle Fire.  When you first open the game hit the left or right arrow and follow the directions to remove the feint account.  I also used &quot;file expert&quot; to remove the open feint folder.  I've played the game several times, its been over an hour and feint has not appeared back on the device.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a fun past time me and the kids love it. I would invite everyone to play it.great for little kids
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I have to admit that I was more than surprised when I listened to this CD, purchased it for the song \\"The Walk\\" and there are only about 2 songs that I do not enjoy.  I would recommend this to others!
B004QSQML8|4.0|If you aren't familiar with Legend there are some things you should know about it:<br />-There isn't much plot<br />-The principles have less dialog together than any one supporting character with a speaking part<br />-The editing is a little bewildering<br /><br />This is all to say that it isn't a very GOOD movie from a traditional standpoint. So why does it have the following it does? Primarily because it is a BEAUTIFUL film. Beautiful people run around a beautiful fairy tale forest trying to outwit goblins and demons, who are sort of beautiful in a gothic grotesque way themselves. You get your choice of two beautiful soundtracks, and two beautiful prints: the US theatrical cut is magnificently clean, while the international work-print is pretty dirty (a fact for which the director apologizes before it starts) but still sharp as a tack and perfectly watchable. This is a movie that is all about EXPERIENCE over story- If you enjoyed Labyrinth, The Keep, or House of Flying Daggers you can get an idea of what to expect.<br /><br />Fans of Ridly Scott will take note that much of the footage of unicorns used in this film was in fact left on the cutting room floor from the unicorn dream sequences in Blade Runner. Does this mean Tom Cruise is a Replicant? That's probably too deep of a read.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|This movie pulled me in within the first few minutes and never let me go! Action, intrigue, revenge, even a little romance. Wonderful main character (Hugo Weaving) and Natalie Portman does an outstanding job as well. The movie is intelligent and very well done. Best line from movie: \\"The people shouldn't fear the government. The government should fear the people.\\"
B004M9AS3Y|4.0|my job requires me to travel a bit frequently. i'm also learning photography and so i wanted a backpack that would carry my laptop and my camera (P500 nikon which is not an SLR) and still have adequate space. i don't have an SLR as yet but every bag i searched for for camera and laptop purposes were only for SLRs, lenses and a laptop.. i searched and searched and i came upon this bag and very hesitantly i bought it... to my pleasant surprise the bag is exactly what i've been looking for. it holds my laptop 14\\" dell latitude snugly (not sure if it would hold a bigger laptop) with adequate padding and also the padded compartment accessible from the outside is perfect to hold my camera. in addition to that, there's more than enough room to hold accessories like laptop charger, mouse, external hard drive and the bag will hold more than that... there are also organizational compartments of which i just might find use for... the straps look strong and are not painful on your back. what's nice is that the excess nylon from the strap adjuster can be tucked in nicely instead of dangling. and even when full, the bag doesn't look big on me... and i'm a small-framed person so that's an added plus... in short i'll be using this bag on every trip as carry on... my reason for a 4 star rating is that i haven't used it just yet so i'm not sure how it will hold up but it does look like a strong rugged bag... a good buy, well worth the price!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Works great if u have high speed wifi or else it won't send emails only receive them. ho hi hi hi hi
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I'll cop to being a little underwhelmed by Thor, and since Captain America was the next Avengers film, I was more than a little worried. Thankfully this concern turned out to be baseless, as Joe Johnston delivers the same bouncing retro panache here that he used to such brilliant effect in The Rocketeer. Cap is a film of moments- Hugo Weaving's Red Skull frantically working a huge bank of controls to fry his superiors with a ray gun, Chris Evans bombing his USO routine to a camp of war-weary soldiers, and a dozen other instants of cinematic brilliance are icing dollops on a very sweet cake.  One feels honestly that this is the kind of movie they would have made about Captain America in the 40s if they could have. And while it contains innumerable little tidbits to appeal to Avengers followers and comic fans in general, it remains accessible to the casual moviegoer as well. If I had one complaint about this film it would be that there are really too many characters and too much plot for just one film- Cap deserved two movies just like Iron man, and I hope that down the line, he'll get them.  With this set you get the movie on BD and DVD, so you can take it to your mom's house where they haven't updated their home theater in eleven years. Extras are pretty sparse and consist mostly of little promotional tidbits that were already available online- it's my theory that all the really juicy bonus content is being saved for some kind of boxed set after Avengers comes out. The movie itself is a lovingly faithful transfer that will not disappoint anyone, but probably won't blow you away either- this is a very straightforward film without a lot of hidden details or secrets. Still, a lot of work went into these sets and digital backlots, so best to see it all, eh? Audio is appropriately bombastic (I love me some Silvestri) but like the Iron Man films, the music is rather loud in proportion to the voices- no problem if you watch it LOUD.
B0012GMZKE|5.0|I didn't know any more of Leonard Cohen than his name until about two years ago. Oh, my goodness, his gravelly voice is so sensual. His lyrics are pure poetry. His Live in London CD was my introcuction to him. Thank goodness I \\"met\\" him before his time on earth is finished. I am so impressed and so grateful that he is still singing his soulful poetry. He is a diamond.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love it. a must get for all ages to enjoy. great graphics on samsung. easy to use controls to control.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Have wanted this movie for a long time. DVD plays perfectly and is quite enjoyable to watch. Love the great old cars, especially the awesome 'Stang! And Steve McQueen is ... superb.
B002C6A6N6|3.0|UPDATE: I HAVE WATCHED ABOUT 3 MORE DISCS SINCE THIS REVIEW AND AS I MENTIONED BELOW, IF YOU PLAY THIS ON A DVD PLAYER THERE WILL BE NO DISTORTION PROBLEMS. AT LEAST, IT IS WORKING FOR ME. NO DISTORTIONS, FUZZINESS, OUT OF SYNC, AND THE PICTURE IS PRETTY GOOD FOR DVD. HAVE DVD PLAYER HOOKED UP TO HDMI FLATSCREEN TV USING THE RED/WHITE/YELLOW PORTS AND CABLES ON THE TV AND DVD PLAYER. FYI, I AM NOT USING SOME FANCY DVD PLAYER, JUST A TOSHIBA THAT I BOUGHT SEVERAL YEARS AGO FOR $50, BASIC ENTRY LEVEL DVD PLAYER. MAYBE THIS WILL HELP SOMEONE ELSE. CHEERS!!!!!!  This series is a great series and one of the best western shows ever made. I'm not going to comment on the show itself, because I'll assume that you already know what this show is about. That being said, if you haven't read the reviews about the qality of this box set on here, you probably should before you make a decision to buy this set.  I am on the second disc of season two in this set so far. Season one was great, but but when you watch season two, everything seems to be in slow motion some. People's mouths are in sync with the talking so far, but any of the faster action sequences are out of step. There really is no other box set that is available other than the faux leather bound notebook style boxset and that set has even more problems than this one. I have owned that set as well and the spiral notebook style of the set breaks very easily. Plus the dvd's are in carboard slip inserts, so they get scratched easy and some of the discs are already scratched when they come direct from the manufacturer.  I own a blue ray player and have been playing these disc on that with a HDMI flascreen TV and once I started having the probelms with season 2 and the out of sync stuff, I decided to pop the dvd into my dvd player that I still own. I know from past experience that some of my older dvd's that I own don't play well on the blu ray player, probably because of the up-converting that is automatically done by the bluray player. I just tried playing an episode on my blu ray player and it was distorted so I tried playing it in my dvd player, and wouldn't you know it, it plays fine now!!!!!! For those of you who already own this series, try playing it on a dvd player if you haven't already, as that may solve your problem. I'd rather watch it on a dvd player and have a clear picture than a distorted one on a blu ray player.  For those of you who are confuser by this review, please read other reviews, expecially the negative ones about this set to find out what the issues are with this box set before you buy it. That being said, the jury is still out on if I would buy this set again or not. Under $100 is a good deal for a 6 season set, no matter what the set is and renting from the library is time consuming and you have to wait. I'll wait and see and cross my fingers that playing it on the dvd player solves the problem. For any future buyers, this set was done over in china(big surprise) and it is formatted horribly.  I will update my review and let everyone know after I have watched all of season 2 if playing it on a dvd player solves the problem.

B000002KLG|5.0|George Benson's Give Me the Night is superb from the first track to the last. His voice, the lyrics, and the music come together perfectly. This is one of the few projects Benson did that has him singing on every song practically. I would highly, highly recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent app! I now have the Bible with me wherever I go...on my phone and on my Kindle Fire.  The reminders and daily plans are great for focus on certain issues you may be studying.  No bugs and non-invasive like some apps can be.
B003L77G06|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV in a LONG time. It is hysterically funny, sometimes touching; and deals with all kind of people and situations. I love it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun, in an addictive kind of way. sometimes a little too challenging. always exciting to unlock the new games, but as a perfections, it was frustrating when stuck.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love this app. its one where if you start playing , you cant put your device down..almost like it is addictive
B006ON41FC|3.0|It's definitely a fun game, but only for the first 5 minutes. I wish the game had better art direction. The squirrel and tree's are ugly.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a fun game with goals and achievements. fast paced at times to get your adrenaline flowing. I recommend it for all ages.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Capturing the essence of a teenager's spirit is a skill few authors do well. Doing justice to one facing serious illness is even more rare. The Fault in Our Stars proves it can be done. Readers well past their \\"young adult\\" years will enjoy this read immensely. It would be a great read for parents and teens to share - and likely to spark a lot of conversation about the lives of the young characters, and their parents, as they struggle will the pain of devastating illness.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Simple to install, easy to use, works like a it should and is unobtrusive. Gmail account needed if using to sync across internet. Not needed if used on just your local network.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|A very simple and fun game, happy I downloaded it when it was free. You should download it today. Better than Angry Birds.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a very fun game very addictive ....you can turn off sound in the pause menu ...and you can turn off openfeint in the main menu the game tells you how in the hint box when you start the game
B004LWZW7O|4.0|Somehow this film reminded me just a little of a clandestine tip of the hat to Les Miserables, with Cillian Murphy's cop character seeming for all the world like some sci-fi version of Javert. I've mentioned this to a few friends who seem unable to reconcile my comparisons between the two projects with their own takes on In Time, but to me there is a slight similarity. Anyway, I was unexpectedly impressed with this 2011 feature and its strong acting all across the board and its central plot about human beings with expiration dates dwelling in an unequal society wherein time literally is money. It's worth seeing and even beyond that, worth thinking about in the context of the moments that construct our ever-dwindling lives.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I like it its just time fly by thing Lol. anyone who hates this game just mad cause there just not animated enough to enjoy games like this
B006ON41FC|5.0|people are complaining, but I really like this game ...I think it is really fun, creative, and cute.....that little squirrel sure can fly!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Tons of fun minigames. Kind of reminds me of a poor man's Wario game. Not bad, not bad at all.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|this app is the most important app that you could get I love.  you have to get it! its almost like terris
B006ON41FC|3.0|going nuts trying to move this squirrel!  a bit hard to steer him.  but still fun for my 4 year old.
B006ON41FC|4.0|it pops up when you open the game and tells you how to do it. really wasn't hard to find and probably could have figured it out on my own.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Simple but fun game, changing goals keeps it fresh. Runs without issue on my fire. Graphics could be a little sharper.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this is nice  but i gave it four stars just b/c it sometimes freezes  on my kindle fire. overall though its fun!
0307712354|1.0|I experienced many of the problems noted by other readers.  What ultimately made me give up after three hundred pages was my inability to believe in the protagonist.  She is supposed to be smart, she is supposed to on her guard. She won't tell her best friend the things going through her head. Then a complete stranger shows up, a person she has every reason to be on guard against, a woman who refuses to properly identify herself, who appears to be staging their meetings, orchestrating every encounter, a women she suspects is having her trailed and yet she divulges all her secrets to this person as casually as she might talk about the weather.  That was it.  I was done.
B0053VKP8S|4.0|I had a small problem in that I bought a new plasma TV with only optical audio output but already owned a soundbar with only RCA input.  This little device \\"paired\\" the two components perfectly! An inexpensive fix for a common problem.
B004FQX5CK|3.0|Blade Runner is an excellent movie which I've owned on DVD for many years.  Acquiring the Blu Ray version is what I do with the top tier movies in my collection. I have great respect for the conversion of this movie to Blu Ray.  However, I was disappointed at the ending.  This movie is known to have several endings.  I felt that, with Blu Ray, all of these endings should have been available.  It is for this reason that I only gave it 3 stars.  The music for Blade Runner was even more enchanting than I remembered.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|OfficeSuite Pro 5 is a really useful app. As a member of various teams at school, I find myself on long bus rides quite often. This app let's me work on my assignment even when I have no computer.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I I I I I I I I I I I I.  like to. r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r e rv
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game both unexpectedly amusing and challenging. I only got it because it was my free kindle fire app of the day and a week later I'm far from bored with it. I like the characterization of the groceries and the fact that the more you play, the more game modes you unlock. Much better than the over-hyped angry birds.
B0063IH60K|5.0|when you need a little mind clearing, this is agreat go-to game.  easy to use, easy to win, fast to play.
B006C1DH92|5.0|heyy it is awesome and it is solo fun to verse people and have woo much fun and laugh and fart sometimes during a game

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is really awesome. You need to get it. There are so many games to play and you just can't stop. If you do get it...watch out it's VERY addicting.
B000SINT52|1.0|no fewer than 59 lies/misdirections in this 'documentary'. it's sad to think of how many people bought into this garbage. educate yourself: [...]
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is worth it cuz it was free and is basically a knock off of temple run. runs well on kindle fire
B004LWZW9C|3.0|\\"New Years Eve\\" is the lives of several couples and singles in New York who connect over the course of the holiday. Eventually, they all go to Times Square to see the ball drop at midnight. Hector Elizondo is a repairman who arrives at the last minute to repair the ball. Two young attractives locked in an elevator; a rock-star's ex-girl friend returns for his concert; and a middle-aged spinster quits her job and falls for Zac Efron. Hmmmmm....There's some funny stuff here. But tacky is two pregnant women trying to force/forward their baby's birth to win a $25,000 contest. Tacky. Not funny. It's all wrapped in fluffy, TV-sitcom land. A frail, sickly old man is played by a frail, sickly Robert de Niro. Most excellent is his nurse, played by Halle Berry. The real bonus in \\"New Years Eve\\" is the talent, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Alyssa Milano(I didn't see her), Jessica Biel, Penny Marshall, Hilary Swank, Ryan Seacrest, Michael Bloomberg, Matthew Broderick, Jon Bon Jovi, James Belushi, Sarah Jessica Parker, John Lithgow, and a very bored-looking Ashton Kurcher. The funny gag-reel at the end includes the pregnant women giving birth to twins; which are actually two DVD's of \\"Valentine's Day\\".
B006ON41FC|4.0|everything is abolsoulty fun about this game except you should be able to upgrade the squirrel it is better than apps stores &quot;temple run&quot;

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Worked fine before the space ad today. Now game closes after the ad. App is useless now other than to see the space ad.  As of 2/21/12 - The game has been fixed. No more space birds ad.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it was a great game i mean it is so fun and addicting i am on the like 25 level and i have only had it for 1 day
B0063IH60K|4.0|there are a lot times where i can't move at the start of the game. good other than that, lots of deck colors.
B006ON41FC|5.0|As stated by other reviews you can easily opt out of Openfeint in just a few clicks! The 1 star reviewers for openfeint need to learn how to read. The graphics and sound are great on the Kindle Fire. The game play is pretty simple and after a couple of minutes I got the hang of it. Its a fun and addictive time waster! Keep the great apps coming Amazon!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying we couldn't care diddly squat about the digital whatchamacallit that came with this. We were only in it for the DVD.<br /><br />We loved the movie in the theater and with our big screen this was just as beautiful in our living room.<br /><br />I can't speak for the rest of my family, but the only Harry Potter movie I loved even close to this one was the Prisoner of Azkaban and I thought it could never be toppled.<br /><br />I'm sure I have nothing in the way to offer beyond what other reviewers have given this, but mind the PG-13 rating. Some kids will have very negative reactions to the violence against their beloved characters, especially some of the deaths.
B004UID2LC|1.0|the app.makes your device crash do not get it I have had so many problems! it will cause your device to crash a lot
0316010669|1.0|Summary:  If you are an expert then trust your gut feelings.  If you are not an expert then don't trust your gut feelings.

B006ON41FC|5.0|well first of all it is really fun. second I never found myself getting board of it. the obstacles are really easy to dodge sceptically for the trees.
B0078N2MTE|5.0|You will be carried away on a remarkable journey.  Why have I not heard of this movie before?  Much respect for leads in this film.
0452273331|5.0|My only regret is that I didn't read this book when I was eighteen. For 700+ pages, it was a good and fast read.  If I ever put the book down for a while, when I picked it back up, I felt as if I had not lost a beat.  Probably my favorite quote was \\"the shortest distance between two points is the middleman and such is the psychology of the pretzel\\". I found myself using the highlight feature on my Kindle often.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game its fun and addictive. this game has Good graphics  and its free! you should download this app you wont regret it!  I give it 5 stars and a thumbs up!!! good job!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i think it was a good game. a little bit boring sometimes but it keeps you entertained though. i wouldn't say its my favorite but it wouldn't be my least favorite.  i would recommend it though :)
0439023491|5.0|Like the first book, I had a very hard time putting this one down.<br /><br />This book isn't as fast paced as the 1st, but it packs an emotional punch as well. Characters and environments evolve from the fallout of book 1, and new twists and turns are thrown their (our) way.  There was even some humor added in unexpected places and ways that caused me to laugh so hard my family thought I'd lost my mind.<br /><br />Katniss, the strong protagonista of the story, still has to work out her feelings for Peeta and Gale, still going strong protecting those she loves, and still trying to make lemonade out of moldy ol' lemons (even if they look shiny from the Capitol)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the best app in the wrold it has red bird and black bird and blue bird I can nit stop playing it
B006ON41FC|4.0|very cute game. I'm glad it was free since it's become rather addicting. its a little laggy at times on my g2x but overall I like it.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I had gotten this for my dad for a Christmas present but had to wait til the February release date in the states. The shipping was prompt and the order received right on time which happened to be during a month long work training session out of town for me, but my dad waited til I got home til he watched it. We had seen Phantom in LA when I was about 12 for the first time, as soon as it was over I looked at him and said \\"I want to see it again!\\" and within a week he had tickets for us to see it again in the 3rd row. Since then we have seen it together at least a dozen times between LA, Dallas (where we live now), and flying to New York twice to see it. While other members of my family enjoy Phantom, it has always been a special connection between my dad and I. Tonight we watched this performance together and I hugged him after the overture for how amazing this was going to be. By the time \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" played, I had squished by 22 year old self into my dad's chair with him and pretend I was a little girl again enjoying Phantom for the first time. Christine was the best I have ever seen or heard, with such emotion behind her voice and expressions that she brought me to tears in a few scenes. Best Christmas present I have ever spent money on for me and my dad to now be able to enjoy this in our own home, which I hope won't replace the trips to New York to see it live!  This is a must for any Phantom fan, I wouldn't recommend for people who haven't seen it live just because you cannot fully start to imagine what that experience is like, but for anyone, this is as close as it will get.
0439023521|5.0|I'd heard about these books for quite a while and with the movie coming out soon, I decided to give it a try. The truth is, I didn't know what to expect. Descriptions of the story do not do it justice.  The first chapter was hard to get wrapped into the story. First person perspective and storytelling would not allow me to connect wholly to Katniss and her world. However, the 2nd chapter on I could not put the book down. I tried to find any way to work another chapter here and there throughout the day.  I fell in love with each and every character to walk in and out of Katniss's life. I felt for each one of them as though I knew them personally and marveled at how invested I was in each. I may not have liked some, but to me they were still full bodied, believable characters.  While reading most of the Games, I was a wreck! If I could have held the book and bite my nails, I would have.
B006OFN0SE|4.0|\\"Sometimes you need to bend the rules a little in order to keep your country safe.\\" The true story of the man who turned the FBI into what it is today and his almost 50 year reign as the director.  The movie deals with his life as director and the secrets that he kept that he used to stay in power, the same secrets he was worried would bring him down if anyone found out.  Once again being a huge history buff I was really looking forward to this movie.  I also have to say that in-spite of myself I am also becoming a DiCaprio fan. He has come a long way from \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" and I think deserved at least a nomination for this movie. Most of the time if you didn't know it was him you wouldn't have known it. As for the movie I really liked it. The longer it went on the more I got into it.  The only problem I had with this movie is that it tried to put every important aspect of his life in and the movie became a series of little clips that were about ten minutes each that didn't seem to flow together in a normal story like form. The movie is very good and I do recommend it but they flow of the movie seemed different to me. Overall, a good movie that is very much worth watching. I give it an A-.
B0061S073A|3.0|There are several apps that cause kids place to lock up. I have to spend a lot of time typing the password to exit and restart the  app when my grandson plays it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Had absolutely no problem eliminating the open feint and if I can figure it out anyone should be able to do it.  It's a pretty good game, I just have to learn to control the little rodent better!!
0439023513|2.0|Nothing I say here hasn't already been said by others, but after reading this book and its reviews, I had to comment.  First, I have to say that the first two books are masterfully done. Each character has a purpose, has a reason for being in Katniss's world. I think this is highlighted by the fact that some tributes are never named because the book is written in her 1st person perspective, and actually adds to that closeness of the reader to Katniss's thoughts.  But in this book, the author seems to show that she has trouble weaving a story of conflict and loss outside of the Games. There is no structure, characters lose their strengths and purpose for being in Katniss's world.  Now the two arguments I've seen in the reviews have been that one has to be or know someone in the military to understand what the author was trying to convey in this book and that it's unfair to compare Katniss (in this book) to Twilight's Bella.  The thing about reading this book and a military background is if the reader can't understand the feelings and actions of the character(s) then that is the fault of the author, not the reader. It's the authors responsibility to connect the reader to the emotions, extreme and subtle, behind the actions of the characters. In the first two books, I felt the pain and loss of Katniss and all those in her world. It did not require me to have lived or known someone to have lived in the districts of Panem. Nor did it require me or someone I've known to experience the Games to feel these things with the characters. The author obviously missed her mark when so many feel their beloved characters withered away rather than became stronger, more flawed (more complex) characters in the end.  And I have to agree with the comparison of Katniss to Bella. Katniss had become a shadow of herself in this book. She seemed to whine or pout throughout this book. There were times when I could picture her stomping her foot and holding her breath at just how unfair life wasfor her. This was not the Katniss of the first two books that tried to make the best out of what precious little she could get. This was not the Katniss who instinctively put the needs of those she loved above her own. And she respected anyone that did the same. In an everyone-out-for-themselves world, this was a huge strength of character.  The only selfishness she'd shown in the first two books (and her backstory) was when she was ready to give up because she could not see any other way to help her loved ones, and even that is only slightly selfish. So the change was like night and day.  I wish this book had the characters grow from what they originally were, flaws and all, to prove the author's point subtly. Not become completely different characters just to prove her point. And as others mentioned, I wish more focus was on how Katniss and her husband rebuilt their relationship and their world.  In all, I think the author had very strong emotions connected to war and those emotions made her forget that it was the characters, not the war, that was crucial to the story.
B0011BDPXQ|1.0|I never understood the slavish adherence to the idea that the Stargate is a secret to all Earth.  Seems like having a space ship is more a threat to the show's formula than the idea that Earthlings knew about the Stargate.  It's as though that element of the show is the key to everything.  In the end, it simply doomed the show.  There is nothing plausible about it.  There are a lot of people who ask questions and many of them not only don't care what the government thinks about their opinions, they want to confront and challenge the authorities.  Billions of dollars do disappear, but people are not content with \\"classifed\\" being repeated a thousand times.  This is the weakest element of all of Stargate.  It mystifies me that they kept it up for more than a dozen years.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is another one of those movies that I love to see over and over.  I laughed so much I cried.  I HATE slasher movies, this movie  snubs those kinds by adding its own type of twist and lots of laughs!!!  I love the characters and the story line.  The characters are 'regular-types' (that you can 'understand'/associate with) and the story wasn't 'stupid' which was the best part.  The surprises were endless, just when when you think you've figiured it out, then something else would happen!!  It was exciting, suspenseful and funny all rolled up into one movie!  I recommend this movie, not to squeemish due to the blood, but to those who want excitement and laughs -- satisfaction guaranteed!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is sooo addicting! I love it:) The levels are easy, but completing the ribbons and earning all the stars is what makes it challenging but fun!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Bag It is a very fun app!  Works great on my kindle fire.It's fun for all ages, easy to learn, and never gets old!  Worth the $.99.  Very happy:)
B006ON41FC|5.0|its a fun game I don't see why everyone is complaining. sure it connects to open feint (or w.e) automatically but that dosnt mean you cant enjoy the game!
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun game kids love it they said it was easy to play and great picture. they play it all the time.
B006ON41FC|4.0|love the game, fun and addicting on my EVO. Reminds me of a cute version of Temple Run! The app does freeze up a little too much though and doesn't work well on my galaxy tab.
B006ON41FC|5.0|You and your child will love this app.I got it and then my mom and dad got it and we were all addicted to it!
B006PHD0RW|1.0|wanted to check it out, got tons of great reviews, but it won't even open on my EVO. as soon as the app launches, it closes right back out. no force close warning or anything. just closes
B005Q1W10A|5.0|As a Brit living in the US, I miss Sunday night dramas on the BBC or ITV, so I was so excited to be able to get seasons 1 and 2 UK original version from Amazon.com.  Season 2 was almost perfect - almost got a little soap opera-ish at one point, but who cares? Thomas and O'Brien are miserable people, but we got to see a bit of a softer/vulnerable side to them. Violet is a hoot and her constant bickering with Cousin Isabelle is hilarious. We just finished the last episode tonight and decided to go the extra mile and watch the Christmas Special. Wonderful, wonderful drama!

0439023513|3.0|The arc of the Hunger Games is compelling, although I personally feel that Suzanne Collins's style is a bit sparse. What just blew my mind, however, having just finished Mockingjay 3 minutes ago is...what kind of ending was that?! After all that she's been through, after all the horrors that she endured, after all the strength she showed through the whole series...Katniss just fades into the periphery, doesn't even try, just gives up and has kids with Peta!? Seriously. At the end, of the book, Katniss claims that she has enough fire...but where did it all go at the end? I feel like the ending was rushed and that Katniss wasn't given a chance to mark the new government that she had such a hand in allowing to form. She just gives in to silent, country life and has kids!? Ugh! I know that a big theme of Katniss's life is having to fill roles that she didn't choose, being a pawn in everyone's little game... but I don't think the ending that came out of the book was really her choice either. She didn't try to claw back and use the power that was thrust upon her to make her own place in the world...she just settles down with Peta and has kids! Ahh!!! I can't get over it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great game I want to play it all day......I'm so good at it!!!!:) I wish everyone could play it I lovvee this games!!

B006PHD0RW|1.0|In my personal opinion, I  hate it!!! it is stupid. it doesn't make sense. although it is a puzzle game and I'm not good at puzzle games so that might be the reason!
0062011847|4.0|It's been a while since you're latest Vimes fix. You're maybe missing him. It's been years. You're maybe thinking, \\"I wish I could get so close to Vimes that I was in his head.\\"  Then this book is perfect for you! Why haven't you read it yet?  This isn't as much a City Watch book; everyone except Vimes has a small role. It isn't so much satire, either. The comedy is like a puppet show staged behind a two-hour-long one-man off-broadway premiere. This is a story about Vimes. It takes place mostly in his head. All of the other characters serve to illuminate Vimes: they are his foils, his mentees and children, his other halves. The plot isn't something that happens to Vimes, it is something he pulls along behind himself as he is compelled into action by his Vimes-yness.  This is the brooding, introspective Vimes of Monstrous Regiment, showcased and dwelled upon. For 416 pages. In many ways, this is great! Vimes is an interesting character, the plot has its twists and interests. It's well written. Poop has a recurring role. In some ways, though, it's intense! Vimes is an intense character. He is a man of blacks and whites, a man against the world, a man against himself.  Snuff has a different tone from most Discworld books, but it's still good. If you've enjoyed the City Watch characters up until this point, you'll enjoy submersing your head in Vimes'.

B002GZQYMK|1.0|Got this CD cus a friend recommended them, said they were like this band that band this other band...  said they were GREAT and his favorite.  Well, they sound like Radiohead meets Alkaline Trio with a splash of Queen, and that pretty much sums them up.  If I want to listen to any of those bands I will, I dont need one band that sounds like them.
B005T87QCI|2.0|I downloaded this app and it is very very. hard. playing on easy is like playing on hard, and metronome is nearly impossible to beat. don't get this for your kids, they willget very frustrated.
0062082353|1.0|how many americans will praise a book like this and then go to church on a sunday? This country is in a high state of hypocritical denial about such issues- such issues as sex or death.<br />I've browsed the book and seen Kyle on Dylan Ratigan.<br />A society that praises killing and spending on war as we do- it's not surprising.<br />The 10 Commandments- the sermon on the mount? this country would rather push war. The real issues of a thug like Kyle? glossed over- too controversial.<br />sad, really- like rome-we are a Godless society.<br />The real heroes are the peacemakers- never forget it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun cant stop playing the game the points are a little ridiculous to have to get so many. the snake game is my favorite
B005LAIGWS|2.0|\\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" is stunningly disappointing to fanboys. I'm a fan of the Marvel Ghost Rider comic books. I'm a fan of directors Neveldine and Taylor (loved their Crank movies). I'm a fan of Nicolas Cage. I'm a fan of mindless comic book and action films with loud explosions and soundtracks. But this movie was little better than the worst Bruce Campbell movie made in Romania for the Sci-Fi Channel. It looks like it was made on a low budget. There is little action, and what there is is visually dull. The rest of the movie is sitting around and talking.<br /><br />All I wanted from this movie was some cool chase sequences, fights, and explosions. It turns out that all the good moments fit into the trailer. The car chases are dull. Ghost Rider mostly stands around rather than fights, and when he does fight it's not exciting. The 3D effect is fine but it does not add much.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" looks like a cheap and quick made for TV movie compared to the 2011 hits \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\", \\"Fast Five\\", \\"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\\", \\"Thor\\", \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\", and \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\". With so many good action and comic book movies being made now, there's no reason to spend any time or money on Rider. I went in hoping for \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" and got \\"Elektra\\".<br /><br />Reviewed 2-17-2017 after watching in 3D on opening day of its theatrical release.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|it rarely is able to download. used to be a good app, but last few months it has become almost useless
B006ON41FC|3.0|This game is a good game .... It will be better if the fient didn't come up every time you opened the game

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is pretty fun. It's a great time killer. There is a whole lot of games you can play, but one of the downsides is you need to purchase most of games by coins you get in game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is definitely worth $.99, I spent more than a few hours on it yesterday and really have no idea where all the time went. It is kind of annoying when you're constantly asked to review but it's fairly easily bypassed. The game looks nice and flows perfectly on my tablet ( asus prime, ICS), I wish more games worked this smoothly. I will be buying the next one as soon as I've mastered most of this one.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I just got this app for my new kindle fire! This is BY FAR my favorite app on my device. This game is full of   nonstop fun as you challenge your hidden bagging techniques! There are several different catagories  for the game. I absolutely love and highly reccomend it for any age! Well worth it! Hope this convinced you to get it! The pictures / controls also are great and I play the game every day! :D I WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS IF GIVEN THE OPTION!! I cant stress enough how much you should get this app!!! :)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Excellent game,  hours of fun on your kindle for a great price! Multiple levels that require different problem solving skills.
B000W965QW|5.0|This book is real great. If you haven't seen the movie, I think that is well done, also.  I really just wanted to comment on how you can buy a used hardcover of this for UNDER A DOLLAR, and yet you have to pay $12.99 for the kindle edition....  I'm glad that my kindle was a gift, so I don't feel obligated to spend 13 times the amount of a real book, to have a paperless edition.  This is where kindle book pricing does not make sense to me.... If the kindle edition was, say, $4.00 or even $7.00 or so, I would have spent that. Why? I do like my kindle. But the stubborn high prices on ebooks is actually swaying me to NOT buy ebooks, and still even save money by purchasing used for UNDER A DOLLAR.  Haha, sorry if this is confusing. I realize that ebook prices are not always Amazon's setting, so no complaints there. Just a general WTF, why is it SO EXPENSIVE rant.
076115678X|5.0|I'm so thankful for this book because it has been transformative to my life.  Hair is a very big part of our expression of self and when we don't know how to magnify it's beauty it can be frustrating.  This book addresses not only the science behind out hair, but also the ways our hair effects our identity and how to embrace ourselves.  Thankfully, our culture is showing more appreciation for curly hair, but that has not always been the case.  Read this book!  Embrace your inner curl, share it with others, and even start a curly girl informational session/support group!  Curly Girls Rock!
1400069289|4.0|The book as you will guess by the title alone, is all about how to recognize habits, change our bad habits, and establish some better ones.  I have heard MANY times that you do not 'break' a habit, you replace it with a better one, or a good habit.  This book has a lot of interesting stories on people either in groups or on their own, and how changing a habit impacted the single person or the group.  There is also talk about how habits affect us ALL as a society.  I found it to be an interesting read...it made me think about some of my own habits and how I can go about fixing them and make some good changes for myself.
0385342063|5.0|I got into this novel within the first few pages. Poppy is an irresistible character who immediately draws the reader to her corner.<br /><br />Our heroine, Poppy Wyatt thinks she will be marrying the \\"perfect\\" man in Magnus - she has it all planned out - and has the engagement ring to prove it... or wait... no no no no no - NO? Uh-oh! Poppy seems to have lost the engagement ring during a fire-drill at the hotel where she was attending the Marie Curie Champagne Tea event with her friends. One second it was there - the next - GONE! As Poppy frantically searches the ballroom for her emerald engagement ring she realizes she doesn't have a strong signal (reception for you US readers) and heads outside only to have her phone ripped from her hands by a hooded figure on a bicycle.<br />That phone was the only way for people to reach Poppy to tell her they've found her ring.<br />Now what?!<br />In a slight panic, Poppy is fetched a drink... the brandy helps clear her mind and focuses on the trash can... where - oh can it be? Poppy somehow manages to locate a mobile phone just waiting conveniently in the rubbish bin for someone in need to grab it. Can she? Should she?<br />Oh yes she can!<br />Poppy takes the phone and prepares to use it when it rings!<br />The voice on the other phone is very pompous and demanding.<br />Soon Poppy finds herself using the phone to \\"help\\" its owner, Sam Roxton, in ways that he never expected. All Sam needed from Poppy was the promise to forward any messages that arrived on the phone - but from that moment on their lives went on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.<br /><br />What I loved about this book is the humor and interactions between Sam and Poppy. I couldn't believe some of the events that took place in this book! I thought that both characters were complex enough to hold readers' interest and that Kinsella showed the journey that led to their evolution. Poppy and Sam must both overcome some issues with their personal lives as well as how they're leading those lives.<br /><br />I think that anyone who has read Kinsella's books, or has enjoyed light-romancey-comedies will enjoy this book!<br /><br />romancereviewz[dot]blogspot[dot]comread Kinsella's books, or has enjoyed light-romancey-comedies will enjoy this book!  romancereviewz[dot]blogspot[dot]com
B006QVRVJK|3.0|Based on the acclaimed play by Yasmina Reza, this is the tale of two sets of parents and their misguided attempt to make peace after one of their children bludgeons the other with a stick in the local park, causing the other to lose a tooth and undergo dental surgery. Nancy and Allen (Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz) are the parents of the culprit, and Penelope and Michael (Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly) are the piping mad parents of the injured victim.  At some point, they decide to hold a meeting at the bourgeois home of the high-strung Penelope and her doltish husband, Michael. From the start, things begin to go awry. Penelope begins to critique the parenting skills of both Nancy and Allen, and visa versa. Before long, things get out of hand, with all four individuals firing various insults at one another, revealing their true colors, and ironically behaving like schoolyard bullies themselves. Much like Edward Albee's `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf', alcohol soon plays a supporting role in the film, and the situation escalates from bad to worse.  This is the film in a nutshell - pardon the cliché. Four people, one setting, tons of fireworks. It wants to be `Virginia Woolf' for a new generation, but lacks the acid wit and ferocious bite of Albee's masterpiece. One of the problems with `Carnage' is that the material isn't as funny as it thinks it is. These characters never go for the throat, and the film suffers as a result.  Jodie Foster is yet another weak link in the film. She is over the top - and not in a good way. Her performance is annoyingly distracting. Either she was sorely miscast in this particular role, or comedy simply isn't Foster's forte. On the other hand, Kate Winslet, John C. Reilly, and Christoph Waltz are at the top of their game. Collectively, they make the film worth watching, and they have some of the best lines.  `Carnage' isn't without its charms, though most of those are in the first act. The two scenes which bookend the film are quite effective as well. With just a bit more edge, this film could have been a small classic. As it is, it is merely okay and nothing more.  Rated R, 80 minutes, directed by Roman Polanski, released by Sony Pictures Classics
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this app. I play it everyday and I am addicted. My sister, dad, and I all play this game constantly. The game is not only fun, but also has goals that you are trying to accomplish. I got this app when it was free, but I would pay for it any day. Worth the price, super fun, and clean. It works great on my kindle fire. I say go for it!
B006OV7S1I|5.0|Sean Durkin's film debut, `Martha Marcy May Marlene', was a hit with the indie crowd at Sundance this year, winning the U.S. Director's Award for Best Drama. After much acclaim in the film festival circuit, `Martha Marcy May Marlene' has been given a wide release. It is also one of the best films of the year.  The story focuses on a young girl named Martha, who escapes from a manipulative, abusive cult in the Catskill Mountains. Her estranged older sister picks her up at a gas station three hours away from the location of the aforementioned cult, and insists that Martha stay with she and her husband. All the while, Martha begins to unravel emotionally, as well as psychologically. The film blends past with present, bending the narrative so that you are seeing the world through Martha's eyes in all of its twisted confusion. While her sister and her brother-in-law desperately try to unveil her many secrets, Martha is haunted by a lingering sense of paranoia, as she fears the \\"family\\" from which she escaped may come back for her any minute.  This is not an easy film to watch. The scenes of emotional abuse and brainwashing are powerfully raw. However, this film attempts to bring to the surface issues which are shockingly relevant.  The film is anchored by two excellent performances by Elizabeth Olsen as Martha and John Hawkes as cult leader, Patrick. Sean Durkin is a filmmaker to watch. This is an extraordinarily strong debut.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very fun way to keep boredom at bay. Some games aren't as good as others, but all are entertaining. A worthy advesment for the easily bored.
B006OB3K56|5.0|Steve McQueen's sophomore feature officially solidifies the director's status as one of the greats. McQueen is one to watch. With his debut feature, `Hunger', he was able to pull an amazing performance out of the incredibly versatile Michael Fassbender, and he does the same here.  The aptly titled `Shame' centers around a man named Brandon Sullivan. Brandon seems to lead the perfect life. He has the perfect job, lives comfortably in an upscale apartment in New York, and is strikingly handsome and healthy for a man in his late thirties. All of his friends seem to love him, and he gets along quite well with his boss and co-workers. However, Brandon is living in darkness. The truth is that Brandon has been struggling with sexual addiction for quite some time, and as we will see throughout the course of the film, it has begun to devour him completely. Unable to form intimate bonds and meaningful relationships, Brandon has become a slave to his most carnal desires. His life consists of casual trysts with prostitutes and random men and women from clubs and bars, sexual encounters over the webcam, voyeurism, and compulsive masturbation - not to mention a drug habit.  When his emotionally damaged sister, Sissy, unexpectedly shows up at his apartment in need of a place to stay, she quickly becomes a nuisance in his life, placing a barrier between Brandon and his addiction. When she discovers his dark secret, she is appalled at first, but attempts to lead him to the path of recovery by reminding him that he is loved. These two damaged souls need one another to survive.  As the pressure mounts, Brandon's life begins to unravel. He goes to the very depths of hell and back. He begins to lose control, until one day when he is forced to deal with his demons head on.  There is hope for Brandon yet.  The performances in `Shame' are magnificent. Michael Fassbender delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the tortured Brandon. It is a tragedy that he was somehow overlooked for this years Oscar race. Carey Mulligan is equally powerful as Sissy. She was extraordinary in `An Education', and continues to impress with her monumental work here. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the score is haunting as well. All technical and artistic aspects are perfect.  This is an exceptionally powerful film, and it is not recommended for those who are easily offended. Director Steve McQueen refused to censor this material to gain an R rating, and so the film was branded with a well-deserved NC-17 rating. The sexual content is extremely explicit, but serves a purpose within the context of the film, and is never gratuitous. If you are seeking titillation, you will not find it here. Onscreen sex has never looked so repulsive. Sex addiction is a serious issue that is rarely dealt with in the cinema. Steve McQueen tackles the subject with respect and constraint. The results are disturbing and rewarding. `Shame' is one of the best films of 2012.  Rated NC-17 for explicit sexual content, 101 minutes, directed by Steve McQueen, released by Fox Searchlight Pictures.
0062082353|1.0|It's stunning that this book  is/was a best seller. I usually write longer reviews. But why waste my effort? The book is poorly written, as pointed out by several others. I'm sure the author is a great soldier. But he is not interesting at all, which is strange given his credentials. I have to confess. I didn't finish the book. I couldn't continue after I got midway through it. The writing was at the grade-school level, and the sniper came across as vacuous with fake humility.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game said I would get pts if I did this so I'm just gonna give it 5 stars la la la la la
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Simon Baker was given some gritty material in Season 3.  The concluding episode totally shocked me.  Anxious to see Season 4 and find out how Simon is going to get out of his very weighty problem.
B006ON41FC|4.0|the only reason I gave it a four is because there is something better than this game that's aorta similar.  DEAD RUNNER,  instead of one game mode, u have three in dead runner, it was once the app of the day.  and I think it was one of the best app of the days that I had ever played. so if u are not buying this app when its free then I suggest that u buy dead runner instead
B006ON41FC|5.0|endless fun, controls are simple and easy. soooo worth the 99&cent;, although it might not look like it. Get this app!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|omg, this game is so fun! I love the graphics, and the squirrel is adorable. I didn't find this game very difficult, and its hours of fun!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Great game to fall asleep to.  Quell is very well done, but not designed to thrill.  Well worth the money.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Earlier last year I would hear this song on the radio that would just stick in my head. It was an amazing piece of music, but I never really caught the performers name.  Each and every time I listened to the song, a wide smile came upon my face and then shortly afterward tears. The spine tingling vocals with her beautiful voice accompanied by no more than a piano, this song no doubt leaves a lasting impression.  This song is \\"Someone like you\\", and I can say with conviction that listening to that song never gets old or \\"boring\\".  After the recent Grammys I ventured online and sampled other songs off her album, \\"21\\".  Tremendous material the lot of samplings that I listened to, so I went out to Target to purchase her Deluxe CD with 4 bonus tracks.  Rolling in the Deep is a fun, uptempo, and divinely soulful romp.  Adele's remake of Lovesong is splendid.  The overall production qualities on this CD leave the ear wanting more, MUCH MORE!  I think I will go out and buy her first album now.  For any fans of GREAT music, \\"21\\" will NOT disappoint!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are so fun you don't want to stop playing when you get in to it.. so download it now and rate it with 5stars!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|let me start out by saying the dvds DO work and i love this show but the layout on the dvds and the box itself is crap. there is no play all feature on the disc so you have to play each episode individually... thankfully theres only 2 eps per disc, but you have to go all the way back to the main menu then back into episodes to get to the next episode. the box is already falling apart from me opening it the very first time, the glue holding the plastic pieces onto the cardboard just popped right off.  now having said that, i love this show. great show. the 5 stars are for that.. if i were to give the packaging and menu layout a rating it would have been 2 or 3 stars.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is awesome u should get it they have allot of challenges for this game. u will have tun trust meh
0439023491|5.0|Such a great book and a great series.  It was a little slow getting going, but once I started I couldn't put it down.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. It is sooooo much fun. The graphics are impeccable!!!! I think that the flying squirrel is adorable. It is now my favorite game!!! Play it almost every day. Buy it!!!!
0439023521|5.0|very engaging and gripping.  it took a few pages to get going and once it did i couldn't put it down.  the entire series is wonderful and i highly recommend it.
0393317552|4.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies is a captivating book by an evolutionary biologist, trying to shed light on why certain civilizations fared better than others. The structure of the book has a scientific flavor about it, is explicitly biased towards geographical determinism, but far from providing peremptory arguments on the subject. The examples are thoroughly expanded with a lot of detailed information, inspired by diverse civilizations painted in different times. The reader clearly feels that the book is the result of in depth research.
0439023513|5.0|Such a beautifully written series, the ending was bittersweet! Its a series I'll read again and again. You'll fall in love with the characters and get wrapped up in this story.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Spent my .99 for the game (love Uno) Only to discover I couldn't get it on my fire, because of the 80 mgb it requires! What a waste of a buck! :( Now know I will avoid any and all apps from Gameloft!
B005HSL626|1.0|The WORST GAME EVER Because the first Time i tried to play it it went back to the app store!)
B006ON41FC|3.0|The game is really quite fun. I would rate it five stars except for two things. One is that the pause button is far to close to the control area, it miss triggers quite often. Two is that after a few times of playing, the game gets down right bitchy about creating a review for it. I got the pop up to rate it after every single click. What a load of crap. Let me decide when and if to rate you, don't make it nearly a requirement of playing the game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I don't expect much from my phone in terms of games but this does keep you entertained for awhile...its a nice break from angry birds.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I haven't been able to stop playing it since I downloaded it! one of the most fun games I've played in a while by far!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I am only putting this to get rid of the rate five stars ad its so annoying and I can't stand it
B0071QIN00|4.0|Fun game, with some good challenges.  Does freeze up my Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant occasionally.  Would give it  5 star if it didn't freeze up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really great app I play it all the time!!!!!!!!!!!!! the most addictive game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! I delly think you should get it
B006ON41FC|5.0|I thought this game was amazing. However, I had to make a review or I couldn't get back on which made me angry so I suggest that the app. Creators fix that.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is so cool. it really passes the time I love it. I think you should get this app for all its worth.
0316044695|5.0|Really well written story about true life American heroes, even as you may ask yourself why are we in Afghanistan?  Maintains your interest throughout.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Truth is boring, unpleasant and disappointing. But it is necessary to tell it and to defend it. That's why the First and the Second are the most important and need to be fought for.  Katniss should have died in the end. She's got lucky, though. She became largely irrelevant and nobody bothered. And, I guess, the powers that be had enough sentimentality to patch the girl up and let her be. That happens.  I'd say, the third book is the most important in the series and make it it worth the adult reader's time.  --  Cohen the Barbarian
B006UG90RM|3.0|First I apologize to all on YOU TUBE for my immediate comment of essentially OMG I never thought I would say this but VH SUCKS!\\" I partially take it back.  This album, yes I bought it and have listened to it numerous times so STFU, it is very catchy but not new,  the songs stick in your head, a VH Trademark for sure. DLR still has breath, but still appears the idiot when he speaks or live.  Same drum tracks, guitar riffs, every time you think \\"WOW HERE COMES VAN HALEN\\" PLLLLLBHHHHH nada zip nil nothing. Just revamped 80's blues van halen scale rock.  JUST the way we like it...bet this would be awesome live, but not on MP3. But STILL IT IS VAN HALEN DAMMIT!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy playing this app when I'm really bored. there are some of the games that i get stuck on for months, but then i will let one of my friends play it and they get it within 3 tries.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|awesome. good app. a bit memory heavy. a a a a a a a a a a aava hzhdh sssss jsbs
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  In some ways it is like Tetris for groceries.  The object is to quickly and safely pack a grocery bag.  The setup is quite similar to other premier games such as Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, and Where's My Water, where there are numerous levels in different scenarios that you unlock once you progress through the game.  Scoring is also out of three stars based on speed and successful completion of objectives.  As common sense would dictate you want to place the larger, heavier, and more durable objects at the bottom of the bag as to not damage the more delicate items.  The humorously animated food products help to turn a seemingly mundane task into an enjoyable puzzle game.
007174889X|5.0|This is the best book when it comes to high level medicine. I'm from Brazil and i can tell you, the reading is great, the vocabulary is easy to understand and the informations are the most trusted in the Medical World. Just buy it! You won't regret.
B00004XPPC|5.0|Some films remain with us forever, this is one of those transcendent films at the tipping point of David lean becoming beyond a great craftsman and story teller. Forget any accuracy to the novel or the war for that matter, it holds on slender facts and becomes one of those wondrous studies of character he is so well known for. Its nice to see each new edition of these classics restored by technology, I hope future blueray and beyond will take care of these classics.

B006ON41FC|1.0|Ok 1st to all those condescending reviewers: I am NOT illiterate &amp; I did read the instructions....&amp; ummm,  guess what? You CANNOT OPT OUT of OpenFeint!!!  A note to the developers here, there's actually a small, minuscule group of us out here that DO NOT WANT to share everything we do with a social networking site. And here's the kicker...believe it or not, we still actually want to &quot;Have Fun&quot;! **and to developers: please stop having ur family &amp; friends stop writing &amp; submitting all ur 5 star reviews here. It's just sad.  If this app paid me to install it, I wouldn't have. Can I give this a Negative Star Rating??
B004PVF95Q|3.0|I became an Elbow fan after buying the \\"Seldom Seen Kid\\". This album is a bit slower and duller than that. Its an OK album but I cannot help but be disappointed. I will stay an Elbow fan after this release but I had hoped to grow as a fan when I bought this album.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I loved this game. The graphics was awesome.  Great job on your first design creator.  However it was really short.  If you could make it as long as the Ravenhurst game I would so pay $10 for it.
0312641893|5.0|Cinder was an amazing retelling of Cinderella, but it was also way more than just a retelling.  Cinder is a strong character that I really admired. I actually wish I was as strong as her. She loves her stepsister Peony who is her only human friend and her robot friend IKO. She didn't have an easy life what with most of her family hating her and being a pariah because of the fact that she is a cyborg, but she was still hopeful about her future and was a true friend to those she was close too.  Kai was a very charming prince and what I loved most about his character was that he wasn't one dimensional like his character is sometimes portrayed in other retellings. He has a sense of humor and even though he has problems he doesn't let them completely take over his life. Kai was also very noble and kindhearted which really showed through when he was protecting the lives of his people. I really liked seeing the relationship between him and Cinder develop throughout the story.  IKO was most definitely one of my favorite characters in this book she is so silly and happy go lucky. It's hard to feel sad whenever she is around. She was also a great friend to Cinder.  The sci-fi elements in this story were really interesting and I liked to see how they played a role in this futuristic world of Cinder's. Even with all of the technological advancements of this world they still had celebrated old traditions like the festival which I felt made the story seem even more real and showed how even as time goes on human society still holds onto and remembers it's routes.  My favorite quote from \\"Cinder\\" has to be \\"Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time.\\".  I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages it is simply amazing and I cannot wait until the next book comes out!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Even if you don't know God this is a good first start. It will read the Bible for you. Make your decision on The Word after you've read it. You'll be surprise how it could help you today. Keep an open mind and prepare to be amazed.
B006WPSQVC|1.0|This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  It was horrible!  I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless it was free.........but then be prepared to be bored.
0743299795|5.0|I haven't finished it yet, but I am enjoying it.  A bit old but very interesting history inside there..  Not very analytical and so far not very detailed in how to apply lean manufacturing.  It is more of how lean can help you rather than how to apply lean \\"so far\\"
B006ON41FC|5.0|i love this game its the best you should totaly get it works asom on kindle fire it is so adictive
1594744475|5.0|This is a great book with wonderfully inspiring pictures. Recipes are simple and sound great. There are tips on using food to tint rice and hard boiled eggs. I have not made any of the food suggested yet, but am excited about all the possibilities.

B0045EJY90|1.0|This product was faulty out of carton, it would play a CD about 3/4 way then just stop, and nothing would correct this, you could go back to beginning of CD and it would play 3/4 way then stop again. I was dissapointed, normally being a frequent customer of Amazon I am pleased with items purchased thru the years, and it is always my main source of on-line purchasing.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is so easy to play my six year old has the high score, but my husband can't resist the challenge  either. get past the owl only to face Tnt.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is pretty fun I like that its kinda like an old game I use to play I gave it a 5 cause it was a little more fun than all the other games I have.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I got this game because it was a free game of the day. I have really loved it though! It is very engaging and a fun, different idea. I recommend this app.

145162445X|4.0|This is the second book by Professor Krauss that I have bought and read, and both of them were great reads. I learned a great deal about the vacuum of space which he wonderfully explains. It is \\"something\\" not \\"nothing.\\" His overall coverage of astrophysics is very well written. The only dislike I can register is the inordinate amount of time and space that he used in the exposition of his debates with the clergy, philosophers, and other non-scientists concerning the origin of the universe. Why waste so much energy on them?
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is fun first time playing it and got to 1000 m already if you don't want to get this game your lost losers lol joking but you should get it
B006ON41FC|1.0|Game freezes up due to Openfeint.  Doesn't give option to decline.  Lame...  uninstalled due to not working properly.  Glad there is a twenty word minimum for these reviews so i can make sure you understand that this game freezes due to openfeint.  Hence the uninstall.
B006ON41FC|4.0|my whole family loves this app, we all downloaded it to our phones. we have had no problems getting it to play
B000HF6XKO|5.0|This movie will keep you hooked till the end, unless you expect fancy CIA spy action thriller sniper shooting movies. This is not a fantasy movie, for those of you who know the 'real' world, this movie is of no surprise. Movie flows in 4 different paths and connects very well. Concentrate and Compare to the world around you!!
B0010X745K|5.0|Arrived early and played without any problems. Great story and good actors, special effects were good too. I bought it because every store in the 3 county area didn't have it or couldn't tell me if it cound be ordered!

B0025KVLRY|5.0|What can you say - it's the Beatles!  It's early Beatles all the way and better than I had anticipated.  Everything the Beatles touched was gold, and it's only in light of their superb work that causes this CD to be rated low on the list of Beatle releases.  But put it up against other artists of the time and it shines.  The Beatles went through three stages in their musical career and this CD is from the first.  Like Please Please Me it's a snap shot of the Beatles early career, when they were working day in and out entertaining at little dance halls and traveling all over England in a bus with Roy Orbison and other great early rockers. You can hear the chase for fame in their voices.  There are several classic early Beatle tunes on this cd, including It Won't be Long, All My Loving, Roll Over Beethoven (really good), and Money (really good).  Get it.  Get them all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|quite enjoy solitaire.  nice to play a free version. few pop up ads make it easy to jusy play the game.
B000XSLVN4|3.0|The record label has ruined it again!  This special edition contains the edited version of her songs.  It ruins the songs.  \\"Special\\" Edition means rip-off.
0545425115|5.0|I am completely in shock that I love such a gruesome book.  Wow!  Wish there were more than the 3.  I read them all in a week.    Suzanne Collins is a very talented author.  I'll be watching for her next book.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|This is an amazingly great fun show.  I don't know what they were thinking when they put on the cover to the DVD set.  Please ignore the crappy cover.  The show is a must own!!!  And the special effects.... Very sweet.
B004EPYZP8|1.0|How could it be possible that while the accused Louis Roulet is testifying, answering his lawyer, could speak straight to the jury, crying and making the statement of his innocence(while crying), and there's no objection by the disctric attorney or interruption from the judge himself?, big flaw in the movie screenplay. Behaviors that are not allowed during a trial are seen in here.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A fun app that allows a variety of entertaining games! From puzzles to classics, this app offers the opportunity to be amused for hours
B006ON41FC|4.0|Cool game its really fun and what is wrong with openfient? however, I think that quests should not involve items
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is definitely the best free alarm in the app store! I have it on my kindle and it does NOT drain my battery! If u have trouble getting up in the morning, this app is for you!
B006ON41FC|5.0|awesome this is a thrilling game that takes skill it is very fun and addictive you collect nuts to eaten points to by cool gear and costumes I suggest u download dis game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i totally love this game! or should i say games?!?! this is one of  the best games of the season!!!!!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|It is an awesome game that I think a lot of fun and will make a lot of money and great reviews!!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|My favorite game ever until it started glitching and I had to shut down the whole Kindle just to leave that game
B0063IH60K|5.0|when you need to just relax for a bit, solitaire is just the game to play. graphics are great. easy to manuever too.
B004SDEP38|3.0|this app is amaaaazzzzziiiinggggggg but not woonnderrrfullll I love it and it is very helpful. its is very simple and is great for kids and adults
0385344228|3.0|Found this book to be just o.k.  The premise of the story (already rehashed in other reviews) is compelling and I was looking forward to a great read.  The first half of the book was mostly good and the story moved along at a decent pace, although at times the writing was condescending and amateurish (surprised as this doesn't usually bother me).  The trial scenes dragged and became dull.  The final chapters would have been fascinating on so many levels but these chapters were short and lacking in depth.  Disappointed!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I felt like City of Bones was an overall interesting start to a good series. The characters are a little flat in my opinion but start to pick up by the end of the book.  The shocking ending gives the book much needed depth and creates quite the controversy.  I wasn't really a fan of the Simon/Clary/Jace traingle but that is probably because I am not really a fan of love triangles (other than the Inferno Devices).  I would recommend this book but suggest that you read Cassandra Clare's Inferno Devices (Clockwork Angel, Clockwork Prince) first because they are the superior novels.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love it!  so much fun and worth the cheap price. challenge and addicting really recomond getting tip...don't hit the trees or get the bad nuts
B006ON41FC|4.0|there is an opt didn't, so don't listen to the other reviews,and everything is to expensive and that made it lose a star but other than that its a fun little game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Most of these games are fun. However, the instructions are rather vague so you pretty much learn how to play by trial and error. I have already unlocked two games, and based on other reviews I have no plans to upload any upgrades.  The games are simple little time wasters, not exactly brain busters.
B006UG909U|4.0|I must confess that I was not very optimistic about Van Halen's new album...But when I loaded it into my CD player, I realized the guys are back ! Words just can't tell how good it is...Wolf is doing a good job on the bass, but I miss Mike's backing vocals.  I've been a Van Halen fan since I was a kid back in 1986. At that time, Sammy had already joined the band and, by the way, I always liked the second line-up as much as I love the first one. But listening to Van Halen's new recording with DLR leading the vocals is definitely something special. It is like going back in time to live what certainly was a great moment in rock history.  About the tracks....The ones I liked the most are: \\"She's the woman\\", \\"You and your blues\\", \\"As Is\\", \\"Big river\\" and \\"Beats workin'\\". \\"She's the woman\\", \\"Big river\\" and \\"Beats workin'\\" are excellent new versions of old material from the 1970's.
159562015X|4.0|Another book I bought for my husband..... He used this book for retiring planning purposes in order to focus on a good balance of work and hobbies. Easy to read, the web based questionnaire is easy to follow and he got some good ideas! Highly recommended!  He very much appreciated that an earlier reviewer commented on the fact that if you want to do the web questionnaire you need to use the password that comes in a new book, a used password won't work! So.... maybe good value for money to buy a new book instead of a used one, no matter how cheap a used one maybe (and they are quite cheaper....).
B006ON41FC|5.0|my seven year old and I have been glued to this game.  the only issue is starting from the beginning everytime, it gets a little repetitive.  the store is fun though...
B0068RHSCW|5.0|This not a horror movie although the previews give that impression. It is more a psychological thriller with a couple of twists. No complaints here, if you like movies that keep you figuring out the plot, then you like this one.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is awsome and fun. i love. it u wool love the 3d graphes cool awesome sweet i have it on my kindle fire it is so cool

B001EC3JME|4.0|good universal holster; i bought this for a small LED flashlight.  it is rather tight, but after a few days of \\"breaking in\\", it holds well.  i can see how useful this holster would be for other tools.  i find it easier to remove my belt than to use the clip.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great I like to use it at home. but I wish I did not have to have Internet to use it.
B0078JRFZE|5.0|I am an extreme period piece viewer and can spend hours after hours living in these long past times and Downton Abbey is no exception! The costumes, acting and plot just keep getting better and better. I can't wait until the next episode and hope this series goes on forever. Thank you British period drama for continuing to create masterpieces.
B00319ECGK|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made.  They should have stopped at this one in my opinion but oh well...I didn't buy the other two movies.<br /><br />The Matrix is as amazing movie that if you have never watched it, it will tickle your brain.
B006ON41FC|5.0|once you get the &quot;hang&quot; of flying this game is totally addictive. its way better if you try to complete the goals.
B006ZEDZNY|3.0|Although I absolutely love Depp, and Hunter...I found this movie to be rather trite, a little dry and boring. Depp cannot actually portray Hunter in this as he did in Fear and Loathing which I loved, altho this is a story by Hunter. All I could see was an older and not so hot Depp, portraying another, barely, interesting character who loves( ha ha ) the wrong woman, gets in over his head,,,OH I cannot go on, I am dozing. Go here if you are easily entertained.
0439023513|5.0|I loved this book. I thought the author did a wonderful job of following through.  I don't feel the message of war is bad is her only message as stated in some reviews.  I do think this is what happens when you have oppression and uprisings.  I loved her completion even ifit made me depressed after finishing this book.  However, she captured PTSD perfectly.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I've been a fan of the books for a few years before the HBO show was even mentioned. I normally get into a series because it is being adapted for either film or television.<br /><br />As to the show itself: FAN-F-EN-TASTIC!<br /><br />The show is a great adaptation of the first book, there is very little changed in the overall story, what was changed was the inclusion of moments that although were not in the book themselves, were written as a what-if they met and talked. The best of them were the one with Robert Baratheon the King of Westeros with his wife the Queen Cersei Lannister.<br /><br />The character dynamics were fantastic, the casting and the set designs. The clothes and the props. Everything was superb in production design.<br /><br />It even made me like the moments with Sansa a little bit and I never liked her character in the book, and since I already know what is in store for her in Season 2 and on-ward, lets just say things get worse for her.<br /><br />My favorite (sorry for jumping around, I just really like this show and the books) character/casting of all were Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister and Sean Bean as Ned Stark. Those two made this show in my mind especially Peter Dinklage. If you haven't seen the show, watch the bit when he is on trial at the Eyrie \\"confessing\\" his crimes. Pretty much any scene he is in is wonderful and a joy to watch.<br /><br />So if anyone has not read the books or have not seen it on HBO, buy this DVD set or Blue-Ray, can't go wrong with either. Although from what I usually see with Blue-Ray they throw in a few extra Extras, plus a giant Map of Westeros and the Free Cities (locations of the show/books).<br /><br />Overall, great show, great everything. Throw in the fact it comes out the beginning of the month and my Birthday is towards the end it makes figuring out what to get myself all that much easier.
0439023521|5.0|This is one of those stories that you do not want to stop reading.  Everybody is reading this one and so should you!
B006ON41FC|5.0|its addictive. and when I got it the app was free. win win. I would recommend if you need to do something to pass the time.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is my fav game on my kindle! I don't know what u people r saying about openfient because it doesn't show up on there.
1452101248|4.0|Some of these recipes might be intimidating for new cooks because they have a lot of ingredients but they really are not difficult to make.  This is a good book if you are cooking for those who do not eat meat as many are main dish recipes, or, if you are trying to eat less meat in general.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I like the game...my wife doesn't. I find myself spending more time playing it than I mean to. I'll jump on to reach a goal or two real, only to end up spending over an hour playing it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|good game. and loads of fun. would be nice if there was a save option.  in the snow area, watching the owl gets a bit tricky .

0307593312|1.0|Taking the time to read something that you discover at the end was a waste of time is frustrating.  How much more frustrating the same realization is at the end of this ponderous slab of nonsense.  And yet I can't simply describe this extended ramble as nonsense.  It's worse than that.  A person can't forge ahead through 900 pages of pure nonsense.  The reader here gets the sense of groundwork being laid for an eventual resolution and even finds entertainment in the sights along the journey toward something or other.  In the end you arrive nowhere.  In 900 pages there's a lot of room to introduce numerous elements and characters that raise questions about their relationships and purposes and to create surprising and entertaining ways of resolving these.  There's no need with all that space to get in a hurry and the author is not in the least hasty with any subject.  The problem is that time after time these questions are just left hanging.  Characters are developed, situations are set up, even major background elements that shape nothing less than the entire world are described and then, at the end of it all, that's all you've got.  Set ups, background and loose ends.  This unsatisfactory treatment is applied across the whole range of themes and characters from trivial to primary.  In dozens of cases throughout this novel you'll wonder how this or that will turn out but the author will just leave you wondering.  Astonishingly, this includes the major theme of the book.  In the end this book has nothing more than the suggestion of a theme.  There's something to be said for the view that the journey is the destination.  If you take this view to the furthest extent you might find something worthwhile in this novel.  No wonder the author is never in a hurry.  He's never really going anywhere.  Even if a journey needs no destination to be worthwhile I've seen it done much better.  Certainly 900 pages of bloviation is excessive if that's the point.  I will qualify my uniformly negative reaction only by revealing that I listened to the audiobook version and the narrators were quite good.  Top notch, in fact.  It's not their responsibility to provide what the author left out.  They did a terrific job.  The translators may have done as well for all I know.  No one without access to the original language can say anything meaningful about the success of a translation.  Maybe in the original Japanese this stuff holds together better than in English but I can't see how.  Don't even pick this thing up without first letting go of the notion that you are entering a differently constructed world with its own internally consistent logic around which a dramatic narrative is constructed and resolved.  It just goes round and round for some time and then stops.  You'll be left wondering what the point was.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Very addicting. cant get enough wow wow wow a a a a a a a is is is is is
0525478817|5.0|I couldn't wait to read another John Green book and was glad I got this one by preordering it! High school kids love John Green and old people, like me, do, too.  This one is a poignant account of teens with cancer....close to home to so many. I found myself crying, and I laughed aloud at so many parts that describe teens in high school.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is so awesome and fun.  I am so addicted to it.  I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone any day!!!!!!!
1423140591|5.0|As always Riordan has written another good book. Keeps my interest and keeps the interest of the middle school and young adult kids.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|With different games all different people can enjoy. I recommend this game to all my friends and they too love it.
B0073U2FB2|4.0|In this movie, four young Americans (including Emile Hirsch, from Speed Racer, and Max Minghella, from Art School Confidential, among others) get stranded in Moscow when an alien invasion (represented initially, intriguingly, as a lethal form of electromagnetic waves) attack Moscow, leaving almost everyone dead. Our friends hide in a sort of basement, and when a few days later, they emerge from inside, they find wholesale destruction, and the news that the aliens have attack planet wide, but also intriguing hints that there maybe other survivors. And soon enough, they find that some Russians have banded together to resist the invaders.  Produced by Kazakh filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov (from the interesting Nightwatch franchise) this movie is nothing special but is surely an entertaining outing. Among the plus: the survivors escaping from the aliens in a desolate Moscow, including empty landmarks like The Kremlin and Moscow State University. Among the minus: some of the special effects are really cheesy.
B00005B4ND|1.0|When I got the movie I was unable to play it on the dvd.  It was broken so it was unless to me.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Huff is a top notch news source.  The app itself is easy to use has several categoties and works great on the Kindle Fire.  Give it a spin.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This was a great app when originally installed 3 months ago on my Fire ... then the crashing started.  Since the update today it's back to being an excellent weather app. Radar is great.
B000PUB9I2|5.0|I discovered Francis Cabral's music in 1994, through a friend who had heard him on a trip to France, and wanted me to translate the songs.  I remember being thunderstruck by the poetry of his lyrics. His songs have the ability to transport me; it's like a mini-vacation to listen to this music. This two disc set has enough of his songs to satisfy. I gave the set to my sister-in-law from Quebec, and she loved it also.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Although it is not a complicated game, it does not need to be. This game supplies fun and challenge in an easy to play package. I seen no reason to give less then a 5.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|works great on kindle fire. plus the Bible is a great thing to have period. recommend to anyone and everyone
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|This movie quickly was added to my best movies ever list. Actor and Actresses were just Oscar worthy with their acting. The plot is dramatically suspenseful. I give two thumbs up!!
B0008ENIAC|5.0|From start to finish this movie is what classic hollywood is all about a great story,a great plot,and a great cast.This movie was joan crawford at her Academy award winning very best,just an all around great movie if you are a collector(which i am)you have to have this one for your collection folks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always loved playing solitaire, this ranks pretty high on my fun games to play list.... I would totally recommend this game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is full of twist and turns its very fun and always brings something new. I love this game very much
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Coould play it all day. I dont know why people are giving this 1 star the games are so easy.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I personally think that the app is great. It is easy and fun. I don't understand why people totally dis an app because of just one thing. I am willing to over look a few things because it is such a nice app. my kids and I all enjoy this app. so glad it was the free app of the day.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun game.....it was free but I would have paid for it. The continuing goals keep it interesting. Cute graphics and simple controls.
B006ON41FC|4.0|It's pretty fun but one thing I don't like is that its the same level all the time just with different goals, I just don't get that. But all in all it is pretty addicting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is amazing. only bad thing is that you might get mad at one of the game.
B000QGAU4E|1.0|I hated this movie.<br /><br />It was well-received by critics, though, so I watched it twice to confirm my belief that it was bad.  I still think it's bad.<br /><br />Main problem was that they had two sci-fi premises that didn't belong in the same movie.  There was the idea that there hasn't been a baby born in 18 years:  a serviceable idea.  Then there was the idea of a police state based on evicting immigrants:  another quite viable idea.<br /><br />But what these ideas were doing in the same movie was beyond me.  Either of them could have carried the movie, but shoehorning them together didn't work well.
B006ON41FC|3.0|I had a great time playing this game. Fun and addictive n great time for my fire.  It is a great find for the free app of the day.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|great puzzles. not too easy, not too hard...and just the right length. grisly manor was also good, but entirely too short. this was perfect. give me more, fire maple!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is truly wonderful for the money. I use my Kindle Fire everyday, and this case has held up EXTREMELY well. Highly recommend if you want to protect your Kindle Fire. 5 stars!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is very cool I love the games on 121 games it is the best game ever ever ever ever ever
B006ON41FC|4.0|I liked this app. Control is easy and smooth. I enjoy trying to reach the goals set for you. It is very fun
B004U7MQXS|5.0|I don't know why there are so many complaints about this DVD.  The quality is good.  The sound is good.  The people who complain must be expecting perfection, like it was made today, not in the 60s.  Order it and sit back and remember your youth.
B005C9YZIW|4.0|This six blu-ray disc set is quite incredible in it's entirety. Picture quality is often spectacular in spite of the fact that it's 1080i and not 1080p HD. The narration is excellent and the content is highly informative, incredible and these discs can make you feel like a kid again. What I mean by the last part of that last sentence is that while watching some of the episodes on these discs, you (or at least I) get that same sense of wonderment, near disbelief and true amazement that only seems to exist when you're a kid seeing things for the first time. The one flaw with this set and the reason I only gave it four stars instead of five is that the DTS-HD HI RES audio track on each of the discs has an audible hiccup throughout the entire program. Every few minutes or so, between five and ten give or take, the audio will cut out for a split second then go back to normal. It occurs on each of the six discs to some degree or another and can be a little distracting. I know it's a flaw on the Planet Earth discs in particular because no other blu-ray discs that I have played before or since has behave that way. But for that one downside this is a great blu-ray/HD set and well worth the asking price in my opinion.
B005K17RU0|1.0|it works for me on the fire but it just keeps a little1 up at the top bus the settings and it bothers me
B006ZLT7Y8|4.0|Given the confusion apparent in many reviews regarding the blank pages, and discussion regarding quality of printing, perhaps a second printing is in the offing, thus explaining why a valuable addition to the collective photographic trove of the world is out of print, mere months after arriving to much fanfare. Perhaps the editor Mr John Maloof can help here, as the asking prices for used copies are already outrageous! I am puzzled by complaints of poor quality printing, as the reproduction appears perfectly adequate to my (experienced) eye, and as for the \\"missing\\" images i.e. the blank pages.....asked and answered in a number of the comments. Very fine photographs, and I would enjoy seeing another monograph, blank pages and all!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game engages the brain in a different way than most, which is why I find it restful. The simplicity is what makes it pleasant to unwind with.
B006ON41FC|4.0|its a very random game a bit addictive and has a weired looking squrril  that is the end of this reveiw
B0054JZC6E|5.0|super fun!!!!!!!!!! :) so much fun Woot woof love it cool awesome fun love it fun super fun cool awesome love.it so much best app ever
B006ON41FC|5.0|you shud play this game its dope for realz it is addicting I'm on it 24/7 man hook me up with going nutz2 definetly getting that. Yea buddy!
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is awesome! I'm so glad I bought it. well, technically it was free but yeah... its still awesome
B004L0NGEC|1.0|No instruction, help, e-mail, nothing.... no way to get started after paying for this app. The free ones offer tutorials. Expected more.
0307276902|5.0|Sham or not.... this book is good. Rarely do i read anything more than once. I've read this 3 times. It's a great story and very enjoyable. So what if parts of it are exaggerated? You should be able to identify plot holes and still grasp the foundation of what this man is going through. Highly recommend.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|This is just preview rather than a full movie, amazon should clearly say it or put it in a different section, this is a big disappointment.
B001HN6918|1.0|Unimpressive, non-whimsical, and tasteless are the best words to describe this film's overall appeal to kids and even less entertaining for adults. Voice acting is cue-card four inches away quality here and general presentation is less than imaginary sliding towards a snooze-fest. NOT RECOMMENDED TO ENTERTAIN EVEN A BRAIN-DEAD EGG OMELET.
B006ON41FC|1.0|would have tried this one..but not with open feint auto enabled. if you don't know this open feint keeps an open connection to your device...not good!  take this out and looks ok...but there are other time wasters to get without this.
B006P0FIGU|1.0|Let me just say that I did not enjoy the purchase of a movie ticket for The Three Musketeers. I found the Cinematography, lighting and acting to have major flaws from all incoming angles and was thoroughly disappointed. I was hoping for an action movie that wasn't cheesy. Quality is this movie's shortcoming and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE AT ALL!!! Chocolate bars are much more satisfying even though I would like one with vanilla and strawberry flavouring as well as chocolate.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is really fun and easy to play which I like also!!!!!!! I think anyone over the age of maybe 4 could play it and I sometimes start yelling because I'm having so much fun I would definetly recommend it!!!!! I have itvon my kindle fire and it works great!!!
B003Y5H5AG|1.0|Toy Story had a magical feeling that just can't be matched anymore and we meet the next underwhelming exhibit, 4,845,621,593. I was expecting a good-hardy warm Gargamel chase frenzy from the cartoon, but instead, we were delivered a sappy, drooling flick reminiscent of what is comparable to a Scary-movie-Garfiled hybrid subtracting the icing from the cake. Let's play with matches and coins-boredom tears may be invoked into the cries of children all about the land and your admissionary fee will be irredeemable. Take you pick, stick to the cartoon for barrels of fun, or watch this hastily written cinematic-log. NOT AN ENJOYABLE FILM.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I had barely heard of a visual novel when I got this game. I started it up and text described the scene while screenshots at the top gave context to the text. But, the text at the bottom screen didn't just describe what the place looked like, it described the main character's thoughts, his actions and his questions.  It was an interactive novel. You made the decisions for the character, but there was a story for you to read and follow. It reminded me a lot of a \\"make your own adventure book,\\" and I just a few moments after I realized that, a puzzle started. I had to find tools in my surroundings to get out of a locked room by using clues, combining items and solving tiny puzzles. It was only after I completed the puzzle and got out of the room that I realized that it reminded me of games like Myst or Crystal Key, long, complicated, intricate puzzle games.  This is an amazing type of game, and the characters were unique and diverse with their own pasts and motivations, including the main character. The game has multiple endings, and it's impossible to hit ever puzzle the first time through. Taking different puzzles reveals completely different information each time, and it's only by solving them all that you're able to see all the information and the whole story. I loved how the characters acted differently depending on what information had been revealed (For instance, if you enter puzzles with \\"Santa,\\" he befriends Junpei and sides with him, but if you don't enter a puzzle, then \\"Santa\\" almost ignores him.)  I recommend this game to anyone that likes puzzles and games with a thick storyline. Sometimes the storyline doesn't make a lot of sense, but all of it's other points completely make up for it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I had this on my phone and loved it.  I just found it for the Kindle Fire.  It looks and plays great on this 7 inch screen.  On of the best ever and add that it's free.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the best game ever played in history of games and also very cool and awesome and very fun to play

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game and this comment gets me 250,000 points to earn more games so this was definitely my goal for writing this
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Picked this up after seeing it listed in IGN's top 10 android games of all time (number 4). Was suprised to see just two reviews for it prior to mine on Amazon here, but figured maybe it just made the app store. I have it installed on the Kindle Fire. Visually it looks good. There are a lot of achievements and a good course selection. The power up balls make it very interesting. As far as the basic gameplay, it is simple to pick up. I was playing it with-in minutes and although they provide practice holes, it was easy to go straight to the course. It is one of those simple physics games where your aim and control of the powermeter is important. The ball will then fly in the air as directed and will further interact with your enviroment once it lands. The first course starts simply and you can easily get a hole in one once you figure out the mechanics. The difficulty slowly ramps up from there, sucking you into the game play. Courses will temp you to take extreme short cuts (high risks)or play it safe. The powerballs really make a difference and since you are only allowed a set number per course, overall strategy comes into play. Lots of choices and for its low price is an outstanding and addictive game.
B005T87QCI|2.0|really boring,i cant think why they didnt try harder. im not joking, its kind sad why they wouldnt try harder, more levels more classes or something
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a really good game and luv it is also complicated. luv luv luv luv luv luv luv luv

B005Y423ZC|5.0|If you are a fan of Adele this is a must to add to your Adele collection. She is so real and down to earth and somehow makes you feel like you are there and having a conversation with a girlfriend. Of course it does not beat being able to actually be there, but this is the next best thing. I have been playing this dvd over and over for weeks and it has a cd with the live recording of this concert as well. Great buy!
B006ON41FC|3.0|i enjoy this game h h h HHH. bb bb bb h. b b b b b b.  b b

B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game for free!  I would even pay a dollar for it. very cool graphics and gameplay. Try it out!
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is sooooooooooo much fun and is soooooooooo adicting but when I press a button I have to hit it two or three times and its slow getting to the game.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|When I ordered one of these I was afraid that I was getting in over my head. How in the world does a USB plug-in thingee improve wi-fi reception? Would I have to go in and do this and do that to the computer so that the original wifi setup and the new one do not conflict? I had visions of receiving a thick booklet of \\"How To Select Routing Codes\\" or some such imaginary nightmare technical setup.  REALITY.  The package came, everything fit together simply, no guesswork. I plugged it into the computer then slipped the mini CD-ROM disc into the player, and it proceeded to start and configure all by its lonesone. Awsome!  The installation complete, I clicked on the screen icon and presto, not two signals appeared, but seven. I chose one and it came in borderline weak (marginal) but it wasn't even there before. Other signals improved from POOR to FAIR.  Dang near plug and play
B006ON41FC|5.0|I like this game a lot! its really fun to play......and I think that anyone would really like this game. If you don't believe me then try it for yourself and you will see what I mean when I say that it is fun and very well done(:
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Husband really loved this game. WIsh they had many more like it. He could not wait to come back and solve the riddles
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|Midnight In Paris gains effectiveness by portraying the inner fantasies everyone has and putting boyish imagination to real life. The movie is really a dream where the main protagonist actually achieves his most desired fantasy of going back to the salon era in 1920's Paris. Typical of fantasy movies Gil is driven back in time by the fact he is in an unfulfilling relationship with predictable people surrounding him who can't possibly imagine what he aspires to. Because Gil is beset with such mediocrity in such an unjust way the gods of fate look down on him with pity and reward him by making him a welcome guest in a 20's Paris cultural and literary dream. Without spoiling the story Gil is confronted with a difficult choice between his new dream world and the present.  The movie is once again pure cinematic genius from Woody Allen. As usual, Woody's personality is so strong that he vibrates or radiates into the movie just by directing it. The actors are just an extension of Woody. It becomes obvious that Gil is just standing-in for Woody, so it's too bad Woody couldn't have been 40 again and played the role himself. There's artwork and nuance in how the movie subtly blends humor, intellect, common problems in personal relationships, the essence of Paris, and magical fantasy seamlessly. With Woody directing, the film almost becomes a canvas of sorts in itself of equal artistic texture upon which the movie is painted. If Woody specializes in capturing the zeitgeist of cities this time it's Paris' turn. Midnight gains warmth by having famous 1920's Paris figures cameo in a Woody Allen movie. Gil gets to walk with his gods and literary muses as their guest for a rare moment in time. I guess the lesson of the movie is that Gil will always have Paris, no matter what era.  Although Woody is hated throughout the world they say they love him in New York...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Everything with the game is great I use it to waste time and its 101 FREE games to me that seems like a good deal!
B005ORVN1Y|2.0|The DVD-A and CD formats are dead (for at least this type of release anyway). These Sector 1, 2 and 3 releases are just not worth it. Taking sources of 192k 24 bit and then dumping them back down to 44.1k 16 bit leaves a better than original master but why? It will still never be as good as a 24 bit 192k release. And these masters are subjective to the original masters that were destined for vinyl to begin with. The 5.1 mixes are a complete train wreck. They sound plainly and lazily mixed with many effects such as reverb that were in the original mix absent or altered for the worst. Tempo changes performed in the original mastering process are missing all over the place in Signals (lay the stereo mix on top of the 6 channel mix for Countdown or Digital Man in an editing machine and you will see what I mean). The alternate takes are great as a sideline only. We need Terry Brown back in the fold (with his ideals that made these albums what they were in the first place) for a real mixdown to 7.1 24 bit 96kHz LPCM on Blu-ray with the 24 bit 192kHz stereo tracks as a secondary audio selection (which are superior to the prior remasters so far). For instance, check out the 5.1 of Cygnus X-1 Book 1 (A Farewell to Kings) at 00:03:14.389 (beat 4 of the 7/4 measure), there is a splice revealed by a crash cymbal from either another take or simply just an editing goof while spreading out the signals in the surround fields. There are other issues revealed in this same manner. As a novelty these 5.1 mixes are OK I suppose but thats where it ends - NOVELTY.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|The simplest way to tell you what I thought of it is to assure you that I'll be reading the sequel. I will be reading it, come hell or high water. The end left me hanging, as the first of a trilogy ought.  I also like love stories. I would like to think I am more academic than that, but the truth is that a good love story is, in my opinion, the best of all stories. The trouble is that they're so rare. Good ones, I mean. Delirium is a novel unabashedly about love, and the absence of love, and the consequences of that absence, and what it looks like to find love in a setting otherwise literally devoid of it. And not just romantic love, but the love of a mother for her daughter, the love between sisters and friends... all of it.  Lena is a girl who has waited eagerly for the procedure for years, the procedure everyone gets at the age of eighteen that will take away her ability to feel love. She has been looking forward to this because the absence of love will also mean the absence of fear and the absence of pain. She has been looking forward to this because the one thing she wants more than anything is to finally be just like everyone else.  What she does not expect is that love will find her before her eighteenth birthday. That she might meet the one person who can show her how ugly, bereft, and oppressive the world she lives in truly is. When she does meet him, the walls she's built around her heart are quickly pulled down, and the question of losing her love for the sake of fitting in becomes absurd. The consequences, however, will mean the end of all she's known. She is willing to take the risk, because she loves. But she may not survive.*  Some of the wonderful things about this book: Lauren Oliver has taken a rather extreme plot line and turned it into something plausible, readable, and natural. Nothing about Lena's world seems unlikely. Every outlandish element of this loveless society has its root in something familiar - whether it be our natural fears, our mobbish tendencies, or our insecurities. And the characters are believable, too. Nothing is unreal. It's also a storyline I would have liked to have written, which is to say that it's a world I would like to sit in longer, and these are characters I want to know better.  Having said that, I did not at first like Lena much. I did not buy her eagerness for the procedure - and not because the procedure seems so obviously horrible to anyone outside the system. It didn't seem believable because of her character and her history. Oddly enough, as she gradually changed her mind about the procedure, gradually came to realize that the society she had so long supported with all her heart and mind was at its roots corrupt and dehumanizing, I started to believe where she'd come from.  In the same on-the-fence sort of way, I loved Lauren Oliver's writing, her very human descriptions, the way she never hesitated to sit in a single, precious observation for as long as it was necessary. I also found myself skimming almost full pages of description that were just a bit more florid or tangential than the present moment of the story called for. In other words, it was occasionally a bit wordy.  But it was also beautiful, and personable, and fearful all at the same time. I have high hopes for the next book. And I hope very much that the third will follow fast behind.  *Of course she will survive. Who are we kidding.

B003X5UFWW|4.0|This is a moving tale of a man who's fighting style will stand the till the end of time. In a world where honor is not given it's earned, this Ip Man displays this with humility and love for his family and fellow man. THE FIGHTING IS EPIC, AND YOU WOULD BE A FOOL NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE. It is dubbed which I dislike that's why I didn't give it 5*, however I always take a movie for what it is not what it isn't.  I WILL WATCH THIS AGAIN. (oh i almost cried, you'll know the part when you see it)
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I enjoyed the game, wish it took longer to play like Myst and Riven. great concept as well. Will try others.
B005WY8YZW|1.0|Oh, go ahead, buy Conditions of My Parole, it's frickin awesome. But at least BUY THE ORIGINAL. It's a dissappointment at the end of the day knowing its not the real thing.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've had this bag for a year and a half and it's still in amazingly solid shape.  I travel frequently and always bring my camera and equipment and haven't had any issues with it.  I love the side straps to carry my tripod, and all the additional outside pockets to easily grab extra memory cards or batteries.  I just bought my mom the same bag because I'm so pleased with it!
0061673730|1.0|I knew nothing about the author or the book when I first bought it, it just looked good. I got about half-way through and wondered why I wasted my time reading this. Some might think the author is really clever because he seems to talk about really complex stuff and attempts to dumb it down for everyone else. However, he covers too much material and it's all wrapped up in a quasi-fictional story that frankly is quite boring. If you're looking for a bonding experience about a man and his son, while they address philosophical concepts and everything, I'm sure there's other fiction authors who do a much better job and are known for their great works. Go to any used book stores and you'll see heaps of these books collecting dust; I say just chuck it in the trash where it belongs.
B006ON41FC|5.0|going nuts is awesome, u go nuts. I love this game, u fly around gathering nuts, and yes I did say fly ur a flying squirrel. while flying and getting nuts u avoid trees, and owls, tons of stuff. this game is awesome
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just plane fun. Not much more to say, something to do sitting in the hospital while the wife sleeps. great!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I was sorry to see this game end. Great graphics and challenging puzzles made me wish for more. Really glad the developers included a map for navigation. Loved the game and will look for more from Fire Maple.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this is a fun, time wasting, enjoyable app. you are this wierd squirrel thingy that flies. could be better. i love it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|it was good, but it froze, and also, it makes you turn too much overall though, it was a great game
B006ON41FC|5.0|What's up with these reviews. This game is AWESOME!!!!! I mean ur a little squirell flying around collecting nuts. Awesome
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I read so many reviews about this case and in the end decided I would purchase it. I love it. Not only is it a nice protection for my Fire, it is very stylish and well manufactured. One of the concerns I read several consumers mention was that the case doesn't close completely. But I'll say that after a little bit of use, the cover closes just fine. I wouldn't trade this case for any other that I've seen.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very true version of the classic card game.  Of course, you can take this one with you anywhere you go. Good graphics.
B005FOQDC0|5.0|This is a great Lego kit, lots of parts, many power functions parts so when you're done building this, you can use the parts for lots of your own creations.  However, as MANY others have said, DO NOT pay the overpriced Amazon.com prices.  Just picked up one for $199.00 DIRECT FROM LEGO with reasonable priority shipping cost.  $269 for \\"Prime\\" members pricing!?  Come on Amazon, we joined Prime for better deals, not to be taken advantage of!  Word of advice:  Amazon used to be the go-to place for the best deals, especially of you were an Amazon Prime member, but now you really need to shop around, you will likely find better deals somewhere else.
B0071QIN00|4.0|its cool but u can crash and land on ur back and not actually fail. ur on ur back, so tilt the device to get back on wheels? I don't think so
B005K17RU0|1.0|Worked great from November 15 til Feb 17. Now crashes, forces close, and will not reinstall without wiping memory cache first. Once newly installed will not fine my location, can't remove location, or reset home location. Too bad. Great while it lasted, TRASH now! DO NOT DOWNLOAD TO KINDLE FIRE, INCOMPATIBLE--AND DEVELOPERS UNWILLING TO FIX PER KINDLE FIRE APP SULPORT.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Pretty fun distance game. Would be nice if the items in the shop weren't so expensive. Other then that good game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well it looks good and plays well but I gets old fast so next time make it more addicting but overall de ent
B004O3YGMC|2.0|I can use it fine on an ipad 2 bit it closes every time I try log in on my Droid.  This is on wifi home network.  Waste after a bucks.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this app! it is amazing and so addicting! be sure to play it a lot. Radios amigos buenos.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great app! only this wrong with the app is one they have the squirrels tail all wrong and two there is not enough things to buy. But after all its a really great app. I give five stars
B006ON41FC|5.0|going nuts is an awesome squirly game that someone of any age can enjoy. if ur looking for a fun energetic way to pass time this is the app for u.
1401937519|5.0|An amazing book.  I can't remember the last time I read something that caused me to pause and take notes.  And the writing style makes for easy reading.  Uplifting, informative, joyous.  If you're \\"stuck\\" in a life, maybe this book can help you, because it's about living, not dying.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is super fun and i play it all the time-very addictive. you should buy this game you have to glide your squirrell through the forest and collect nuts and buy out fits and complete objectives
B006ON41FC|4.0|its a fun game where you would just avoid thing and collect nuts aka coins. its not the funest game in the world but it sure gets your mind of things and is a great time killer.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|From the beginning it had me. I have read the books more than once and this movie was perfect. And to another reviewer she wasn't glitz and glam at her wedding because the next movie that's what she has to be prefect all the time and gorgeous. They did the simple pretty wedding thing. Plus if anyone remembers she didn't want this big a** wedding in the first place this was for Alice and you and me of course. Those shoes were to die for. There is nothing like the exerts of Jacob that they put in, Taylor Lautner and the facial hair. Can we swoon now ?!?!?! lol. The anticipation of the sex scene was great. His reaction was perfect to the book. She didn't even realize that she was marked up like she was. I was there with her in dreamland and he had to come and f it all up. The anticipation of the next time they would have sex and the activities he had her doing was funny as hell. It was a great movie and I am so ready for the last installment.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Not very challenging if you work out already. Not a bad video,  though. Would be great for a beginner! My moms gonna get it
B005LAIGW8|2.0|There's a moment in \\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" where the title character is urinating a giant stream of fire, and then turns and seemingly winks right at the camera.  It's definitely an amusing moment, but it also neatly summarizes everything about this film: Though it has a dark subject matter, it's best when being goofy, and is, regrettably, not very good at everything else.  Taking place several years after the first film, \\"Vengeance\\" finds Johnny Blaze, AKA the Ghost Rider, riding around Europe, trying to keep the demonic spirit within him from breaking out and running amok.  Yet, when he hears that the devil himself is after a child, Blaze reluctantly takes on the task of rescuing the boy, because not only can he save the world (again), but he also has the possibility of freeing himself from his curse forever.  Despite being a sequel to 2007's, \\"Ghost Rider,\\" \\"Vengeance\\" barely feels like one.  Granted, Nicholas Cage is back, and he still turns into a flaming skeleton from time to time, but the movie has little to no connections with what came before, and feels like a music video hastily upgraded to be a feature film: the camerawork is fast and loose, with lots of miniscule zooms, the story feels barely there (who exactly made this much-talked about prophecy anyway?), and there are lots of inconsistency with it's predecessor: why is Blaze's motorcycle/outfit really different?  Why does the flashback to his contract-signing look nothing like the first film?  Why does the rider act so differently then the first time around, etc.  More often then not, \\"Vengeance\\" seems to be mainly focused on getting cool shots on frame, and while that can work, there's no strong backbone to guide it.  Granted, the first Ghost Rider film wasn't grade A superhero material, but it had a strong focus on Blaze's efforts to deal with his curse and trying to remove it.  Here, he just zips around makes people explode into fiery embers.  Still, \\"Vengeance\\" does feature some good moments.  Nicholas Cage turns in another amusing, over-the-top performance, complete with unintentionally hilarious facial expressions as he morphs between Blaze and the Rider (so much so that my theater was laughing every time he did it), and a really amusing scene involving a twinkie.  The final car chase does manage to be quite interesting, and I also liked how the film explored a little as to exactly what the Ghost Rider spirit is.  But while \\"Vengeance\\" does feature some amusing/cool moments of over the top craziness and action, for the most part, with it's looser and sloppy feel, and more focus on set-pieces then a focused story, it's a disappointing follow up to it's predecessor, and is ultimately not really recommended.  For die-hard Ghost Rider fans only.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really like playing this game,You get to find hidden treasure too. The music is relaxing.  It's worth the money
B004FRX0MY|3.0|While the updates have been slow and I do feel the app is WAY to heavy, it is somewhat better. I still spend time clicking the same song 10 times while shopping trying to review it only to have the song 5 tracks down start playing. As a loyal customer to Amazon I do want them to have great apps to support the music I buy from them. However this app in the past few months has cut my music shopping/exploring time in half. Simply put, this app is not up to Amazon standards IMO.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Was it really necessary to ruin the whole game just to show the same dumb promo every single time you open it? It's coming. Great. We get it. But if I can't play the old one, I sure ain't playing your new one! Tried to alert them on FB and all they do is delete any negative posts!
B002CSC5EC|3.0|buying this on blu ray was expecting something wonderful,but what i got was a gloried dvd.having bought the deluxe dvd box set,which i must say is great,was expecting probly too much,but with all the hoopla on blu ray one must think is it worth it getting it on a new format and though the product is well over 40 years old would expect some wonders.sad to say this is not the case with blu ray.i want my soxes to be blown off and circling the earth.this is not the case  if you want woodstock get the dvd.  the only good thing about blu ray is saving yourself from getting up and changing the discs.so now my favourite piece if history, i have it on all formats.  peace and love  farout man
0765356147|4.0|The Mistborn Trilogy makes complete sense.  Sanderson never changes the rules that he started out with in the first book which is very refreshing.  This is a book of answers, rarely have I read a book with so much answers explaining and tying loose ends.  When you finish the book, You really felt like Sanderson really knew where he was going with this story from book one chapter 1.<br /><br />This book has everything that the first two books had in it, humor, twist and turns, and a lot of surprising deaths.<br /><br />Sazed really steps up in this story and has a interesting arc as does Elend.  Spook goes from minor character to Major character in this.  Vin show all the things that she has learned from the first two books, she reminds me a lot of Luke Skywalker in return of the Jedi.<br /><br />The Last Two hundred pages are great as aways, This book has three really great chapters at the beginning then begins to slow down until it starts building up to the end.  The reason this book gets for stars is there's a lot of repetition throughout, If you've read the first two books it's overkill and because the book had that lull that was hard for me to get through.<br /><br />As A Trilogy I give this series hands down  5 stars and one that I would highly recommend to some one wanting to get in to fantasy.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|words cannot describe this just wonderful movie  beautifully filmed and great settings,just beautiful.  fantastic story and a cast of millions  a must have,a must enjoy.  highly recommended
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Have on both my Droid, and on the Kindle Fire and love that I can pick up were I left off no matter the device. Plan I am reading is working out great. I do wish that I could figure out the reminder function on my though.
1469984202|5.0|Writers of science and speculative fiction have a huge responsibility. They gaze back and forth in time, peering through the dimensional veils, and bring back what they've seen on their journey. Good writers have the ability to crack the walls of our mind, letting in the fresh air and light of the unknown. Hugh Howey is one of those writers. Howey has created a crowded, lonely and lovely world. The writing puts you right there, a voyeur on every landing, all the way to the Down Deep. This story is, quite simply, brilliant. There is love and tragedy, despair and enlightenment, and best of all, delicious redemption. Enter the Silo, watch your step... and your back.
B006ON41FC|4.0|love the app.! got it a 1/2 hr.  ago and can not stop playing. works great on my kindle fire. love it!!!!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|First off this review is to point out what people who hate this book are missing. My mom read this book she thought this book had a good story line but it was poorly written. I can't say i don't disagree. That is the only bad thing i can say about this book. The story of her love is sweet and intruging. the action and adventure of th book keeps you reading. Put together these qualitys make a good combination. Now there are moms on here complaining about how they don't want there children reading about enjoying killing. I get it it really isn't right for people to take pleasure in watching teens killing eachother or teens enjoying the killing themself. What most people are missing is Katniss several times stated how she couldn't bear the thought of having to kill someone and how Peeta really coudn't bear it even though at one point the kill ws an acident because one of the players ate poisonous berries he thought were safe to eat. Also do parents really realze how much this competition is like back in ancient Rome and the gladiators? Do parents think we should keep those out of the history books just to keep their kids minds away from the evil that has occured? Keep in mind while reading these books it's fictional. I would recommand these books to teens and adults alike.
0780622650|5.0|This is a great movie with a good plot and cast. The only irritant was the docter but I'll get over it. I've had this movie on vhs for years so now it's time to get the dvd..

B0029XFNA8|3.0|I got this as a gift for my wife and assumed it had the color version too.  I obviously should have read the reviews.  She loves the movie itself though and the black and white picture looked great so I still gave it a 3. I think she returned it and got the DVD with both versions of the film on it though.  Oh well...
B005T87QCI|4.0|I have to say the movie suckkkkks. when my friend told me to at least play the app I said fine. the app has some of the robots from the movie and some you have to buy. but out of all if your footed at fighting games like me then you will love it.!!! so in all its good
0307891372|5.0|This book is great and big very detailed. Some 700 pages of maps hints and notes. Detailed description of all the quests.
B0042GIRYE|1.0|I was looking forward to listening to this cd. Within minutes of arriving, it was in the player. Song after song, I was fuming, deciding what I was going to do with this disc, return it, skip it accros some water, or give it away. What a waste of $12.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I think this is a really fun and challenging game. Great graphics... totally addicting. My son and I love it!!
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Up (Single-Disc Edition) is a Disney animated movie from 2009 and is about an elderly man named Carl Fredricksen who one day decides to have an adventure with unforeseen consequences. The animation is great and the storyline is well-developed. The music is amazing and won a well deserved Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Not Disneys best, however a movie that should entertain the entire family. Recommended. 4/5.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love the game can wait to level up ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha. ha ha ha ha
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I bought this Rode VMP for my Canon T2i because it was smaller than the previous [[ASIN:B0007U9SOC Rode VideoMic]] and had this new control to boost audio by +20db. Later I found out that T2i does not have any manual audio control at all. Without audio controls, you can't manually lower your audio to 1/4 from the lowest settings as previous reviews have suggested for VMP, or turn off AGC. Result was that I can still hear hiss noise due to AGC in camera. Only solution I found is to install Magic Lantern [...], turn off camera AGC, and lower down analogue audio a bit. This is really a major oversight in part of Canon - not letting user have control over audio for otherwise such good HD-video capable DSLR!<br /><br />Rode VMP is cute little shotgun mic I have started to like. Improves the audio by miles! This year, Rode has released a new stereo omnidirectional mic for DSLR - I am going to buy one when it becomes available. You need both microphones in your bag - Rode VMP for interviews, and Rode Stereo Videomic Pro for ambient sound recording.<br /><br />I only wish they still ship Deadcat Windshield for free! Rode also needs to make a hard case/bag for this mic.<br /><br />I bought rechargeable [[ASIN:B006P7SVT4 T-228 Plug-in Compact Charger + 2 pcs 9V 200mAh Centura (LSD) NiMH Rechargeable Batteries]] which works great for the VMP.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun FAOTD, addictive and cute. Great game for kids and adults alike. Might have bought for. 99 cents but glad its free for today, I give it four stars.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Very nice way to waist some time. Kids even enjoy playing the game in the car. I'm happy with it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy this game. lots of fun and a good way to pass time. bonus if you have kids and lots of doctor appointments.
B00632HWOG|3.0|ever since an update this week, everytime mail comes in it makes dsoumd...even when the volume is down! Please make it stop!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great because there is so many different kinds of games. I would reccomend this game for anyone who want diversity.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I got this game of the free daily. I love it! The only problem I have had is that there isn't really any instructions. The controls are self explanatory but there is nothing to tell you how to use the things you buy in the shop.
B002BWP49C|5.0|What can I say about Twilight? I've never bothered much to read the books,or watch the movies for that matter, but I saw girls/women around me in awe about this. Edward this, Edward that, Robert Pattinson here and there. So after watching Vampire Diaries I got curious and started watching Twilight. Within 20 minutes I was hooked. Can't let go anymore, ordered the books, ordered all the movies there are and following everything now very closely.  Feel a little embarrassed because I'm a 35 y/o woman that is totally hooked on the characters (book as wel as the people portraying them on screen) and keep rewatching over and over and over again. I actually feel a bit empty inside when I'm done watching, so I start from the beginning again haha!  I love the story, the special effects in the movie, it's just such a great big love. You shouldn't overthink it all too much. I know people are saying well how stupid is that, she has to die in order to be with him, he is too protective and overbearing. But don't look at that. Look at why she wants to become a vampire and why he acts around her the way he does. It's their love. And that love is amazing and I would wish for everybody in the world.  So read the books, watch the movies. You'll have a lovestory for life :)
B001DHXT6G|5.0|i will comment on the video quality in this review.  plenty of reviews of the episodes already.  i just bought ST - the orig series 1-3 bundle (std, not blu-ray).  i played the disks thru a Sony upconverting player on my 47-inch LG TV.  the video quality was simply excellent! - much better than i expected from a show 45 years old.  i do not do blu-ray, so i cannot compare it to that, but i was very pleased.  i recommend this package to anyone who is not into blu-ray  i have not had time to watch all the 25 disks, but i did a spot check of all of them (4-5 minutes per episode) and all played fine.  terre

0525478817|5.0|This is the first book of 2012 going on my favorites list.  I'm always afraid to say I really loved a book so much it's on my favorites list because sometimes that wonderful feeling kind of fades and you later realize that it maybe wasn't quite as amazing as you thought.  That favorites list has to be saved for the truly amazing books.  And I rarely add books to it.  But when I read this book I had no doubt in my mind that it belongs on that list.  It truly is a special book that I doubt will ever fade from my memory.<br /><br />This is a book that takes you on a roller coaster ride.  It's full of amazing witty and hilarious characters.  But these characters are dealing with so much.  You know from the description that this is not just some happy go lucky book.  Cancer is a tough and scary thing and there are many revelations to be had when facing life and death.  There are very few books that have made me feel as much as this one.  This book had me laughing hysterically and sobbing all in the same sentence.  It truly was an epic ride and one of the best I've ever been on.<br /><br />John Green is an expert in creating characters that really truly stand out.  That are super smart and witty and full of some seriously awesome humor.  And I've come to love quite a few of his characters.  But in this book, this book they are more.  These are my most favorite cast of characters yet.  They stand far above the others in any of his books.  They were truly perfect.  And to be perfect they were of course flawed and real.  But they were smart and witty and absolutely hilarious.  They had to overcome so much and they had to find strength to deal with stuff that we all hope we never have to face.<br /><br />I honestly could ramble on about the awesomeness in this book but there really are no words to really describe this book.  It's just perfection and please go get a box of tissue and sit down and read this book now.  I promise, you won't regret it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this was a really fun game.I like how you have goals to complete so I can set my mind to doing something. I hope hither people like this game as much as I did,that would be a lot.
0385342063|5.0|This was such a cute book. The dialogue is absolutely hilarious. I love Sophie Kinsella and she did not disappoint in this one. On a side note; I wonder if she is going to turn this into the next \\"series\\". It was definitely cute enough and did have an open ending? I think it would make an awesome series.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a really fun addictive game don't listen to all the morons out there who say it forces open feint they didn't read the 1ST thing that pops up on the screen when the game starts. that said, works great on sg2, great graffics, good controls and lots of fun.
B006ON41FC|1.0|While I eventually was able to turn off the stupid open feint, it should not automatically opt you in.  Side from that, the game lags horribly. I've played other games like this on my phone without the horrible lagging. Makes the game unplayable.
1579128149|5.0|This is the book that my 9 yo lugs around all over the place.  When you consider how heavy this book is, that is no small accomplishment for an author to achieve.  This is not the book which originally got her interested in Chemistry.  That book was Mad Science, by the same author.  Anybody with children should probably own everything written by Theodore Grey (honestly, I'm not related, have never met him, and I'm not getting paid for this review - his books are just that good)  I will say that if you are an adult with no children or imagination, you can probably skip the buying part and just check them out of the library.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is soo fun.  I downloaded the free app, and it is fun just the way it is.  This was actually the first app we bought on our new Kindle fire.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|A good moral comes from this movie: we all live in imperfect but good times. We can dream, or daydream, about the good old days, the golden ages of the past, but people in those times were probably also thinking of some better bygone time. I have read references of this kind as far back as the Roman empire. The good time to live in is the time we live in. The acting is good and fun, the pace clips away fast, there are several surprise turns to the story and the finale, while slightly predictable, is heart warming!
1594202842|5.0|This book is not a self-help nor a child psychology textbook.<br />A lot of people criticize the author's method of rising her kids with such stringent and Manichean methods; however, she wrote this book as a memoir. She is pretty honest and often contradict herself (We are only human!) She mentions Chinese people don't praise their kids but she repeatedly reminds the reader how talented her kids are. She describes her elite scholastic linkage, which can be traced back all the way to ancient China. She is married to a \\"white guy\\" but she emphasizes she was the first Asian woman he has ever dated (Unlike some guys with yellow fever who date nondiscriminatorily.)<br />Between the lines, I can see a hard working mother trying her best to raise her kids, sacrificing her time and energy and putting herself at risk of being disliked by her daughters. The quarrels between the author and her daughters are amusing (to me.) Even I myself am a first generation Chinese, I don't have any desire to have children. I was born in Hong Kong and I didn't come to US penniless.<br />The book turns out to be more interesting than I have expected. Just remember don't take it as some kind of guide book. This book is meant to be a memoir of a competitive mother trying to raise her children.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Kinsella has really raised the bar on Chick Lit!  Her characters were beautifully drawn.  No more greedy unlikeable heroines, dumb as a box of rocks and strident besides.  I really, really grew to love Poppy and was teary eyed in the final scene.  The romantic chemistry is beleivable and tender.  The plot line was fresh and funny--hard to do these days when most chick lit is so very \\"been there, done that, read this a million times before! argh!\\"  Will be recommending this to all my friends!
B006ON41FC|5.0|i hope that everyone plays it. its such a fun game and it gets you addicted to it once you download it
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is agood game i thought but it is very laggy... my brother plays this game.like 24/7 now....... so now I'm gonna talk about random stuff like scooby door poptarts and hunting and fishing......i like fly fishing and hunting
B006QKJZMW|1.0|Bum, Boobs and Breasts added with Blood, Brutality and Bitches is no replacement to a terrible script, horrible acting skills and an absolutely mindless story-line. I wish someone would have told director Scott Speigel (Evil Dead 2 & The Quick and the Dead) this truth. Overall, a absolutely brain dead time wasting release. Save yourself some pain - Give this movie to your enemy.<br />Overall rating - 1 out 10 (out of charity)
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I just recently downloaded this app and I it works perfectly. I never knew there were so many words. Plus I love how they show you all of the related words. Only thing bad about this app is... NOTHING! !!! I would recomemd this to anyone.
141694737X|5.0|We got this book when our daughter was about 6 months old, and she absolutely loved it.  As she became more dexterous, she enjoyed being able to open the flaps.  She is very engaged when we read this book to her, and she enjoys flipping through the pages on her own.
B003XL6EKS|5.0|Brandon Flowers shows his voice can work in many genre's. He throws a little bit of everything into this solo album: alternative, pop, country, etc.
1416534784|5.0|My son loved it. It was good reading for him. He was asked to get it for school and all the children in his 7th grade class are around 13.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best you have lots of games to choose from and there are a bunch like parachuting from the top of a building, darts, table hockey and much much more
B001LF347E|5.0|This item arrived ahead of time and in excellent shape. Nice twist on the legend of Arthur and Merlin. If you had not read the legend before you would never know the inaccuracies the show portays. All in all it is a great show and I look forward to the following seasons. i would definitely order from this sourse again
B006ON41FC|5.0|going nuts is a very addictive game and i love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *-&#9733;
B001E45XT4|5.0|For the price you can't go wrong and after reading the connection problems and how much batteries the wireless headsets go through I wanted a wired one and bought this. I bought the [[ASIN:B001MSS6CS Syba SD-CM-UAUD USB Stereo Audio Adapter, C-Media Chipset, RoHS]] that hooked into the USB port on PS3 and [[ASIN:B0012MMW7E Cables To Go 40408 3.5 mm Male/Female Stereo Audio Extension Cable - Black (12 Feet/3.65 Meters)]] 12 ft extension cables so I could sit on the couch. It works awesome! This setup I would higly reccomend if you want to sit play online and chat for hours. What I really like is the mute switch and the inline volume control. And my  game of choice with this set up is [[ASIN:B000WJFZEA Warhawk (No Headset)]].<br /><br />Once you get the adapter, plug it into a USB port on the PS3, and make sure to go into the system settings on the PS3 and change the chat input setting to this device.<br /><br />NOTE: Since the PS3 4.00 update only the chat sounds come through the headset which is what I wanted.<br />  If you want to get full sound you will have to plug the headphones output to the back of your TV or receiver or you will have  the buy the official Sony PS3 headset [[ASIN:B0053OLY9O Wireless Stereo Headset]] to get full sound through a headset.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is really fun!!! It is interesting, and very original. You can get different costumes and gear. Going nuts is really cool!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My friend has a kindle fire that he brings to school everyday and I always play this app, it was so tub that I went out and bought a kindle for myself!!! This app is the best ever!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it keeps me busy pretty fun actually I can not complain about it it is a free app and it works well
B006ON41FC|5.0|gr8 game give it a 5 outa. 5 very fun and difficult easy in beginning worth at leas 1 dollar probably more
B005V1WZ10|5.0|I know using the word \\"Grammy\\" is strong language but this is a powerhouse album. Korn have never made anything this revolutionary. They've combined their signature metal sound with dub-step music. For those of you who don't know, dub-step is probably one of the more complex styles of electronic music; to combine dub-step with metal is an amazing achievement. I heard this was going to be an experimental EP originally and I am so glad that the band and the dub-step artists agreed to a full-length album. I have to say that this album is so complex i had to listen to it twice.<br /><br />All of the previous Korn albums kind of show up here in terms of vocal style and intensity of the music: I can hear elements of \\"Life is Peachy\\" while other times I hear elements of \\"Untouchables\\" or \\"See You on the Other Side\\".<br /><br />I won't bother listing the tracks and rating them but I will say this though: only one track (\\"My Wall\\") didn't measure up to the rest and it's still a decent song.<br />I also strongly recommend you get the SPECIAL EDITION because the extra 2 tracks add to the experience even more and are great songs. The band really should get some kind of award for this because this album created almost a new genre of music that isn't lame but instead kind of serves as a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />I know some Korn purists who think Korn should stick to the sound of the 90's will bash this album because they don't understand that bands need to experiment to become better musicians. Don't listen to those naysayers and enjoy the music, buy this and be surprised at how amazing it is.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is ok.  Not too spectacular,  but something to do while sitting in a waiting room, etc.  Good time killer.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. I went 2,453 miles!!  I love the owl effect,the snow acorn,fire acorn,and the skeleton. costume.  =D
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Game worked great and I loved it, but the new Space ad that appears after loading crashes the game.  As soon as I touch the screen, the game closes.  Now I can't play it at all on my Fire.  Please fix it!<br /><br />I tried shutting down my Kindle Fire and when I restarted the game, it finally worked.  Don't know if it was totally my doing, but it worked.  LOVE this game; so glad I've got it back!
B006ON41FC|4.0|this is a very fun game. I wish it would have levels though. it would be even more amazing if it had different levels.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Get ready to be addicted to a game. It's lots of fun and there are lots of challenges to beat. Love it!
1847879071|2.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, this is an excellent book for, well, discovering statistics using spss.  Along with Tabachnick and Fidell, this got me well through my PhD in medical science.  I recommend it to colleagues and students alike, but always with the caveat that mine completely fell apart.  I guess a well-used book is a good one, but it is very disappointing. Notwithstanding it's usefulness, it is very difficult to justify coughing up another > $100 for a book I have already paid for!  Great book. But handle with care.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Everyone said this was going to be the biggest flop. Then people watched it and everyone said it was the surprise hit of the year.  When you have only CGI apes, even the promise of Andy Serkis donning the motion capture and James Franco being anything other than Spider-man's back-up kept me from hoping this movie would be decent.  Then I watched it on DVD.  This movie is a prequel-like movie to the original Planet of the Apes (with Charleton Heston). It sets up the idea of how the apes took over the planet. There are the honorary nods and winks to Heston's epic: \\"Get your stinking paws off me...\\" and \\"It's a mad house!!\\" are woven into the movie. Names of the original apes are quickly given and then dismissed. You'll even get a hint at the space vessel that crashes in the future. We're bound to get a sequel with a possible re-telling of the original.  James Franco does a decent job as a scientist who's on the verge of curing Alzheimer's. His character arc is bound to his father who suffers from the disease. Serkis certainly deserves some kind of award or honorary mention for his bringing a CGI creation to such life. Other characters are simply there to fill the void. Tom Felton (Harry Potter's nemesis, Malfoy) continues his mean streak by abusing the apes in his father's so-called sanctuary. Brian Cox is shuttled to the side as Felton's sleazy father. John Lithgow never ages. He looks the same as when he was in 3rd Rock from the Sun.  They leave enough threads open for future films if the studio decides to green-light the sequels.  I enjoyed this movie. If you can deal with easy-viewing, popcorn flicks, you'll sit back and enjoy this one.
1469984202|5.0|Well, I have successfully managed to enthusiastically, (read: obnoxiously), recommend Wool to just about everyone and anyone in my daily life whom I perceived as being even potentially literate, leading me to now give cyberbullying a go!  Typically, brevity is NOT my strong suit, but of the Wool series, I really only have this to say: You will be doing yourself a great disservice if you don't give in to the impending and certain phenomenon that IS this story. The world, the characters, and the reality in which they exist are brilliantly crafted by the author, Hugh Howey, who is a writer in the vein of sci-fi great John Scalzi; weaving our common humanity into an uncommon circumstance.  The writing is stellar in every area: style, continuity, character development, exposition...etc...etc.  I found myself devouring chapter after chapter, book upon book, with no concept of how much time I'd spent engrossed in my Kindle, clawing toward an end I didn't want to come, but consumed and compelled by the need to know what was there.  I've never been driven to write an Amazon review...then came Wool.  So, heed the 5 STARS bestowed by, umm, everybody and get on board the Wool wagon.  .....while you're at it, warm-up your best \\"Told ya so!\\" for the Johnny Come Latelies who'll be swarming about once this thing finally blows-up Hunger Games style.
145551389X|4.0|Amazing picture book! But i had a tear on the book sleeve! So please package it up a lot better! Thanks!
B0058U0EEO|5.0|Dont waste time reading long reviews from others. The song clips give enough to tell how good this album is.
B005SV9X22|4.0|So let me start out by saying that i LOVE Gaga! She puts on an amazing show for all! And with the product, it was good. Except for a part where she was singing So Happy I Could Die it froze for like 2 seconds! And maybe it was just the DVD that i got! I Don't know! But all in all, it's a MUST BUY
0385342039|5.0|I am NEVER disappointed with any of Sophie Kinsella's novels, and this one is no exception!  A brilliant read!  I was a bit sceptical at first as I am not into ghosts or the \\"beyond\\" but the writing in this novel was just superb.  Full of laughs, at times tears but in the end, it was an all over brilliant read.  I have read all her novels and cant wait to get my hand on \\"I've Got Your Number\\".  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B004U52VPS|5.0|Angry Birds.  5 year old grandson loves this game.  He can set it up himself and makes sure the stetup is as on the cards.  It takes all his skils to set it up - so I do believe it is of educational value also.  Buttom line - he loves it.
1250006341|5.0|I was most pleasantly surprised to learn so much more than possible with the TV presentations which are really fantastic portrayals of the historic epics.  I am in awe of Jessica Fellowes and her collaborating husband, Julian Fellowes.  They have done a marvelous service to all to get a grasp of the lives of the time periods.  Truth is I was hoping that this volume would reveal some of the material for the Second Season as it was most stressing not knowing for I was completely smitten by what went on at Downton Abbey, but instead was most impressed with what I saw and read.  Very well presented.  Thanks.
0307719219|5.0|I've always been interested in this type of thing. Such as why Rome failed and why history repeats itself. Is the United States going to fail eventually. This book, though I need to read more into it and update my review when I have a better grasp on it, is a very insightful book on the interests I have on this subject. I would recommend this read to anyone who is interested in history and the fall of nations.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In this first book of the Hunger Games series, readers are introduced to Katniss, a strong-willed girl from the country of Panem.  Her world is changed forever when she's selected to be a tribute for the 74th Hunger Games-a battle-to-the-death between 24 of the country's youth.  The story is told from the first-person perspective of Katniss in the present tense, which is a bit jarring at first but will quickly add to the urgency of the story's telling.  I bought only the first book at first, unsure if I would like it or if it would be too violent or disturbing (children killing children) but Collins does such a great job creating a world that makes sense-captivating the readers and not adding too much detail for the squeamish.  Do yourself a favor and get the whole set-The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I'm going to be short on the description.  I went ahead and bought a Samsung 50 inch plasma during black friday.  The Samsung was going to be a replacement for a 28 inch vizio in my bedroom that was giving me issues.  I have these wireless Sennheiser headphones that only have the regular rca stereo inputs. The headphones are a big deal to me because I get to watch my movies late at night without bothering my wife and daughter while they are sleeping.  The Samsung does not have a audio rca output but it does have a optical one which is pretty much standard on all new tv's. Used this FiiO device to turn the rca input to a optical one and hook it up to my tv.  Works flawlessly.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book, book 2 of the Hunger Games series, is a must read.  I could not put it down.  At the end, you'll want the third book immediately!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I'm forty years old and love this game.  My kids love it too. Easy to play. Lots of variation. Never bored.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have a physical keyboard that I never use anymore because I like this app so much. Has settings for the fast typists or the more accurate typist, so you can use what's best for you. Picks up on new words fairly quickly and allows you to delete misspellings that make it into the system. It's not perfect, especially when you are trying to introduce a new word or type out a url, but it is by far the best keyboard I've used.
B006ON41FC|5.0|It reminds me of temple run, has upgrades, outfits, a currency you have to collect (nuts) and stuff that tries to kill you, owls, bombs, and trees you have to avoid. Overall great game! love it worth the money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|you wont regret this download, it allows you to read your Bible in several versions, choose from a long list of devotions, and also share with your friend. the developer thought of everything even reminders...thank you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on my Kindle Fire and my iPhone. It works great on both. Will be the only Bible app you will want.
0307959856|3.0|OK Maybe I missed it but what happened with the gunshots heard in the woods?  Wish there was an index, since I don't want to have to reread the whole book just to find out. Helpers, please!    Also, excuse me, Lady P.D. James, but Charlotte did not notice Darcy's interest in Elizabeth at the Assembly Ball!  It was at Netherfield, two balls later, sheesh!  Really disliked the mis-characterization of the bond between Elizabeth and Charlotte.    I was ecstatic at the beginning, but soon wished the book had been handed over to one of the Dragons at The Republic of Pemberley (<...>) to be vetted.  They would have caught all the silly little mistakes so annoying to serious Jane Austen scholars.    One more thing, it would have been illegal under English law at that time for Mr. Bennet to sell of any part of the Longbourne estate since it was entailed to the male line.  Was also disappointed that Mr. Bennet was introduced as a character entirely irrelevant to the plot.    I love the idea and think Lady P. D. James did capture some of the sparkle of Jane Austen's style.  She is a master in her own right, but this effort did not truly serve her or the original.  I started out with quite an appetite and was left feeling very hungry for the true heir to Jane Austen's genius to step up, if such a thing is possible.
B006ON41FC|5.0|i love this game it.is hard but i am really good at it now i am a hazlenut yeah go me
B0066W1AZK|4.0|No, really! I can't beat it! (on hardest setting). Play it all the time. Wish you could see taken pieces though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great! Get it today. I play it often and find it User friendly. Worth every penny! lt is a deal at twice the price.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is so much fun, and so addicting. It is so fun it is horrible because I sometimes spend hours playing it! lol
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is cute and very fun but the only thing from keeping me from 5 stars is that the Feint auto load just annoys me.
B006TJXZ30|2.0|worked well for the first two weeks. now all my emails go to outbox unsent. I'm trying to check my settings! fix the glitches please.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|I hate to say this but DRIVE has to be the worst movie in all time. It has NO PLOT, it has 80's disco music that plays as the sound track every 5 minutes! There is almost no dialog and honestly, when there is it almost reminds you of people talking in slow motion..words spoken seem to last forever just to say one sentence. My fiance and I love movies but this was a serious FAIL. Again, hardly worth it, even if it is free. Don't believe me and rent it but how someone here can muster up any positive words about this movie AND come close to being worthy for any award is beyond me. How bad is it really? My first movie review is this very review and I only decided to review because of how terrible it was. It actually makes me angry I wasted about 2hrs of my life when I think about it. I had to do something to let everyone know any positive review is pure insanity!
B00005N6KG|3.0|I buy these in bulk and last from days to many months. Some only play in one ear from the start. I'm sure everyone knows by now that its due to the thin wires, and fragile connection at the plug. What you need to do is wrap 2-3 thin rubber bands around the plug area to protect against constant stresses (bending and pulling) there. If you have the patience and determination, when the wires go bad, get a $2 plug from Radio Shack, and cut the old plug off, and solder on the new one. This takes some experience, but can save plenty headaches over the long run. There are youtube videos on how to do it.<br />5 stars while it works, and 1 star for SONY not being able to provide a decent wiring connection. That's why you need to pay attention to the wire thickness and plug size, and not just the sound when buying headphones.
B006ON41FC|4.0|its good fun game has easy challenges but there are a lot so you have something to do for a while
B005K17RU0|5.0|love it. very accurate and covienant. only weather app I will ever use. worth the download especially since it is free.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so cool because it looks so real and when I hit hit a tree it feels like I did in real life
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game so much! I have a very busy life and its so nice to dog down at the end of the day and wind down with this game.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|When  videos are converted to mp3, they're not actually mp3. why? Can't power my screen off to listen to it because it's still just really a video file. Otherwise, it's a cool 2nd rate app to iphone's jailbreak 'youtube to mp3' app in cydia.
B006ON41FC|5.0|the title says it all the game is great the only problem I had was the slamming of advertisement and forcing me to rate
B006ON41FC|4.0|Going Nuts is an ok game. I like that you can buy things with the nuts you've collected.  I do not like that I cant find a opinions. button. to mute music.
0060512806|4.0|The shipping and handleing was good.The book it self is fiction and I read mostly non fiction. The book was recommended by a friend and he was spot on. I,m still reading and still enjoying this episode of Neals works.
1451627289|5.0|What an ENTERTAINING read!Loved the plot line, the characters (new AND old), the settings and historical detail. Stephen King at his finest.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love this app!! Sleeping with chronic snoring partner has never been more peaceful. When sleepy time is on my brain blocks the snoring and focuses on the sweet sounds of ocean, rainstorm, river, whatever. Best lifestyle app ever! Finally 6 hours of rest, no more couchtime for me.
0307593312|4.0|Very interesting sci-fi read that may have lost a little in the translation from the Japanese. Strong characters and engrossing plot sag a bit about two-thirds in, but ultimately lead to a satisfying conclusion.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|I purchased a Adele 21 CD and I am quite disappointed that the CD has skips on it. Track 8-9-10 can't be enjoyed because of the stop and start, stop and start, then it begins to replay the track all over again. My CD player is a BOSE and I never had skipping before with a CD.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|Denzel as a traitor who has been on the loose for 10 years.  He gets some highly classified info (a computer file) of MI6 and CIA agents who have been...naughty courtesy of taking $. He injects the file (in a vial form like the tracking device in [[ASIN:B0020M99LC Casino Royale]]) into his side then goes to the US embassy in Cape Town, South Africa where all this is going on as the baddies are after him.<br /><br />He is sent to Ryan's Safe House.  Robert Patric shows up, playing a character similar to who he played in [[ASIN:B002G1WPHM The Unit: The Complete Series]] and they are going to waterboard Denzel, no fun to watch. Oh, meanwhile, Ryan has a gal and he tells her a long rambeling story like Tom Cruise in[[ASIN:B000I68800 Mission: Impossible III]].<br /><br />So, the baddies show up at the Safe House and shoot it up, so Ryan  and Denzel are on the run, they vear into oncoming traffic to elude them. They go to a sporting even to hide, suprising Denzel would even go along with this, even if Ryan holds a gun on him, we see he is capable of disarming people.  He cries out so the police jump in.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the people at HQ (CIA in VA) FLY to South Africa, they figure someone on the inside is a nark (NO! REALLY! YES!) They aspire to go to another safe house after Ryan tracks Denzel down at one of Denzel's former known associates. At the new safe house fighting insues, we see an agent shoot a female agent point blank and she goes down, ugg.<br /><br />Of course, one of the main handlers is a bad guy, no duh.  In the end Ryan submits his report, leaving out certain important parts that his boss questions, Ryan plays dumb.<br /><br />Do your self a favor and watch [[ASIN:B000RPCK24 A View to a Kill]] or even [[ASIN:B00000K0EA Tomorrow Never Dies (Special Edition)]] if you want to see somebody do something, or even [[ASIN:B0009W5JS2 XXX - State of the Union (Widescreen Edition)]] for its comedic insight as it too uses the 'file' idea of a small object that is sought after like the battery in [[ASIN:B002ZG9864 Knight and Day (Single-Disc Edition)]].
B0055SWM08|4.0|A very fun puzzle game with lush graphics and smooth game play.  Puzzles were just the right level of difficulty... challenging, but not so frustrating that I gave up.  Very nice music, but I'd have liked a little more variety.<br /><br />Not so unique... I have a very similar game on my Nokia tablet, though this one has a couple different twists.  I guess Quell must be better, because I finished it, where I didn't finish all the puzzles on the Nokia.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Beautiful melodies, arrangements, and of course, that timeless voice. At nearly 70, his voice is silky smooth with no hiccups. He chooses to use more vibrato than usual, and is in a higher register than usual, but there's no mistaking that it's our old friend Paul. It's just a really touching album. A real throwback to a simpler time. But it's not Paul doing a Tony Bennett impersonation -- no, he's doing it his way. It's not crooning. It's really, really touching singing. The kind that makes you sad but also happy at the same time. The best way to describe it is...this is how Paul would sing to his young daughter as he tucks her in at bedtime. The best song in my opinion is his original composition, My Valentine, but More I Cannot Wish You is also stunningly beautiful.  Paul's at that point where he doesn't care about reviews or what people are expecting of him. He's not trying to make the next Sgt Pepper's. He's just doing what he wants to do. And for the record, the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive and the album has charted top 3 in the UK and top 5 in the US. Not bad, Paul. Not bad for an album of mostly covers of old songs that most people haven't heard of.
0060512806|5.0|Cryptonomicon deftly weaves 4 subplots across 50 years: the story of a Japanese miner/engineer hiding a cache of gold, an American codebreaker working on Nazi encryptions, another American soldier carrying out bizarre orders to conceal the work of the codebreaker, and (in the present) an American hacker who starts off trying to build a data haven but ultimately gets on the trail of a cache of gold.<br /><br />This book isn't for everyone, but those with interests in WW2 and cryptology will be sucked in and love it. Parts of it are informative, parts are laugh-out-loud funny. At 900+ pages it's long, but about 700 pages of those are actually really interesting. One 1-star review lamented that much of this comes across as shaggy-dog padding and that he was able to skip whole pages without missing anything. I see his point, but 7 out of 10 times disagree. Again, this is not for everyone.<br /><br />This book actually reminded me of Gravity's Rainbow, which I liked but acknowledge has a limited reader base. It this sort of thing is your cup of tea, I highly recommend it.
0062060562|2.0|I agree with some other reviewers that this book had an interesting premise but failed to deliver the suspense that I was expecting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always enjoyed this game. This app was a great choice for me. I like to play it for relaxation.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is so fun And I can not stop playing it it is addicting. this game you should get I cant belive how fun it is.there is no reason to not get this game this is COOL

B005HSG3TC|3.0|This is a decent case. It will protect my kindle fire, but it's not exactly what I was thinking it would be. The front cover is extremely thin in keeping with it's goal to be lightweight. I'm sure it will do fine, but it does feel like there isn't much there. My main complaints would be the stand, which is really a lousy design. It is constantly popping out of the little groove on the back. My guess is that it would work better on a flat surface, but that's not where I need it to work most of the time. I am a bit disappointed with the closure too. My own fault for not reading closer but I don't think the elastic is going to hold up in the long term. Elastic stretches with use and I'm afraid eventually it just won't really do the job anymore. I would probably rate this case higher if it had been a bit cheaper. It's not awful, but I expected a little more for the price.
B006ON41FC|5.0|i just love this game! its so fun, especially if you love squirrels it was very addicting to play !
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I must admit that when this game came up on Amazon app store the other day I didn't think it would be as fun as it turned out to be!  It starts off relatively easy (like all games do) but quickly turns to be quite difficult (but not difficult enough for you to give up!).  My 5 year old plays it, my 15 year old plays it, and heck I've been playing it too.  Its a definite keeper in my book!  It a puzzle game that you fit groceries in a bag (or two or three depending on what each session tells you to do) but you can't stack too much ontop of certain things or they'll get smushed!  Sort of a pick it yourself tetris (kind of).<br /><br />This is the kind of game you gets you in a lot of trouble at work!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome because you get to earn points to get different games and there are a lot of fun games on here
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it....too many ads though.  The games are fun for the most part.  Some are difficult because of the touch screen sticking issues.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Going nuts is a fun creative game. It is a flying squirrel that you control and collect nuts. But be aware of trees and rotten nuts. Oh and don't forget to have fun with the game.  :)bye
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Great to pass time.  Not a whole lot required...fun, relaxing. Recommend having available on your phone.  Challenging but not frustrating...good to go back and be able to complete level with one less move.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Very good game especially for the price. I've been neglecting my girlfriend for the past 4 hours. I only wish there were more upgrades.
B004HV54TU|4.0|The little I've used this mouse it has been okay, though it is quite awkward to operate.  It is hard to pickup and move around while mousing.  The overall control feels okay and does it's job, at this point I'm unsure if it is any better than other options.  I, for one, favor a trackball since it keeps my wrist steady and in place.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love this game and I always want to play it on my Asus transformer prime,  but it's not optimized for tablets yet so the game freezes all the time! Hopefully they will fix it soon. Game looks crappie on the 10.1&quot; screen too.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Its Awesome you can play it a lot its challenging Its fun to play a lot.Its competitive it doesn't lag a lot.
0684833395|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I don't think I have laughed as much while reading any other book. It has a lot of dark humor but there are definitely moments that will have any person laughing very hard. There is a good deal if symbolism in this book as well,  some very subtle others are in your face and it makes the book that much better. Even if you aren't looking for something so deep this book is still for you. Even taken at the most superficial level Catch 22 is a great read. It can make you cry, laugh hysterically, or become very angry. By the time I finished this book I loved all the characters. If you have seen the (somewhat) recently released movie just know the book is 1000 time better. It does jump around a bit (chronologically) so it can get confusing but I feel like that's part of what makes catch 22 catch 22. Happy reading! :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|app works great on kindle fire had it for a while now and i have seen no problems, does not seem to flow down my kindle its awesome and fun for people of all ages
B005T87QCI|1.0|This game doesn't even work. Who do I talk to about getting my money back? Why don't they test the game before they release it to new tablet?
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love the game and I do not know why there are haters. Just stop using Openfient or whatever it is called and ENJOY THE GAME!

B006ON41FC|5.0|i absolutely love this game it is very addictive and very fun to play and it kinda reminds me of supper cart hero but way better! !!!!!!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Cant be without it, does not add bulk, light and protective casing is very secure and is tough for setting. Kindle down like a book and not so gingerly. The felt inside is assurance that the kindle screen is protected as well. Highly recomend this case. Stand feature is a nice added bonus.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love Going Nuts it's fun, addictive, and entertaining. You have to download it.  Have to the life of your entertainment depends on it.

B005R4255C|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  I am a huge Michael Jackson fan and i completely love this Album.  Thank you to the people who made this album possible. You defiantly captured Micheal's spirit in this CD.  A must have for any Michael fan.  Rest in peace Michael.  L.O.V.E

B000005HAU|4.0|Is a good standar piece where the player shows his virtuosity, but I thaught he was a better player like Salinas from Argentina

B004EJUMT2|4.0|If you like Mercyful Fate and/or King Diamond, you will like these guys. The lead singer doesnt sing as high as King, but you can tell their influence. Its a bit on the shorter side playing at only approx 35 mins, but all songs are worth listening to. The album isnt overly heavy, the lead singer does no grunnting, growling or screaming (which is fine with me), its still has a heavy sound. The recording is clear and sounds great. I would have no problem recomending this album to anyone.
B003YBUSMW|3.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday (he is a huge Forza fan) so he was looking forward to trying out this steering wheel for the more realistic experience. He has used it a few times now, and says it is very touchy and sensitive so sadly we are returning it. Other than that, it looks like a great product and everything came like described.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|installed huge, sneaky open feint software even tho I declined. not worth the invasion of privacy. very disappointed.  huge, annoying fail.
145162445X|2.0|The subtitle of this book is, \\"Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing.\\"  Finally, after 180 pages, the author gives what even he admits is an entirely facile response, \\"Because if there were nothing, I wouldn't be here to write this book!\\"  That is a complete and utter waste of my time.  If you're not going to answer the question, don't write the book.  That being said, the book has some things going for it.  The author gives an interesting explanation of how we now know the universe to be 13.77 billion years old, rather than just 14 or 13.7.  He also explains inflation nicely.  The explanation of particles winking in and out of space at a quantum level is frankly startling.  Too startling for me to believe, but thought-provoking nonetheless.  But, while I admit that you need to know the background to understand the explanation, he never gets around to explaining it.  At the end, he simply throws up his hands and states, \\"You may as well ask why the sky is blue as opposed to some other color.  It just is.\\"  That's not good enough.  This book is false advertising!  Stay away!

B005K2YRVG|5.0|I bought the Timbuk2 Envelope Sleeve Case in Grey/Cold Blue in January 2012 for my Kindle Touch (wifi only version).  It fits this particular Kindle version perfectly- not too loose and not too tight.  It's a solid and well-made product that safely holds and protects my Kindle from drops and kids.  I love the color but the red interior I could do without (just don't like the color, nothing wrong with it physically).  I definitely feel it's worth the price and does what it promises.<br /><br />Good to know info: You cannot read with the book in this case, nor can you charge it while in this case.  It uses velcro instead of a magnet to close the case, which is comforting (I've heard magnets do harm to electronics and why take an unnecessary risk?).  The fabric is somewhat stain-resistant, though that isn't a guarantee.  It's not cloth, but it's not plastic; it's a nice in-between material that doesn't feel cheap.  The red interior has not caused any trouble for my Kindle and it's in the case whenever I'm not reading.  I would buy this case again, for myself in the future or for a gift.<br /><br />Update Oct. 31, 2012<br />Still going strong!  The velcro is still like new, the interior is still in good condition (no shedding, but some light wear from the velcro), the cover is still in great condition.  I have 4 kids that play hard and don't leave my stuff alone and my Kindle is still always safe in this case.
B006ON41FC|5.0|lots of fun.  plenty of levels and goals to reach.  works great on the kindle fire.  highly addictive.  reccommend this game

B005KJJ4F8|3.0|After seeing so many great review of Cinder, Marissa Meyer's debut, I was definitely looking forward to reading it. This scifi take on the fairy tale Cinderella sounded like a lot of fun, and it didn't disappoint. Cinder was a fun, enjoyable story, complete with an interesting world and great characters.  Sometimes it almost felt like a Disney movie - Cinder had a cute and odd sidekick, an evil \\"step\\"-mother (of course), a prince, a witch, and so on. There were a few variations that I liked - the fact that one of her sisters, at least, was kind to her, as well as the more complex world made it stand out a bit from the rest of the herd. Being a retelling of a fairy tale, the plot \\"twists\\" were quite predictable, but Cinder was enjoyably nonetheless.  There were times that I found Cinder a bit pathetic, but for the most part she was a good protagonist. Her cyborg attributes made her really unusual and added uniqueness to her character.  The world of the Lunar Chronicles is pretty different from any other I've read, containing both advanced technology such as cyborgs and artificial intelligence and what I would call \\"techno-magic\\" in the Lunars' abilities. I do wish there were more explanation of the origin of the lunar base, because I couldn't really tell if they were supposed to be human or not, and I wasn't entirely sure of the relationship between the various Terran nations. (Yes, Terran. I do try not to be nit-picky here, but the term \\"Earthen\\" really irritated me.)  Cinder was a quick, fun read, and I'm looking forward to the next book of the Lunar Chronicles.

0385523912|5.0|\\"Nothing to envy\\" is a chilling, heartrending and engrossing description of everyday life in North Korea. The author has interviewed refugees from North Korea's third largest city, Chongjing. Life in this supposedly \\"democratic people's republic\\" turns out to be an almost exact replica of George Orwell's novel \\"1984\\". The novel's description of a futuristic totalitarian state caricatured Stalin's Soviet Union. In North Korea, the caricature is the real thing!<br /><br />The book really speaks for itself, but some details stand out more than others. Markets are almost entirely abolished, and so are wages. Instead, everything is rationed. Citizens get food, clothes, housing and even children's candy from the government. The society is fiercely hierarchic, with limited social mobility for the lowest estates. Most people aren't even allowed to live in Pyongyang, the national capital. Nor are people allowed to leave their home towns without special permission from the proper authorities. Sexual puritanism is so extreme, that several of the people interviewed by the author knew next to nothing about sex even in their late 20's. One well-educated defector had no idea that women menstruate!<br /><br />Repression is severe. 200,000 North Koreans are imprisoned in the country's own version of the Gulag. The most notorious prison facilities are virtual death camps. The large number of political prisoners isn't surprising. Critical off-hand remarks can lead to interrogation or imprisonment. Mobile police patrols search people's homes at random, usually in the middle of the night. If somebody defects, all family members (even loyal ones) are automatically sent to the camps, with virtually no hope of being released. Public executions are common. Children are taught to spy on their parents, and those who do are treated as heroes. The regime doesn't even trust its own allies. Pro-Communist Koreans from Japan who immigrated to North Korea weren't allowed to enter \\"the core classes\\", some were purged, and none were allowed to return to Japan once they realized the true nature of the regime...<br /><br />The economy of North Korea virtually collapsed during the 1990's, as the Soviet Union dissolved and subsidies to the regime were discontinued. Rather than reforming the economy, Kim Il Sung and his successor Kim Jong Il decided to continue as if nothing had happened. The famine of the mid-90's was man-made. 2 million North Koreans might have starved to death. The lucky ones managed to escape to China. One refugee, who worked as a doctor in North Korea, was stunned to realize that dogs eat better in China than college graduates in North Korea. Meanwhile, the army was stealing most of the humanitarian aid from the United States, United Nations and various international agencies.<br /><br />Even in this living hell, there are certain details that actually struck me as humorous, in a bizarre kind of way. One is that most North Koreans wear identical clothes. These are made of \\"vinalon\\", the only indigenous North Korean invention. Vinalon is a fibre made out of limestone and anthracite (!). It's worthless compared to real wool or textiles. Well, isn't it a great achievement to turn coal into clothes? This almost sounds like a parody of \\"sustainable development\\"...<br /><br />Another absurd detail: One of the refugees interviewed lived in a small shack during the famine, but still had portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on her wall, since this is compulsory. At one point, everything in the shack was burglarized, including the glass covering the portraits, but not the portraits themselves! Defaming the photos of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il is punishable by death, so the burglar rather left them on the wall!<br /><br />I'm not a great fan of neo-liberal capitalism, but this book shows what happens if a centralized command economy is created on an artificial basis and strictly adhered to: permanent rationing, virtual serfdom, little or no domestic economic growth, a quasi-feudal hierarchy and a totalitarian state making sure nobody leaves. And, of course, an absurd propaganda apparatus to convince people (if at all possible) that they really have \\"nothing to envy\\".<br /><br />Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels actually criticized a similar system proposed by some of their opponents, calling it \\"barrack socialism\\". Marx and Engels would have been horrified by North Korea. Yet, in an ironic twist of history, the barrack socialism of North Korea claims to be Marxist! But while Marx and Engels would surely have opposed Kim Il Sung's evil parody of their philosophy, they weren't very prescient overall.  China, with its \\"state capitalist\\" blend of state ownership and market mechanisms, would have been attacked by the founders of Marxism as \\"bourgeois socialism\\". Yet, China is one of the strongest economies in the world, suggesting that some form of dirigiste mixed economy is the real alternative to both American neo-liberalism and the neo-feudalism of North Korea. In another strange twist of history, China too claims to be Marxist...<br /><br />Let me conclude by saying that \\"Nothing to Envy\\" (the title is an obvious double entendre) is one of the best books I've ever read. The book is tragic, and parts of it might actually make you weep. To call it \\"one of my favourite books\\" therefore feels slightly bizarre. But yes, it *is* one of my favourite books. Barbara Demick should be commended for giving us this glimps into one of the most despicable societies in the world, the Orwellian nightmare of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.conomic growth, a quasi-feudal hierarchy and a totalitarian state making sure nobody leaves.

B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is super dope. One of the best games on my kindled fire. It has super good grafics too. I'm happy they took it down to free but I would have payed the money for it.  One of the best games ever.
B006ON41FC|5.0|game is great on my gs2.  you don't even notice openfeint, and if you don't already have it installed it just creates a generic profile. openfeint haters are idiots. but the game, it's fun, the goals are fun to try and achieve. game is smooth, hasn't crashed on me and I've played it for many hours already.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Its great love it I use it to check on downloads when I'm away from my computer and it works good for that purpose.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater and we liked it so when it came out on dvd we had to have it.  My 10 year old granddaughter liked it,too.  This movie was delivered in less than 7 days, which was great.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|For years I've been playing a game with the Life of Pi.  I would see it at my local bookstore, pick it up, read the back, carry it around the store, and - in the end - put it back on the shelf.  We've all had those moments: \\"The book seems interesting enough, but - eh - I'm just not feeling it.\\"  Recently I moved to a new city, and in my ritual of practices I got a library card at the local library.  The librarian handed me the new card and told me I could check out two books on my first visit.  I went and perused the aisles, and - lo and behold - Life of Pi jumped out at me with it's turquoise jacket like a proverbial fish from the water.  After reading the book - in just one night - I was pleasantly surprised with the story.  Faith and science are woven throughout the parable of Pi and his faithful companions on their Pacific odyssey.  I thought about the book for a good day after I finished it, which - in my point of view - means the author did his job; prompt the audience to evaluate your work and their life, all at the same time.  I don't believe in spoiling works, giving all the details, or giving my fixed opinion on a piece of art; as art it is open for interpretation by all.  As such, I would say everyone should give this book a chance. I imagine it would bring everyone their own perspectives.  If nothing else, it is - plain and simple - a well woven story.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|with the new angry birds space ad the game has quit working this needs to be fixed. or is this the plan to people to move to the new game?
B002RKSXJG|5.0|I really liked this one, and I believe I found my new favorite author. This had so many great plot moments and great dialogue that it was simply an easy read, even in spite of the length. I downloaded this author's other books, and hope they're just as good.
B003102JDM|5.0|I find this movie to be rather hysterical. From Sy Ableman to the South Korean exchange student, there are just so many moments of pure, dark comedic gold. The Jolly Roger, Santana Abraxis, it is all very, very funny if you have this sense of humor. I am sure not everyone will find it as funny as I did.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Great movie even better in 3D!!! Hopefully Disney will eventually make their whole library available in 3D.I highly recommend to anyone!!
B000AP04L0|5.0|I got my dvd with 'Extra Flair' LOL.  This movie is a classic, it speaks the mind of almost every cubical worker I have known and/or worked with. It sums up how I felt about working in an office when I did. Even 10 years later this movie is just as funny, if not better then it was back then.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|I use this to jot notes to myself.  It isn't as helpful in the car.  My writing without looking creates interesting, illegible scribbles.
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|First off, let me say that my kids and I love the movie (we are big Pixar fans at our house).  It is a different flavor than the original but it is still quite enjoyable.  I specifically purchased this combo pack for the digital copy - so our kids would be able to watch it on a certain 7\\" android tablet that we also got for Christmas.  HAH!  Boy was I wrong in thinking that would work!  I was stupid enough to believe the representations in the studio's advertisements where they show people watching the movie on non-connected (and non-itunes) devices.  In anticipation of a long car trip, I downloaded the \\"digital copy\\" and transferred it to our 7\\" android tablet (hoping to surprise the kids).  Imagine how pleased I was to find that the tablet would not play the file and that  I can only watch the file on the laptop that I downloaded the file onto.  !?HUH?!  What good does that do?  If I wanted to play the movie on my laptop then I'd just put the disk in the drive.  In what way is that the same as the claims represented in the studio's \\"digital copy\\" advertisements?  Oh, and the cherry on top of the whole thing is that the \\"copy\\" EXPIRES next year (?!?!?!?!).  Long story short, if you like the movie like we do then buy the appropriate disk but don't pay any extra for the digital \\"copy\\".  The one qualifier I'd offer to the above is that perhaps if you already have an apple ecosystem at your house then this \\"might\\" let you use the file UNTIL IT EXPIRES...
B005G02RIC|5.0|[[ASIN:B005G02RIC Tosca [Blu-ray]]]  I took advance of the good price to buy this DVD with a great cast.  The production at the Verona Arena was great, the scenery in the vast stage was very successful as well as the costumes and lights .All these elements were very effective in maintain the dramatism of this opera .The end of the first act when Scarpia and a chorus sang \\"The Sbirri ,una carrosa\\"(Te Deum) and people arriving at the church at the same time of a procession began, the combination with very good music, scenery and lights were very effective.  The main characters: Tosca, Cavaradossi and Scarpia played by Fiorenza Ceddolins, Marcelo Alvarez and Ruggerio Raimondi were very good in their roles showing the complexity of there personality's .Scarpia has his intend on getting Tosca as his lover using the power of his position to create doubts about Cavaradossi's love for her, on the other hand Tosca goes from love to jealousy and at the same time tries convince Scarpia to pardon Cavaradossi, and in exchange she will accept him although she will kill him before this. At the same time Cavaradossi prefers to die before renouncing to his ideas.  This is a very dramatic opera and it is very well reflected in this production.
B006ON41FC|4.0|It is a fun quick app, there are some slowdowns on my fire but it operates just fine. It does end up being a timesink but it still can provide plenty entertainment.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is a great movie. I bought it for my 7 year old daughter to see. We have the Disney version, which is good, but this version we had on VHS and we needed it on DVD. Needless to say, She loves the movie, both versions, but this one is her most favorite with Carol Burnett.<br />She will be doing a dance recital (Ballet) in a few months and they are dancing to \\"Hard Knock Life\\", so now she has a clear understanding of combination of Ballet slash washbucket :)<br />I highly recommend this movie. Great for all ages, a Classic!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|101+20 games is a horrible app. The graphics stink. The gameplay itself stinks. There are annoying adds popping up every single second for other apps. AND the controls don't even work half the time. Don't get this app, it's a waste of valuable memory space.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This is a great film even if you're not a baseball fan.  Wonderful ensemble cast, good story and direction.  Well constructed movie with strong family appeal.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Good game, but same thing everytime.  Leveling system like jetpack joyride. All in all fun, but bets boring after a while.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|This is a great time killer app and also fun for kids. My toddler is fascinated by all the motion. Very colorful and strangely addicting.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|This movie in my opinion is a brilliantly hidden message. What is the Message? The message is that we are all running out of time. Unknown to most of humanity, only the elite selected few really know the real story of the earth. There is an interface that can bring immorality to the selected ones. (And yes, it really does exist ... but it is not for the masses, unfortunately - most of humanity must indeed die. But this is really their own choice.)<br /><br />Some believe that this is some sort of New World Order ... but that too will be a miserable failure.<br /><br />How do you really change your time zone? Sorry, I can't tell you that, it is something that you must discover for yourself.<br /><br />This is a pretty good movie. Enjoy, hope to see you in eternity.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Blu-ray has amazing quality in both video and audio. I love this movie, and the Blu-ray just completed my home theatre experience. Would buy it again if that made any sense.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is cool because there r verious types of games you can play I just don't like the part where it always says by this and you'll get 30000 coins other than that this is cool
B006ON41FC|5.0|was not expecting much... but awesome! simple little game better than most. easy controls on a fire. good reflex game
B006ON41FC|5.0|Going Nuts is definetly worth your time. Its fast paced, cute, and has plenty of objectives for you to full fill. Its definetly addicting and challenging. Totally worth download on the Kindle Fire
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|good game.  I enjoyed the I Spy quality.  great as cognitive stimuli.  that keeps the synapses firing.  I would recommend it for alzheimers and traumatic brain injury patients
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are fun and challenging.  They're kinda addictive. They keep you wanting more. good for being free ya know
B006ON41FC|5.0|good game. really fun to play and good controls. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
B005ZUR724|1.0|every update, bug, and Evan a ban you get no response do not buy this game its not worth the hair pulling out...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app.  I like the number of translations and the number of reading plans available.  I haven't used any of the other tools.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is good. it was a little laggy but when i turned openfeint off it worked watt better  oher than that amazing game
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun fun but if not familiar it is hard but once you get the hang of it u start to love it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|There are a bunch of cute little games in this for when u get bored and it gives u something to try to accomplish if ur competetive like me! Some of the games are really stupid tho.
B006ON41FC|2.0|When I was playing this game it was fun and Coll but when I went to the store and tried to buy something with my nuts the screen became unresponsive and it really made me mad
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy this game it gives you a challenge I would recommend it to anyone to play!!!! I also would buy it for any of my family members. who like these kind of games....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game! I love it a lot so glad I got it. just need the update but it wont let me..
B006PHD0RW|5.0|At first I thought this game would be boringly simple, but once I started playing I discovered how challenging it really is. Many games get repetitive after awhile, but this game has enough twists and turns to keep you interested.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I love the combination of the personal narrative, factual narrative, anthropological (historical & current) narrative & in-depth look at running the book combines. Not only does it unite several different narratives, but does so concisely & cohesively. You get invested in every single character in this book, in addition to wanting to go on a 20+mile run. Best of all, as with most things in life, the conclusion that simple goodness helps a human run better is reaffirming.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun app and great for when you are stuck in a waiting room.  Definitely can't beat the price.  Works well with kindlefire.
0691152640|4.0|This book is not for the casual or recreational reader; it includes a lot of economic data, charts, graphs, and time series.  The point of the work is that our current economic difficulties are not unique but rather just one more in a series dating back as far as data is available. The authors make a compelling case that, presumably due to human nature, economic crises occur, are forgotten, and then recur. One \\"take away\\" is that people should never think that they have become so smart that (economic) history no longer applies to them.  This time is never really different!  The reader can also find other \\"take aways\\" from this book, such as, that strong economic regulation has its' faults but does produce financial stability.  A point which the proponents of massive deregulation should carefully consider.  Overall, one of the few economic works worth the effort to read and understand.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It was a good challenge for me! I like to solve problems especially,  in fun and creative ways! These types of things are good for your brain even though you don't notice it! I'm also very competitive and don't give up easily. This is definitely a wonderful game!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Haven't stopped playing it since I first opened it.  I have a feeling that it won't be as fun in the long haul.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a great game that is easy to learn and tons of fun.  I stopped trying to explain too much when teaching people how to play this game.  Run them through the basics and play one round and then everyone is good to go.  This is a great game to get kids and adults thinking about spacial relationships.  A nice change of pace from most of the other games that are out these these days.  This is a fun game for 2-4 players that you actually have to think about to play.  I think 3 players has a fun variation with the 4th color rotated around, lots of twists and turns.
B005K17RU0|1.0|It has been consistent in one respect...it has never failed to crash every time I have attempted to use the app's functions.
6305313687|5.0|You will want to go change the world after watching this movie.  Edward Norton's best role ever.  This is a great movie with great characters, great acting but an ever better story.  This is exactly what we needed to bring racism to the forefront and tell the story about how people can change.  Everyone should watch this movie.
0307888908|5.0|Unless you are the smartest, wisest and most connected person in the world, you won't need this book. But if you are just a average Joe, then get this book ASAP. I always like to begin my review by saying what is the main takeaway I got from the book.<br />\\" Is all about networking, baby.\\" And this book shows you exactly how to do that. The authors show poignant examples of people using network to get ahead in their careers. Time are changing , and we (workers) must change with it. The fantasy of working for the same company and getting a fat pension is long gone. We have to be like a start up company. Hungry, on permanent beta form, always evolving.<br />The old saying of not what you know but who you know is more powerful now then ever before. Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, say that by having quality allies and second and third level of contact is the way to go to acquire jobs, ask quality questions and get ahead.<br />They talked about managing risk. To get ahead you have to get out of your comfort zone, but be smart about it. Have an ABZ plan, plan A is your first plan, plan B , is when things change and plan Z, is the worse case scenario.<br />They give specific things to do to get ahead in business:<br /><br />Have a list of 20 people you would call if you just got layoff.<br /><br />Ask relevant questions when you are seeking a superstar contact or interview, like what should be my next step, you would you do in my situation, the main thing is do not waste their time, do your homework.<br /><br />Have a coffee date with at least 5 people that could help you career or at least can ask for career advice.<br /><br />Find alternative ways to achieve your goals.<br /><br />in LinkedIn, categorize people: who will be the go-to person for technology, for relationship and who are the smart cookies you can ask general questions.<br /><br />As you can see, this is an excellent book. The one smart criticism I would have is that the author is the co-founder of LInkedIn and I would have hope he would have given us a lot of information on how to maximize LInkedIn or some hidden gems that no one would have known but he shares with his readers. But that is extra because the book is about being an entrepreneur  and not about his company. There is a dummies book on LInkedIn that is worth checking.<br /><br />In summary, I loved this book and I will keep it as reference and follow a lot of their recommendations.LInkedIn and I would have hope he would have given us a lot of information on how to maximize LInkedIn or some hidden gems that no one would have known but he shares with his readers.

B000W91RUG|5.0|This is a great start to a great series.  Finally there is a tv show out there that everyone can enjoy.  The characters are well developed and the writing is awesome.  If you have not watched this series catch a re-run and you will be hooked.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|A fun little puzzle game to keep you thinking.  If you like trying to solve puzzles, this is for you.
B006ON41FC|5.0|DONT LISTEN TO THE ONE STAR RATINGS!!!! this game is amazing. my friends, babysittibg kids, and also me have played this game for hours! its fun to get progressively higher and higher in points to earn a new title. It is seriously FUN!!!
B00513DGIO|2.0|Normally I never finish books that I hate but this was so hugely awful that I felt compelled to complete it with the desperate hope that there was some value in its concusions after a stunningly terrible journey.<br /><br />The early comment that there has never been a society based on barter but many based on debt was a great hook until a few minutes thought made me realise that debt which is not repaid in cash but with some other form of good or service at a later date is simply asymetrical barter. Just because I repay your help in fixing my roof with a bag of corn when the crops come in does not mean that no barter takes place - just that there is a time lag in the transaction. Using debt recording devices such as tally sticks as the author mentions really just emphsises that the debt will be repaid in some form not that barter does not exist.<br /><br />The author's frequent implicite praise of debt forgiveness in ancient societies does not stand up to scrutiny. These debt eliminations were an act of fiat by absolute rulers (tyrants in modern terminology)who sought to create emotional endebtedness by gift giving through the use of eliminating debts incurred to other people. A bit like a political candidate saying \\"vote for me and I will make VISA cancel your outstanding balance. All I demand is your eternal love and gratitude for my gift to you of someone else's money.\\"<br /><br />The end was too awful to desribe. The output of hundreds of pages of slipshod writing and monsterously twisted statement (e.g. Iraq was invaded because is moved to trading oil in Euros not Dollars) was an appallingly plaintive moan along the lines that modern capitalism is terrible and surely we can do better. Just too,too empty and silly a book and a dreadful piece of nonsense. Do not read this book unless you want a theme park quality experience of the mad vision of the world provided by loony academics.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|It is addicting.  The drawback is that the objects break easily and you can't move two things at once. Overall it is a good game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|So addicting I was playing it for so long I only stopped when my kindle fire died it is sooooo. fun!
B005LAIGW8|5.0|I didn't like the original Ghost Rider movie much. It wasn't very exciting, and when the action got going it was too video-game-ish for my tastes. The whole thing had the kind of generic superhero thing going on that comic adaptations have been trying to escape for a while now, and the movie overall was pretty forgettable. It only makes sense that for the sequel, the frachise recieved the perfect antidote-- the guys who directed \\"Crank.\\" This movie is so intentionally outrageous and over-the-top that it ends up being the perfect cocktail of balls-to-the-wall action insanity. Nicolas Cage is completely unrestrained this time around, and if you love yourself a good Nicolas Cage freak-out scene as much as me, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />Do not go in expecting \\"The Dark Knight.\\" This is not a superhero movie, and it is not a serious movie either. It's an over-the-top, violent action movie with a supernatural twist. I'm amazed that it's not R-rated, but however they managed to keep it PG-13 I honestly don't care. If you like movies like Kick Ass or Drive Angry, this movie will be right up your alley. It knows that it's about Nicolas Cage with his head on fire killing people, and as such it knows not to take itself too seriously. It's the perfect mix of bad ass and funny, and the whole thing is presented in a way that feels a lot more raw and unrestrained than its predicessor. You don't even need to see the original movie to get into this one, because they did a great job of recapping the character's origin story in a way that is both funny and to-the-point.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with what the new directors have done with this film, and I think it's exactly what the franchise needed. Even if the critics are trashing it and it might not do well at the box office, I really hope they come back to direct a third one. They clearly have a lot of love for his character, and at the same time they're smart enough to know exactly what it is and don't try to pretend that it's anything more.ything more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game can be difficult to play, but everyone from age 3-80 will be able to play. I absolutely enjoy playing it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun! I liv earning points and earning rewards . earning a certain amount. means u will get better games.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|This movie is one of my new favorites as far as over the top action goes.  The animation is of the highest quality and full of great color and detail, pretty much the reason why I own a blu ray player in the first place.  The movie makes me think of a mashup of the game F-Zero with the animes FLCL and Gurren Lagann, except it was produced by Madhouse and not Gainax.  Imaginative, fast paced, even hilarious at times, and an explosive intensity that you can nearly feel through the cars and in the characters' expressions as they hit the nitro (even more if you have  surround sound).  The English dub is very well done and I thought the actors fit their characters' roles and energy perfectly.  Full of alot of recognizable voices from the industry for those who are familiar with it.  Does have some R rated language throughout, which I love seeing in an animation as long as it fits the mood (which it does in this movie...like a glove).  It's movies like this one that got me into watching animation in the first place with its vivid and quirky sci-fi style.  If you're like me, just watching the trailer will give you an idea if you'll like it or not.  I'm glad that my expectations were met on this one.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|I enjoyed Unkown until the end.  I even enjoyed it close to the end when the truth about Neeson's character (Dr. Martin Harris, in Berlin for a biotechnology conference) comes out, up until the rationale and justification for all this sturm and drang occurs.  Then I got disgusted with the Hollywood agenda.  But more on that at the end of THIS review.  Dr. Martin Harris, in Berlin with his wife, is in an auto accident in a taxi, nearly dies, and comes out of a coma.  At that point he's \\"unknown.\\"  His wife doesn't know him any more and she's with another guy who is Dr. Martin Harris (played by Aiden Quinn), who has all the proper papers!  Neeson's character has absolutely zero papers to prove he is really Dr. Harris.  He then starts running all over Berlin trying to figure out who he is and avoid getting killed by some shady ruthless guys.  The plot is full of suspense and fear.  I like the \\"Urban Euro feel\\" to the movie when Harris, played well by Neeson, befriends Gina the taxi driver (who is an illegal immigrant from Eastern Europe) and runs all over Berlin trying to figure things out and avoiding the bad guys.  He runs into a former member of the Stasi (E. German secret police), which only makes the confusion worse and the action more lethal.  While some may find the movie plot cliched, I liked it and I was rather surprised when I learned the truth near the end, when Dr. Martin Harris finds out who he really is.  (Spoiler alert below!)  OK, now my rant and the part that I hate:  THE CLICHED HOLLYWOOD POLITICAL AGENDA, which comes out at the end.  It's in way, way too many movies!  You see, corporations are evil, because they are greedy sociopathic money makers and they'll kill to get their money, according to Hollywood.  Just look at \\"The Island\\" (where evil corporations make clones for body parts for evil rich), or \\"The Runaway Jury\\".  Maybe the Hwood producers are projecting their own jerkiness on to other corporations, I don't know, but this movie falls into this stupid, false and cliched political agenda at the end.  You see, all the action and killing in the movie is due to ....... Corporations knowing that their profits will go down when a scientist wants to donate the formula for revolutionary bio-engineered corn to the world!!  So they'll murder people to keep up their profits!???  This is such BS and it's so typical of Hollywood films.  You mean to tell me that a charitable scientist, funded by a Arab Prince, is going to help the world with his FREE invention, and thus is targeted by assassination by .... corporations???  You the reader, how many Fortune 500 corporations do you know that directly pay assassins to knock off their competitors (and saying that criminal drug cartels are part of the Fortune 500 is cheating)?  Try ZERO.  That's because they are run by people who either are mostly good, or at least do not want to go to jail.  The premise of Unknown just doesn't ring true.  Look at the world's organized killings & bombings -- a high percent by Islamic terrorists, a high percent by Mafiosias and Drug gangs, and perhaps another big chunk by Communists & dictators; and some in war zones.  But Islamic terrorists and Mexican drug kingpins are OFF LIMITS -- non-PC!! -- to the Hollywood crowd. So the makers of Unknown pin the blame on some corporation that wants to kill the saintly, selfless scientist who is going to save the world for free.  B. S. !  It made all the good plot elements sour for me.  It's a conspiracy theory that rings false, just like the paranoid theory that \\"we would have had electric cars decades ago but the evil oil companies stopped them.\\"  Doesn't wash with me.  The ending ruined the first 99% of the movie for me.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|I saw the original in 1984 and loved it then.  This director's cut is a bit longer and even better.<br /><br />The performances of Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham and Elizabeth Berridge are phenomenally alive and<br />interesting.  I felt as if I knew them in this time and place.<br /><br />Needless to say, but worth saying, the music throughout is Mozart's and is so beautiful and inspiring and<br />delightful, I felt enraptured by it all.<br /><br />The costumes and sets are beautiful.<br /><br />Loved this movie.
B006ON41FC|5.0|awesome game I love it! its like my new favorite game.I love squirrels.best game ever!! love it!  love it!  love it!
B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah is one of my favorites. There is always a song on her cds that anyone can relate to, that's the sign of a good songwriter-singer.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love every thing that this app has to offer. There is no other app like it in the whole entire app store.
B001ED7C58|4.0|The soundtrack was pretty good.  \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" by Muse was my favorite on this.  \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" by Linkin Park came in at a close second.  It was disappointing, however, that it was part of the end credits and didn't have a place in any main part of the movie.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game not only do I love squirrels I love trees and helping wild life sooooo cool and funny nice game.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I find this to be almost perfectly synchronized with the movie.  The mood of the soundtrack reflects that of the movie quite well.  I found the most haunting and almost heartwrenching song on this CD to be \\"No Sound But The Wind.\\"  However, that particular song seems to occupy an unusual spot in the movie somehow.  You wouldn't think it would apply to a scene with Edward and Bella but rather a scene with Jacob and Bella somehow.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it was good. free. you should buy it. writing words to fill out limit. s s x d s s s s. s s s s s s s z s s s s s s s
B003CFBQBW|5.0|This is definitely my overall favorite of the twilight soundtracks thus far.  It has a wide variety of sounds on the CD, giving it a little bit of everything.  From the very heartfelt \\"My Love\\" to the catchy tune of \\"Chop and Change.\\"  However, my favorite tunes on this are \\"Eclipse (All Yours)\\" and \\"With You In My Head.\\"  The entire CD appeals to me rather than just a couple of songs.

B005LAJ212|5.0|Like a combination of the best nightime soaps of the past, the current crop of the best daytime has to offer, and the snarky, humorous asides of recent buzzy teen- and 20-focused dramas, this offers the best of all those combined and more.  The other half clearly has a lot of issues and boy is it fun to watch.  From the lavish settings to the so-bad-they're-great characters like Nolan and Tyler there is someone for everyone to both love and hate.  What a great guilty pleasure!
B006ON41FC|5.0|best game I ever played I am a haslenut I have 10000 nuts on that game. very good game recameded!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|No problems at all with this great cover!  I DO NOT BUY LEATHER and that narrowed my choices quite a bit when looking for a cover of some sort.  Didn't want a case with a zipper but a good cover, protecting the screen and being able to just close it when finished.  This is it exactly!  Nice feel to the cover micro shell, doesn't slide around when carrying or when sitting on my lap, can use the stand without any problem (just don't do it too often).  Definitely worth the price.  A bit fancy with the white and black look.  Easy to place around the Fire - basically just clicks in and stays on!  I am very glad I read the reviews on this cover and decided to go for it.  Try it!  Remember though it is not a zipper type carrying case but it does do a good job as a cover and screen protection for the Kindle Fire.  (Think opening and closing a book).
B006ON41FC|4.0|crazy fun so addictive and something to do when you are board worth it lol. and not confusing at all. costumes are fun
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's easy to use, easy to search and find chapters and versus. I would recommend to friends and i really like the plans as a way to learn more and read the Bible.

0439023513|1.0|I'm writing this review for a book that was listed a YA.  This book seemed less YA but I would have been more disappointed had it been an adult book.  ************spoilers*************  I loved the first two books.  Katniss was an interesting character that had depth and used her mind to figure things out to survive. In the third book she becomes a shell that drifts through the book.  Most of the book she is either drugged, injured or despondent.  Many of the other characters are flat.  The whole \\"special squad\\" she joins screams \\"red shirted ensigns\\" from star trek lore.  I liked the authors style in the first two books.  This time from the siege of the Capitol on, it seems choppy and rushed.  The plot seems less thought out.  A few examples:  1.  If Coin wanted Katniss dead, why didn't they let her die at the end of the book?  The medics blew up so the odds of her surviving serious injury seem a stretch anyway.  2.  Prim's death made no sense.  Young medics that close to the fighting?  It would have made more sense if it had been her mom as a squad medic.  3.  Snow was a ruthless, conniving leader.  That lame attempt at a human shield was the best he could do?  He razed district 12, why not launch a nuke or two?  Putting the kids outside is just a easy way to get Gale's trap sprung.  The trap was better suited for district 2 anyway.  There are many others, especially based around the lame throwaway group that Katriss gets to sneak through the city and yet somehow gets there slower than the main army.  I wasn't hoping for a happy ending but simply one that was in character with Katniss and her journey in the first two books.  The ending seemed contrived and very un\\"young adult.\\"  If the author truly wanted a bleak ending, she should have had Katniss travel quickly, one chapter, with the main army.  Then once they get to the mansion, Coin who wants rid of Katniss, sends her group to kill Snow.  Katniss knocks out Peeta to save him.  On the assualt of the mansion, everyone dies but Katniss.  Katniss reaches Snow but he has killed himself, like Hitler.  Giving Katniss no resolution and a hollow \\"what was the point feeling\\".  Throw in some poison roses surrounding Snow, and Katniss still gets injuries she must always suffer through.  That would leave enough book to learn about how the Republic shakes out and see the aftermath.  It would also allow to find out how Peeta and Katniss work things out.  Or maybe show a better resolution with Katniss and Gale.  I rated book 1 a 4 and book 2 a 5 so I'll rate the series a 3.  It could have a been a thought provoking classic series.
B006ON41FC|3.0|I mean, it's a fun game, and you CAN disable open feint. But, it's hard to control sometimes, and it isn't free ( I got it when there was a sale.). It would definetly be 5 stars otherwise.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is very addicting. My mom let my cousin borrow her kindle, and he plays it with my sister and I, all day long.
1439181780|5.0|This is the most important self-help book I have ever read. It focuses on the importance of setting your sights on what you love and using the power of love to attract whatever it is you are loving. Excellent book!
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This CD was a gift so i was so glad that it arrived before the birthday.....CD was is great condition extremely happy with purchase thank you very much
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I get a warning that I can't watch the disk without an update.  I'll go out on a limb and assume that has something to do with copy protection and not enhancing my movie experience.  Maybe I'll change the review if I can figure out how to actually watch the movie.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I personally think this is a very fun game and you can not just beat it in one day so it has long lasting fun.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is adorable and addicting!! its one of the best games I have ever played:) have fun when you get.it and keep track of the time because you will lose track playing ths!

B000BNX3B4|4.0|I caught this on WE the other night. Lane is doing her normal unkempt, middle aged depression role, and Cusack was actually really likeable. The large family was funny as well, and Stockard Channing provided a some comic relief. It was a bit uneven, and it was allowed to unfold not really in a perfect way but kind of as if it was really life happening. This makes for some really boring parts though. Not a terrible movie, not a great one, but one somewhere between Ok and likeable. Watch if you are looking for something light.
0307959856|5.0|excellent condition. book club book. first part of the book was wordy and tedious.  when there was more dialogue it was more interesting. Would make a better film.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This movie is a great movie for a man to get back to being a \\"real man\\". Its also a great family movie for all, and it will touch you in your inner soul. In my opinion one of the best films I've saw in a long while. This will make you think about whats important.
0061537969|5.0|Enzo's character is genuinely and poignantly conveyed in this story.  His thoughts and actions make me think how lucky we all are to have animals in our lives, and how our pets are an extension of our own families.  I cried happy tears all the way through the last chapter!
B004XQO90O|3.0|Well - the movie grabs you right off the bat. Very interesting and exciting - some good acting and nice explosions... and while I can totally go along with alternate universes and even go so far as to see somehow someone figuring out how to wire someones brain back to an incident that happened like in this movie, I just don't see that it could've made a difference in enough time to have stopped the 2nd major bombing - much too much time had passed by the time he got it figured out.  And, while it's nice that he was able to finally effect the outcome of the train bombing to a happier ending...its not real in this universe so it doesn't really matter - does it? The logic of it all (or non-logic, whichever it may be) - including the email the woman controller gets - was just \\"not right\\" and so it was a little disappointing and is one I don't think I'd care to watch again.  It's also not one I'd say \\"oh you should see that!\\" to anyone.<br /><br />It's ok (you probably won't hate it) - and for what it was, it was well done...I just think the story is flawed.  I can see the guys liking this one a lot more than the women.<br /><br />It was really nice to see Michelle Monaghan in this movie - she's a wonderful actress and very easy to watch. I don't know why she isn't in more movies.  (Hint hint Hollywood)
B0000640SB|5.0|I had this in VHS version and wanted to update before I wore out the tape.  This is one movie I watch multiple times per year.  Great acting and special effects.  Can't wait for #3 (already have #2 in DVD).  I purchased this from an outside vendor and the product arrived quickly and in excellent quality.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is fun but may be challenging for younger ones I am very happy with this game and think you should buy it
B0045JEPXU|5.0|I never listened or even heard of this Artist until I started surfing YouTube. Then I cam across him and WOW, I love him. The songs on this CD are great, some songs use strong language so I would not recommend that you play it around children but for me, I rock with it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Trying to complete all of the goals is really fun and cool. Also, it has a lot of creative costumes to wear.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Good Game, fun for my kids. Not overly big in terms of memory usage, good visually. Overall, an entertaining game for all ages.
B002BWP49C|1.0|Five Stars???  People actually gave this movie five stars???  What film were they watching?  The is the first movie, in my memory, that made me cringe because it was so campy. I guess that's to be expected considering how bad the book was.  Who was the brain trust that thought a hack writer like Stephenie Meyer would make a good producer? If she had been a good producer, she would have had the studio hire Catherine Hardwicke to direct.  At least Hardwicke kept the story moving along in the original film.  If Bill Condon had been smart, he would have let them use the name Alan Smithee on the credits.  (Look it up.)  The biggest problem with Breaking Dawn is there isn't enough material in the entire book to make one movie, let alone two. The dialogue is bad; the story is weak; and the teenage angst factor has been overplayed to the __nth degree. Kristen Stewart is a good actor but you'd never know it from watching this ilk.  I'm grateful that I didn't pay money to see this in the theater, and even more grateful that I didn't pay for the DVD.  Too bad I still had to pay to watch it on pay per view.  Save your money.  If you really want this DVD, wait for it to hit the discount rack.  I'm sure you won't have to wait long.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This app is awesome u should download it. Its a little frusturating but practice makes perfect. I got all the way to the winter nuts! Awesome!!!!!:-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|nice game for basic solitaire.  I haven't had any issues. . . . . . . . . . .

B004EBUXSA|5.0|Couldn't be happier with this purchase and associated purchases made via Amazon for my gaming PC build.  Prices were better than shopping local.

I recommend this product and once again am extremely satisfied with Amazon's virtual store. Easiest way to window shop, compare and plan.

1451648537|4.0|When Steve Jobs passed away last October, the overwhelming media attention seemed a trifling bit too much to me. Sure, it's always sad when someone in a position of prominence in our society passes (and as someone who has known both cancer survivors and victims, I can say that any loss due to cancer is always tragic, no matter the person's relative worth to society at large), but apart from my iPod and the Mac computers I have vague memories of us using in school, I couldn't say that his life was any more impactful to me than anyone else's. In short, I didn't get what all the hype was about.<br /><br />I'm still not sure that I do, but Walter Issacson's masterful biography of the late Apple founder goes a long way towards pointing out why he mattered. Issacson had unprecedented access to the mastermind of the iPod, iPhone, and Mac computers over the course of what would be Jobs' last few years, but the biography is in no sense \\"authorized\\" by Jobs. It paints a fully-rounded portrait of an overachiever who could alienate just as well as he could inspire, a visionary whose sight could be hindered by his own biases, and a businessman who failed in many ways to connect with the people closest to him, despite his ability to connect the world.<br /><br />Jobs was an adoptee who never knew his real father or sought him out (Issacson reveals that Jobs' father actually owned a restaurant that Jobs and his creative team frequented, though the two never knew it at the time), and that distinction drove his life, giving him a sense that the normal rules of polite society never applied to him (this would bruise many egos around him, but it would also drive those he managed to push themselves beyond their possible boundaries). Jobs was never satisfied just to make a profit; he wanted to create, and create he did. While Issacson makes clear that Jobs was more of a salesman than a nuts-and-bolts engineer, without him Apple would never have been able to sell the world on the technology that has so come to dominate our lives. Jobs was a visionary like Henry Ford before him (though thankfully minus the anti-Semitic leanings of America's premier auto maker).

B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Worth 5 stars before update. Now when I open it on kindlefire it only brings me to the menu. Then, when I choose my level it just force closes. Really disappointed with the update. PLEASE FIX IT!!!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Though I'm loathe to endorse a series that glorifies a serial killer, Dexter has a twist that made the premise palatable enough for me to get over an initial aversion to a niggling fear that shows of this nature are adding to societies desensitization to true horror. All I can say is it's beautiful and fun to watch, and addictive. The very first episode isn't great but they weed out unnecessary trivia (like the pork sandwiches) and focus more on plot development in no time at all. I couldn't stop watching it.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|When people hear the term \\"science fiction\\" they immediately think of an adventure genre, like fantasy or westerns, with an outer space setting. There is nothing wrong with such movies that set out primarily to entertain, and I enjoy them as much as anyone else. But largely ignored since the 1960s, the heyday of social consciousness and space exploration, is the sub-genre of hard science fiction. Hard SF focuses as much on the technical details of the \\"science\\" aspect (often ignored to a degree of outright implausibility in outer space adventure stories) while at the same time using the concepts of exploration and technological innovation to ask poignant philosophical questions about the human condition.<br /><br />Roger Ebert called the movie Moon \\"a superior example of that threatened genre, hard science-fiction,\\" and I couldn't agree more. The movie was directed by Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie, and it's masterful. I've watched it five times now and its mind-bending premise addresses one of the most sensitive scientific advances of our time, and explores the steep impact such innovation has on the very definition of what we consider human.<br /><br />I don't want to go into too much detail about the plot for fear of giving too much away.  The basic premise is simple.  A man named Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is stationed on the Moon for the purposes of monitoring a Helium-3 refinery.  He is the only person manning the station.  His only companion is a robot named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey).  Due to a communications tower failure, he can only communicate with his wife and daughter, and his employers, on a time delay message delivery system.  This causes extreme isolation for Sam.  He looks forward to the end of his three-year stint on the lunar base, but suffering from exhaustion he begins to experience hallucinations and ultimately crashes in an accident.  Sam awakens some time later and is restricted to the base by Gerty in order to recover from his injuries.  However, Sam eventually manages to convince Gerty to let him out of the base, and Sam returns to investigate the crash site where he discovers someone eerily familiar.<br /><br />It is rare to find a film in the genre these days that elicits the type of emotional reactions that are usually reserved for fine drama.  There is nothing wrong with Star Wars, the Fifth Element, or Avatar.  Action-oriented science fiction films, despite their decided lack of emphasis on actual science, are entertaining and can impart lessons in their own right. However, they often sacrifice poignancy and aesthetic quality for the sake of box office receipts.  2001: A Space Odyssey is, in my humble opinion, the finest science fiction film of the 20th Century.  Moon quite obviously was inspired by, and follows in, the Kubrick tradition, and it does not disappoint.  This is the greatest science fiction movie of this century thus far.
1466401885|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite books. I didn't want it to end, so I made myself put it down half way so I didn't read it all in one night. It is so beautifully written and I have already read it twice now in one week. Jamie has a way of making you connect with the characters, their feelings and make you want more!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good weather app. Would have given 5 stars if it told the percentage of rain likely. Other than that I'm pleased.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a pretty good game to pass time with. I downloaded it, got rid of it, and then gave it another chance and.I'm glad I did.
B005LAIGP0|4.0|The movie hits on all the classic stereotypes of a ghost story. There is a haunted mansion in an isolated marsh thick with fog. There is a past of a haunted suicide and a recent will. The village has a secret. The house has ghostly images, squeaks, creaks, whispers, things that move on their own, and a raven that enters it.<br /><br />Our main character has a wife who has died in child birth and for some undisclosed reason this is his \\"last chance\\" with his firm so he just can't walk away. In the beginning, Radcliffe wears his hair down over his forehead leading me to suspect he really does have a permanent mark in the shape of a lightning bolt.<br /><br />There is a mystery that is supposed to draw you in, but having seen so many clich&eacute;s you wonder if this film will offer you anything new.<br /><br />As the poorly developed Arthur (Daniel Radcliffe) sorts through the papers in the house he uncovers letters which sheds some light unto the situation, and we get to see his bolt free forehead. Radcliffe was neither an asset nor a liability. His agent did him well, but I thought he mustered more fear and terror as that Potter guy in the late sequels than he did in this film. He seems to have trouble with convincing facial expressions.<br /><br />The strength of the film is in how well it utilizes all those haunted mansion clich&eacute;s, the lighting...or lack of it, and the detailing of the era. Arthur is played as a rather dull character. There are things that happen to him which would have made me leap out of skin and run out the house, yet he does very little. Also Arthur is quiet as he encounters the unknown, perhaps done to build up the scare factor, but I wonder how that would have worked with a character who talks to the ghost while searching about, maybe with a comical line or two taken from \\"Hold That Ghost\\" or someone like Joe Pesci swearing obscenities at it.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Safe for the kids to watch on a foggy night if you want to scare the bejesus out of them.want to scare the bejesus out of them.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is great. you basically get to control a flying squrrel and collect nuts. its really addictive and super fun! glad I got it.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|I have seen the film 3 times already and loved it.  Michelle Williams brings the kind of attention to a feminist that any woman would be thankful to have.  Marilyn Monroe was much more than a sex symbol she a symbol of an orphan who went on to become of the most successful and diverse actresses of her time and all time.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|enjoy finding some of my younger memories....loved the dvd and soundtrack....dvd was as described and the service was fast....looking forward to more
B003ASLJRW|4.0|This is Eastwood's second supernatural Western, and it's one of his best Westerns. After a mining community is attacked by an armed mob of competitors, 15-year old Megan buries her beloved dog, a casualty of the attack, and prays for a miracle. That next day, a preacher mysteriously appears and immediately establishes himself as a venging angel. After roughing up a bunch of the town's mob he moves in with the miners and is seen changing his clothes, revealing the scars of six wounds--wounds which obviously would be non-survivable. He also appears in camp on a pale horse, just as Megan is reading from the book of Revelation: \\"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death. And Hell followed close behind.\\" (Rev. 6)<br /><br />The movie is well done and is a keeper.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is awesome. Although it automaticly connects to Open Feint whitch is kinda irritating but, other than that it's great!
B006ON41FC|4.0|Despite all the people who are grumpy over the game's OpenFeint policy, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did because it is quite enjoyable.  The mini-achievements that it tempts you with provide a fun challenge and incentive to keep coming back for one more run.  I don't really get why people are so uptight about OpenFeint, anyway. I'd be willing to bet the majority of people complaining about OpenFeint have a Facebook account, so I can't believe that they're really that worried about their personal data.  While it is probably not the best policy for any game to automatically opt you in to OpenFeint, it can be turned off and you can always delete your account permanently if you want.  It would be nice if people would rate games on their true merit rather than arbitrarily giving 1 star reviews just because of something they don't agree with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I believe in the Lord and his word. This helps me grow in God and learn verses. Recently I've ben looking though Psalm 119. This app has helped me memorize Psalm 119:1-10. I believe I will memorize a lot of verses with this app

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I was going to buy this album on Amazon as soon as I heard the title track Born To Die, for some reason I was hesitant. I saw it at Target for 8 bucks and bought it. I was so intoxicated by the album and have been infatuated ever since. I love every song. This is a must buy, and definately album of the year. Lana has a very sensual voice that sounds like a dream from the old days. Listening to her feels like a warm summer day on the beach in the 60's.  Just make sure to get the deluxe version which features 2 additional songs. Lana&lt;3

0061733199|5.0|If you have one book, this should be it.<br /><br />All you need to know and more, in this relatively small handbook. The size of the book should be a huge selling point; it's about an inch thick so it doesn't take up much room at all.<br /><br />The chapters are easy to navigate so you can quickly find what you're looking for.<br /><br />My only complaint: Make a more waterproof version. I ordered the paperback and was disappointed that the pages aren't laminated. That would make this book so much more practical.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is an addicting game for people who loves animals. I love this game and it's awesome 3D graphics. This game was far beyond my expections.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've sharpened axes, knives, machetes, scissors, and even rotary blades with this thing.<br />A few features that make this unique:<br />(1) A hole in the frame that can be used for a strap.<br />(2) The diamond rat-tail file that can be used for detailing or serated blades.<br />(3) Lightweight, compact design. You can easily forget that it's in your pocket.
B006ON41FC|5.0|You can turn off OF inside settings when you log into OF.  This game is fun so far on my kindle fire. I like the goals they set. Plus great graffix. I hope you guys that gave it 1 star atleast played the game. Shame on you if you didn't.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I think it's safe to say that most Van Halen fans had reasonable expectations for this album, prior to it's release.  No one expected a true return to glory, but we all hoped it would be good.<br /><br />It's not good.  It's fantastic!<br /><br />Seriously, play this album a few times, and you'll wonder why these guys didn't find a way to make more music together over the past 25 years.
B000002VCQ|5.0|This is the epic first album from Whitney Houston released in 1985.I've always thought this was her best work because the song structures were simple and it helped to launch her career into new heights.This album contains the early hits such as &#34;saving all my love for you&#34; &#34;all at once&#34; &#34;greatest love of all&#34; and the infectious,&#34;how will I know&#34; with it's signature opening synth line is my favorite Whitney Houston song.It's sort of like a marriage proposal song in an indirect way.This album also has the famous duets with Jermaine Jackson and Teddy Pendergrass which sounded good.The other songs were surprisingly good especially the opening song,&#34;you give good love&#34; which gets the album off to a good start and &#34;thinking about you&#34; and &#34;someone for me&#34; also sounded catchy as well.Overall,this album made for some pleasant listening.<br /><br />The songs were creative,the melodies were refreshing,the lyrics were inspiring and Whitney's voice sounds better than ever and really hits<br /> the high notes to perfection.My only criticism was the duet &#34;hold me&#34; got a bit long and the verses were repetitive but that was not unusual given the time period the album was made but the song was still good.There are no fillers,every song is fun to listen to in its own way.Other albums made after this one were good,but this was a sentimental favorite with me because it captures Whitney at the top of her game.If you were to own just one album from her,this is a true masterpiece that I would highly recommend.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is so cool. I love this game. evory should love it its a really fun game. This game is the best.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I bought this to replace a Timex automatic watch that quit working about a year and a half after purchase, and was out of warranty.  Initially I was concerned about the lack to ability to wind it (Timex watch had that feature), but I have left this watch on my nightstand every night for at least 8-9 hours and it has never run out of power.  I wear the watch all day, and am generally not incredibly active while wearing it - most of my day is spent in front of a computer.  The watch itself looks great - very clear and sharp face, easy to read.  I have had many compliments on it.  Only negative, from my perspective, is the band - does not look very good on you if you have pale skin.  I replaced it with a dark brown leather band and it accents nicely.  As others have reported you will have to slightly adjust once a week - it tends to get a minute or two ahead of the time, but not a big deal for me.  Highly recommended.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is so fun to play i am added to it i just cant stop. i do wish you could move the device insted of the buttons. :)
B0042EJD8A|1.0|WATCH Fracknation for the truth. Josh Fox is scum; an evil person.<br />This film deals with a situation, sometimes just the reality, but basically a HYPE intended to fulfill the Democrat Party's need for more votes and the typical fear that cajoles the &#34;ignorant&#34; into compliance. This IS a &#34;real review&#34;. Beware the Anti-American Liberal Agenda. The Democrats are bringing America to its knees. Who &#34;owns&#34; this place anyway!? Saudis? A muslim President in the White House doing NOTHING to create jobs, etc. &#34;Wake up, sleeper! Rise from the dead.&#34;
B006ON41FC|1.0|going nuts.  I really liked this app when I first started, however on day 3 not so much you only can work toward 3 goals at a time and the same map gets old I guess I'm just not that good because I've been trying to accomplish the 15 gold nut goal and just can't now there are 2 goals on my list to do it and now I'm no longer interested.  sorry squirrel your cool and cute but controls are tight and all you do is frustrate the tar out of me.  if I felt like I was accomplishing some I would still play.  but I only have like 7gb of empty space guess your getting uninstalled to make room for more worthwhile apps.
B00005614M|4.0|I find myself skipping over \\"Darn That Dream\\" pretty much every time. The cheesy vocal just blows and takes what could have been a five-star album down a star based on its inclusion. Otherwise, this is pretty great stuff and an essential part of anyone's Miles Davis collection.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is cool but they should add more power up things.and different directions to move but rather then that it was cool
0307593312|4.0|The reviews for this novel are all over the board.  Some are from long time fans of Murakami and others are from first timers, and the reviews from both of these groups also range across the board.  I fit into the second category.  This is my first exposure to Murakami, and I'm not quite sure how I feel.  I debated long and hard whether to give four or five stars.  I finally decided to go with four stars, primarily because of the story.  The writing, in my opinion, is superb.  Having read this novel I am now having a hard time getting into other novels I had lined up to follow this one, simply because I keep wanting them to read as well as this one does, but they fall short.  We get an in depth view of the three main characters of the novel, very in depth, but the writing is so great that you are compelled to read on and even to care about the characters.  I actually ended up liking Ushikawa more than Aomame or Tengo.  Ushikawa started out as being a very unsavory character, even a villain.  But as you got to know him, through the in depth review of his internal thought process, which Murakami is so good at, you slowly gain a different perspective.  Like Fuka-Eri, you can pity him.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed the writing, the story was a little hard to take.  Maybe I felt this way because it was my first experience with Murakami, and I do not yet appreciate what he may be bring to convey.  It is not a particularly intriguing story.  When I tried to tell the story of the novel to others, I faltered, finding myself unable to keep a straight face, as what came out of my mouth (not little people) was too bizarre to even sound like a story, so I gave up.  The writing, however, kept me going.  Just to give a couple of examples of what appealed to me in this novel:  From a chapter on Aomame:  \\"She kept a tight grip on the cold metal pipe that served as a handrail, lowering herself a step at a time, backward, and stopping now and then to brush aside the stray hair hanging down her forehead and to adjust the position of the shoulder bag slung diagonally across her chest.\\"  From a chapter on Tengo:  \\"There was a simple, rapidly spoken announcement that the train would soon depart, and the train doors rumbled closed, sending an outsized shudder through the train as if some huge, ancient animal were waking itself from a long sleep.\\"  These are sentences that cause one to linger over them, savor them and even come back to later and ponder.  Even simple sentences were compelling:  \\"The days flowed by smoothly, regularly, uneventfully.\\"  To my mind it takes huge effort to be able to compose sentences like these, and there are many in this work.  I come down on the side of recommending the book, not because of the story, although it sometimes impels you on, but because of the beautiful writing.  Because of that I will be looking to pick up my second effort at reading a Murakami novel.

B0013KTGAG|4.0|No it wasn't the ending, the whole story was a bit rushed, Danny Boyle clearly shows his influence from 2001, Alien, and Solaris, but he should've also taken note that those movies take a bit longer to develop their stories, which is exactly what Sunshine needed to do. Taking some time to develop some of the characters such as Harvey or Corazon would've made their characters more interesting, Harvey just comes off as a selfish prick when it's unexplained he's homesick and misses his family.<br /><br />Prettymuch all of the stuff in it is plausible, such as the Q-ball being the reason the sun is dying or hell even Pinbacker's descent into madness, Boyle was trying to make a film like Apocalypse Now in space but it also looks like the production company rushed the film along and tried packaging it along as some space adventure film when it was a lot more than that.

I finally got this case for Valentine's day and I can't tell you enough how much I love it! I was instantly drawn to the strap that either held the cover shut or held it open. It's nice to be able to secure it either way. I also like how \\"slick\\" it makes my Kindle look. I have NO complaints what so ever.

0813498023|5.0|GGS is a fantastic book. It gives insights into the development of human cultures around the world in a way that's both easy to understand and interesting. I'm a big history buff and more than once I've wondered why some great civilizations fell apart or never rose to the heights their potential seems to promise. While GGS can't provide a blanket answer to such questions, it does a wonderful job of explaining factors that make some civilizations work and others to fail. The majority of which I'd never even considered but Diamond lays out his reasoning in a way that is simple but effective.  The berth of this book makes going into details difficult. But I did feel that Diamond did a wonderful job in presenting a lot of big ideas in such a way that any intelligent layperson could understand them and his reasoning. He only uses charts and graphs when they're really the most effective way to show what he's talking about. Too much of that sort of thing can make a book seem dusty and drive off normal readers.  I don't think I can really add all that much to the praise that has been given this book already. I can only say that I found it one of the most insightful reads I've had in years and that I'd urge anyone with an interest in history to read it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The reading plans are perfect!  I love being able to read on the go &amp; keep track of what I have read.
1591396190|4.0|Blue Ocean Strategy really opened my eyes to a new way of looking at strategy.  Although each of the companies highlighted in the book were not new information for me, I had never thought about what they've accomplished in terms of a Blue Ocean Strategy.  This book takes something that any business person knows intuitively and puts it into a concrete methodology that can be applied in your own business.  One such methodology is the Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create grid.  Since reading that chapter, I've been applying the grid to nearly everything I've come across.  It is a great way to have a fresh look at just about every aspect of your business.  Look at your competition and identify what they are doing that can be completely eliminated without damaging your value to customers.  For Southwest Airlines, it was seat assignment.  Then look at what you can reduce that will set you apart.  Again, for Southwest, it was meals.  Now, although serving peanuts instead of a full meal is common-place today, when Southwest started doing it, it was a completely new idea.  Next, look at what you can raise.  What is your competition doing that you can do better, but that will also raise the value for your customers?  For Southwest, it was the level of service.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I bought this because I wanted to make sure I had a case when my iPhone 4S arrived from Verizon.  It's still on and the iLuv case just sits there.  The screen protector installed easily and is transparent.  I didn't even have the plastic bubble remover card and just used a credit card from my wallet.  The only thing I don't like is the swirly back, but my phone never really is face down to see it.  The material is soft to the touch which is why i probably haven't switched to the hard case.  With it stretched tightly over the iPhone, the fit is great and the case only flexes if you pull on the edges of the open sides on top.  I think I got it for $2 off on an Amazon special, but I think it is definitely worth the full price.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The story line and artifact collection are nice touches. Game play is nicely taught.  Overall an excellent small game for mobile devices.
0393316041|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book as much in a long time.  Grab a copy before it goes out of print.  Acutally, it's going so well it may take a while to disappear.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Word of God at your finger tips! tons of translations to chose from and absolutely User friendly! I'd reccommend this App to everyone!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was free this weekend but I knew I couldn't read just one so I bought the omnibus.  WOW!  I couldn't put it down -- I carried my iPad around all day so I could keep on reading.  When I finished I bought 3 more of Hugh Howey's books.  This was truly one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Well written (and thankfully well edited), this spiral into the silo is both touching and heart-pounding.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the best Bible app you will find.  I love the flexible reading plans, which help to easily incorporate reading scripture into each day.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This was one incredible performance, and I was overwhelmed by the beauty and intensity of the performances, and the entire fantastic production!  The ending with Andrew Lloyd Webber coming onstage and introducing again the original London company, with Sarah Brighton singing with past Phantoms, and then being joined by Michael Crawford, took my breath away.  I highly recommend this production to own, for you will watch it over and over!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so fun.it has all the games I love.its just like the one on your Ds ..............but so much better.download it its amazing.
1932735410|5.0|A must buy book for all PMP aspirants. I agree, the tone is a bit negative, but who cares if you get such excellent tricks/trades/PMISMs and situational exercises?  Ahirjoy Biswas, PMP
B0063IH60K|4.0|easy interface. only negative is I cant find any option to shuffle by 3, which is traditionally how the game begins.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|this help a lot with finding the strongest and best wifi out there and that's why I recommend this to many people ;) have fun with it

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I got mahong artifacts free on the app of the day. if everybody would have waited longer, nobody would have had to pay 5dollars for it.
B000JML7EC|5.0|Amazon makes it great to enjoy the classics on Kindle.  Treasure Island was my first e-book on my Kindle that I received at Christmas.  First, let me comment on the fact that there are numerous FREE e-books for your Kindle; this includes such classics such as Treasure Island.  Second, I had long forgotten how enjoyable are the classics of literature of which Treasure Island is one.  I greatly enjoyed what I believe is the greatest pirate story every written.  If you compare all of the modern pirate stories and especially the movies you can readily see that they are based on Treasure Island.<br /><br />Sometimes old is better than new and this is the case with the Kindle version of Treasure Island or in fact the hard copy as well.  15 men on a dead man's chest, yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|The film spoofs 1950's musicals. The Muppets must raise 10 million dollars or lose their old studio and trade name. Like old 50's musicals, the plot has holes big enough to drive a truck through. The music was great. Numerous stars appeared in the movie and hammed it up. The cameos kept me guessing. While this is a kid's movie, much of the humor is directed toward an older generation. For instance, Emily Blunt who was in \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" was Miss Piggy's receptionist at her Paris larger size fashion office. Mickey Rooney appears in the small town song and dance.<br /><br />This is the typical Muppet humor with the numerous asides and unexpected turns. Amy Adams and Jason Segel, the 2 human stars were less than stellar, but then again they were mostly playing a straight man for Muppets. If you loved the Muppets before, you'll love them again.
0985081821|5.0|This was a great read from the very first page. I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters, Sophia and Charles.  You could relate to them and even the fanatical people in their lives. It makes you question the sanity and the world as you know it around you. At each page I wanted to know more. I really love the ingenious twist on a familiar story and I couldn't predict where the next turn would be. It was if the author has a deeper perception of the universe and the story is the way to open our eyes.  It was an adventure and I can't wait for the next book to see where it leads.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|The action/drama/mystery film opens with a quick character build up of the multifaceted CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). He operates a safe house with nobody in it. He wants a European field assignment, but lacks department seniority.<br /><br />The movie switches to Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) obtaining an embarrassing electronic file from the MI6 in South Africa. \\"Frost\\", because he is cold. Denzel uses his expected savvy to escape. He is a rogue super agent who free lances, buying and selling information. In order to escape the bad guys, Tobin surrenders to the CIA. Now the questions are: Was this his original plan? What is on the file?<br /><br />Tobin is taken to our aforesaid safe house for intense interrogation.<br /><br />I loved the opening of the interrogation scene. The interrogator says, \\"I'm here to advise you of your rights. You're being held under national security order 600 which means you have none.\\"<br /><br />Frost is too important of a person and the top secret safe house comes under attack. The young low level highly trained Matt Weston is now on the run with a man who is a master manipulator of people. To our list of unanswered questions we now add, \\"Who is the mole?\\"<br /><br />Ryan and Washington give us excellent performances. It had elements of the Bourne series that made this story interesting, but it doesn't quite measure up to that film. Cliche ending. I would say if you are a fan of the trilogy, check this one out.<br /><br />Multiple chase scenes, torture, killings, shoot outs, minor \\"roof top\\" jumping, car wreaks without explosions.<br /><br />1 f-Bomb, no sex, no nudity. Rated R for violence.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|one of the best Mahjong games I've seen and played in a long time. I bought it as FAOTD so ads on 1st screen don't bother me; if I had paid $5.00 for this app, the ads would have brought my rating down to four stars... I just think developers would've been smarter to have a button option to go find other games by G5 rather than force thrum it when you've paid for an app.  That said, the graphics are beautiful, gameplay is smooth and challenging without being impossible. The adventure comic strip isn't adding much to the game but doesn't take anything away either. it reminds me of the old soap opera detective comic strips from the funny pages... not funny, never actually completes a story, but you read it anyway.  absolutely worth a free download, and if you like mahjong, it's a beautifully done paid app.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game. Will share with family and friends. I like the detailed graffics. Keep making games like this one. Thank you.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Good App! I am frequently out of town. I like the ability to set several locations.  With a touch I can check the weather in another place.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its very fun lots of games to chose from but some games you have to buy using points you win from the games you play
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great relaxing fun.  Very hard to stop playing. Wonderful way to pass time.  Each level has something to keep you going.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|So being new to the whole game. Its pretty easy to pick up and fun to play. It seems a bit easy but I'm sure it gets tougher. I actually got this free using the Amazon App of the Day. I played it on My Kindle Fire and it looks nice but not fully optimized for tablets. I can't say that its worth 4.99 but you wont feel ripped off at that price either.
0439023548|5.0|Got the book quickly and was very satisfied with the condition of the book. Pleased with my experience. Will definitely use Amazon again soon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so fun there is no problems with this game love it there are so many fun games I would recomemd this game
B002G1K82Q|5.0|This is a great movie for beatle fans, and people who are familiar with the turmoil of the late 1960's.  Centers around the war protests, music of the era, and a love story thrown in.  I rented it, loved it so much I had to buy the thing.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This is one of those movies that is hard to explain and best to just see yourself. I really liked it, but I like crazy movies. It will not be for a lot of people. It is disturbing. It has amazing camera action and you may feel \\"sea sick\\" watching the camera movement. Noe said he liked Gerald Kargl's film Angst(Fear)1983. I saw that movie first and it is one of my favorites and can really see how Noe took off from there. I am going to watch a couple more of Noe's films (I Stand Alone and Void) and looking forward to it. I am now a Noe fan.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Brings a little excitement to an already popular game, great job! You just want to keep playing and not put it down. Works great on my Motorola ATRIX.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|if you like mahjong this is fun one with a twist...  great visuals and easy to play... cool sounds... try it!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Voices/accents have been changed<br />Ending is changed<br />a whole bunch of things just arent... right.<br />If youre buying this cuz youre expecting the original movies like the box suggests, then dont buy this.<br />If you want Lucas's revision of the movies to better match the new movies from the 90's then go ahead and get this.<br />Its up to you.<br />I happen to like the REAL Originals from the 70's.<br />Lucas should really listen to his fans (you know... the people who gave him his fortune), and supply us with the REAL versions like so many thousands of people have been requesting.
B006NFKUF6|4.0|Rwow wow wow good games fast paced game this is a four star game to me I like but to much talking in there
B0067Q42BY|2.0|The text is tiny and the intro is unreadable.  Also, the music begins to play before you have a chance to turn it off.  Finally, the objective is not to clear the board, but rather the much easier task of clearing two specific &quot;gold&quot; tiles.  This is not worth paying for, the free stuff is better.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I wanted this for my tackle box because it is small and I can bring it on the river while fly fishing. Works as a hook sharpener too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Word of GOD (JESUS) is an invaluable tool. The layout of this app is awesome. The only downfall is you you need a service connection to use. Try out MySword. Their only downfall is not having NIV.
B006ZEEHQS|1.0|What a disappointment,  all of the best parts were in the trailer.  We were tempted to end the movie before watching all of it, it was that bad!  Lots of dialogue that seemed to do no where. We should have read some of the other reviews before watching this movie!  We hoping for something like \\"The Tourist\\" so you can imagine the disappointment.
B006UG90RM|1.0|Even though I'm a long time Van Halen fan I didn't have any expectations for this CD in light of recent vintage rockers putting out new material. So I bought this CD and listened to it without having heard any tracks before hand. I have to say that this is the worst Van Halen CD by far. David Lee and Eddie still have their skills from a technical standpoint but there are no real songs on this album. It's also strange hearing the backing melodies done by Roth instead of Michael Anthony. I really didn't know what to expect from the album and I was sorely disappointed, even the solos sound reminiscent of past Roth Era guitar solos without actually sounding original. I'm just going to listen to the old stuff as this new album doesn't hold a candle to anything they've ever done. In fact, if a new band came out with this material I'd have a hard time believing that they'd ever be signed. How'd this get so many 5 star reviews?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|got this app for the kindle fire and its awesome!!! I got it as the free paid app of the day
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game has an interesting twist to the standard Mahjong tile game.  I have only played a few levels but seems to work well and has a nice sound track to accompany the play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to just pull out my bible anywhere I am a begin reading. I also enjoy the different reading plans.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|I don't care if you made other apps, stop spamming your garbage ads in a PAID app.  EVERY TIME you start this app you must first wade through the devs ads for other apps they make before you can play.  There is the first screen which nags you to buy the other stuff they make, you then have to click ok to continue, once you finally get to the main screen there is another nag button flashing about their other apps.  You can't disable any of that crap so you have to jump through the ad hoop before even getting to the point of playing.  The second button on the main screen is enough, you don't need a damn ad ridden splash screen first before the game starts forcing people to click continue.  This is a PAID app, stop nagging people with your crap ads!  The game is well done but the ads are enough to make me stick with &quot;Random Mahjong&quot; instead.  Its too bad, I was going to buy this and part 2 but glad I didn't and won't be buying anything from this ad spamming dev.  ONE simple (non blinking or intrusive) button on the main app page linking to your other apps is enough, this is just ad overkill.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|when will Amazon stop with the endless rash of poor apps.should be renamed free crap of the day .oh well maybe tomorrow .
B0034G4OUY|5.0|Great action movie. I love just about anything with the rock in it. Definitively one of my favorites to watch.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a fun version of Mahjong. Not boring like some of the others. So glad I downloaded it! I'm sure I will be playing for hours!
B006ON41FC|4.0|if you want an fun way to pay .99 get this app because its gust fun fun fun fun for everyone!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is fun, even though some games in it are hard.  that's half the fun of it.  I'm glad I found it.
B0073PZIYI|2.0|Good concept but poorly executed. Even the best efforts of Seyfried and Timberlake could not breath life into this tired script.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|1Password is the premier desktop password database on Macintosh and Windows.  Sync across devices via Dropbox is seamless. I use it on my Macs, PC, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, and now newly purchased Kindle Fire.  Having login info stored securely and safely, yet easily accessible, is critical.  That's what 1Password provides.  Tech support is also very responsive and professional.  Don't let the negative review (Actual cost $50.00) deter you. They didn't realize that it does require at least one copy of 1Password, as it is a read only app on the Android platform.  If you already own 1Password, this extends that software to your Android device. And it's free!
B0066W1AZK|2.0|the app is pretty good, except. for the fact that 2 games out of three it has called stalemate. the most recent time, I had two queens and a rook and was two moves away from a definite checkmate. other times, it will call threefold repitition when it is clearly not. it is honestly a sore loser because it doesn't let you win. look elsewhere for a better programmed app if you ever want to win.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great game. Very well designed.  WELL above average. Like it so much. Keep up! More free games please.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|this app is amazing. it takes a little getting used to to figure it out, learning curve, etc. it's worth it though!
B006ON41FC|5.0|pretty entertaining. I like the goals and the store to purchase the various powers. it would be nice if you could get a better description of the how tos. overall a good game though-
B006OAB3ME|4.0|This collection of well-chosen standards is a class project from start to finish. McCartney's best decision was enlisting Diana Krall and her band to back him - as well as Tommy LiPuma to produce. The authentic small-combo jazz feel puts this head and shoulders above some famous rocker-turned-crooner efforts (sorry Rod). But more to the point, McCartney doesn't really \\"croon\\" here so much as apply his familiar singing style to these old songs. There's no hint of Sinatra or Dino in his approach. It seems he must have been keenly aware of his own vocal limitations at this late point in his career. While no one would dream of calling his interpretations definitive for any of these songs, McCartney put a lot of obvious effort into carefully and accurately delivering these complex melodies. What he may lack in command and confidence in this style he compensates for with respect for the material.  The accompaniment by Krall and company is first rate. The album is dominated by ballads and could have benefited greatly from a few more uptempo numbers. Or even one truly uptempo number, for that matter. \\"My Very Good Friend the Milkman\\" and a few others move along at a nice mid-tempo. McCartney's two originals are strong - \\"My Valentine\\" has tasty acoustic playing by Eric Clapton, and \\"Only Our Hearts\\" (which nails the period sound) features a soaring, melodic harmonica solo by Stevie Wonder. Clapton also guests with some bluesy electric licks on \\"Find Yourself Another Fool.\\"  The whole deluxe edition thing was extremely poorly handled. The Target version of the deluxe version is the best one because its the only place to find the two bonus tracks. You can download four MP3s from a recent Capital Studios live performance with any deluxe version. I was disappointed it was only four lossy MP3s instead of higher quality downloads of each song from the forty-five minute performance. Any deluxe version also includes a few glossy postcard-type photos. But the real prize are the studio bonus tracks only available at that one aforementioned discount retailer. One track is a very nice rendition of \\"My One and Only Love.\\" The other is a redo of McCartney's own 1979 \\"Baby's Request.\\" What sounded like pastiche on \\"Back to the Egg\\" (complete with synthesized trombone solo) now sounds completely authentic - and of course the trombone is real this time.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am enjoying this game so far. Good graphics, and a twist to other Mahi jong games.  Even nicer to get it for free today.
B002IFOY5C|5.0|Highly recommended for fans of this underrated movie - this Canadian release is the ONLY way to get the original theatrical cut enhanced for widescreen TVs. The original DVD of the theatrical cut is non-enhanced, meaning it will look \\"window-boxed\\" on your widescreen TV (i.e. - black bars not only on the top and bottom, but on each side as well). The domestic Blu-ray includes ONLY the \\"director's cut,\\" which not only adds material - it re-edits some scenes, changing one element of the story significantly AND has a totally different ending.  For my money, the theatrical cut is the only version of the movie. Spoiler alerts ahead, necessary to discuss why this version is so superior to the \\"director's cut.\\" In the theatrical cut, Stallone's Sheriff Heflin is painfully naive to think he can house Superboy (Michael Rappaport) in his office without Ray (Harvey Keitel) finding out. That works though, because Heflin is not the most sophisticated law enforcement officer. In the director's cut, Heflin actually goes into the bar where Ray and the other cops hang out and blatantly announces that he has Superboy in custody. Instead of naive, he looks totally stupid. The other big change, and again a necessary spoiler, is the ending. In the theatrical cut, we have a brief coda in which we see Heflin still on the job, doing what he always did (in other words, his acts of heroism gained him nothing in material terms - no promotion, etc - making his selfless actions even more admirable and poignant). In the director's cut, this is completely missing, with a highly abrupt ending that makes it unclear what became of Heflin after the film's climax.  All of this might not bother the average first time viewer. But to me, the changes ruined the movie. Since writer/director James Mangold has basically disowned the original theatrical cut, I didn't think it would ever see the light of day on Blu-ray. This Canadian version (which has the alternate title \\"Detective\\" in small print on the cover) has been out for a few years. It is not a perfect transfer by any means, but contrary to what some other reviewers have claimed - it IS 1080p high definition. The main problem with this transfer is that the source print has dirt specs on numerous scenes. The picture is generally sharp and miles ahead of the old non-anamorphic DVD of the theatrical cut. For me, having some scenes slightly marred by specs of dirt was an acceptable trade-off to have a 16:9 formatted high definition version of this definitive cut. Get it while its still in-print if you love \\"Cop Land.\\"
B005J4TLQG|5.0|I've watched this movie, and told everyone I know to watch it.  Haven't been this excited about a new alien flick in quite awhile.  New and fresh.  P.S.  All my firends loved it too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game rocks but some of the games just do not make any sense to but over all it is a very fun to play:)
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|I was a HUGE fan of the original.  Of course it's not as good as that one, but a decent attempt.  Not cheesy, true to the original story line.  If you're a fan of a good alien flick, you'll like this.
B0035J6TAI|3.0|This is a really difficult album to review. I received it as a free legal download in glorious 16-bit FLAC and have played it though some really nifty phones and speakers. Think B&W, marantz amp etc. Not quite the 60k nautilus that I'm sure Peter had in mind when he recorded it but these will have to do :) So I've always admired his production values and was prepared to be suitably blown away by Peter covering some of my favourite songs with orchestral accompaniment. It starts with Heroes which is challenging to say the least but the arrangement is intriguing and, overall, it works. The Boy in the Bubble is great, really moving. Mirrorball is a cover of the Elbow track, which in theory, should work as Elbow is all about excellent production with clever arrangement, hallmarks of Gabriel. But it doesn't work. The fundamental problem here is that Garvey & Co. produced the perfect arrangement for the song which is all about its arrangement. Gabriel has to do something different and it's just not that satisfying.   Flume is beautiful and suits Gabriel immensely.  Listening Wind is good but not a patch on Talking Head's original. The Power of the Heart is better than Lou Reed's original. The only song on the album of which this is true & the only time where you feel this could be a Gabriel track you're listening to. My Body is a Cage is so dark. a sonic black hole. In a way the delivery is so wrought as to be comic. Unintentionally so I think but I'm not sure. It didn't work for me in any regard. The Book of Love is lovely. His cover of Randy Newman's classic I think it's going to Rain Today is well judged but not particularly interesting. Apres Moi is big, bold and controversial from the fortnight strings of its opening bars. It's towards the end of this song that everything goes awry. It's the first real outing of Gabriel's primal screaming cum wailing on the album. It's not a pleasant sound and, to my mind, not especially musical.  The next song is one of my all time favourites, Neil Young's beautiful gem, Philadelphia. As I gauged the pitch in the opening bars I knew there'd be some wailing here. THere is, from the start. Now, it almost works in this song as it's so raw & painful. In many ways, it perfectly captures man's struggle with mortality, the animal instinct to slink away and die alone and the social instinct to share and to have those to share with. So wailing is apt but, again, I don't feel it's musical.  Gabriel's wails are deeply unpleasant. I suspect he's trying to shock and it's tedious.  It finishes with Radiohead's Street Spirit. After the pitching issues of Philadelphia I was prepared for a problematic delivery. What follows is an arrangement that misses the point of the song. The enthusiasm of Yorke's delivery works cleverly with the driving power of their musicianship to lift Radiohead's songs from dirge to divine. Mess with that formula and try to turn it into a pseudo Shatner talkie and it doesn't work. Indeed this cover is so awful I've found it difficult to listen to the various groans and screams he throws out. Not my cup of tea. I'm sure someone thinks this is avant garde genius but I think this song is a resounding failure.  So 3 stars then. Some of this album is well worth a listen and other bits are awful. Almost none of it improves on the originals. It is, in short, a somewhat successful vanity project.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|The BEST! Of all my collections of concert dvd's this is the very best and in blu-!ray.  Picture and sounds unbelievable. Thank you A-HA.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Its a good way to waste some time. I enjoy the various power ups during gameplay and the story is enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved every minute of this book, I read it in a day I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|my dad wont give me my kindle fire back because he is always busy playing this game I started playing it was it little.confusing but then it became really easy
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger games series was beyond amazing, I loved every minute of these books, I could not put them down. The mockingjay does not have a fairytale ending like everyone thinks a book should have instead it is realistic and that is what makes the ending to this series amazing. I felt connected to the characters Collins did a great job of making these characters come alive. Even though its the end I am still wanting more, I want to know what happens in the future with Katniss and Peeta in detaol, I fell in love with these characters. Amazing series
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire was my favorite book in the Hunger Games Trilogy.  The characters were full of life and energy that made me feel as if I was there with them, experiencing everything that they were.  The plot was very suspenseful and had many vivid details.  Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job, because I could hardly put the book down to do anything else.  The ending made me extremely excited to start to read the next book.  I couldn't stop thinking about what would happen next.<br />  Throughout this book, many similes are used to help describe certain things.  For example on page 312, Peeta is describing with detail the different colors he can make with his paints.  He says \\"Pink. As pale as a baby's skin.\\" and \\"Green like spring grass.\\"  By describing this in detail, it puts a mental image in my head that Peeta is a real person and really can create colors like that.  The author(Suzanne Collins) creates the illusion that the characters in this story are real and that this really is a true story.<br />  If someone is contemplating about reading this book or not, I highly recommend that they do.  You will not regret it.  Once you begin reading it, you won't be able to stop and once you're done you will want to read it over and over again!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is really cute and fun and flying squirrels are awesome. i got this as the free app of the day i would totally pay 99cents
B006ON41FC|5.0|I really love this game!  The first day I got it I played it almost the whole day!  It's very addicting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love 101-in-1 games. These games are fun, challenging, and addictive. the only drawback is that you have to purchase the games to unlock them and the higher you go the higher the cost.
B006ON41FC|5.0|its so sddictive because once you fail u always try to get past the place u messed up n u can never stop
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is easily the most entertaining mahjong game I've played. It looks great and runs smoothly on DROID RAZR. This is the best free app Amazon has offered in a very long time!
B004UID2LC|5.0|because i don't like spending money on music i can just download it for free.i get great sound quality and can play on my apps while i listen to what i want btw better than pandora
0060853972|5.0|I wish I was witty enough (and British enough) to have written this book. It is an amazing and hilarious literary feat. Gaiman and Pratchett vividly describe every character and scene; Crowley and Aziraphale are one of the most entertaining duos to grace the pages of fiction and if you disagree you should stop reading this review and call a doctor - you've obviously suffered severe brain damage and need to seek medical help immediately.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|From the start I fell in love with this game. There is SO much to love about it. It challenges you, but you cant stop playing.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|A fun game even the kids enjoy, questing and reading the story is great. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game!!!!! It is really fun to play. I like the quest option. my friends recommended it to me and said it was great. she was correct.

B0064NTZJO|2.0|Save $20, we bought both this movie and Contagion, last night we decided to watch Drive, we were both excited because of all the positive reviews we have heard and seen. What we expected and what we got were two totally different things. After watching this movie we loaded up the trailer online just to make sure we watched the same movie. The trailer looked exciting and fast paced, this movie was painstakingly slow, some scenes where the lead actor was too say a line there was as much as ten seconds of silence, there were a lot of what seemed liked slow motion scenes...mind you, these scenes were not action scenes. Some might call this art house or such similar talk....I say bull. You buy a movie called Drive...you expect...well...a lot of driving??  Not so much, sure there were a couple of nice chase scenes, but not near enough, this was a half hour movie that was extended to a hour and a half....and not well. The movie had it's share of violence, actually, a bit on the over done side. On a positive note, Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks were both great and deserving of much more screen time.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I find this game very interesting because I have never played mahjong before and have always wondered what it was all about.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|love this app! great on the kindle fire. fun game to play, it get's a little harder with each level.
1594202842|5.0|The author is honest and brave insofar as she discusses both her personal triumphs and weak points/problems with being so stringent with her young children. The take home point is she simply states that while she tried her best in what she knew to be the best child rearing possible, she learned from her children that she had to make adjustments to her own child-rearing philosophy.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Very fast and powerful. Included CPU cooler is a joke howerver; You'd expect with this technology that Intel would have increased funding in this department a little.
B003L20IHE|5.0|This DVD came as described. I loved the movie but cried when Charlies brother died. I could almost feel what Charlie was going through. It all turned out good in the end.
0385340559|5.0|This is one of the best Jack Reacher novels I've read.  I was hooked from the beginning and found it hard to put the book down. A great story line that held my interest all the way through.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I loved this DVD. It was sad the way the chimps were treated at the facility they went to when the lab was finished with them. The caregivers were very mean and cruel.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I think this is a great app and you DO NOT have to &quot;wade&quot; through ads to play. there is an ad screen before you play but once you click &quot;play manning artifacts&quot; it takes you to the game and you don't have to deal with ads anymore.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|MANY OPTIONS / very nice game options.  Good graphics. Can't wait to play all the levels. NOT BORING!  And free - what a great find.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are fun, but others are kinda, and i mean kinda, sucky. some of the quality is bad.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I was looking for a point and click fame to play do I picked it up and it was entertaining but only took an hour or so to beat.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|i think this is a really cool game and I hope that other people like it as much as I do:)
B0067Q42BY|4.0|one of the best mahjong apps for android. works great on my honeycomb tablet. glad this was on sale been having trouble finding a mahjong I liked.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I understand that this is the free app of the day and I do appreciate it. The main reason I check the.app of the day is to avoid apps that advertise.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I download this game into my new Tablet (Asus transformer prime, Android 4.0) I was so excited to be able to play. luckily I was able to complete the game, but a day or two later, the game kept freezing after just a few minutes and needed to be force closed. I would love  to be able to play again, but until it gets fixed, I wont give it more than 1 Star.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Great product and sender was great, no problems with this.  Love the prices. dvds were great quality and the order came in on the dates that were stated.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|the app actually made mahjong exciting..,u can go and do. cool side missions...... really fun in my opinion.... and It was free
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|80s retro-violence at its best. Reminds me of \\"To Live in Die in LA\\" but so much better. Every actor plays their character perfectly. This isn't fast and furious, but it's not art house. Great Flick
0316044695|5.0|I was gifted with this book by my son, and I'm so glad I read it because it is the kind of story that stays with you long after the last page is turned. In fact, I've found myself checking Face book, the Boots Campaign, YouTube and elsewhere to gather more information about this courageous and outstanding man...Marcus Luttrell. Thank you for your service seems trite acknowledgment for the heroism and sacrifice of our brave Navy SEALs, but it needs to be said. Better stated: Thank you for your endurance, your God-given talents, dedication and zeal to help make our country and its citizens free from the oppressive zealots who would kill us in their misguided mission to annihilate the Great Satan.<br /><br />Lone Survivor is the true story of Operation Redwing and the lost heroes of SEAL Team 10. But it is more. The book opens with Marcus Luttrell's mission to personally meet the families of his dead comrades; not just his close brothers who were part of the mission, but also of the 16 heroes who came to rescue Marcus and his mates and who were shot down in their helicopter.<br /><br />The second part of the book details Marcus' early years, his training to become a SEAL while still a teenager, and later the actual training that took place in Coronado, CA and elsewhere. The degree of difficulty of SEAL training is explained in clear detail; out of well over one hundred men, only a handful will have the stamina and mental fortitude to finish. (Luttrell explains that the body can stand almost any punishment, but the battle between success or failure is in the mind.)<br /><br />Finally, after weeks and months of physical training, marksmanship, guidance and other tactical courses, the newly minted SEALs are pinned and ready to go. The final part of Lone Survivor deals with Operation Redwing and the betrayal of Petty Officers Marcus and his buddies Danny Dietz and Matthew Axelman and Lt. Michael Murphy. Also detailed is the story of Marcus Luttrell's survival, thanks in part to his overwhelming need to relate the last days of his group and in a larger part to the Pashtun villagers who protected him from the Taliban.<br /><br />Luttrell and his co-author, Patrick Robinson, have penned a gripping story of courageous men and one particular man's courage against near impossible odds. This is not the type of book I normally choose, but I found it enthralling, horrifying and so gripping I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Lone Survivor has more than 1500 reviews; I doubt mine will add noticeably to them, but I have to say I found the book very engagingly written, and since Luttrell's views are similar to my own, not at all off-putting as some reviewers have commented. Also, as a published author who has checked, double, triple and quadruple checked my own manuscripts, let me say that no matter how many times you reread your work, errors get through. There was nothing in Lone Survivor that gave me an instant's pause.relate the last days of his group and in a larger part to the Pashtun villagers who protected him from the Taliban.

B0067Q42BY|2.0|I don't know if I would have liked the game but as soon as I saw it had used up 43.6 MB I removed it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I was having fun playing with this app until. bang...smacked right into a tree because I hit the edge of the board. entertaining and a slight challenge.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Wow, if you love playing Mahjong, you need this game. The graphics are insane and the UI is superb, hats of to the designers for doing an amazing job. Must have App!
B006ON41FC|5.0|My wife is upset that I downloaded this game, I've been playing constantly since last night when I got it. Very addictive and challenging.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game is fun. Runs great on the Incredible 2. Recommend it for the app of the day. Ads are annoying and removing them would make it five stars.
B000WTZ784|4.0|I remember when I first bought 'Calling All Stations' a few years ago. At the time, it was the only Genesis release I did not own (live or studio, as well as both 'Archive' box sets, the 'Turn it On Again: Best of 81-83' compilation and the 'Turn it On Again: The Hits' album, not to mention a vinyl of 'Spot the Pigeon'). So, since it was in a bargain bin being sold used, I bought it for a dollar fifty. That's not a bad deal.  Well, I listened to it, and I initially thought it was awful. I couldn't stand it. I just hated it. So, I put on my CD shelf with all of my other Genesis CDs, where it stayed for a number of years. Than, on one lazy Saturday afternoon, I was bored, so I decided to take it out for a relisten. I hadn't heard this in about four or five years, and I figured it couldn't hurt to do it one more time.  As it turns out, I liked this record. I like it A LOT. The songs aren't badly written at all ('Calling All Stations' I think contains some very interesting vocals), and I've actually become a fan of Ray Wilson's raspy voice. It's totally different from Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel, but that's *exactly* what this band needed in 1997. Genesis wasn't looking for a Phil Collins sound-alike, or a Peter Gabriel sound-alike for that matter. This band was looking for a new identity and a new voice that would reestablish themselves as a band.  Unfortunately, that wasn't to be the case. The record bombed, ticket sales were very slow, and by mid-1998, this incarnation of Genesis had disbanded. And that's a shame, as I believe this lineup really could have released some more great material. We're lucky to have this record though.  There's plenty of good stuff here, and don't let the Phil Collins fanatics tell you otherwise. 'Congo' is a very good radio-friendly song inspired by world sounds (taking a page from Peter Gabriel's book) before become a great progressive pop number. 'Alien Afternoon' features some fine playing by Mike Rutherford, and 'Not About Us' should have been a huge hit for this band. 'Shipwrecked' was released as a single, but it unfortunately stalled on the charts. 'Shipwrecked' is probably the best track on the album, and one that I have been listening to repeatedly these last few weeks.  There are lots of b-sides too from this record. 'Run Out of Time' is probably my favorite of these, and I absolutely think this cut should have made the album. It didn't, and that's unfortunate, but it's available on a few CD singles from the time period. I advise Genesis fanatics to seek those out as well -- they're dirt cheap used here on Amazon.  Overall, I recommend 'Calling All Stations' for the open-minded Genesis fan. If you think Genesis died with Phil Collins in 1993, or if you are of the opinion that Genesis died in 1975 with Peter Gabriel, odds are you aren't going to like this album. It's got a very progressive rock flavor to it while still retaining some of the more mainstream sounds that made Genesis a household name in the 1980s and early 1990s. There's lots of great material here that has gone largely unnoticed, and this is a record that warrants some massive rediscoveries by fans. If you don't own this and you like Genesis, buy it (it's cheap used) and listen to it. You can always sell it if you don't like it...
B0067Q42BY|3.0|the game is fun but is does not fill up the screen on my evo 3d so i dont know how some of the kindle fire reviewers were able to play this. this might sound stupid but i thought it might have a config option to help configure the screen but it doesnt as well the graphics look like an old 8-bit nes or snes game again fun game but either way when playing zoom in or zoom out the graphics are what i said prepare to have to zoom in or out half the time while playing if someone does reply back please dont write somethin insulting quote bruce banner the incredible hulk don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Keeps asking to be reviewed.  Have to log into a third party service for high scores. Have to disable every time I open the game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this version! So addictive!! Definitely recommend this game, lots of fun! get it while its free, but would be worth the $5 too
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This book deserves five star no doubt about it. The trilogy proves to get better as you read. If you read this, you'll be greeted with a full entree of spice, flavor, and beauty. Delicious! If they come up with another book, I will be stuffed with amazement and criminal cases. Im going to go back to bed now. yawn.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Best picture of 2010, Inception. Best picture of 2011, Drive. Neither actually won, both should have.  I saw this movie today (a Saturday morning) at 9am on DirectTV. Then I watched it again with my wife before we went to bed. This is the first movie I've ever written a review for on Amazon. That's how damn good it is. It's rare for me, or anybody, to watch the same movie twice in a day.  I'm buying it on Blue Ray just so I can let people borrow it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've been a fan of mahjong for a long time, and this is the best version I've ever played. G5 Entertainment also makes hidden object games which I love playing on the PC and I'm glad such games are available for Android.
0316098329|5.0|\\"Room\\" sucked me in from page one and held me tightly in its grips until the end. I have never read anything like it! This chilling book kept me riveted and held me hostage until the last word - a highly gratifying read!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|es un juego muy entretenido que ejercita la mente. una vest empiezas a jugar ya no quieres parar hasta el final.
B006UG90RM|4.0|One star just for the fact that Van Halen is back together and making music. One star for the music - the band is in great form (and it sounds as if they have finally ditched the keyboards and gone back to their roots). One star for the rock - there are some serious jams on this song. I'm not sure if there are any great hooks but there is some definite rocking on this effort. One star for the fact that this gets better with each listen.  So why not five stars? Two reasons: 1) I really don't like Tattoo and probably put this song near the top of my list of worst Van Halen songs ever. The song doesn't rock, and the subject isn't interesting. 2) The backing vocals aren't anywhere near as good as they used to be. Michael Anthony could sing, and he's gone. Eddie's voice is shot and Wolf just doesn't have the pipes. Mind you, the backing vocals aren't bad - it's just that Michael Anthony set a very high bar.  A couple of thoughts about the packaging ... I liked the bonus DVD and wish there had been more of it. There is something wrong with the CD as after track 13 the CD sticks at 0:00 on a non-existent track 14. I had to advance past it to get back to the start of the CD.  I saw VH in concert a few years ago when the band got back together and I enjoyed the show. I also saw the Women & Children First, 1984, 5150, and OU812 tours. I can't imagine that the new tour will top any of the shows I've already seen. The tickets are very expensive and I have no desire to see the opening act (Kool & the Gang).  All in all, a very nice effort from Van Halen - welcome back boys.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I spend hours playing.  it reminds me of an adult version of memory. but more fun!!!!!  I just can't. put it down
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|I've now tried 4 of these to use for my laptop's hdmi connection due to its port placement for cord direction.  I wanted to get the sideways-in hdmi out of the way with a straight-down 90 degree drop at the side of my coffee table.  For design, this is a fabulous adapter since it swivels right/left AND pivots 90 degrees up or down.  But, not a single one of the 4 worked out of my laptop.  TV could not get an input signal at all.  As soon as I removed the adapter and plugged the hdmi cable back into laptop directly, system video was back on TV screen.  My graphics card would immediately detect the connection with the adapter and recognize that it was outputting to 2 displays and even correctly identify the second as my TV, but the TV screen remained blank.  I plugged the adapter into the TV ports and got mixed results -- connecting it to the cable-box hdmi produced cable signal, but connecting it to the laptop's hdmi cable into the TV got me nothing but blank screen again.  So, at either end of the laptop-to-TV hdmi cable, absolutely no audio or video whatsoever from laptop.  Very disappointing, and I don't understand how this could be the fault of my laptop/graphics since several hdmi cables have always worked fine and as I see it, this adapter is still just basically another hdmi cable in alt form.  But as I said, it did work with the cable-box hdmi at TV input, so who knows (if you're getting it for that purpose, it may be great but that wasn't my need at all :-( ).  I was so happy to have found the perfect adapter at a tremendously reasonable price, I originally ordered 2 (one for backup) and when neither worked, got a set of replacements, which now have to be returned also.  Very disappointed and aggravated.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing this solitaire game. It's better than having to carry cards around with you. Plus, you can't lose the them. The game play is really easy and responsive to the Kindle Fire. I would recommend this game.
0345533054|5.0|This was an absolutely amazing book.  I say that not because the writing style was phenomenal (it was merely decent), not because the characters were developed so wonderfully (I couldn't wholeheartedly warm up to any of the main characters like I could in other books), and not because it's bound to be a timeless classic (it'll probably just stay a simple mass-market paperback with at most a couple more reprints).  No, this was absolutely amazing simply because the twists and turns of the plot were absolutely amazing. Every time I thought I had the book figured out, another twist would be thrown in--and not just a little twist here and there, but entire 180-degree, plot-changing curves! Even down to the last chapter or two, when you finally feel like the plot has finally been laid out.  In short, a hearty recommendation from me just on pure entertainment value
0345479092|1.0|There is a lot of pressure out there to get a baby on a routine of some kind, and I guess that's why I was so happy to read this book.  I bought into the idea that it was a routine that was flexible enough for my baby as an individual.  I could do EASY (Eat, Activity, Sleep, You (parent) time), but in intervals and at times of the day that worked for him.  For the first three weeks of my baby's life I breastfed him on demand and then tried to start implementing an EASY routine.  I would feed my baby, letting him take as long as he needed on one or both sides, then I would have 'activity' and cuddle him, change him, let him hang out in his infant seat or whatever, and then when he started showing signs of fussing, I would pop in a pacifier and start soothing him to sleep.  When he fell asleep I would either take a nap or get something done around the house.  When he awoke, I'd feed him again and continue the pattern, just skipping out the 'activity' at night.  Sounds great, right?  Wrong!  My baby stopped gaining weight on EASY.  I noticed that he seemed pretty skinny and went to have him weighed.  He had barely gained an ounce in 3 weeks.  EASY may work for some breastfeeding mums, but not this one, and probably not a lot of others either.  It's been proven that a women's capacity for milk storage can vary from woman to woman by as much as 300%.  Clearly, my baby needed to be fed on demand, even if it sometimes meant every hour, when he needed to cluster feed.  We're back to feeding on demand, and my baby is back to gaining weight.  I feel horrible about trying this routine on him.  And now that he's almost 3 months old, he has naturally lengthened his time between needing to be fed, he naturally sleeps for longer stretches at night, he is naturally content (sometimes) to fall asleep on his own in his cot.  Aside from the poor advice for breastfeeding mums, I think it would also be sad to take away from all the soothing that mums naturally want to do.  I'm glad I didn't listen to Hogg's advice about not rocking my baby to sleep, or co-sleeping with my baby.  He needs lots of contact and I went with my instincts on that from the beginning.  I just wish I'd gone with my instincts more about feeding.
B006ON41FC|5.0|i cant believe how entertaining this is I thought it would b stupid but then when I played it I just could not get off of it now I'm on it everyday this is highly recommended for everyone
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had at least four different Bibles loaded on to my old Kindle and then bought a Droid.  When I uploaded Youversion onto that phone I was THRILLED to be able to quickly (key word) select the translation, book, chapter & verse I needed for any situation.  The devotionals are great, too!  I followed one on Christmas carols with my children in the weeks before Christmas and was so grateful to have it right at my fingertips.  Now that I have a Kindle Fire, I get to enjoy youversion in the bigger format.  I LOVE this app and recommend it onstantly.
