B005LAIHPE|5.0|really good movie and my husband loves the action in this show, the people and the story is really attention grabbing...
B005KCTQSK|5.0|The Songs Were all great especially home and the cover of elton johns song \\"your Song\\" my least favorite is animal and i still listen to the song anyway i love her so much
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|he really deserve's a oscar for this movie he did so good and it is so enjoyable to watch you feel like your right there with them as they went through the waiting and then escaping it was so good....
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I am very pleased with this movie.  Having grown up (I am am older person (:-)) with The Wizard of Oz I wondered how they were going to present this &#34;prequel&#34;.  It was great.  Although the wizard was a bit of a cad for most of the film, he came through in the end and saved Oz.  Seeing the Witch of the East's transformation was good also.  This movie answered a lot of the questions I and I am sure a lot of other fans of the original movie had.  Again I say that I was very surprised and delighted by this story.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Saw this game on the FAOTD and read the mixed reviews, so I wasn't too sure about it, but glad I downloaded it.  It was a lot of fun, challenging and addicting.  Made it all the way to the very end of the princess' journey and loved it!
B004ZY0VHY|3.0|I liked We Need To Talk About Kevin, but not as much as I thought I would. Sometimes it was hard to follow and sometimes Eva got under my skin. Kevin's character was sometimes complicated to understand, which is to be expected. Overall, the book was okay, but sometimes hard to follow and it took me a while to get through.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|This is a fun and challenging game, looks great - BUT - the amazon game circle pop-ups are incredibly annoying!!<br />As another reviewer wrote, it completely interrupts the level and blocks out the entire screen until you &#34;X&#34; it out.<br />I also don't care how many points I have made or how many boxes I've blown up!  I probably will end up deleting this off of<br />my Kindle Fire.
B0091REZMW|4.0|great game never gets boring. it is always changing. rewards are pretty awesome once you figure them all out. only second day any ive barely scratched the surface. don't like that you have to buy things to finish some of the quests or that you have to stop and invite friends or rate the game to get what you need. its okay don't get me wrong. I just like to stay focused on the task at hand not run off to another page to get more diamonds or coins. otherwise it is tons of fun and very entertaining
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This is the first book in a long time where I couldn't't wait for things to happen. Although I am not a \\"Darcy\\", I am so glad to find out that she was able to find herself and change her life for the better. This is something that I need to figure out for myself and find my own Ethan.
B006YZHEB8|2.0|movie does not run smoothly is jerky and freezes up.  may be our player we are trying to figure that out.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|The ending was amazing!!  The cast of characters and what they were portraying was appropriate for the storyline.  Highly recommend.
B001NTUDVI|5.0|Continuing my Mariah Carey Album track by track reviews.<br /><br />The Emancipation of Mimi is Mariah's 9th major studio album (excludes MTV EP, #1's, Glitter, and Greatest Hits) and her most commercially successful album since Daydream. Musically, the album is as diverse as anything she's ever done (though it has more hip hop than usual which was at first a turn-off) and vocally she shows less restraint than her prior Charmbracelet album.<br /><br />1. It's Like That (Featuring Jermaine Dupri & Fatman Scoop): A track about Mariah celebrating her 'emancipation'. This is a hot party track, nothing like Mariah was doing in the early '90s. 8/10<br /><br />2. We Belong Together: One of the biggest chart-toppers ever, an R&B ballad with killer vocals. 10/10<br /><br />3. Shake It Off (Featuring Jermaine Dupri): Similar in composition to the opener, but more laid back, lyrically it's and about 'shaking off' an unwanted boyfriend. 8/10<br /><br />4. Mine Again: Old school jazzy ballad, complete with the fuzzy recording sound. Amazing vocal. 9/10<br /><br />5. Say Somethin' (Featuring Snoop Dogg). A smooth R&B jam with some rather provocative undertones. This song grew on me. 7/10<br /><br />6. Stay the Night: Similar to Mine Again, nice lyrics and vocals. 8/10<br /><br />7. Get Your Number (Featuring Jermaine Dupri): Mr. Dupri collaborated with Mariah on some of her hottest tracks, including \\"Always Be My Baby\\" and \\"Sweetheart\\". Anyway, this laid back Hip hop/club song is sweet. 9/10<br /><br />8. One and Only (Featuring Twista): Awesome, and Mariah actually keeps up with Twista in the rapping department to stat the song off! 9/10<br /><br />9. Circles: Mariah's soulful lyrics and vocals really make this song stand out. 10/10<br /><br />10. Your Girl: A perky R&B ditty. 7/10<br /><br />11. I Wish You Knew: Return of the insane upper register, reminds me of her older stuff. 9/10<br /><br />12. To the Floor: A fun club song, I didn't like it much at first, but it grows on you. 6/10<br /><br />13. Joy Ride: Another song that goes down memory lane to the old Mariah. Lovely lyrics. 10/10<br /><br />14. Fly Like a Bird: Killer Gospel track to finish off the album. 9/10<br /><br />Final Album Rating: 8.50<br /><br />But wait, if you purchased the platinum edition you also get 4 additional songs!<br /><br />15. Don't Forget About Us: Very reminiscent of We Belong Together and arguably just as good. 10/10<br /><br />16. Makin' it Last All Night (Featuring Jermaine Dupri): It's not my favorite, but it's a fun little dance track. 7/10<br /><br />17. So Lonely (One and Only Pt2, Featuring Twista): Love this song (similar, but not the same as One and Only) and its crazy fast beat. 9/10<br /><br />18. We Belong Together (Remix, Featuring Jadakiss and Styles P): A nice remix. 7/10ou. 6/10<br /><br />13. Joy Ride: Another song that goes down memory lane to the old Mariah. Lovely lyrics. 10/10<br /><br />14. Fly Like a Bird: Killer Gospel track to finish off the album. 9/10<br /><br />Final Album Rating: 8.50<br /><br />But wait, if you purchased the platinum edition you also get 4 additional songs!<br /><br />15. Don't Forget About Us: Very reminiscent of We Belong Together and arguably just as good. 10/10<br /><br />16. Makin' it Last All Night (Featuring Jermaine Dupri): It's not my favorite, but it's a fun little dance track. 7/10<br /><br />17. So Lonely (One and Only Pt2, Featuring Twista): Love this song (similar, but not the same as One and Only) and its crazy fast beat. 9/10<br /><br />18. We Belong Together (Remix, Featuring Jadakiss and Styles P): A nice remix. 7/10
B00CFQMVLS|3.0|The title tells it all really except for the annoying subtitles for the bad guys and the equally annoying father/child plot lines.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really like this game but it is way too short. Can't wait for other &#34;Rooms&#34;. Best game I've played on a tablet or phone as I don't like hidden object games that seem to be all the rage for those platforms.
B008G3N71W|2.0|While this is an erotic book, the best parts are in the first half of it.  After that, the author takes a very odd, strange turn, not necessarily for the better.  By the end of the book, I was thinking, \\"Really?  That's it?\\"  It's just ODD.
B0000C23DO|5.0|Some of my fondest memories took place at a dead show in California, Growing up, I never understood why my dad was running off to follow the dead. After moving to Cali I met what else? A DEADHEAD! He took me to my first show and seeing them live I could see what all the fuss was about! Now my 17 yr old son makes fun of his dad & I, at times calling us hippies!
0547848412|5.0|Haven't read it yet - but service was fine.  It's going to be my vacation read - starting  this Saturday.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Our grandchildren love as much as we do. It is challenging and takes some thought to play. Good for ages 10 and above.
B00CM9JKXU|2.0|I was in euphoria when the news broke that there would be 2 Queensryche bands!  First they release a rehash of already delivered music (no new music)  Then this comes out a month later... Todd La Torre may sound great live... I've heard him.  But he does not have his heart into this release.  Shallow, lacking passion.  Rushed and short wording - does not sound convincing.  Many of the lyrics are verbal masturbation!  They broke off from Geoff because they thought they would be better without him?  Really?<br />I've meet Mike Wilton at a Meet and Greet .  He is extremely talented.  One of the best guitar players ever.  The whole band is very talented.  But, the criticisms expressed to Geoff Tates Queensryche FU release seem pale in comparison.<br />I love Queensryche!  It is practically my religion.  I express these remarks in hopes that only better performance will be afforded in the future.  If this is the direction of the non-GT vocals, I may be forced to only follow GT.  I will continue to repeatedly listen to this album in hopes of finding the enthusiasm that many other reviewers express.<br />Todd La Torre was adopted into Queensryche, he did not build the band.  Usually being chosen is better... maybe they should have been more critical and chose someone with more passion in their vocal talent.  Even if they did not sound like GT.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Several characters perish, a kingdom in the balance, and Winter is Coming.  A great book.  Hurry up George and write the next one.
B002NN5F7A|3.0|It wasn't what I was expecting. I've heard so many quotes about this movie. For me, however, it didn't live up to it's hype.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|What I like about Facebook is seeing wonderful photos of the kids and pets in our circle of family and friends (and others, but the kids change the quickest & most dramatically).  There are some great pages I've &#34;liked&#34; (and enjoy their content).  We don't have TV, so I use the weather-related pages on FB as my &#34;weather man.&#34;<br /><br />What I don't like about it are the never-ending changes that often, for me, are not improvements.  FB seems very Big Brother-sh to me.  I've &#34;unliked&#34; some pages because the comments on them have been too often too negative and downright mean, rude, etc. (and needlessly so).  I've left FB for months and returned a couple of times; returned basically for the family/friends photos.  Some of Facebook's practices go beyond annoying to just plain wrong, in my opinion.  So far, the photos make it worth staying for me but that could change ~~ although there are a few perqs with FB, I can live quite happily without it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|keep a pen and paper handy it will help...some levels are easy others take some thought.  I had a lot of fun with free app.  ENJOY
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is fun, an easy and quick read, empowering and life-changing in the best of ways.  It doesn't get any better than that!  I have the Kindle version and plan to order the paperbook (or hardcover, if available).
B00CMKDMM4|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book.<br />There are factual errors, the company distributing the hiking maps that are recommended has been out of business for some time and the maps are no longer available.<br />Apart from the normal editing problems, this book has whole lines of text missing. You get things like \\"the best books to buy about Bulgaria are\\" blank, nothing!<br />I must confess, I am not the best at finding my way around a kindle but I have had more trouble with this book than all the other books I have read put together. The highlights are hopeless. Print on dark background might work in a print book but , in an ebook it's unreadable.<br />I would suggest that if you want a travel guide for Romania and Bulgaria you look elsewhere or at least, don't buy the ebook version.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Loved the characters and the actors playing them. The scenery was amazing too! 5 stars from me!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I can always watch this movie. So much fun for the whole family. It's a classic in our home.<br />Anne
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome way to spend time on my break at work. A great game to exercise the mind.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Are you kidding me, what's not to love about Bob Seger.  CD plays ver well.  I've seen him in concert and it does him justice
B00D37UQ1K|2.0|This is the absolute not the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen in my life, but its really dam close. The book is not all that great to begin with but this movie is just downright bad. Now I don't know how hard it is to have the main part in this film (wanderer) but it look like they needed a more experienced actress for the part. Not that she is bad, just think that someone more experienced could have pulled it off better.<br /><br />Also I feel they could have explane things a lot better earler in film, I mean why should Wanderer even care for these humans that where her body's family not hers. I know in the book they explane and go into more detail but the what 10-15 min they give us was just not enough time to get why she even cares to start driving in the desert looking for them. Now it does a better job at this about an hour into the film but before that expect to be a little bit lost.<br /><br />I dont hate the movie I just was extremly disapointed with it. Read the book and save your money, I guess you could get this at redbox its worth 1-2 bucks and a quick afternoon if you don't have anything else to do....
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|Enjoyed some but not all the songs, I think they had high hopes of increasing shows ratings going into the next season!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|As usual, Ms. Picoult  deftly weaves a story that is impossible to put down.  The characters are realistic in their flawed humanity, and the mesmerizing storyline draws the reader in, up until the very end.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This was a great book for those who enjoy a action adventure book that gives a lot of detail and has a interesting story line with a story that is such an unusual plot
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was a great ending. I could not put it down! Recommended to teens. This is the third time I read the book.
B00CHYA9D0|5.0|I absolutely loved the first release from Caro Emerald. If that first release was a success, just listen to the second one, you will be blown away!<br />This second \\"essay\\" is a wonderful combination of lyrics and rhythms that makes your foot tap the beat, your head swing, and your fingers hit that fake piano keyboard you wish you learned how to play when you were a kid!<br />A touch of New Orleans, a little bit of Satchmo, and a \\"soupcon de\\" Sidnet Bechet and you can't stop listening to each song over and over!<br />This is also an opportunity for Caro to get out of what she does best, and show us she can do so much more! Just listen to the last 3 songs of this release: The wonderful in you, Tell me how long and My 2 cents. A mixture of her traditional sounds and main stream POP, but with a style and presence that define Caro Emerald!<br />A must have and a must listen over and over...
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|The grandkids like this one but I think they are getting tired of it.  Not much activities that we can see on this one.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|been wanting this series for awhile now. came better than i expected and sealed brand new. now my collection begins
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I'm a huge sucker for every Grand Theft Auto game that's come out, but since I don't own any of the systems that play those games, I was eager to give the Gangstar games a shot on my Kindle Fire HD. I was fine with having to clear a good chunk of my storage space to make room for a game with this kind of world and graphics, and I enjoyed learning the gameplay. However, every time I get past the first 10 or so short tutorial missions, the game crashes and loses my progress. So unless there's a fix for this, my frustration is going to win over. Nobody wants to have to only play the beginning of a story-based game like this.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|my brothers And I love this app e<br />my brothers and I love this app everything in the store ......... we have in our kingdom ;()
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|The replay value and sense of humour in this game keep me coming back more than any of the other dozens of games I've tried on my Kindle Fire HD. Between Punch Quest and Jetpack Joyride, I wonder why I even keep wasting my time with the slick, 3D games that take forever to download or progress in, when these nostalgia-inspiring but contemporary and silly 2D platformers are where it's at.
B0047VSW30|4.0|An interesting movie that I enjoyed. That the heavy later became a doctor of the church amazed me.  recommended by me
B001OMJGD0|3.0|Bryan Singer's take on the Man of Steel is very unique and thought-provoking, but it's lacking as an action film.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Would like more levels. I really like the way this game challenges you. I look forward to more levels. Soon!!!
B005VPRFSY|5.0|What kid doesn't like Legos?  I just cannot believe how expensive these items are.  This was a Christmas gift for my grandson as he loves putting these things together.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game for animal lovers.. i enjoyed playing it.. it is also a great game since it is freeeeeee :) hope every one who plays it enjoys it like i do :)
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I didn't see this movie when it came out but was looking forward to viewing this on our new 3D tv.  How alive and creative!  Simply amazing and entertaining for the whole family.
B006BXT4TI|5.0|This is the best CD I have heard since Ten by Pearl Jam. Every song is good and several including Sister, Little Black Submarine, Dead and Gone.
0316098515|4.0|Purchased this as a Xmas gift for my stepdaughter but didn't realize she had it already.  She loves the cookbook, however.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|If you wonder what it may be like to be a sniper in today's modern warfare then this movie delivers. I really liked Mark Wahlberg in this movie.
B00D6M86RS|2.0|I have a basement full of pinball machines and love playing them... it's never the same game twice.  The problem with computer pinballs is the physics of the ball, and eventually you will figure out the \\"patterns\\".  This game lack true pinball physics.  The ball feels like it's made of cotton candy, not steel, and behaves the same way.  For Kindle \\"Pinball Arcade\\" is true to the real tables and much more fun... and the ball actually looks and \\"feels\\" like a pinball.
B008Q00BOQ|3.0|This was good for it's time but doesn't compare to the lastest MI movie. It's worth watching to catch up with the story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game really made you think to try everything possible!  Interesting! I cant wait for more puzzles!<br />Let me know when more rooms come out!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I have only gotten the trial thus far but already its great. I've ran into some bugs playing it on my galaxy s3 but none the less this game delivers everything you would expect from wotc. Will be getting full game shortly!
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I really liked this game. The only bad thing is if you cant finish getting through a door and have to finish it later, you have to start that level over again. Makes you think! Eaiting for more levels to open.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Am waiting for the remainder of seasons to become availible. Have purchased season 2 from Amazon.  Hope you release other seasons soon.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wow! Ms. Day managed to ramp up Eva and Gideon's relationship to sizzling levels. She takes them to where readers wanted them to get to while leaving several questions and mysteries unsolved. The plot thickens, but we can enjoy seeing Eva and Gideon grow with each other and see what happens to the other characters we have grown to care about. Ms. Day please don't leave us hanging too long for the next installment that is sure to be boiling hot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is so awesome to play and it just catches my mind to where I go in time.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is amazing. It would keep you interest for week's.  It is amazing.  I think this is a very great game and I would recommend it to most people.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I find that it protects my kindle and is easy to carry it around. Will take it on my next trip to test the usability of it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I can't say anything more than this book is fabulously written<br />And I love it so great . You should read it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think the weather as reported is usually correct and helps decide what I will do that day Thanks for the accuracy
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is probably one  of the best games I have. It is full of fun and is amazing. Congrats to the makers of this game,
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|Original &#34;Great Gatsby&#34; captures the very essence of the story F.Scot Fitzgerald Intended. This is a TImeless MUST SEE Movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was a wonderful story. Offers a lot of affirmation for us believers and inspiration do those not yet believing.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I had only heard of Testla.  It very interesting to learn about this great man.  I hope history will give him his due.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This movie not only has an interesting, creative story line, but was filmed with no special effects. Also, the way it is written allows a viewer to watch it multiple times and still get something new from it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much better than the first, Temple Run 2 is seriously a game that you will never want to put down.
B005TVYVI2|1.0|This swim suit is not for the professional or competitive swimmer....the fabric is too stretchy and not water resistant!  My granddaughter is a competitive swimmer and she was extremely disappointed.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Good app but needs updates it sucks please add up dates really Apple has lots of kik up dates!!!!! Good app
B000VSAEYI|4.0|So I have 3 girls, 7, 3, and 8 months. They all love it. I recently had my niece and nephew over too ( 5, 2) they loved it!  I can't believe how many little extras they include!  For the price, you cannot beat this deal! My ONE complaint, and it's probably my own fault, the hose line sprang a leak the first time I used it, but I had the water up full blast! No worries a little bit of ducttape and it's working just fine!
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|It's stupid how you need a Facebook to play I love angry birds but I HATE THIS ONE DOn't get this app if u don't have a Facebook
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Lots of twists. Didn't really know what was going on. Kept me interested. Liked the end but it left me wanting a little more
B00AFEX83C|5.0|This Movie Make Me Have Happy To See This Dvd And This Movie The Funny Movie Too Me And More
B000BH4YJ0|5.0|If you like the Spanish romantic music, this is a CD for. He is a good singer and the music is excellent. I would definitely recommend the CD!!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is really cool .like it a lot better than the other shooter games .I give this a 5 star game .hope everybody likes it too.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love this app it's awesome. but I think it would be cool if their where deer you could ride.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's actually fun and made time go by fast. It's also addicting. Although there are only 10 levels they were not to hard but not to easy. Overall it teaches u if your smart enough to escape! Challenge yourselves ;D
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I am not much for musicals, I guess for a musical the acting was pretty good, not for me though.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Loved it. Very insightful around the idea of true expertise or mastery. I think it overtly shows the positive, but also subtly reveals that there is also a bit of a personal sacrifice needed and that everyone may not want to make that sacrifice.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Can't wait for the sequel.  Great movie and Universal studios is making a ride out of this movie.  Good for the whole family.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I thought it was cute game to waste some time with.<br />Then there was the update and their special 'treasure chest weekend' >>> 95% of those were only available for 6 pearls . . . It is ridiculously hard to earn those pearls in the first place. I went ahead and spent 6 of them for a 'treasure', only to receive a measly 255 algae in return. I could've easily harvested those (complete waste of pearls/rip off) . . .<br />The 'exchange' only works between pearls (yet again) and sand dollars, there's just so much you can do with sand dollars. It'd be way more helpful to be able to exchange those copious unused amounts of sand dollars for either algae or how about some more pearls!!!!!<br />But the one that takes the cake for me is my latest rare fish, apparently he needs 9000 algae to produce a pearl (and NO I didn't accidentally used one too many zeros!!!) . . . this fish then produces a pearl every 48 hours, provided he's fed. There's NO way to harvest that much algae in that amount of time, so I guess you'd be expected/advised to buy them. The largest bundle of algae is $20 for 6000 algae meaning you'd need 3 bundles over 3 days for 2 feedings for 2 pearls >>>> I LET YOU DO THE MATH!!!!  . . .<br />This is supposed to be a game for KIDS, I find it shameless the way the developers are trying to get them to pay for a supposedly 'free' game . . . don't get me wrong I wouldn't mind paying for the OCCASIONAL extra, but expecting customers to shell out very real $60 in a span of 3 days is beyond ludicrous!!!!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My daughter loves this app. I even play it with her. it keeps her occupied for a little bit &amp; it is easy for her to use.
B0087ITBT8|5.0|Grear movie love it love Barbra Streisand very funniy If you have a chance to see it and then buy it
B002N5N5M0|1.0|When I received the package containg the fourth season, it had the second season DVDs in the fourth season box. Very unreliable for buying his product and future products for movies.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Had no idea what to expect when rented this book. Sad to learn of how orphans were treated in Ireland not so long ago.
B005OK722U|3.0|If you enjoyed the first two Eli Roth Hostel's, then you may be a little disapointed in the third installment.  It's the classic case of a different director trying to tie up the triolgy and make it an instant hit.  I think it missed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game will keep you busy for hours! If you're going on a road trip this will definitely pass the time!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This  game  is one my grandson loves!  my daughter has a kindle fire  and she talked me into buying one . I'm so  glad I did. such a great thing !  not just for me  for my grandkids also! This  game  is amazing for car trip.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The ending blew me away.  I sometimes wished the author spent a little more time on the other characters but thoroughly enjoyed the book and it has been awhile since I was in that space.  I recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It did what it was supposed to do.  The alarm went off and I woke up.  Interface is easy to use.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|If you love fantasy, war, romance, treachery, evil, heroes than these books are for you. An addictive read, once you start you are in till the end
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I agree this game has great graphics an is addictive to play, but in order to get full enjoyment out of this game you will need to spend some cash.
B0081L391C|5.0|This movie is full of really funny laughs, both characters, dialogue and set pieces.  I won't give away spoilers, but so many funny moments and lines.  And the characters both change in ways that are actually charming,so that you are really rooting for them by the end.  A truly enjoyable, fun movie.  Lots of F-Bombs and sex and drug jokes, so not great for kids.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I really loved this game after playing it at a friend's house, so I downloaded it on to my Kindle Fire. The game USUALLY works fine, but sometimes it doesn't open or freezes my Kindle Fire. Also, I bought the extra levels because I had finished the regular levels. I was almost finished with the extra levels, I shut down my Kindle Fire or something like that, and didn't play for a long time, and then, when I opened it the next time, it didn't seem to recognize that I had purchased the extra levels! And when I went to the Scribblenauts store, to try and buy the levels again, but it said that I had bought them! I deleted the app, reinstalled it, worked fine, same problem AGAIN.  I really recommend this game, but keep in mind about the freezing and crashing. I don't want the technical issues to discourage you from getting this app, though. Because it is a great one, despite the issues. Different people have different opinions. I hope this helps you make a decision (and I hope that decision is to get this app because you'll have tons of fun!).
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters and twists and dialogue continue to be incredible in this series.  I did not love the switch from peace time Downton to war time -- I missed the simple twists and turns and soap opera drama of a family and its servants.  But this certainly added a new dimension and pushed the characters further from their comfort zones.  One of the great series on TV today, a trip back in time.  Amazing that a show so simple can be so good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I adore this show! Could not stop watching once I started.  Cannot wait for Season 4!! If you haven't started watching -- start now!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I love Bruce Willis and this character.  His relationship with his son was fun.  And there was some great action.  But at a certain point, it was all action.  No real twists or character surprises.  The ultimate villainous plot was just fair - a money grab, surrounding the Chernobyl power plant, that was kind of confusing and not so interesting.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I read the entire series in less than 3 weeks.  I couldn't put them down.  I was devastated when it was over.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Kool game need to really think ....how would you get out ?where do you look ? Is what makes it fun!!!  Greatgame!!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is the best app ever..I look forward to seeing my dragons everyday! will not get bored or burnt out as there are plenty of tasks and fun stuff.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|this game here sucks.....they need to fix the kinks in the game...it freeze to much...and you never get to finish your game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool game. It would be better with different music. A must have if you like puzzle games.every one should get this app.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Great movie, very typical from this director. Jamie does great job in this and found it funny and entertaining. That is what I expected and it delivered.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book but after a couple of chapters I couldn't put it down! I haven't seen the movie yet but after reading this book I am going to make sure I do!
B007I6GCT2|5.0|This was a great addition to the Star Trek family. Very enjoyable and can't wait to see the next movie.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a splendid short novel. Some may complain about the length, but it was perfect for telling this bittersweet, elegiac, thoughtful and, yes, terrifying story. The details of the story don't quite make sense, but they are not supposed to (who/what exactly are the Hempstocks, fleas, hunger birds, etc.). The themes and emotions make sense, and that is what matters.<br /><br />The framing device of a middle aged man temporarily remembering what happened to him when he was seven years old works wonderfully. It really shows the differences between childhood and adulthood, and SPOILER (maybe all of us have a forgotten story of how we lost our heart before becoming adults).<br /><br />4.5 stars (rounding up for resonating so much with so few words)
1439196834|5.0|funny plan and simple of of the plays i knew because i love HIMYM and watch it a lot but some of them are fun reading for the first time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought it was a good game. my niece plays it all the time and she loves it. I'm ready for more levels.
143911000X|5.0|I carry it around with me its a great convo starter funny and great SUIT UP and be a WINGMAN lol
B00D2K40WY|3.0|I think this is a fun game but it gets boring after a little while I hate that u have to buy just about everything in the game me I give it 1 thumb up and 1 thumb down
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This was an emotional rollercoaster of a book, written with brilliance. It took Harold Fry on such an amazing journey, you could just imagine yourself there, such a voyage of discovery.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Hang in there. The first 40 minutes or so are slow. I had low expectations and so thought that this was some kind of high-handed indictment of the pharmaceutical industry from Hollywood. I almost walked away. Then, the set pieces in place, the movie kicks into gear and... you'll appreciate not having any spoilers. A most gratifying movie. Well worth your time and a bowl of popcorn!
B008L1F91A|5.0|This figure has great detailing, a great metallic paint job and a fantastic pose. Some people will not like the head sculpt, but I for one am a fan of it. It's hard to go wrong picking up a Kototbukiya figure. Also this line of DC figures look great together on the shelf.  This &#34;figure&#34; has no articulation. So don't pick it up for your kid to play with. This is for adult collectors only in my opinion.
B002K0WBYG|5.0|all women exec need to see this movie just in case they have a male assistant<br />see that all are treated equally
B00992CF6W|3.0|the game is ok but now lava can burn wood and it has burned every building in creative mode down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many unexpected twists! This book was the first I have read in several months and am already anticipating being sad when I finisth Gillian Flynn's other two books.
B00701L5XS|5.0|This app is absolutely the best app for knots I have seen. I have a few books on knots and have checked out other apps (as knots fascinate me plus, working in the building trades often requires the use of various different knots). It is very clear and simple to see how to make them. The fact that you can slow it down is great! I would highly recommend this app! Excellent job!
159463176X|2.0|So looked forward to Hosseni's #3.  It is difficult to write an &#34;epic&#34; if the central characters are hackneyed and predictable.<br />Real corny.  Perhaps #4 will get him back to honest writing rather than apparent bestseller frenzy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. I can not stop playing it. It is fun and very challenging the further along you get.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|I have several Ryan Adams CDs. This is one of the best, if not the best.  In my opinion, his first two CDs had no bad songs on them.  I have not felt that way about any of his CDs since &#34;Ashes and Fire.&#34; This CD is full of huge emotion, and the lyrics seem very intimate.  They are lyrics that I think most can relate to.  The music is very creative, with changed time signatures ( I am a guitar player );  For instance, &#34;Ashes and Fire&#34; the song, is in 6/8.  The first three songs just hooked me, and I was in another world. If you love Ryan Adams' music, then you may find this CD to be a masterpiece like I do.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|I would give it 3.5 stars if possible. It was entertaining and well produced but the story was fairly predictable and the characters were the typical good-guy/bad-guy types. All said, it was entertaining and I didn't feel like I was cheated in any way. If you're looking for a good action movie to watch, you won't be disappointed.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Thought this was a well written drama. I enjoy watching the series and the way the cases unfold. Highly Recomend
0810970686|4.0|There was some wear and tear which is to be expected because it is a used book, but my daughter doesn't seem to mind.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|When I got the app I thought it was free but when the models came up you could only pick one and for makeup dresses and accessories you only had about 3 you could pick and the rest you have to pay for. Even though when you get the app it says Free but when you get into the app you have to buy stuff.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I do really like this game. However, I don't like the daily reminders to play. I play in my leisure time which is not that often. If I find out how to switch off daily reminders, then I can say this is a five star game.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I had some initial issues with the program running all the way through.  It would get stuck.  I called the Amazon Help Desk and they assisted me in getting the app to run.  I did enjoy it.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This is one of the few games that I give a five star rating.<br /><br />The goal of game is to take the people across the river and to save them from the mummies. You gain powers, such as lightning bolt, as you play. You also have a certain amount of people you need to save out of all the people to pass the level. The difficulty does slowly increase, which I first doubted after playing about five levels--so I'm glad that it isn't impossibly difficult after a little while or simply easy throughout the game. It gives the player a nice increase.<br /><br />The graphics are just adorable and very nicely done, though it reminds me of Paper Mario. The sounds are great, though after about level five, I just turned it off. I liked the introduction of the game and thought it was cute.<br /><br />Overall, the price of $1 did kinda surprise me as it's a very good amount to pay for this game. Most times, great games to play are at least $3--so I'd give this game five stars alone for the price. I don't see any issues on my kindle fire, which is always nice! I would definitely recommend this game to everyone!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Seems like a movie disconnected from the original Rings.  Not worth watching and very non engrossing, rent something else. Fruit loops.
B005K17RU0|1.0|For me, it was clunky to use and didn't have the items I normally look for in a weather app.<br /><br />other people may like this app., but for me it didn't fit my needs. I found the WAPP app much better.
B00005N6KG|4.0|The headphones are lightweight and fit quite well. I would recommend them. The price is right. They are very good.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I never thought I would get hooked on Angry Birds, but did very fast. This new version is more fun than the original and has a lot of new items going on. If you are looking for a more addictive AB game, check out the RIO version. that one is definitely my favorite.
B0085W09ME|5.0|I think this is the best thing since sliced bread. Instead of me going from site to site or using one of those travel sites with million gazillon ads, this is AWESOME. I use it all the time to find flights and compare rates.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is my favorite out of the Angry Birds collection. I could play it over and over again without getting bored. I love the new sections, and the addition of new &#34;birds&#34; with different functions makes this game so much fun
B004GYY714|4.0|This works much the same as a traditional radio and allows me to access many services that I enjoy. Podcast are also available but subscribing is not as far as I can tell.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I am quite certain that I will never climb any high mountains during my lifetime, but reading Cheryl Strayed's description of her odyssey was almost the next best thing. She is a very gutsy lady who isn't ashamed to describe her adventure in the most honest way. I couldn't help myself - I had to describe her adventures to my husband and my friends even if they didn't particularly want to hear them. I don't generally read books about endurance or mountain climbing, but &#34;Wild&#34; was about overcoming your own limitations and fears. Highly recommended!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Great show.  I love keeping up with this crowd.  Amazon was quick and easy.  They made it nice to be able to watch back to back without commercials!:). Highly recommend!
1881273873|5.0|I love this book.  I'm in a relationship, and this book is great for building that relationship as well as other relationships - coworkers, family, roommates, and more.  I recommend it to friends frequently.  I've read the original (married) edition as well, and found this one to be much more relevant to the life of a single.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great...definitely ready for new levels.  Lots of fun...simple idea executed in a well developed game. Good job all the way around.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Awesome graphics. If you like tower defense games this one is a must have!!!<br />Normal level is generally difficult enough particularly at or above 15th set for a level.
B00932A4XE|3.0|The movie did a decent job showing how families in different stages of life go through a pregnancy.  There are plenty of other ways to spend a couple hours but if you are expecting, its very entertaining since you can relate to a lot of the scenes.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Being a Queensryche fan for over 25 years, and like many other fans of this band, we know what the Queensryche sound is supposed to be, and this is it.  For the last 15 years, the band has suffered from lackluster sales and sub par releases, but the self-titled release, QUEENSRYCHE, sets a new standard of performance, and delivers.  From the classic dual guitar sound, the tight drums, and pounding basslines, they also present new powerhouse vocalist, Todd La Torre, formerly of Crimson Glory.  Once you hear La Torre belt out Where Dreams Go To Die, you're hooked--- at least this listener was.  Not to mention that this lineup does justice to the classics: Queen of the Reich, En Force and The Prophecy.  This album is easily 4.5 out of 5 stars, a near perfect release for those fans starving for the true Queensryche sound.
B004C0WVP6|5.0|Seagate makes the best drives, and this one served it's purpose. It holds all my data and keeps it secure. I love the S.M.A.R.T drive feature that lets you know if your drive is going to fail. A great addition to any computer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Brilliant I love the new thing with selection of wardrobe for tricky and the other dude but there should have them on them all
1451627297|1.0|wow .. how could a novel that starts of so spectacularly crash and burn so dramatically?  loved the first 1/3 of this book - taut, exciting, cant-turn-the-pages fast enough reading.  very very good.  then, our character goes down the rabbit whole for a 5 year jaunt and my god the wheels come off this book in a hurry.  honestly, after about 30 pages into his 'adventures' in jodie, TX i could not read anymore.  and that is where the book has sat approximately 40% read for the past two weeks.  each time i pick it up and try to finish i fall asleep.  still a king fan, but man..what happened?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy the challenge of all the various puzzles.  Some are simple but others quite challenging and have to b e done in a certain order. I loved it!
B00C0UHGLO|5.0|Perfect implementation of the realworld game. A little bit small for a phone, so i recommend this one for a tablet.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|i hadn't heard from these guys for awhile.  was still listening to their last album and then i saw the great news about the new one.  heard the new song and loved it first listen.  preordered the cd.  everything gets better with age that includes Depeche...excellent cd.  don't hesitate buying it.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great script. Really enjoyed the whole movie. Makes me look forward to the sequel!!!! Cast was truly ensamble - although Downey always steals the show.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|this book had me laughing from start to finish. not only is Tina very witty, but shes (obviously) an incredible writer.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Much better than 100 floors! Even my kids enjoy searching for hidden clues in order to solve the puzzles.<br />Some of the floors are tougher than others but so far they are all solvable.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I haven't had alot of time to try it out but I think it is more for younger children and someone who might have more time than myself.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As with the rest of his books it is a story well told.  I would recommend to a friend. OK
B00AREIAI8|5.0|as everyone already said the app has great animations and is fun also everyone that post a coment just wanted the 3 free gems that you get if u do but it's a cool game any way.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Although it follows the basic plot of the book, like with every book made into movie, for the sake of story-line it differs in many ways from the book. If you're a fan of the series, the movie wont be your favourite, unless you take it for what it is: an adaptation of the first book in a series. All in all, I did find it entertaining.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I liked the movie, it reminded me of the movie -  the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel - which was also a good one.  There are pluses in being with people with the same background, having a lot in common.  But it is also interesting being in a place that everybody comes from a different background and you learn about their lives and experiences or basically learn new things.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|Brazil, Fast Cars, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker plus Elsa Pataki and The Rock to boot? What else do you need?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A good story written well. This is my first time reading a Landay book an d I would definitely read his others books. It was a surprise ending.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|IF you're a fan of action, then this is for you.  If you also believe that bad guys can also be good guys (sometimes), then this is for you.
B001JRB16U|5.0|My first-grade daughter saw part of Mary Poppins on TV, but was not able to finish it because we had to leave.  I decided to order it for her, and it was a good decision.  It is now her favorite movie.  She loves Dick Van Dyke and the music and the humor - and so do I.
0307352153|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend of mine.  I enjoyed reading it and bought a copy for my daughter as well.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I was ordering Mary Poppins for my first-grade daughter and decided to get this title as well.  She and her older sister love it!  The producer and director and some actors have ties to the James Bond movies.  Fun trivia.
125000098X|5.0|Good book. make  sure read all books in this series. I cant really compare to other series have not read any.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love adventure and I haven't seen the movie yet but it gives you a great dose of what is in the movie I love this game!!
B00006D295|5.0|this dvd is a great addition to my film collection. it arrived in perfect condition and vert fast also. i would order from this outfit again and again....david
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I could not put this book down. The writer has been there in the dysfunctional shop they describe so well. I felt as though I worked with the people at this company. Highly recommended for anybody in IT, especially those in decision-making capacity!
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|I really wish I hadn't spent the money in renting this . But I am oh so thankful I did not go to the theater and see it or I would be really disappointed.  This movie was really lame .
B003G4W49C|4.0|It's all too easy to forget that this story is about a child. The depth of the characters and the clear intelligence that the protagonist displays mask that well. While some of the plot is easy to infer, there are twists that make it worth it. I'm a long time sci-fi fan, and only now just began reading Orson Scott Card -- worth the wait! I hope the movie adaptation doesn't fail utterly!
037582913X|5.0|This is one of those books that you use the voices, and really get into when you read it to your kid.  My daughter and I loved this book when she was little.  Sent this to a friend.  Great price.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|On the first level,I completed the horse puzzle, but nothing happened.If it was solvable,it would probably be a four or five star.but until then...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Are you at work?  Nothing to do?  No customers to help?  Well I was, and this game was the result.  I downloaded it and played it for a while and fell in love with it.  It forces you to think (which is rare in today's world).  I really enjoy playing it and I believe that you will too!
B005HESINU|5.0|The four episodes I purchased and downloaded came through fuzzy, not distinct and clear as a new show ought to be.  I don't know how to clear up the issue - DO YOU?<br /><br />THIS EPISODE OF STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST OF THE SERIES.  IT DEPICTS HOW SPECIES WHO CANNOT \\"NORMALLY\\" COMMUNICATE COME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER ON A RUDEMENTARY LEVEL.  THIS IS MEANINGFUL FOR HUMANKIND AS A WHOLE - WE MUST LEARN TO SEE THINGS FROM ONE ANOTHER'S POINT OF VIEW AND NOT JUDGE OTHERS BASED ENTIRELY UPON OUR OWN PERSPECTIVES.  IT RELATES TO INTERNATIONAL, INTER-RELIGIONAL, AND INTERDENOMINATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.  WE MAY DISAGREE PROFOUNDLY, BUT WE MUST LEARN TO GET ALONG, NONETHELESS!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This was a great movie in that it depicts how the south was in a less then memorable time incur history. Although Hollywood, it does speak to a chapter in our history.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Lots of Action a bit of Romance, conspiracy, great actors. Fun story-line. Not a kid movie. Fun for the average guy and girl.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Not one of my favorite series, I think it is for the younger generation, not someone in their 60's.<br /><br />PHYLLIS BOND
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My daughter just loves this toy! Their are all types colors and textures to explore. She loves chewing on the teether and the rings and squeezing the crinkly &#34;foot&#34; of the giraffe. The entire bottom of the giraffe crinkles too which was a nice surprise. Overall a great product for this age to keep them entertained and happy!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I don't whether I enjoyed the book more or the movie, they are both great, book is enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Phyllis Bond
B000KFB4PK|5.0|My aunt has this watch, so I was thrilled to see it offered.  My only problem is that my grandson is five, and although he loves Legos, he was a bit youngto be thrilled with the watch in that it did not hold his interest.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The book kept me riveted to each page.  i could not<br />wait for the next trip down the &#34;rabbit hole&#34;
0811879542|5.0|Like the concept, and allows for the reader to have some fun as they read it with their child. Best for younger toddlers I think.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show, excellent plot line and wonderful characters round out this wonderful show. Great interaction between the cast and sexy play between the lead character and the paralegal in the show. This is a must see!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun and entertaining game! I enjoy playing this game. Subway Surf is a good way to relax.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very addictive ...can't wait for more rooms to conquer ... fun to play but more challenging with multiple rooms per level
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I'm still a huge fan of Sandra Bullock. I really loved this movie. Very good acting on each actor's part.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|There is almost NO chemistry between the actors and the characters are stereotypes.  Even Kevin Cline couldn't salvage anything entertaining from this.<br />This wasn't even entertaining enough to be satire.  I rated one star only because there was nothing lower.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Not a bad app but needs to be updated, Facebook is a big player in social media and should be updating more often like Twitter & Yahoo. This app is good and would recommend it to others, but the people at Facebook can do much better than this. And there should be more choices, so people don't have to settle with what is currently available. I no if it's not broke don't fix it works, but Facebook is losing out big compared to other social media sites. Many things that they could be taking advantage of.  To many ideas to discuss. Amazon is awesome, I'd give them 10 stars not just 5. Facebook should follow some of there marketing ideas..........  mattyg
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game[[ASIN:B00CWY76CC Can You Escape]] it has secret places to look plz rate it a 5 or less some of them are hard to escape
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter is almost on top when it comes to social media,  I love that you don't have the profile b.s. that Facebook asks for and you no who is real and who isn't. Facebook catfish and people making fake profiles is destroying many people's lives. Twitter allows you to find out who your talking/chatting with and if they real or not.  Like celebrities, Twitter varies that there really who they say they are. Which is awesome.  Also love that you can improve  and get your website out to the world via Twitter. Amazon/Twitter are awesome..... keep up the amazing work....  mattyg
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is never blurry and is very cheap the only in APP money is if you want more diamonds or coins and they give you some of those through out the game this is the nest horse game ever
B006GWO5NE|5.0|As we all know normal USB B mini's do not fit well in the Kindle fire. This cord fits perfectly. I like the texture of the cable and length. It doesn't seem to want to kink or twist up.<br /><br />I think this cable will last a long time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game I love horse and I'm glad it is free to I play it a lot I just wish things weren't so expensive
B008ULRY78|5.0|I thought this would be pretty boring, but it ended up being a really nice action movie. Although the ending could have been better.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My opinion is yes it's really FUN!!!!!!!!!And it's really FUN if you don't have a pet or if you do.
B00C2VIA52|1.0|I have been playing this game for a while and I loved it!! But just recently the servers have crashed on me. I am frustrated and angry at these shenanigans. Update the servers or else ill keep my one star review and never ever purchase anything at Gameloft ever again. Not only that But ill let my forum find out and have all of my 19000 followers to seize purchases at Gameloft.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was fun, challenging at times and simple at others. My only qualm is that it only has ten levels. Add more and then I shall give you 5 stars.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I love puzzles so I thought this would be great. I installed it on my Kindle Fire HD. It started up just fine, started a puzzle but had to stop. When I went back clicked on icon and got nothing but a black screen. Removed from devise and re-installed. I got a repeat of the work then not. I have removed this from my Kindle.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|This is a game I will rate. Mutant roadkill is all I needed to see to get th game. You have jeeps turrets and guns. With upgrades u can smash vehicles in half. Great game.
B004N6369Y|4.0|A great story. The Authors fascination with France is getting old and sometimes predictable.<br />But, this is a great book.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Yup, it's a blow 'em up, shoot 'em up tour de force, but it employs several stars in loveable roles. Loveable spoof. looking forward to RED 2. since I heard there is going to be one.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|If you need a basic calculator for your kindle then this is it. Nothing fancy, but does what i need it to.
B00CRVZRUS|4.0|This review is from: The Beatles - Help! [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)<br />In \\"Help!\\" The Beatles second film the band seem almost like guest stars or an after thought in this comedy inspired by The Goons and the satirical pop art stylings of director Richard Lester. There's more of a story here but it hardly revolves around the band themselves focusing on the MacGuffin-like Ring that Ringo sports on his hand and that proves to be essential to an Eastern cult's practice; whomever wears the ring will have his or her throat cut. It's a pretty dark subject matter for a film that spoofs everything from the James Bond films to films starring pop stars.<br /><br />Truly bizarre at times and clearly influencing Monty Python's Flying Circus, \\"Help!\\" Is a fascinating mixture of the surreal and whimsical with some terrific songs from the band. Even when some of the gags in the film don't quote work, the band manages to sell them with their charm and charisma.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks looks extremely good but there are certain digital artifacts suggesting that this might be an older HD transfer. That's not necessarily a bad thing as most folks won't notice these artifacts and some won't see them at all. Colors are bold and the detail is quite nice throughout with film grain not buried under heavy handed digital noise reduction.<br /><br />The lossless surround track sounds very nice depth and presence particularly during the musical interludes which visually clearly influenced MTV a decade later. The 5.1 mix can't match a contemporary film that was intended for exhibition in that format. The presentation is clear with remarkably detail for a film that is 48 years old.<br /><br />The special features included here are exactly the same as the DVD edition.<br /><br />We get the three featurettes on the film with one focusing on the makong of the film, one on the restoration done for the previous 2007 release for the The Beatles in Help!

B005USZML4|4.0|Cool I loved it .very exciting complicated this book was the best and Theo was A nice character  interesting fun
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Why I waited so long to watch this show is unknow to me but whatever you &#34;thought&#34; this show was about and decided not to watch......change your mind!!!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It's just so....sketchy. The way it actually works is just.....so weird. I'm only 13, I can't explain it real well. But it's just........no.... :-/
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|Yeah, much of the acting is nothing to write home about, and there is no real character development or extensive backstory on the protagonists, but so what? This is a kick-A, balls-to-the-wall action movie, which features Navy Seals overcoming huge odds to destroy some very despicable people. This is a very good action flick. If you're looking for something more than that, try Shakespeare.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Gives you so many ways to create knew hair styles. I do t know what some people are talking about that it won't Download. Maybe it's because I have an HD. 6 BILLION stars for this game.
B0038P59A0|5.0|It is what I expected, but that being said I really enjoyed it.  I liked the feeling that you were able to get in the mind of Sherlock Holmes and that he looks at the world in a way that is different from everybody else.
044100590X|5.0|It is not an easy read.  But when I first read this book at the age of 14, I was instantly hooked.  I am a Dune lover.  I have read the entire series by Frank Herbert at least 5 times.  This book alone, I have read at least 20 times.  I highly recommend this book to everyone that enjoys science fiction.  Then when you read it and you get through the books that follow this, I recommend picking up the rest of the saga as written by Brian Herbert and Frank Anderson,
B001XVD21Y|5.0|I don't know why I never saw this in the theatre but when I finally saw it, I loved it.  There are plenty of twists and turns and I thougt all of the big named actors fit their roles really well.  I was able to get immersed in the movie while watching it on an airplane.  I would recommend it as one of my favorites.
B00C4QLUFM|5.0|Now I don't have to worry about losing my DVD copy because its online and I can watch one of my favorite movies anywhere.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Great product and a must have for the multi room kindle user. My wife keeps her kindle fire charged all the time now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the challenges that got better each level. looking forward to more when do the next levels come out?  thank you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I wish that we in America could get this at the same time as the UK. Loved it, however, thanks
B004TI5N38|3.0|The book was ok. It was light reading. Rambled a but in some places. I have read a few of this author's books.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I don't have much trouble getting to sleep but this app is so peaceful and very easy to adjust to your liking
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very entertaining, just a quickie summary of the characters and the story line.  Fun to watch.  Go for it Downton lovers.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|The best watch i have purchase yet. I get lots of compliments and its just very classy. Thank you so much!
B00BC24NT4|3.0|I can't help but wonder if this is actually a recent LeCarre or a re-release of one of his first efforts. I suppose I could track that down but it doesn't interest me enough to do so. Regardless, I read the whole thing and found a few engaging places but, overall, it was pretty poor when compared to others he's written and I've enjoyed. The plot skips all over the place before it finally lines out and the reader figures out what's going on. Perhaps it is supposed to be that way to reflect the confusion of the secret world he writes about. There was no character that I connected with with interest and concern. It was a big ho-hum for me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Excellent game! Challenging, but not impossible. Very creative, and it makes you think.<br />Can't wait for more levels. Highly recommend!
0307477401|5.0|Like Firewall, this is a purchase for my mother-in-law. If you haven't read his boooks, do so - you'll get hooked
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not crazy, uses the brain, works well. Reminds me of games played when younger. Find key to open next level. Creative mind game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible that I have ever seen.Tons of languages and it has an audio setting on it.That's just too cool.
0679805273|4.0|Since this will be a gift later in the year, I cannot review it today.<br />I did receive this very quick.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Very nice movie about a girl who seeks out her cousin and helps him to walk again with help from the gardener's son even though other people watching over him try everything they can to prevent it.  It is about a father/uncle's love for his children and his wife.  The girl loved gardens and wanted to bring the garden back to life even though the tragedy occurred there.  Something people could watch with their children to teach them the value of trying to fix something even if it seems too hard at the time.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Just started learning and this is the best app for that. Always been afraid to try. Thank you for this app
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a quiet book that evolves with a deeper and darker back story than first indicated.  Charlie's conflicted life unfolds in letters  written to an anonymous friend that are both heartbreaking and witty.  I enjoyed the book very much.
B000JMKO3C|3.0|The story picked up quite fast in the initial stages but lost touch eventually. its becomes too slow and tedious in the middle which causes the reader to loose interest...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Hazel is a sixteen year old girl who has more to deal with than lugging around an oxygen tank and trying to survive a rare form of lung cancer; she needs to save her parents, fall in love with a hot guy, endure incredible pain, and find a way to get to Amsterdam to meet the author of her favorite book to demand answers about imaginary characters !  John Green's writing is witty and crafted with tidbits of genius and insight.  The characters seem too real to ignore, and by the end I'm rooting for Hazel against all odds.  I'll recommend this book to all readers who can handle the idea of a misfit heroine with more courage and insight than her tender years should warrant.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Today's Amazon free paid app of the day (6/26/2013) is Open Sea! (Go Down Mo!) from the Pixelizers.<br /><br />When I saw the art of the app icon and The Pixelizers logo screen I was not that impressed.  But when I saw that great short little intro film clip, I started to change my mind.  Then I played the first round and found this to be a rather fun game.  I wanted to keep playing and playing it and wasn't getting bored with it right away like I have on some of the other somewhat recent free app of the day selections from Amazon.<br /><br />So I am giving this 5 stars.<br /><br />Here are some of the reasons why:<br /><br />1. Fun game that the whole family can enjoy.  This is like a Lemmings type game with a biblical theme.  Being a religious person or having biblical knowledge is not a requirement to enjoy this game.<br /><br />2. The game has decent graphics and sound.<br /><br />3. The game adds new things after every so many levels to keep it interesting.<br /><br />4. The game is not really huge in storage like some of the more popular games are.<br /><br />5. There appears to be few or no ads in this game.<br /><br />6. There appears to be no nagging for you to rate this app every so many minutes like so many apps seem to want you to do that have been free apps of the day in the past.<br /><br />So I hope some of these app companies are taking notes so they have a better idea why I might have rated their apps lower in the past.<br /><br />I also should point out that this is not a fake review.  In fact, this is review number 100 for me for an Amazon app.  Just click on my name and you will see that I have written 100 reviews now and that I am not some new overnight reviewer.  I have reviewed apps on Amazon for several months on and off when I have the time and I have something worthwhile to say like this app which managed to get a 5 star out of 5 star \\"miracle\\" rating from me (since I tend to set the bar high on my ratings).
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book was going good until the ending killed it. There must be a good reason for the book to end the way it did. I personally felt like the ending was not finished. I also dislike the fact that there is no happily ever after!
0316056863|4.0|Not what I had expected but it was a very sweet read. An interesting insight into her life and what makes comedy.
B00338QENI|5.0|Simply amazing, this was eye-opening and inspiring. Well written, informative, the stories within the story were of histories time will not forget because of writers like Rebecca.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This is by far an improvement over my expectations. There is but one word to describe this, a Masterpiece. FANTASTICAL!
B00499QUK2|5.0|This show is smart, clever and SO SO well acted. Watched the season shows quickly as I l really enjoyed them. THEN they said: no next season as actors have other engagements. UPROAR fr followers. NEXT: change: filming next season. YEA!! Both actors r excellent; Benedict C. Is enchanting. Am a HUGE fan & hoping for 12+ seasons!! 1 show = better than many movies for quality.
0425263924|1.0|I have just read many comments posted on the Amazon website regarding this \\"final book\\" in the trilogy--it was supposed to be trilogy.  Right?  Trilogy means 3 doesn't it??  I did not read any of the reviews before I read the book but if I had, I probably would have cancelled my order with Amazon.  Extremely disappointed with the ending.  Sylvia Day made her fans wait so long for this book--I believe she postponed the publishing date several times.  The first two books were wonderful and I could not wait for the final (HA!) book to be published.  Last night I finished the book and could not believe the ending!  What a let down to your fans Sylvia.  I for one am finished purchasing any of her books in the future.  Good authors do not leave their fans hanging in this manner.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Very confusing and hard to follow. There were so many characters introduced, by the end, I had no idea who was who!
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This book is excellent.  We should all be taught this info from the time we're born!!  I would recommend this book to everyone&#62;
B002APU580|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law's birthday after her visit to us when she missed the ending.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a great writer,give us a good insight  how the turbulent history of his country affected day to day life of ordinary people ,to what point circumstance change peoples life.He is brilliant on his description of country and people
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|i loved this movie. Especially with Christoph Waltz. He basically stole the show. Another great quentin tarantino movie! Although i have to say that this movie is totally one sided, biased. but like i said, awesome movie!
B00CS7ZXFK|5.0|Many of these songs are \\"better\\" than the originals. Why do I feel this way? So much has improved over 4 track recording. I also think the guys' vocals are more mature and not as pinched as when they were kids. And... Let's face it. Every person on stage on this tour is such a professional that they literally all have bands of their own.<br /><br />The end result is true to the 60s, modern, and refreshing. What a real sonic treat that makes me forget about how 2013 sucks! Please send us some more if possible, guys. If not, thanks... For 42 songs life's good.<br /><br />BTW- David Marks is awesome on guitar and vocals. He takes lead on \\"Getcha Back\\" and I like this much better than the culture-club bleached original. Oh if only they had let David rejoin in 1972. I still miss Carl and Dennis and their absence is truly felt. Get the album. You won't be sorry.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|best game ever- you can get huge dragon's and little dragon's to I hope you like this game<br />I hope you have a good time
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Wow, just as I was going to buy the book I read the reviews. I was looking forward to an ending not a continuation. I asked my daughter if the book was as bad as the reviews said and her reply was yes. I'm done with this series, these characters, and this author.<br /><br />Sylvia, you should have stuck to the original plan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It takes some thought and that's what makes it fun! But then it becomes hard to put down! Check it out!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is a really fun little game...the kids and I love it<br />just wish all my gameplay transferred over when I got my new kindle fire
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one of the best apps ever! It is so entertaining and challenging! It's totally an amazing time killer! Fun to play with and mess around! It reminds me of Angry Birds...except that game got &quot;old&quot; really fast! This one never will! I love this game and you will too!<br /><br />  Keep on Gaming<br />  Chloe
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Sounded cool but I couldn't get it to do the second download on my Kindle Fire. I had to uninstall it.
0446547638|2.0|I really did not enjoy this book, and I usually love Nicholas Sparks.<br /><br />One of my dislikes was the love interest of the story. Yes, the development of Dawson and Amanda was written well so that was fine. But I did not like Amanda's character at all, it seems she never did tell the truth about anything, not even in her marriage. And then once I had gotten to the plot twist towards the end, I was able to predict what the ending was. Meh, I wish I didn't read this, it made me sad how he portrayed marriage (and I've read other books by Nicholas Sparks where he has done a fantastic job, even when it is suppose to be sad).
B008FC4WA4|1.0|Just when things get interesting, the little book ends, kind of what feels like the middle. It's more like a downloaded sample and I'm looking for the next chapter. At $1.99 it comes out too about 7 cents a page.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm 13 and I love this game!! It's very realistic and has great graphics! It's easy to earn coins so you really don't need real money to play so it's really free. I love taking care of .My horses and winning competitions :)
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone should view this movie!!!  It really makes you aware of what's going on in the food industry and why we should think about  &#34;What are we eating&#34;!
B004QR4H3O|5.0|I absolutely loved the way that Jean François-Ménard was able to translate words like &#34;Ravenclaw&#34; (Serdaigle) and &#34;Hogwarts&#34; (Poudlard) and he managed to keep the original meaning of most, if not all, words.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|If you're wondering what to watch with young grandkids, (8+) then this will be well received. quite well done. good show.
B00AVTMCYW|4.0|Saw the film, then read the novel. The film did not ruin the novel for me. That renders it a 'Like'
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|My boyfriend and I rented this movie on a Saturday night. I had been looking forward to it since the first time I saw the preview! When it came on, Jeffrey put his arm around me! Most of his friends call him Jeff and his parents do too, but I call him Jeffrey. My dad was being a jerk and made us leave the door open so I told Jeffrey to put his arm down in case my dad came in and he'd been drinking. He said, \\"Brit, will you please call me Jeff?\\" and I said, \\"ugh. Fine! You call me Brittany, then!\\" And he rolled his eyes at me and made that stupid noise that boys make but I didn't even care because I had my period anyways. Like, really bad.<br /><br />I liked the part where the zombies' hearts beat again and you could see it (but you couldn't really...the movie just let you, like, see it? But you couldn't, like, see it if you were there).<br /><br />But, seriously, don't go out with Jeff.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|This summer blockbuster is low on story line but is still entertaining. A lot of buildings are destroyed with tons of damage!
B0018RFLN0|4.0|This mission impossible team is this flick is just Tom Cruise without a team. Enjoyed the movie however. The action on the train is stupendous. Saw MI I-IV consecutively on Amazon Prime and really enjoyed all four. Ready for 5.  They should add a younger man that can eventually replace Tom Cruise/Ethan Hawke as the leader of the team so the franchise can continue.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|NICE search &amp; find mystery game give it a try.  Well did you u download it yet  few more words really come on
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|couldn't get it to load, couldn't get it to run, couldn't get it to work at all. it may work for somebody but for me it did not work at all.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Peter pan is one of my favorites and I bought it for my three year old grandson who enjoyed it as much as I did!
0739375970|1.0|I was disappointed with audio book 4 of this series but this volume was worse still.<br /><br />It is obvious that the author has run out of ideas or direction for the characters and is merely intent on dragging as many books out of his patrons as possible.<br /><br />The characters go from one disaster to the next. Any direction they had is lost in the next disaster. When characters or story lines end it is sudden and anti-climatic. Important changes in the story line deaths, escape from death, happen between chapters and with little explanation. The author is able to repeatedly create cliff hangers but doesn't seem to be able to move on from them. Very dissatisfying.<br /><br />The narrator is amateurish. He uses \\"voices\\" that don't match the characters. In particular the beautiful young women sound like old hags. He often can't separate the voices between two characters having a conversation.<br /><br />I was very taken by the first 3 books in this series or I would have stopped listening to this early on in the chapters. I kept thinking it HAD to get better. It didn't. It was boring, repetitive and wandering. Considering the cost, this book is is very poor quality both in the story and the narration. I wont be listening to the next book in the series.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|My grandson loved the movie! It is a classic worth watching over and over again! It is better than the movies they have for kids today!
0449011917|3.0|As others have indicated this audio book was very disappointing. I totally agree with what others have said. It simply was not up to the standard of the first books.<br /><br />I was particularly annoyed with the new narrator who apparently never prepped or took the trouble to listen to the pronunciations of some of the characters names from the first books. The result was very confusing for the first hour. The narrator also uses a Shakespearian style and over emphasizes in the wrong places. He settles down as the chapters go on but he never shows the quality of audio narrating that the first narrator in the series showed. His \\"voices\\" don't match the characters. All the beautiful young women sound like old hags and you often cant tell who is who during conversations between two characters. Just plain amateurish for such an expensive volume.<br /><br />At this point I have to read or listen to the next in the serious but this is going downhill fast....
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great.  Thanks so much. Amazon is the BEST!!!  I'm so happy to be able to charge my Kindle again!
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|This movie has a lot to offer the hero is not some grotesque freak but a kind of regular Joe who gets involved in an army experiment to make him into a super soldier.  I did not fall asleep as I do on some flicks.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|Dennis Lehane is never disappointing with his plot twists.  I have read everything he has written and have enjoyed them all.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|If you like ST:TNG (I do) then this is a must.<br />It's amazing how much they improved the original image quality! Where the enhancements really shine is in the space special effects. They didn't just clean it up, they added detail to improve upon what was and bring it up-to-date. For example, planets which had originally been featureless now have topography and atmospheres and moons and rings, etc... planetary rings! There was one episode where I noticed that not only did the planet now have a rings, but the Enterprise cast a shadow on the ring that moved with the Enterprise as it orbited! How cool is that?! That's a small detail and they didn't need to do that, but they did, and it was cool! There's lots of little improvements like that - and bigger improvements as well. Does the on-ship sets & tech still look a bit dated? Of course; the show ran from '87-'94 and there's only so much they could do, but they did everything they could and it looks great.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Those who love the stage musical version may not like this movie version. I do like it just for that reason: it's not an exact copy of what you know and love from the musical. Here are my thoughts:<br />1) Russell Crowe is not that bad. Yes, he could never sing notes and grand as Terrence Mann did but he does a decent job. If you really want to hear bad listen to Pierce Brosnan in Mama Mia.<br />2) Anne Hathaway brings incredible sadness to her role, as it should be. Great job, even if some lines she is crying her words.<br />3) The new song written for the movie so it could be nominated is forgettable.<br />4) I thought Hugh Jackman could have been better on some of his songs. Don't know why the performance wasn't 100%; we all know he's done musicals before and is an amazing performer.<br />5) Love this movie's take on Master of the House.<br />6) This version of &#34;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables&#34; is just as heart-rending as &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34;.<br /><br />It's not perfect but it's good enough to rate 5 stars. If you are a Les Miz purist you may not think so, but after having heard the musical so many times, I enjoy hearing this different take on it.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|The best alien series I've ever watched on TV.  Excellent acting and writing, keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Unbelievable.  I couldn't stop reading.  I had no idea what the book was truly about, and didn't think it was for me.  After many people telling me I had to read it I picked it up and 3 weeks later finished it.  Worth every penny!
B004XZR63M|1.0|Mr kiyosaki is an excellent motivational speaker, but his advice fluctuates from the absurd to down right illegal! Insider trading, illegal tax write offs, completely impossible financial gains in short time lines. He talks a good game & promises nothing, because most of the things he promotes are dangerous & some could get you sued or arrested! For a man who has been sued buy the company he hire to help him promote his book, to the fact that he doesn't own a single piece of property in his name or any of his company names. I find the source suspect.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|One of the very best books I've read.  The character development and story line is like no other.  I would recommend this to any woman who wants to fall in love with their spouse, again!
0061906220|5.0|There is a website you can go to to get a recorded song of the story.  My preschool class loved it.  They sing along and request it during any down time.
1597801577|5.0|this was another replacement for a lost library book. Again, perfect condition giving them a better copy for about 50% of the fine.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|Great album. Glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone who is a Fogerty fan. This was a really well done album with many great hits.
0811871258|5.0|I guess this is pop surrealism???  Got as a gift for someone whose artwork falls somewhere near this style.  He loved it.  Even if you're a fan of more classic styles, this is undeniably interesting stuff.
B0053O89IS|4.0|Based on a famous person and forensic anthropologist, Kathy Reichs and created by Hart Hanson.  The show depicts, in a fictional manner, how a Forensic Institute and the people who work in it interact with each other expertise; however is not that quick and easy.  They solve the killing within days of the murder with only, sometimes, an small amount and even bone fragments.  But I like the show, is a modern day Romeo and Juliet.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I had to watch twice to understand the movie. I like the concept of reincarnation. I was baffled at times. But when the end of the movie of all the characters together on that ship. it seems to me they went back to change history??
B00AB55BS0|4.0|I heard from other countries where it is being viewed the even though is a psyfi TV show, is well based and written.  If you like fiction and adventure with different characters or estrange or weird  beings, you would like it.  This TV show is based on a series of novels written by George R. Martin.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked the book.  I first watched the movie and then read the book because I loved the movie so much.  I enjoyed the book a lot even though the two were different.  I would suggest this book to others.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|WITH THE SAME DIRECTOR AS ALIEN. I EXPECTED RIDLEY SCOTT TO PRESENT  A GREATER HORROR SPECTACLE PRESENTATION. THE OPENING OF THE MOVIE WAS VERY CONFUSING IF NOT FILLED WITH HIGHER EXPECTATIONS.<br />HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED IF HE HAD USED A BETTER CAST. OVERALL THE LACK OF INTENSE SUSPENCE LEAFT<br />ME DISSAPONTED.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked the story a lot.  The writing was okay, pretty run of the mill, nothing that jumped out at me as oh wow, this is so well written.  Characters were well-drawn.For me, it was well plotted.  It was well structured.  And everything that happened had ample ground laid for it.  I never felt manipulated. Never quite understood the testifying parts...until it all came together.  All in all, it was a good read.  Not the literary fiction I usually enjoy (so okay, sometimes I am a snob) but all in all, an engrossing story and a page turner.  It will be a good movie.
0143036424|4.0|I typically can't stand mystery books but this was excellent. Really liked the character development, and how human and fallible the people in it were, while still holding something of rugged western feel.
B000001EGA|5.0|This is the last record Elton John recorded with his original band for several years, and one of the best.  The album is something of a concept album recounting, in fragments, Bernie Taupin and Elton John's early years together.  All of the songs are solid, there aren't a lot of hits (\\"Someone Saved my Life Tonight\\" was the only single off the album) but it's so good you'd never notice them missing.<br /><br />The final three songs (including \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\" and his remake of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\") are bonus tracks, they weren't on the original album.  They're all good songs even if they don't really fit in with the rest of the album.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|This season had its strong moments (Sybil, the wedding, the grandeur of Scotland), but had many throw away plot lines that either disappeared after a few episodes, or were far too boring to carry through an entire season.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I wish I could find more books like this one! I usually read crime novels, but this book was a nice change.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great cast, great scripts, great premise! What more could a guy want? Holmes is superb, Watson is excellent and Moriarty is sublime!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I am really enjoying this show. It really holds my interest and I would highly recommend it to everyone who loves courtroom dramas.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I very much Liked the film period.  People who buy this are in for the ride of their lives.  Jeremy Renner as always was exceptional in this role!  It met all my expectations and much more!<br /><br />Thank you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I  like  the game  because it is a very challenging and fun game and it Is a very<br />'unique game.
0307279189|5.0|This book brings together personal stories, historical race myths, and scientific evidence to show why everyone should run. It also will change the way you feel about running, and change the way you think while you run. It was an easy read, and fascinating.
B00B0A5XQU|3.0|I enjoyed book.  Very predictable, however, I still enjoyed!  Also, it deals with women's issues which appealed to me.  Light reading but good.
0679805273|5.0|Loved this book as a child, loved it when I graduated. And giving it for a graduation present made me so happy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good tool. Plenty of plans to choose from. Good way to immerse in God's Words when you are home or on the go. God bless.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a great game to play. My grandson plays and loves that he can send me gifts. I would recommend it to anyone.
B003KUSUG8|2.0|I just overall didn't like the music that was on the CD. I like other songs by Eminem better. You may like it though.<br /><br />One thing I did like though was the digital copy. It allowed me to hear the CD right after purchasing it instead of having to wait for the CD to come in the mail.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game. If you got it you will get addicted. You should get it. You really should
1780721676|5.0|Very informative book, outlines the reasoning behind the diet plan, I have been following the principals of 5/2 diet for a month now and have lost 2.5kgs and its the easiest thing I have ever done
B00CWY76CC|5.0|When looking for a game that my kid would like and I would approve of, I came across this one. It kept him engaged and challenged through all 10 floors. He loves puzzles and these gave him the right amount of challenge to help him with problem solving skills and being observant about his surroundings. I played this game to and it challenged me as well. If you love puzzles you will love this app.
B000PAU032|3.0|It's good for easy listening only - I prefer the more creative, classical talents of John Williams' film music.  Zimmer just isn't the composer I anticipated.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My dad got this game and said it was fun I loved it when I got it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get this app
B000FC1LOC|4.0|It made me want to see the movie - which I did.  Very moving and thought-provoking.  Probably a chick flick, though.  And a girly-book.  But I couldn't put it down.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|This game is awesome I stood up for hours playing this game. Never thought it would be this much fun
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Awesome, loved it. Can't wait for the next one. Action packed and funny.  Marvel did a great job.  If they ever finally do a JLA movie they have high standards to live up to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game . It's really addictive and fun . I recommend this to any horse lovers out of there .
B005BDZQKU|5.0|I've read some reviews that say the picture quality is no as good as expected.  After watching this movie (which I bought for my wife as a birthday present), I can say that I DO NOT know what these people are talking about.  The picture is so clear, I can see the original film grain.  We also own the DVD and we did a comparison of the opening &#34;flying over New York City&#34; sequence.  The DVD was very clear on my 55&#34; HDTV.  But when I played the same segment from the Blu-Ray, it popped out of the screen!!  You can see the individual cars on the streets far below and can make out the extreme details of the crowd in Yankee Stadium!!!  We were seriously impreed.  The colors are stunning too.  In the opening song where the boy slams his fist against a red wall prompted vocal reactions form everyone in the room.  The red was so deep and vibrant.  I'm very satisfied with the quality.<br /><br />The packaging on the 50th Anniversary edition is quite nice.  It comes with the Blu-Ray AND the DVD version and a copy of the songs reinterpreted by other artists.  The nice touch is also a separate blu-ray disk with extras.  Usually studios give you the extras on a standard resolution DVD, not blu-ray.  That was nice.  The book is interesting and the postcard size international movie posters are nice too.  My wife is going to frame them together.  Seriously though, its the movie we really wanted.  So just he Blu-Ray will be great for most. But if you want the extra nick knacks, this set will please.  But the picture quality will certainly please you!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|The only thing that is bad about this app is u don't move it moves u just get to do a little bit of moving. It is free so u can't get to mad about it. The graphics are fairly well they could be better but remember it's free.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I never knew what a beautiful voice Susan Boyle has!<br />She is magnificent singing each and every one of these songs!
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|Title says it all.<br />This is easily Deep Purple's most melodic and graceful set of new tunes in many, many moons. Gone is the guitar bombast and overkill Steve Morse is prone to. His playing here is mostly more melodic with the guitar show-off pyrotechnics definitely taking a back seat. Thank you, I guess, to producer Bob Ezrin.
B000088E6D|5.0|Wonderful Michael Buble CD.  Great songs matched with his wonderful voice, reminiscent of the crooners like Perry Como and Frank Sinatra!
B004XVN1T4|1.0|I love Ken Follett's book but this book did not hold my attention at all.  I was bored, the characters and storyline did not work for me.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble is great and this CD certainly shows his talent.<br />Will continue to purchase his CDs as they are available.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Having seen the movie in the theater I knew it would have to become a part of our collection.  Everything about it is exceptional and the message is timeless.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I am a fan of the Oz Witches but not a Franco fan and wasn't surprised that the only parts I really enjoyed were those involving the witches... Especially when Theodora finally &#34;got her green on&#34;...  Special effects were pretty good...
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I gave in and purchased this because it wasn't showing up anywhere for rental. I really enjoyed it- characters are well developed, exciting story line. Writing is good, but there are a few inconsistencies for main characters, so I didn't give it 5 stars.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Not a huge fan of zombie movies, BUT this was different... Obviously more on the comedic than gore side... I enjoyed it
B0057UAE54|5.0|I feel like it is 1977 all over agina, or was it 1976? Whatever, Do you Feel like I do?
0553386794|5.0|Book One is an excellent start to what seems to be an interesting series. There are multiple plots in this first book and the characters are developed well. I wanted to begin a series for \\"summer reading\\" and now on Book two. The best part of Book One? The ending! After 800 pages, this ending was totally worth it!
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is the best game in the world I like the barlog monster duhduhduuuh best game ever oh yeah<br />The monster the Vikings like its<br />Asome
159463176X|4.0|\\"It's a funny thing... but people mostly have it backward. They think they live by what they want. But really, what guides them is what they're afraid of. What they don't want.\\"<br /><br />And The Mountains Echoed is the beautifully written new novel from master storyteller Khaled Hosseini.  I thought The Kite Runner was wonderful, and  that A Thousand Splendid Suns was even better.  Hosseini's new book also takes us once again to Afghanistan before the fighting, where we are introduced to Abdullah and his baby sister Pari.  Their's is the beginning of this story which is told from many different characters and spans several generations.  Rather than one comprehensive story, this novel is almost a compilation of interwoven stories that spans members and acquaintances of one family and their descendants.<br /><br />I thought writing in this novel was just as beautiful and lyrical as one would expect from Hosseini.  He makes the people and places come alive.  What I found I did not like as much as I hoped was the actual story.  It felt a little too disjointed, the changing of narrators with each chapter.  I felt as though I was just getting to know a certain character, and then they were gone.  I would have preferred  just two or three narrator, rather than the nine the book gave us.  At certain points, I was actually a little confused as to who was who and how they connected to the other characters.  I would still recommend reading this book, as the author has once again produced a beautifully written piece of literature.  Just begin aware that it is different from his previous novels.<br /><br />My favorite quote-<br /><br />\\"But there was no forgetting.  Pari hovered, unbidden, at the edge of Abdullah's vision everywhere he went.  She was like the dust that clung to his shirt.  She was in the silences that had become so frequent in the house, silences that welled up between their words, sometimes cold and hollow, sometimes pregnant with things that went unsaid, like a cloud filled with rain that never fell.  Some nights he dreamed he was in the dessert again, alone, surrounded by the mountains, and in the distance a single tiny glint of light flickering on, off, on, off, like a message.\\"
B001QVFDA4|5.0|Ok, first of all I really, really, really would like to know what was on the picture. That's what kept this movie funny and interesting! Ugh, WHAT'S ON THE PICTURE!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I like the fact that it can be plugged in and still be able to reach the comfy chair that I sit in!
B0083GPDBO|4.0|What an interesting twist of acquiring super human powers. Some are born with it, and then...some get if from a rock. Kept me watching so, I guess it was worth it.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|It is a good game for preschool children.  My grandchildren like it on my Kindle.  I have had better games, but it is good for a change.
B0085776BG|5.0|I have always been a fan of the Tuskeegee story. This version kind of showed a little bit more than the previous productions of this fine group of Airmen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it can really drive you crazy at times but I still cant stop playing this game. I wish there were morenlevels but instill love it
B003V40SGS|3.0|If you are in to the late 70's early 80's science fiction, then this is a must see for you.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This game could really be a huge amount of fun. However, the unbalanced play, designed to get the player to spend real world money at every turn, really kills the fun. It takes hours to earn the coins for purchases and seconds to spend for mission rewards that don't match the cost of completing goals. Additonally, at 15, 000 coins to research DNA segments in one case,  one or two XP failures out of the ten segments would be acceptable, not 3 failures to 1 successful segment. Park dollars should only be needed to speed up processes and to buy the cool stuff. I have no problem with having to use park dollars for a T-rex, Pteranadon, or for some of the fancy buildings, but the ever spiraling cost of food, research, and clearing jungle sucks the fun from the game. Also, what's the deal with clearing the underwater weeds you get no DNA and still have additional clearing to do. It just eats up coins.<br /><br />UPDATE: July update ate my level 40 park, and when I worked back up to 10 it takes 5-8 minutes to switch between the land and aquatic park. Click on the terminal for switching parks and it downloads files. The first file always fails and the second larger one usually succeeds. This happens going to and leaving the aquatic park. Therefore going to and from the aquatic expansion take me 10-15 minutes on my 1st gen kindle fire. Additionally, since the game data is kept on my device, and I play on a guest account I see no reason for the game to require an internet connection to play
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was excited when I could watch this in HD on Amazon Prime. The streaming is smooth and we have had no problems. Streaming videos adds additional value to my Amazon Prime membership.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Terrific game!! Can't wait for new levels!! I love that it really makes you think and its not to hard!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a good and educational game too everyone . The app is very respectful and is cheap<br /> I recommend the game to anyone who wants to to know how it works
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very entertaining and really gets the brain working to figure out each level! I highly recommend this game! :)
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show, once you can suspend ypur disbelief and overlook some pretty big plot holes, is fantastic! The three leads are excellent, and this show is like nothing else on tv. It's gory and weird and yet shot in this gorgeous, super-saturated color. Like a bad dream you kind of don't want to wake from. LOVE IT!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Love this guy.... Rest in Peace .... wanted to read everything about him.... America needs more men and woman like this.... ones who love this Country... and willing to stand up for it.
B0098460O4|5.0|I don't usually read spy storied but this is an exception.  Mainly because it is a true story from WW ll which makes it so very real. !!  Zig Zag is a man of great bravery and nerve.  No apparent conscience except he does think of his daughter occasionally.  His exploits are amazing and not to be missed.  A real living Bond with love affairs to match.  A jaw-dropping story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Once I learned how to use it... not too tech smart... I really like the product and how simple it is to use.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Great movie! realistic in every way! hubby wasn't happy we watched on a flight to Vegas..lol tho he enjoyed it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game really makes you think; keeps you guessing, and some levels are pretty hard to figure out; def recommend
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|These are the best for storyline and character development! Looking forward to fourth season. Have recommended this series to friends.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The keyboard is so easy to use and the predictive text is quite accurate! I have used it on my skyrocket and now on the S4 with no problems! I have also gotten the tablet edition. It us WORTH the money!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game, quick fun game to play. Any age would like this game. I play it everywhere, thanks!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good game and has pretty good graphics as well. Hidden object part was pretty fair, not to hard or to easy. Keep u p the good work!
B002M9WW30|5.0|I got this great collection for $12. The movies also have a spanish dub which is a plus since my parents love these movies as well.
B000NY12LO|4.0|This is at times a difficult read as a school counselor. I am still looking for answers. We need to choose our words wisely. Good read.
B005POK858|4.0|I tried this out and really have found it enjoyable.  I'm a huge RPG fan, especially JRPG.  If you don't know what JRPG means, you probably wont like this game.  It's just like a ps1 or psp import game.  Story is so so but I'm not very far yet.  Overall I am enjoying it and recommend it to any one looking for an old school experience.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Though not short on self-esteem, Sheryl's book is inspirational and quite wise. I did find her look back at her idyllic childhood a touch overbearing but I enjoyed hearing about her lessons learned and appreciated the self-deprecating sense of humour.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|much better then the 100 floors game thats out there. still not normally a game i would play but im enjoyng it for now.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|show is a vivid depiction of the lives of kings, queens, princes and their subjects. good action and some good old gore. Not your Momma's television show. Comic book characters come to life here.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love this game...it is full of different levels n hidden treasures. only thing that sucks is every level you go up the amount of energy it takes to play goes up by a lot so I don't get to play as much as I would like.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This is a wonderful story about the relationship between two brothers and their father. The final boxing sence between the brothers will move the viewer in tears and the misunderstanding is resovled too.It is a good family and social drama but the boxing sences are a bit too bloody for some viewers. This movie also throw some light to viewers about life of boxers and the training.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Using this CPU with indicated mobo and included cooler. I have spent a lot of money on fancy coolers in the past. You don't need one for this combo. Runs consistently at 33 degrees centigrade. Not a gaming combination, but great for everyday use. I also am running an i7 combination. Actually, hard to tell the difference for a $100 less
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once you begin watching this outstanding series you greatly anticipate the next showing.looking forward to many more seasons. Thank you
B004SRWW0C|5.0|Love root explorer and have used it on both Galaxy and HTC phones. To get max benefit from Root Explorer, you need to have a rooted phone.
B002361MLA|5.0|The Power of Now is a little known idea, but a powerful one.  Bad thoughts in your head, bad things on your mind, need some peace.  This is an unbelievably simply and quick way to achieve it.  No  polemics, no beliefs, just you.  I know it sounds impossible. It isn't.  A simple idea.  It works.
B002ABAGVU|5.0|I have the 2 newer albums and decided to go backwards to expand my library.  Love it--can't wait for more!
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|As a Star Trek Original Series fan, this was an EXCELLENT way to take it into a new light.  Really well done!
B0065AMQKG|5.0|I can't get enough of this album.  I have several songs that I will listen to repeatedly.  Good blend of slow and fast.  Love it!
B0045XGRQE|3.0|Really good, but not as good as the first.  Lacked story, action was good and the movie wasn't horrible.  Just not as good as the first.
B00C1S945G|5.0|like the original but now in HD, I just hope the rest of the seasons come up in hd soo
0062238868|5.0|Love the story and the way it was written was great. They really did a good job making it entertaining as well as insightful.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|It Lived Up To Expectations And Hype ...Really Kept You Glued To What's Happening ... I Really Enjoyed The Movie ...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book is an awesome read with a surprise ending!  It is hard to put it down. Pretty quick read,too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game. It actually makes you think and is extremely addictive! I would recommend this game to absolutely anyone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was very captivating. Loved the lack of time element. Great game. Like someone said already not too easy but not too hard either.
B0062QRTKA|2.0|Religion based game so starts off bad from the beginning and doesn't &quot;redeem&quot; itself 2nce you get in to slow clunky gameplay.  Would have gotten anrefund if it weren't the faotd.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I watched this movie when I was a teenager (early 1980's) & loved it. The music is great & it is fun to see some of the actors that were popular in the 1970's (Mary Tyler Moore, Pat Morita) in it when they are younger. Julie Andrews is the best as poor Millie Dilmount who wants to be a &#34;modern&#34; (1920's &#34;working woman&#34; who marries her boss), but the boss falls in love for her friend (Mary Tyler Moore). Carol Channing is great.<br /><br />Julie Andrews is one of my favorite actresses; I would love to meet her as well as Carol Burnett. She is so talented! She may not be able to sing like she used to (throat surgery years ago), but she can still act (Princess Diaries; voice of the queen in the Shrek 2 & 3 movies). One of her best, but not highly credited, films!
B002ODEJYE|5.0|high quality video of the funhouse tour.  very good audio and great footage.  captured the tour perfectly.  looking forward to the latest tour on dvd soon.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Seriously! Harrison Ford as a grumpy bachelor workaholic (Linus) who is trying to prevent the chauffeur's daughter, Sabrina (Julia Ormond) going after little brother David (Greg Kinnear) , who is set to marry another woman whose father's company is crucial to a deal that Linus is trying to put together to make millions for his company (as if he needed more). This is a more modern version of the original &#34;Sabrina&#34; (featuring Humphrey Bogart & Audrey Hepburn). For example, in the original, Sabrina goes to school in France to become a chef; in this one, Sabrina comes back as a photographer. I love both versions!
B004EPYZXU|3.0|bugs on the moon who came up with this crazy idea is why they never went back I wondin,t eather
B004EWFV9K|4.0|This is my first Mankell book but definitely not my last.  The journey of the murder/spy story is interwoven with the introspection of Wallanders human frailties in a captivating manner.  Add the slightly foreign culture (Swedish) for spice for a winning combination.
B00009W0U4|4.0|this women is very sexy thou she is getting older she still can get you hard by watching her movies
B0015AARJI|5.0|It works great. Best Controller I have tested. Always the real thing. 3rd party controllers suck. four more words fool
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Maybe it's just me, but while I enjoyed reading it and zipped through the books, I felt like the ending left much to be desired.  And I'm not just talking about the final chapter, for those who have already read it.  That part seemed completely unnecessary to the story... at least to the Red Country story.  Maybe it plays a part in the next book?
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I read this book in a day. I couldn't put it down. I feel just like America in that I'm confused ....who should she be with Maxon or Aspen. Anxiously awaiting the third book!
B00AKFG15S|2.0|I thought the storyline was poorly developed, dragged out.<br />Jeffrey archers latest is not a patch on his first books
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The description of the different tents in the circus were amazing!  The concept was interesting.  I was disappointed by the end, but overall, a very good book.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this app it is a game for all girl's!:) it is also very cool I really like it!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I wish that it could be a tournament so it can last longer and not start over from the beginning
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My son is the gamer so quoting from him five stars and nothing wrong with the game.  It kept him busy on our 10hr road trip
B001XUNQ4S|5.0|I loved watching this movie again.  It was a lot of fun.  Gotta love the old Star Trek actors.  I recommend this one for watching.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Thrilling to watch...songs, drama, and dances all perfecto!!  Once you start watching you won't be able to stop...so addicting!!  Best show ever
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed the the smart-alecky way the astronaut spoke. It kept the book moving and fun. It is a timeless piece of writing.
B00BE97ONM|4.0|This book kept my attention through out. It had it's surprise ending and well worth the read.  I think you will enjoy it too.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites! It truly captures the spirit and feeling of J. M. Barrie's book, and it is a great film for the whole family. I recommend this to everyone!
1451627297|3.0|NO SPOILERS > A fine story, but gets weighted down by a poor writer (that's right, I said it). King would have benefitted from brainstorming sessions with his editor in order to separate the wheat from the chaff. As a writer myself, I know it is hard to excise large chunks of material, but do not call yourself an editor if you refuse to have the courage to tell your star that 800+ pages is too long. The first 250 pages or so could easily have been 50. After that, the novel settles into a rhythm that is entertaining if you have the time. The subplots are nice, but not extraordinary. It often feels like a first draft of ideas, not a tight novel. That said, if you enjoy taking a long time with a good story, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />A minor issue is his arrogant insertion of meaningless political editorials, one sentence at a time. They peter out fairly quickly, but the author's obvious political leanings are completely superfluous to the story (and I share his political perspective, too).<br /><br />More importantly, too many of the \\"tells\\" that eventually slip are not at all creative or realistic within the context. This is where some brainstorming would have helped. They are not fatal flaws, but an outstanding writer would have been more creative. Another writer could not have gotten away with these imperfections, but the book was still enjoyable.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|this book doesn't meet the expectations, at least not mine.<br />Some parts in the book was very touching but some just too bland.<br />If you haven't read any of Khaleds books, start with this one, because the other two will not let you down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|What a brain teaser. This game is a great way to work your  brain. My kids will love this game as well.
B00594XOZU|1.0|i use facebook messenger and text + that both work fine.  This does not cut it.  I was looking for an alternative to text + and this diappoints
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is addicting and fun.  I love it.  Can't get enough of it.  It does get much harder the farther you go, but it is sooooo fun.
B005544TRQ|5.0|These guys are great to watch. They are classy and witty and a lot of fun.  I would say they are a lot like white collar but a lot more smart alecy.
B0031RSBS2|4.0|There's so much that's familiar in all the books. Perhaps that's why I keep reading them. 12 down and a few more to go!!!
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|You may have to watch it twice to get the time frames correct. I've seen it 4 times. I'm a Sandra Bullock fan.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|A very entertaining and funny movie,recommended.FOURTEEN MORE WORDS REQUIRED SO I SHALL WRITE 14 MORE WORDS,FOUR MORE WORDS REQUIRED.ONE MORE
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie has been a family favorite for a long time. I was happy to see it was on Amazon for instant view. Great quality stream with no interruptions.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I have watched this movie numerous times and it never gets old. Great action, fast moving, a bit of humor!  \\"Light that fuse\\"...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this is the best sound app available. Ive tried many of the others but prefer this one. the timer is an added bonus.
1400052181|4.0|This was a well researched book about cancer, genetic research, deplorable medical ethics and very poor handling of information.  I felt that it may have been thick plodding for readers without medical background.
B001EC0OPO|5.0|Very imaginative tale and visuals as would be expected of a Tim Burton project.I can still re-watch it for my Mars fix.Great fun!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was so fun! My husband and I both really enjoyed figuring out all the clues. We always tried to one up each other.
B00821OX98|4.0|When I started watching this series, I expected the typical lame TV SciFi. But I have to say that after watching the entire series, I'm officially hooked. Yes, there are the usual cliche moments and campiness that you would expect to find from a show that tries too hard to make an emotional impact. But the show does s good job of getting you to care about the characters so it becomes easier to swallow. The overall plot is very well written, especially towards the end of the season. What should be a simple situation ends up being increasingly complex. And the show benefits from it.<br /><br />After watching this season, I immediately found myself scouring through season 2.
B000I9YLUI|4.0|Oh, I'm not an actor and don't know much about it really. But Keira Knightly annoyed me in this movie. It seemed at times obvious she was acting if that makes any sense. Like she was trying too hard. Didn't get that sense from any of the other players. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful movie. Some of the shots are so beautiful, they could be paintings over a an open fireplace in a great manor house. Also, a nice adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. Overall, well done.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|I love the movie. It is a movie for the whole family. Great show and awesome effects throuthout the entire show. I will recommend the movie to everyone.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|Being a big OneRepublic fan it came as no surprise that I would like &#34;Native&#34;.  The collection of songs grows on you the more you listen.  Great buy.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This item was so easy to use and did the job perfectly! Wish I would have found out about this a long time ago. Again so easy and fast to scan in and bam you're done!
B0010TBQ0S|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Geoffrey Rush is wonderful in this part. His portrayal of this divinely inspired, emotionally confused, but always kind and loveable genius is genius.
B000U618C8|5.0|Jose Gonzalez is like a breath of fresh air. I love the simplicity of his music, voice and guitar. Very well put together songs.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book love the story line. I can not believe she  left us hanging! Can't wait to finish the next book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love,love pinterest. Such a fantastic way to gain inspiration and enjoy seeing most anything you want. Trying to get my husband to sign up. Highly recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book is awesome I can not wait for the movie to see how they will portray and bring it out
B005PK56TA|5.0|When I first started watching this series, I was a little freaked out by it. It totally grew on me, and I watched the whole season within two days, and moved onto the next season. Can't wait for Season Three! I hear it's about witches...
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|As far as I can tell it does it's job perfectly.<br />I'm being a little harsh on one thing though.<br />Windows doesn't automatically install the driver. You need to install it from the cd or the internet.<br />(Which is a little bit of a hassle when you have no ethernet and no cd/dvd drive)<br /><br />However, once the driver is installed, it's smooth sailing from there!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Amazing book! Read it in 2 days over the summer. Really like the suspense Hannah brings with the tapes. A book that makes you really think about your actions.
B003PAXONC|1.0|It brings subtitles in Spanish when specification says that if you bring. I feel cheated. It's a shame because now lost confidence in amazon with this happened to me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|What a great app to pass time. It's challenging without being frustrating.  I love that you don't have to buy things to stay playing the game
B0063GORYU|5.0|Never gets old! I can play this over and over and enjoy it every time! Good time waster ha ha!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read mostly scifi and have enjoyed my share of super science gone wrong. It is surprising how often this results in zombies (BRAIINNNNSSSSS!) This book is top of the heap for zombie stories. I read in in three days over vacation. I could not put it down.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I really enjoy using this app and would recommend it to others.  It has high quality you would expect.  Graphics are great and I use it a great deal.
B007R11DKQ|3.0|It was a cute movie, but having just read the book, I was disappointed. Some key plot elements and characters were omitted and it was difficult to look past them. Probably a decent flick if you haven't read the book.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|There is nothing bad I can say about this app.  It's done extremely well and a lot of fun.  Great graphics.  A++
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Not quite finished but eager to see how it ends, so with that in mind I must like it!  The idea is interesting and so far the execution is spot on.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's really fantastic for alerts.  My only wish is that it had Weather in Motion like that on the computer.  Overall fantastic.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|Stellar cast, script and timing that is as pertinent today as it was when it was made. Kate and Cary at their finest!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This app works well and I really enjoy playing it.  There are different games and good graphics.  Very nice app.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|I didn't even know I liked this show until I started watching the Season 6 reruns on Amazon Prime.  Thrill of medical surgery and romance.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Without giving the book away (no spoiler alerts) this book was written in true Clancy/Jack Ryan style. When Ryan became POTUS  you ask where else can he go? Well he went there. This book continues the Jack Ryan/Jack Jr series magnificently. A must read for all Jack Ryan fans! Can,t wait for the next book.
B007SPPANM|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio is my life. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. An amazing love story and purchase!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's freaking awesome  addicting at times ! I love playing it day and night! You can relax playing this game! If your mad, after playing this game you wouldn't even remember why you were mad ! :)
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|You think he doesn't notice, but he does! Glad she was able to get her hearts wish and find happiness.
B008602KQI|4.0|My daughter watched this movie and thought it was great. She truley enjoyed this movie.  Awesome product.  Thank you once more.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I've seen this movie several times over the years, and it is still a classic! If you've never seen this movie, by all means take the time to see it one night.
B004132I20|5.0|This is a very clever series.  We love the Sherlock Holmes movies and enjoy watching Elementary as well.  The writing is superb and acting is spot on.  Can't say anything negative except there aren't enough episodes to last me through the summer.
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|I found this to be an easy yet moving selection of Einaudi's genius on his latest.  relaxing and at times exhilarating.
0061950726|3.0|I enjoyed this story because it presents us with some of the realty of our heritage as a country.  The characters were interesting enough and the research was extensive.  My only complaint is the novel tends to suddenly solve all the questions regarding these two main characters, Molly and Vivian, in such a way that out of two very complex lives everything suddenly ends happily.  We go from the serious topic of foster children in limbo now and orphans of the past to a bright and uncomplicated future where everything is peace and light.  Still, a good story, an easy read, and the author is commended on her extensive research of a not very pleasant historical time in America.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is a great movie.  I could put myself right into that time period without any problem.  Daniel Day Lewis did an amazing job.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED is my favorite downtime thing to watch. Always enjoyable and stretches the mind. Many AHA moments for those of us that like to understand and learn all the time.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I avoided this show for a while, mainly because the main characters look and act like arrogant douche bags, and they are, and that is part of the reason this show is so addictive.<br />  My GF and I sped through the first 2 seasons on Amazon Prime, and we can't wait for season 3 to start.<br />  There is one good reason to watch this show if you're a guy... Racheal! She gets me all &#34;Litt&#34; up!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Wonderful performances, extremely romantic version.  I will add it to my collection.  Jude Law is unrecognizable in his role as Anna's husband.
0061122416|5.0|I bought this copy to replace the one I owned and was very happy with its quick delivery. The story is one that everyone should read when looking for inspiration.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|THIS ONE IS AWESOME, I THINK IT IS ONE OF MEGADETHS BEST<br />REALLY AWESOME LEAD GUITAR WITH CHRIS BRODRICK  AND DAVE  ATTACKING IT HEAVY AND HARD<br />PLAY THIS ONE ON  ' ELEVEN ' !
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I have read just about every Harry Bosch book in print.This one does not dissappoint.I'm a big Michael Connelly fan
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The book was amazing it had great imagery and it made me think, Also it was a very inspirational book
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|If you just want to relax and watch a fun, action-pack movie, this would be a great pick.  Just don't think about all the illogical stuff that happens in it and you'll have a good time.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|This movie is awesome.  Im not  one top watch a movie more than once but now intend to with this one!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Make sure you have a box of Kleenex...very powerful. Anne Hathaway's performance is amazing! I've watched it 3 times now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best ever.  they update it to a different place and everything. I love this game.try it out you wont regret it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to download and to use. I recommend this app highly. Perfect for a kindle fire or a laptop. Thank you.
B009QW8032|3.0|Connery returns in an unofficial remake of Thunderball, a Bond movie he himself starred in. Max Von Sydow is briefly in it, and awesome as always, and Kim Basinger is the Bond girl, which makes her the fourth woman he sleeps with. Worth watching because it is Bond, but it suffers from its cast of new actors playing familiar roles and the story is redundant, even for a Bond film.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is very fun it is really the only bad thing is the waiting to get money from the animals it is fun love it
B00AMLFJT4|5.0|I bought this album for my girl firstable but ive once hear it i cant put itoff ha ha ha
B002S45V32|3.0|This move is ok; to remember how the 80 were but the  history is is boring. I like the soundtrack
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Title says it all, works great for the video, but I wish that I could see the chat in an alpha overlay, or sidebar/tab or something.  UPDATE: Has Chat Now :D
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It's a great game. I can easily get on it with my Kindle. I think they should let you earn gems in missions though and you shouldn't have to do certain missions.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game I am 11and I got my 5 year old brother hooked on it. I think this is a good game it just needs some more levels and less adds. I finished the game in about 30 minutes. fun game and is a challenge.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I guess it depends on the type of movie you like, but for me this is another &#34;Fast&#34; franchises hit! It's got crime, suspense, fast cars, hot guys, and lovable characters!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|The story line did a good job at helping understand how the Oz and witches became the type of characters they were in the wizard of Oz.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Who doesn't love &#34;Dirty Dancing&#34;!?! The first time I watched it I was 12, and at 38, am still a fan!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I give this book 4/5 stars.<br /><br />The overall story was good and I enjoyed following the main character around and rooting for him throughout. The book focuses on the challenges that he faces living in a Fictional DPRK. The setting is frighteningly believable. At times, it is hard to distinguish what parts hold true outside of the book's fictional world, which bugged me a little. Part of the reason I enjoyed this story was because it let me see into a place that is hard to get information about.  It made me want to believe everything I was reading, but part of me kept reminding myself that I shouldn't put a lot of stock in fiction. I guess that is a testament to the author's ability to make the book feel real!<br /><br />The only complaint I have with the book is that I felt the Loudspeaker portions broke up the flow of the story a little too much.
B009AMAGQM|2.0|I originally read all 4 books in the Beautiful Creatures Saga and absolutely loved them! As soon as I realized there was a movie, I bought it, hoping to put actual imagery to my imagination from the book! I was sorely disappointed, as the movie is NOTHING like the book, except for names!!! The whole plot is changed, story rewritten, etc. I really wish, whoever wrote the screenplay, would have stuck to the storyline!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Simply wow. How was this not required reading in school for me? You can't help but feel a vast range of emotions for Ender. Written beautifully, here's hoping the movie that's coming out won't butcher this story.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy is a great read!! Inspires romance, desire, sexual creativity, and end the end of it all true love!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is the best app I ever downloaded! It has all of the info I need to see what the weather is. I like how it is updated hourly. I recommend this app to everyone.
0312330537|1.0|At the start of this book I really enjoyed the evocative language Mr. Roberts used.  It caught the rhythm of India really well, and I felt transported.  I found the insights into life at many levels in Bombay and in the country interesting and engaging, but after several hundred pages of the protagonist doing yet another amazing thing, it started to feel a bit like the I-love-me show.  A good editor whacking the book in half or less would have produced a book I would have enjoyed without getting tired of!
1439153663|5.0|One of the few books I've read recently that I couldn't put down.  The story begins in 1791 with a little red-haired Irish girl being used as payment for ship passage for her parents who died in route to America.  Her brother was also sold and they were separated.  Where to put a child that's sold for passage?  With the slaves, of course.  This makes for a confusing life as she grows up not knowing if she's supposed to act like a slave or someone who lives in the big house.  Very, very interesting.  Much of the language was 21st century but it made the book easier to follow than if Grissom had tried to keep it all 18th century.  Very good.  Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|keep them coming!  so much fun and challenging!  love it!<br />looking forward to the new levels.....soon I hope!!  this game is very entertaining and keeps you busy for hours......I highly recommend this game!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|love this show, actually quite obsessed with getting the whole season in. character development is great and can't stop watching.
B00CEJ2H6K|3.0|Dont get me wrong I like amon amarth but this isn't that good of a release. Most of the songs are dull, a few cool riffs here and there but overall its not satisfying.
B00383ZTXO|5.0|I bought this cd for my oldest son Jason on his 16th birthday and since then he has refused to wear a shirt. When I tried to get him to wear a nice striped button-up I bought for sunday mass he snatched it from my hands and wrung it through his buttocks while telling me to \\"come along on my death trip\\". I'm worried about his social life as well. He broke up with his girlfriend after telling her that her pretty face was going to hell. Just the other day we tried to go out for a family meal at IHOP and he sliced his torso open with a broken bottle of ketchup and dripped blood all over my husband's Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Pollan has done it again.  For anyone who loves to cook, is passionate  about fresh and healthy food, and enjoys stellar writing and research, this is your book.  I don't want it to end!  Except, now I have to hunt down some artisan, whole grain bread.  This book will make you hungry!
158270208X|3.0|The internal part of the book is fine, but the gold etching on the front cover and flap is scratched and missing in many areas.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I have always been a fan of picking up new skills, and that's how I came to this book. From giving me the ability to sear the perfect steak with authority, to learning all of those skills I never quite invested in when I had the chance as a younger man, this book has given me a new lease on my own potential.<br /><br />Sounds hyperbolic doesn't it? It's not.<br /><br />While not necessarily as simple as it sounds early on in the book (at least with new skills outside of your aptitude), it does present a very workable system for acquiring new skills that gets easier and easier as you use it; succeed and buy in!<br /><br />Loved the book, purchased both of Ferriss's other books while reading this, as I found the concepts being referenced equally compelling.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Managed to take the best of each super hero and combine them into one exciting fun movie.  IMO, it has several sections that are as good as the best of any other comic book movies, it's the first one I have watched where I wasn't bored at all.  Loss of one star for the perspective of Iron man when he's flying and you see his face through the screen.  It just seems so ridiculous, I just see Robert Downy, Jr. acting every time they show this perspective.  But close to perfect IMO.
0307887448|5.0|I really loved this book, but before I get into the review, I want you to join me in a simple exercise: Take a deep breath, exhale slowly as you close your eyes and imagine everything you have ever loved from childhood; every toy, every movie, every obscure fact, every awkward event, everything.<br /><br />Open your eyes.<br /><br />Now picture all of that love and goodness crammed into the pages of a book called Ready Player One. In it,  you can relive those moments in such a smile-filled, heartfelt way that you might mistake it for a trip back in time - Delorean and flux capacitor most assuredly included.<br /><br />There's so much love jammed into every page of this book that it's almost a cheat, it wins you over immediately with themes and archetypes that prey on what you hold most dear...  your memory of you.<br /><br />And that's no criticism.<br /><br />Wade Watts is equal parts your best self, your worst attributes and the driving hope that every gift has a purpose. His is a tale of the dislocated many who waste away long hours beneath the weight of too much intellect and not enough physical contact and how that drives many into digital space, unconcerned with how the real world continues to pass them blithely by. It's the story of every escapist four-color fantasy scribbled on the inside of a daydream carried on the shoulders of  a legendary Gunter named Parzival as he scours the Oasis in a journey of self-discovery  -  all in the name of Halliday's prize... and a girl named Art3mis<br /><br />Without a doubt, this was some of the most fun I've had reading a book in a long long time.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Short and to the point. This is the best from QR since Promised Land and for me it ranks right up there with empire/PL era ryche. Great job guys, keep bringing it in the future.
0545275326|5.0|My son is ecstatic to read them! He loves Rick Riordan.  He loves Greek Mythology even more. I know he's got ants in pants waiting to come home from Summer Camp to these books that are waiting for him.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Fun to 're enact the d day battles. Good action, great graphics, as much fun as medal of armor ps2
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|It was nice to get a new album from the current lineup after 8 years, but I actually thought Bananas was a much better album and this one was somewhat better than Rapture of the Deep. Some good stuff in spots, but this band is probably just better off performing live at this point. I'll still buy anything they put out and no Rock Hall induction is just absurd, but this was an ok effort.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|Another S. King good one.  Don't know how but he always brings on the \\"can't put them down\\" books. This book reminded me of Hunger Games. Thanks Mr. King.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this. like old school point n clicks. digging it for sure. ill have to check out more gamed by this company.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Unless you have an actual theater, you're never gonna repeat the original experience, but with today's big-screen 3D home theater systems - complete with the separate surround sound audio - you can come real darn close.  Avatar is a great movie to test that system with and it definitely lives up to expectations.  Grab your popcorn, grab your big-as-you-want soda, feel free to talk back to the movie, pause, rewind, and totally enjoy the experience.  This movie pops off the screen in crisp vivid color.  Oh yeah, it's like that.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was good but there were too many different story lines and I left it feeling like some had not been fully finished. I can't seem to figure out where some of the characters fit in or why I had to read 20 pages about a boy and his father which I would not hear about for the rest of the book. This book was a combination of his first two, kite runner had the final happy ending where it somehow all worked out in the end, a thousand splendid suns taught us that life is unfair and that's that. This book had a lot of both, life is unfair, nothing turns out like it should and there is no real fairy tale ending but there is always a lesser but still slightly happy consolation prize. I'm not sure how I feel about it all, it took a while to get into and then once it got good it was over.
B00B4804KS|4.0|The studio did a great job in general of converting this great flick to 3D, with one semi-glaring exception - the red images did not translate to the home screen well.  I don't know how they did in theater versions (if this was even released in 3D in theaters), but on the home screen, especially in the Jurassic Park logo, the Red colors were not well incorporated into the dimensional space, causing some visual effects that were glitchy or confusing.  Other than that, the movie is fabulous in 3D and it makes me wish the technology had been ready when Spielberg had originally filmed it.  I am very glad to see this movie converted from it's 2D, rather than re-made and filmed in 3D.  Spielberg's work was superb and I wouldn't want to see someone try to remake it and offer up some &#34;edgy&#34; wannabe.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Full of information, too many subplots but very entertaining book.  Would recommend to friends interested in art history, and those that like Dan Brown.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Just great.  My son loves this game it keeps him entertained for hours =) Plus he has to use his brain to play!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I Loved the first 2 books in the crossfire series....I read these reviews before I purchased the book...but as ALL bookworms know you have to know what happens in the story. I really hoped I would like them more than reviews said, BUT I ended up skipping chapters trying to get to a more interesting part...ALL the drama is completely unneeded. Obviously Day can write good books but she definitely lost it with entwined with you :/
147674355X|5.0|I read this book in a day. I loved it. Very very hard to put down once you get in to it. I would highly recommend this book
B00AAX68HG|3.0|I like it but it needs work to be a cousin of um num its nothing like him and its too easy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game but definately need more rooms. I like how it takes brain to figure out clues but not too hard to get frustrated with it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book I liked the part about Manny 's imaginary friends make more books Jeff Kinney kelp up The good wprk
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I think this is a pretty good game it held my attention and was very interesting I would definitely buy this game if it was cheaper
1401207529|5.0|This is THE Batman story that changed Batman from the colorful and campy hero of ages past into a modern dark and complex character that he is today.  It's worth picking up if you want to see how that vision developed.  My pleasant surprise with this book is the significant portion of it that was dedicated to Gordon.  He sees a lot of time in this book, and this story helps you get a feel for what drove them together.  You get to see how they have very deep similarities.  I found this story to be really enjoyable, and if you like what Batman is today, you will probably enjoy it, too.
B000FC12SM|5.0|Everyone considerinig marriage, or currently married should read this book; then act on the new found knowledge.  I've read this work before, I shall read it again and again to keep my marriage working.
B00915G6YE|4.0|So, I like this, and I'll keep it spoiler free.  They made some big changes due to last season's cliff hanger ending.  They had some crazy ups and downs that you would expect.  There are some great characters introduced in this season that really reflect different parts of Dexter's character.  I feel like this season's cliff hanger is pretty bad, and didn't seem to make a lot of sense.  I hope that they can wrap this up pretty well in the coming season.  I'm looking forward to seeing how they wrap up the show in it's final season.  I'll definitely want to get it as soon as it comes out.<br /><br />TL;DR: If you've enjoyed the ride so far, you'll be happy with this.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I ended up enjoying this movie more than I anticipated. It had a good story line and an interesting point of view of the super natural. There is an unexpected twist near the end. It was worth watching.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Great movie! Had been wanting to see this movie since it was released, though forgot about it until something happened that reminded me of it. So glad Amazon had it!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had an interesting storyline (much better than its title) and it followed through all the way. It was quite a pleasant surprise.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Didn't think I'd like this as much as I did! It was EXCELLENTLY done both acting and story line. Some surprising little twists - worth seeing it again and again.
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|There was nothing about this movie that kept me interested. If I hadn't been watching it on a plane, I would not have finished it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|WOW!!!!  Wasn't interested in seeing this until I heard the plot from a friend. Who knew?!?! What a phenomenal movie! Absolutely thrilled to now own it -- looking forward to having a Les Mis party to view it together!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I am not sure what I expected from this movie but I know I didn't get it. It was slow and left more questions than it answered.
B002Y0TGOU|3.0|As a fan of the original, but not even a full blown trekkie, I was disappointed. I was convinced to watch by all the hype from what I considered reputable sources. My expectations were apparently too high.<br /><br />If you watch the original series or &#34;Next Generation&#34; you won't get as much action or special effects, but you'll definitely get better sci-fi stories. Maybe as a series it would have had time to breathe.<br /><br />*SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Also, I was disappointed in Spock. He was too human. In the original series you only got a glimpse of this side of him. In the film, hes oozing human imperfection, stubbornness, pride, etc. He's not Vulcan enough for me.<br /><br />The villain was boring. The circumstances around him were interesting in concept, but clever ideas aren't enough. You need character development, dialogue and narrative to back it up.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I could have predicted everything that happens in this movie. The characters are just that - you can make a definition and plug in any actor. The action was pretty good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got every body and almost all the boards and I keep Bering the gold mystery box and every time I play I get like 4 flamingos and I definetely stacked up points so yeah.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|I watched this movie just because of the title. Story line is a bit weak but the action is there throughout the entire movie. There were a couple parts that were out right hilarious although I am sure they did not intend them to be. It was worth watching.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|This was a very good book. In line with the present time. A pungent story if your keep an open mind. I did!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I had to keep turning my head due to all the gory scenes. I know that's tarantino's way and I usually liked some of his other movies. But not this one
B00BESCJII|1.0|Just a horrible movie. I was truly speechless after my wife and l watched this movie.  It was so bad all I could do was shake my head and laugh it off. Wow
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Perfect movie for the family. Even my five year ok stayed awake through the whole thing  after a long day. Good effects and a totally different twist on a tale we've all heard
0345803493|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone, it is a bit to detail but it a well written book. This book has several series and I would recommend to read all of them. I couldn't get enough of this book, I read this book in one day. :)<br /><br />dcasill4sportsblog.blogspot.com
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down until I had finished all three books. It was compelling and easily pulled me into the story and a possible future world. I highly recommend it.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Every frame could be a painting, and i'd hang them all in my house. I've been watching this movie since I was a kid and It just keeps getting better.
B008MM9630|3.0|This game was fun at first and I enjoyed playing it. The graphics are cute and I am partial to games involving magick and mythology. However, there is only so much that can be done in this game without spending real money, which is something I refuse to do. I uninstalled the game after a few weeks because I could no longer advance in it without spending real money. If you don't mind paying to advance then I recommend this game. Otherwise, don't bother downloading it.
0006486010|5.0|I like how Robin Hobb has continued characters from the Assassin's Apprentice series into another 3 book series.  The characters are amazing and complex.  The story line is fantastic.  I have enjoyed the relationship between Fitz and The Fool.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I rarely download games on my phone or tablet because they are generally not all that fun to play and usually have all sorts of questionable permissions.  If I do download a game, or any app for that matter, I rarely write a review about it.  In this case however, I was kinda surprised by the premise of the game, and the good reviews convinced me to at least give it a try.  While this game has a religious premise, I think the story line and game play should not be overlooked.  The graphics are fun and the game interaction is very entertaining.  This is a game you can play and enjoy as an adult, but also kids will enjoy without purchasing a bunch of in-app content or getting linked to less reputable titles.  Without making this too long, the game is fun and worthy of playing.  I have no affiliation to the developer, just an Amazon user who tried out the game and really enjoyed it.
0920668372|1.0|This was not at all what I was expecting when I ordered the book.  By the looks of the reviews it looked sweet, but after reading the first few pages, it was not something I would dare read to my little one!  Not only is it depressing, it is just disturbing.  Do not buy online.  Go to a bookstore and look at it before you buy.  It was not for me or my family.
B004WDRSO2|5.0|I bought this for my grandson.  Enjoy the movie as much as I did when my kids were younger.  Classic
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is awesome and it is really reliable....I always use it. This app has yet to fall me and I would recommend it to anyone
B001WCN232|4.0|Assuming Keith's health and social issues affected focus on this project, as we have three guitarist and three pianists riffing their way into the next coffee break, and many boneweary attempts at something acceptable as album filler...it's still a good Stones album.<br /><br />The uptempo HEARTBREAKER, SILVER TRAIN, STAR STAR; the reflective ballads, ANGIE and WINTER (where Jagger digs in deep for possibly his most soulful performances), will satisfy most fans, in their entirety.<br /><br />I could live without the hideous artwork - a booklet of lyrics would have worked for me.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The only problem I had was that the user name keys were not all working some were but then others were not.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This movie had me heart mind and soul from beginning to end! Emile Hirsch was positively tremendous and I'm forever a fan from now on!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really didn't like the price at ALL!! It should have things to put in the water like fish. There should be more animals that farm animals. I want a dog,cat,horse, and a other animals. Overall it was very fun. You should buy it.
0679746048|5.0|This is one of  my favorite books. Love it. So I thought why not buy it. It came very quickly. The book looks great. I am very pleased with the outcome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was a fun and challenging game. A game I could play for hours. I hope that make another one soon.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Really loved it. We didn't watch the 3D, but it was still great. I am sure the 3D version is amazing also.
B00C2IN78U|1.0|I received this yesterday.  Everything stated this was the Extended Edition Blu Ray. The case however,contained the DVD version of the movie.  Don't know how widespread a problem this may be for this steelbook version.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I really couldn't get into this movie.  I enjoyed picking out which actor played which characters, but other than that I really didn't like this movie.  The jumping around was really off putting.
B00881VLCE|5.0|The puzzles are in brilliant colors.  The finished picture is beautiful, especially since I like cats, dogs, butterflies, and the other items posted.The pieces are fun to slide into place.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I didn't begin watching The Good Wife until the last few weeks.  I decided to catch up on back episodes and I'm so glad I did.  Love this show!!
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I kept hoping for this movie to lead somewhere, but it never did.  I'm not sure what really happened at the end of this movie.  Not enough real action to makeup for the lack of plot.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved both previous books, but I loved the complexity of Mountains. Both the characters and story line(s) require my attention which is very respectful of the reader and I appreciated it
0684824906|5.0|I never really understood the absolute genius of Abraham Lincoln until I read this book.  It was fascinating and highly educational with application to the current polarization of our Congress.  The best part, it was fun to read....Doris Kearns Goodwin is also an excellent story teller!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I personally Love it. It is really fun and enticing. Some of the leverage hard but other than that it's great
B00CRVZRUS|4.0|Ok, the Blu-ray looks and sounds great, but there isn't anything on it that wasn't on the 2007 DVD. It's basically just a Blu-ray upgrade from the DVD. Nothing extra. Just an excuse to put it out in the new format.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Love this app it froze on me 1 for like two secends and that's it it is awesome other than that it is a great app I like the starting horse not too BAD!!!!!!!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|A great game to pass the time and work out your brain.  As much fun as the Pc version with a much lower price tag. It is well worth the two bucks to unlock allnthe puzzles.
0345529057|3.0|Books 1-4 at such a low price, it's hard to turn this down. Since these books are fairly thick yet &#34;skinny&#34; in a sense- it makes them hard to hold comfortably.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i would recommend this book because it isn't your traditional fairy tale and I love how the bluntness of it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazingly written and kept me tuned in the entire way. Intoxicating and provocative. Exquisitely defined and honestly deceiving and somehow that makes sense after reading. It is fantasy mixed with fact and kept me on edge through it all. I gasped,screamed,cried, quenched, and got butterflies as I got further into this book. It is awesome and will keep you at the edge of your seat.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was a very good book.  Just when I thought I had something figured out something else changed.  It made me think just how far I would go for my children.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My mom loned it to me so I could reed it so it was so good I finished it in a day😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱katniss and PETA🐶🐱🐶🐱🐶🐱🐶🐱🐶🐱
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was fun and quick to learn. It made you really think on what to do next. I'd like to play it more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I  think this is the best game I ever played is there and ending to this game I love this game
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was definitely a new light to some of the conflict going on in the middle east. It was filled with action, and remained interesting- which is hard to do if the reader already knows the outcome of the mission. I am not much of a war book reader, but this is a great read.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Easy to play but gets under your skin so you want to go to the next level. Fun and can be played for a few minutes or hours.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Truly amazing and captivating a must read but be careful you<br />Will not be able to put it down<br /> I
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Everything a movie should be. Great casting, great writing, great directing, great acting, great movie. It has the right combination of action and storytelling with humor thrown in at the appropriate spots. The Hulk playing Bam-Bam with Loki is priceless.
1591845556|2.0|This book was more suited for an article.  While I found it very interesting and it really does layout a good method for skill acquistion, it is also a bit boring reading how he learned different things.  The first few chapters are good and maybe one of the chapters on how he executed the process but it the next chapters are just redundant. I wish I had not wasted my money and I wish the author had just written this as a blog post
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|MINI REVIEW: Focus is on the great director, Alfred Hitchcock, as he is making the film, PSYCHO. Interestingly enough there was a lot of resistance to said picture and the film focuses on those elements. A very good depiction by Anthony Hopkins of the master director even if not brilliant nor superb. Intriguing interplay between Hopkins and Helen Mirren, who plays the wife of Hitchcock. Big urban legend question: did he really make Janet Leigh scream with a real knife? Also starring Jessica Biel, Scarlett Johansson, Kurtwood Smith and others.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus;  SOUND/MUSIC: B to B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; HITCHCOCK FOCUSES: B; WHEN WATCHED: mid April 2013; OVERALL GRADE: B.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Hi this product is excellent .Those who want there apple tv optical audio cable to be  converted to 3.5mm jack and rgb audio .This product is the best.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I have been playing this game for a while now. I loved it and even though I swore I'd never make &quot;in-app&quot; purchases, I enjoyed this game so much that I did. In fact, I probably spent well over $25 on in-app purchases to create the reef I wanted.<br />After I downloaded the recent update, I began to experience crashing problems. They were annoying, but I was still able to play. Then somewhere during level 25, I stopped being able to open the app at all.<br />I finally uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I wrote to Disney Interactive's support requesting help with recovering my reef.<br />After multiple messages they finally wrote that it was recovered and all I had to do was shut down my device for 2 minutes then open the app upon restarting my Kindle. When I tried, the app would act like it was going to open but then would shut off.<br />After several more emails, I was informed that after a certain level and reef development is reached, the Nemo' s Reef app will no longer be able to be played on the Kindle Fire device.<br />I would suggest saving your time and money. Although I loved the app while I was able to play it, I cannot recommend it to anyone else when you will eventually reach a point where you can no longer play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was mind bending fun ... i wish there were more levels than just 10. I was disappointed when I passed level 10 and there wadn't anymore.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|new to the joys of horse ownership but so far it seems like a peach.  more to follow as I delve deeper into the worldnof showing
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book especially since it's split in his and her point of view in the writing.  Although I did not like the ending I thought it was brilliantly written and held you captive.  It's incredible to think that there are women out there who really are this nuts!  It was highly recommended to me and it did not dissappoint.  READ IT!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Fantastic read! Had me going back and forth about the characters. Did not see the end coming. Read it in one day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I don't get on it very often, but when I do, don't bother me for at least 2 hours.  A great place to keep recipes, workout tips, etc. without adding more clutter to your office or home space.  A digital board to keep things you need/want to follow up on in one handy place.<br /><br />Genius!
B000AYELVA|3.0|The first X-Men movie is an entertaining film but an extremely basic film.  It is definitely not bad, but it is not great either.  I spoiled myself by watching X-Men United first.  After watching that brilliant film a number of times watching this film for the first time felt very underwhelming.  After watching in a number of times after that I came to enjoy the flick.  I also thank the film for helping to open the doors to a long chain of superhero films throughout the 2000s and still going strong.  If it was not for this film or the first Spiderman film, we might not have nearly as many superhero films as we have today let alone great ones.  However, it is still basic superhero film compared to films compared to later movies like X2.<br /><br />Most of the cast does a good job.  I like most of the characters.  The majority of the actors fit their characters perfectly especially Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Patrick Stewart (Professor X).  Famke Janssen does a good Jean Grey and James Marsden does a really good Cyclops.  One thing that this movie does right that the other after it does not is have Cyclops be relevant.  This is the only movie that we get to see Cyclops do anything.<br /><br />Some actors were miscast though.  Anna Paquin does not do a good job as Rogue.  I think she would have been better a Kiddy Pride.  The character of Rogue in this movie is a far cry from the character in the comics and the TV shows.  Rogue is supposed to be a spit-fire.  This Rogue is the complete opposite of that.  Halle Berry does okay as Storm, but there are plenty of people that could have played the role better.<br /><br />The villain Magneto is a great in this film.  He is played brilliantly by Ian McKellen.  McKellen is one of my favorite actors.  He does great in every movie he is in whether the movie is good or bad.  He got the character of Magneto down to a tee.  Magneto is one of the best parts of the film.  I like him because he is not really a full villain but more of an antagonist.  You feel for him and can see where he is coming from.  I even like his ultimate plan in the film.  It is really not that bad of a plan if it wasn't for an unfortunate side effect. The other villains are very one-note and not worth talking about.<br /><br />The score is nothing special.  The fight scenes are well done and entertaining.  The effects are quite good too.  I also love the social commentary the film presents, which X-Men is primarily based around.<br /><br />Overall, I think X-Men is a decent and entertaining superhero film.  If you are a fan of X-Men definitely check it out.  However, do not expect anything too deep about the film.  Watch X2 for that.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love Nelson DeMille and his best charachter Det. John Corey.  Sometimes I think John Corey are one in the same with the wit and sarcasm...<br /><br />This book takes place in the middle east and it's interesting to see how a woman has to handle herself in an FBI undercover investigation.  As much as I wish this book had come out a little later, I'm glad we can continue the John Corey series.  I guess Nelson is now under pressure to crank these out more often, perhaps a bit more time would have put this book in my 100% Love shelf but it did seem a litlle stale in a few parts...nonetheless I gave it 5 stars and a 99% Love rating.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|The color and size quality of these decals is remarkable.  I will use them over and over.  Love the detailed and specific items for each princess.  Thank you RooMates!
0744014549|5.0|My daughter has been playing all the Tomb Raider games and really enjoys them. They are really challenging and entertaining.
B00171E8CW|5.0|A fitting tribute to one so well loved and admired for his art.  Given by his friends and family, all world class artists in their own right.  Just fabulous!
B00AW57L96|4.0|I enjoyed this and read it fairly quickly.  The 3 main characters are all flawed and likeable, the author builds up tension and even though you see some things coming, it still maintains enough of  a &#34;what will happen next&#34;  aspect.  Good escapism but also a thoughtful portrayal of the ongoing grief a parent who loses a child feels.
B00BHU261S|5.0|Anthony Hopkins doesn't really look like Hitch (even with the make-up) but you know it's him from the second the film begins.<br />Gives an insight into a man with many obsessions - blondes, food, control - and who has a wife who is both saintly AND human.  Also makes you sad for Vera Miles - seems she broke poor Hitch's heart just by wanting a more normal life.
1451627297|5.0|This is my first review post...ever!  I have not read a Stephen King novel in 20 years. Bought this a year ago and just started to read it.  As I was reading, I told friends how much I was enjoying it and hope he did not take a turn on me!  I was not disappointed one bit! The story capitivated me.  I was so pleased with the entire story.  I have recommended the book to many in just the week I finshed it.  I don't think anyone could not like it.  Like I said....my first review!
B00846F1YW|5.0|love this app. nice designs and different things to solve. good for the memory. t<br />I think is worth to buy it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Once again Mr Martin builds a fantastic story with characters (hero's and villains) that you will always remember. Each character is complex, and you begin to feel for difficult decisions that have to be made. Once again,great job to the author in making us care. Because we care for different characters, it is hard to put the book(s) down.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I purchased this movie for my kids to watch on a trip.  This is one that they really enjoy, and the music is fabulous!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This novel was very exciting. There were a few times when almost came out of my seat when vengeance was served. Plus, the ending only served to wet my appetite for the next book in the series. Great literary work.
0785163174|1.0|Can they fit anymore Avengers propaganda into this crossover? As an X-Men fan I now realize that my characters aren't as important to the house that created them as creating a Justice League twin.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|All the action and gore you expect in a Tarantino movie - done with humor and panache. Excellent performances. Watch for a lot of big names in cameos.<br /><br />Even my wife enjoyed it.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I was really excited to see this app come as I have played this on Facebook for quite a while. However, I find the app has quite a few glitches and freezes up a lot.
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Liked a few sings before hearing, like then all after hearing, rarely do you have an album where you can like the entire, every song.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|SO MUCH FUN!!! love this game!<br />It is harder then you think watched very carefully to pick up all the clues. Watch for number & color codes. Have pencil & paper handy!!! Enjoy
B008MEM24S|5.0|The game starts out fairly easy but continues to challenge you throughout. It really gets your mind going, plus there are some cute humorous moments as well! Fun for everyone!
B00DGN51O8|4.0|It was a fun story and the special effects were great! My four year old grandson actually sat and watched the entire movie (through his hands during the scary parts).
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|I'm glad to see the RYCHE rocking again...the music in all is pretty good and Todd does a great job of filling Geoff's big shoes.  What I miss is the big choruses....that's what set Queensryche apart from all the other 80's - 90's metal bands.  Every song in the old days (and even most in the recent days) had a big chorus that stuck with you and made you want to sing along.....not seeing that with the new writing team on this album..
B008QTV3X0|5.0|We were looking for a series to watch this summer now that TV is mostly reruns and talent shows. Streamed the pilot of this show and got HOOKED. Better than &#34;24&#34; in my opinion.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|DDL was great, but the rest... way over hyped. Good, but not in my top 25 movies for the past decade
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|Great Movie. My kid loves anything Lego.<br />Bought it for a birthday present because he had been begging for the movie since it came out.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|WOW!!This is a great sequal to temple run and it has new features like a zip line and gems!This is probably the best sequal you could get for temple run! This game is AWSOME!!
B006JSXYPA|5.0|WOW<br />  It was like new $$$$$,  all 4 disc<br />got the 3D TV for Mothers Day and the Transformer for Fathers Day<br />@ less than 1/2 the store price<br />WOW
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This app works very well to hold all of my music and playlists. I wish it was easier to go back to a playlist from a song after you had been out of the app for a while.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its awesome because you can surf and if you get knocked out by a train and the police are behind you he might get knocked out also
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very realistic when I play it I feel as though I actually own a horse and are actually taking care of it.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|it's kind of hard - but I like that you fly - the enemies are hard to defeat especially since it's timed - if the time runs out they attack you
B00BETX5PS|4.0|We rented this on a whim, figuring we should get caught up since it had left theatres for a while. Many reviews & people I talked to seem to agree that this was either the BEST Bond film or one of the greats in the series. I meant to watch it casually as I cleaned the house, while my husband mostly watched it. I was hooked, and sat down on the floor in front of the tv. I like a good action film, and this held my interest the whole time. The reason I didn't give it a 5th star is because I thought the villain could have been a little stronger/more intimidating. I feel like they didn't go deep enough into his psychosis, they just showed you some of it to make him a working character. SPOILER: a favorite character dies, and gets replaced, another memorable character's replacement is introduced, and we learn the name of another character from an older series film. Overall, I had a great time watching it, and would enjoy it again!
145210655X|5.0|What if Vader RAISED Luke?<br /><br />Such a cute and humorous book about fatherhood. 64 pages of Star Wars goodness. There is no story just stand alone pages, most with comments while a few are only pictures. One of my favorites was Luke telling Vader, \\"You promised to take me to Tosche Station\\" to which Vader replies \\"I have altered the deal pray I do not alter it more.\\" If you like that you will love the book, if you don't get it you probably won't like the book.
B000L53D4O|5.0|Bought this several months ago when my son was about 11 months. Our doctor's office has a similar one in their waiting room that he always played with. He was learning to pull up and had to work out how to pull himself up to it while it slid a little. He first started using it on hard flooring, and at the playground. He now uses it on the carpeted floor. He's also walking on his own now, from room to room. I think it really helped build up his confidence and lower body balance. He still plays with it and we bring it to playdates so other kids can use it. I think it's great that it folds down, too. That way kids who are seated or crawling can enjoy it as well.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a good summer read.  Nice story.  You can see that happening - it made it real.  I would recommend it to any woman.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game I love really helps u learn responsibility kids have to care for their horse or horses to keep playing with them
B000MR9D5E|4.0|The series is a wonderful accomplishment. Years of painstaking patience for the exquisite photography have paid off in this production.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|Love this app . It makes playing your music fun . You can do the things the professionals do. House parties would never be the same again.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Super easy to use. I just put memory card in and connected to ipad and there were all my pictures. It is nice to now have them all at my fingertips. Already personalized some and emailed them to others. Would definitely recommend .
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|There is no band like the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson. We wish they would continue to tour and produce great music forever!!
B009NX50DM|5.0|Sure, the remake with Marky Mark is alright, but the original is so much better. A great performance by Michael Caine with a great heist movie plot. If it's on TV, I have to stop and watch it. Just a fun movie.
B000X9Q8A4|4.0|A collection of good covers of Beatles songs from across their catalog. Some are so-so (Bono's &#34;I Am The Walrus&#34;) while some are amazing (Joe Cocker's &#34;Come Together&#34;, Evan Rachel Wood's &#34;Hold Me Tight&#34;, anything by Dana Fuchs).<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Beatles, this will probably find a special place in your collection.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|I get a kick out of the tongue-in-cheek references to every classic science fiction plot imaginable, but sometimes it has a little too much &#34;SciFi soap opera&#34; feel to it. Haven't completely finished watching season 1, so the jury is still out. On the other hand, I haven't given u on it either.
B001AACEP8|3.0|You get exactly what you are purchasing here: a set of 12 clean, well-produced, bubble-gum pop tracks by a semi-talented artist making no attempt to push the envelope. Few tracks are surprising, and when they are, it's not by much--good (Lost) or bad (If You Can Afford Me).
B00821OX98|5.0|You ever start watching something and say damn this is to fake. Well if aliens did invade this portrays what might actually happen.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|On the price-performance curve, you can't do much better than these. A good flat response with fidelity across the spectrum. For those of you used to $5-$50 headsets and earbuds, they will introduce you to a new dimension of your music. For those who are familiar with high-end headsets, they are inexpensive and durable enough to keep a pair everywhere you need one.<br /><br />The ear pads are comfortable, although they are a bit warm (as with all over-the-ear headsets). The cord is more than long enough, and coiled to stay out of the way.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I hope that Sheryl Sandberg will put out another addition of this book geared towards a younger audience as they did with the Steve Jobs book.  I would very much like my daughters to read Lean In.  Although I have chosen to stay home with my kids and not delegate someone else to raise them, I applaud her success.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I couldn't get it to move to the SD card, at least with the tablet that has Froyo version of Android on it.  Almost everything that I'm not able to do that I download will get removed, usually quickly.<br /><br />It didn't seem to read the amount of battery power I had left in the tablet, it did not give as complete readings as Battery HD nor as many details.<br /><br />Even if Battery HD has advertisements, I'm sticking with that one.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|And certainly cheaper than replacing a fried cpu. If you've got room in your rig, spend the money and get this thing.
B0073TZ1AA|2.0|It has to be placed on a gingerbread device, or later.  It didn't really work that well on gingerbread, though of course it didn't work on Froyo at all.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|A very interesting story and excellent actors with beautiful music but moves a bit slowly. Some story lines were confusing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|OMG! as simple as that! you gotta read it... different, intriguing... I don't know what else to say, read it and you'll see...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very entertaining and enjoyable! Graphics are the best I have seen  on mobile so far! Really good puzzles but not viciously hard!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|The original &#34;Die Hard&#34; was perhaps the greatest action movie of all time. Those that followed were unable to rise to that level for me and this one didn't come close. I'm glad we didn't spend $30 to see this at a theater as we had planned. They say you can't beat a dead horse, but in this case someone tried.
030746363X|5.0|In three months of implementing the slow-carb diet, I've lost 18lbs & dropped my cholesterol by 35 points, just on the diet changes alone. I'm about to add two days a week of strategic lifting (i.e. kettlebell use) and also the PAGG supplements. I've done Atkins multiple times in the past and never found it lifestyle-friendly. But having a cheat day once per week & the freedom to have a glass of wine now & again make this a very enjoyable lifestyle change.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great mind busting game. Makes you think outside of the box. It's a bit frustrating the higher the level though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had to try very hard not to bring the book with me to work. What a thrill!  Loved it!
B004GYY714|1.0|Im sorry to say this is one of the only times i have been unhappy with a product from Amazon, i have not been able to download or use this product after four attempts and found the whole experience totally frustrating .
B00D2K40WY|3.0|This game isn't the best. I hate how you can only give a makeover to one girl! If you're going to get this game I would get the paid version.
B00BHU261S|4.0|After watching Psyco for the first time, seeing &#34;Hitchcock&#34; not only &#34;closed the gaps&#34;, but showed a whole new side of the filmaking magician!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This a good time sink that will take some time, but not very challenging. Good for a plane flight or three. Enjoy!
B004MPESSY|1.0|I wish someone would have told me about the graphic scenes in this movie. So just a fair warning, rape scenes are graphic. And she did pay them back for what they did to her and those scenes are also graphic. DONT ALLOW CHILDREN TO WATCH.
B002RTBN9O|5.0|Interesting story running through the gambit of archetypes we meet during life. This movie contains important perspectives and views missing from the world today. Howard Roark’s courtroom speech should inspire every man. So much is missing from the novel’s version; Ayn Rand was a brilliant author.
B00006FDCD|4.0|But i love this movie. the ending is a little off but all in all a great stephen king movie.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I wasn't expecting there to be as much preggers info in this film more because usually those life happenings are softened a little for the movies.  I laugh and laugh during this movie...it was funny and informative!  HA...
B0021L8UPS|5.0|If you love watching movies that keep you on the edge of your seat, then this movie is for you. And the surprise ending was a shocker.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Meh, I would have been better off watching the grass grow. At least that would have been educational...and less mind numbing.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|The ending ruined the whole darn movie!! Once it was over i regreted spending my money on purchasing the movie!!! SAVE UR MONEY ND DONT BUY!
0345803485|3.0|The plot was predictable, as was much of the dialogue. While the concept could have been turned into an excellent story, it fell short and became simple pornography. I found it disappointing.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was a child. Was SO excited to see it on BluRay. Behind the scenes vignette included on disc is GREAT!
0439023521|5.0|Though fiction, this book is written in a manner that is totally believable. I found it thought provoking. The well developed characters and the state of their domicile draws the reader into their world and demands total attention. It's a book that I found hard to put down. This is the first of three in the series, and when I finished it,I was very happy to have a second and then a third novel to follow the lives and adventures of the characters.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|A triumphant work of historical fiction. Rich characters, well paced action, and believable historical events. I couldn't put this book down.
B002GJU54E|4.0|Janet Evanovich sure can tell a story!  As usual, I found her novel to be absolutely delightful. I thoroughly enjoy her characters and their sense of humor, as well as the plot and Ms. Evanovich's writing style. This novel is several hours of fun and entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is almost like Sonic Riders because of the hoverboards. It is also like Temple Run due to swiping down, up, left, and right. BOO-YA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000OJFV4C|4.0|period pieces can go either way, a big boom ... or a big bust. I like how the story was told
B0063IH60K|5.0|The cards are easily viewed and readily moved with a light tap.The hints are helpful for the lost and the learning.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|A new take on how the digital revolution is changing the way we live. The authors show how we (most of us) have fallen behind in the race against machines. Employment rates are decreasing and we lack the knowledge and organizational infrastructure to fully reep the benefits of this revolution - at least this is so for the vast majority of people.<br />But the book is not dystopic or negative in it's conclusions! Instead we get a lot of good advice on how to race with the machines instead of against them and how to adapt our businesses, education and organizational  structures to a revolution that is fueled by Moores law and the exponential growth of &#34;the other half of the chessboard&#34;.
1932100660|5.0|Great book. Whether you agree with the message or not, it is worth it for all of the peer reviewed literature citations!
B0091W7MP4|4.0|Movie filled with suspense. Proof of characters in real life situations. Example, the police guard at her door going to help fix a car. Stupid but believable.
B0074JODEY|4.0|I have enjoyed this movie ever since my dad took me to see it in the theaters over 30yrs ago! I own a VHS copy of it but as you know that format is obsolete and it was edited! They did wonderful job in restoring a classic on Blu-ray!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|The game is okay. Had to download 2 times before it would really work right. I think most of the games here take to much real money to play.
B009EAO38C|5.0|First CD downloaded to my new Kindle Fire and It works great and the music is so relaxing and plays great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love this game and play all the time..the dragons are cute. I like the fact I can get coins and gems without being on a friend list. Like also the fact you can level up faster than the other dragon games. This is a must have, great for adults and kids.
B002KVAB5G|1.0|this is one of the worst album from the Stones. by this point in the band Keith Richards' heroin addiction was effecting their song writing. the songs are very bland, it was also not well produced. i do not understand how some people claim that is album is simply underrated. have they never heard any of their other albums? skip this one, you won't be missing anything.
B001L5YW9I|3.0|Found it to be too depressing.  Would not watch again unless I felt like crying over some chocolate ice cream.
B003L5BRXK|2.0|firstly, i am a BIG Rolling Stones' fan. i love their early work, and even a lot of the latter albums. but, i don't care for this album. it is mostly a blues double album, with a few rock songs thrown in. so unless you are a HUGE Stones' fan, or a huge blues fan, then you may not like this album.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game, it is one of the best games I have ever played! It is so fun to play.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|My fiancé and I really enjoyed this movie, so if you like action, witches and ghouls, you will like this movie as well. This movie isn't recommended for children. Enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I love it so much that i can play it for hours. It actually feels like it is a real living horse..
B00B2V66VS|2.0|The controls sucks like moving around is hard to do if I move to collect coins it collects it at the end of the pile
B00BHO70L0|4.0|I love Evangelion 3.33. It was hard to follow at first because it seems some parts were missing in the theatrical edition. How did they get to where they were and there seemed to be a division between singhi and misato. I know some japanese so I was able to understand some of the dialogue. However, the movie as a whole was not a disapointment. Gripping and the cg was absolutely awesome. If they ever make an english sub it will fly off the shelf.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is great! It is very detailed and has great graphics. It's also FREE, so go ahead and buy this awesome game. You'll enjoy it. At least I did. ^_^
B008476HBM|5.0|This was a thrilling look at an impressively adventurous life and an exciting time in Kenya.  I was excited the whole time I was reading it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This one is a great challenge for the match 3 games.  You can finish every level with one, two, or three stars.  For some of the levels, getting the third star is really tough, so it keeps you engaged.
B00843TZJ2|2.0|#1- Only in stereo.I guess these old hippies don't like surround sound.<br />#2-This is most likly a good thing because.....<br />#3-The vocals suck.They can't do it anymore.<br />#4- Video is good.
B00913DPW2|1.0|Don't really have a review because it gets to 99% on the load and then stops every time.  Amazon says it should work on my Transformer TF300, but it doesn't.<br /><br />Maybe it will work one day.  I keep trying every so often.  I'll edit this if it starts working.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun game. Quite the challenge for a very infrequent game player. I doubt I will get good enough to need to spend real money tho. youngsters will tear it up.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|If you're looking for a way to kill a couple of hours, this is the movie for you. The story is shallow, the characters underdeveloped, and the whole thing leaves you wanting something more. This is sad considering the potential the movie had based on its trailers.<br /><br />While it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it was FAR from the best. It is best suited to those who felt as if Twilight had a little too much story and action for their taste.
0345529057|5.0|Much better than the TV Show! Product arrived quickly and in one piece. Books are good quality! Plan on getting the 5th book as soon as I'm done with these!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|&quot;My horse&quot; is a really fun game! I could play it for a couple of hoours! The only thing about it is that it's hard to get gems...
B005NFVZTM|3.0|I love Jennifer Lawrence but didn't think this was a good role for her.  The story didn't hang together--it was weak.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Constantly playing this app!!! So fun. Only bad part is you have to be connected to internet. And remember, BACON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)))))
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love NCIS. It is my favorite show. I don't care if I've Seen it a dozen times. I love the characters on the show.
B004XIZK5K|3.0|This is a great way to work out in a limited space written by the foremost expert in the world. Writing is not great but the information is priceless.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Knowledge of the first movie's subject matter is essential to watching this second part. The actors are wonderful and the script writing is spot on for the characters!<br />The characters meet years after their first encounter . The set up with the planned yet unexpected meeting is perfect!<br />Rented this movie. I should have bought it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I SWEAR ONCE YOU GET ON YOU WONT GET OFF ITS LIKE MY DRUG IT CAN MAKE ME HAPPY ON MY WORST DAYS.
B00AOCLWF6|3.0|First episode ok but very slow. Had to bear the first season before watching it and enjoy it it's a great idea just slow
B0002TJGQS|4.0|great batteries.. does the job if thats what you require... great value for the amount of batteries included.. shipping could have been a little faster though!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|It was a great read & finding out more about the under dark elves.  I am a D&D fan and love learner more about the races.
0061950726|5.0|When I heard about the orphan trains I had to find out more and even though this is a work of fiction it still tells a story about something I never knew existed. I'm sure similar things happened to the orphans like what Christina told of, how could children feel to be pawned off on people they don't know to be farm hands, babysitters, etc. Some of them didn't find families that actually loved them. Christina did a wonderful job of letting the world know about something most of us have never heard about. Thank you Christina, I loved your book.
B0007O38XU|4.0|Watch this and wait for the sporadic inspiration--but don't be surprised if you find yourself yearning for those years when Brooks was a more complete filmmaker (Young Frankenstein). --Tom Keogh<br /><br />To start this off...Tom Keogh should be taken out and beaten with a Schwartz powered lightsabre thing.<br /><br />I love this movie.  I pretty much know it by heart.  You'll laugh until you feel like your going to seize up.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Mel Brooks, then this is a movie for you!  Who knows why Keogh didn't seem to find it inspired...maybe he didn't take his hormone treatment that day.  But I can say you'll love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you can feed it care for it ect... I think u would like it too because it is so cool.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|This soundtrack was amazing. Another Zimmer masterpiece, i listen to it all the time even at work. Great sounding soundtrack.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I'm not saying this was a bad movie.  It just wasn't for me.  I think that if you are Q.T. movie fan you will like this, otherwise I feel as the movie is overated.  Good streaming quality from Amazon.
B0095P31L6|4.0|I wasn't looking forward to seeing this dvd, but I was pleasantly surprised when I really liked it.  Good writing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is great for my kids to pass time while they are bored out of their minds. They love it! I play it myself sometimes, very entertaining.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander is unlike any other person I have ever known.  He is brilliant, yet struggles as we all do.  He had an experience from which nobody has ever really survived, and yet not only did he survive, he shares with the world WORLD things that would make most of us call him a nut job.  He applies scientific analysis to his own experience and is so deeply compelled that he risks ridicule, censorship and degradation to allow an ordinary person access to his most personal life.  A huge debt of gratitude is owed this man for risking it all for the sake of any of us who might deign to listen.
B0091REZMW|4.0|just started the game but it looks like it might be a fun way to pass the time. if you like hidden games then it is a must have.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The storyline was very intricate but not overly complex. I personally enjoyed how every seemingly small detail connected each character's story to another and completed the story.
B004D2A04M|5.0|I really didn't think this would workj with my ultra fire 502b but I really needed something and decided to give it a try, and I am very happy with it it holds the light VERY secure and rotates so I usually leave the clip on my belt with my light on and can easily walk while it lights my way
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Great ambient electronic music to listen to while working from one of my favorite games! Definitely a must buy for any fan of Portal 2!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I have ton say I have never played a card game on my tablet but this is fun as hell
B0044C5SCU|5.0|It is usually exciting and the endings are unexpected.  You do need to have seen the previous episodes to &#34;get&#34; everything that is going on.  I love Walter.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Beautiful movie, and 3d is incrediable wonderful movie for all ages and the 3d makes you feel like you are in the movie...
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My original Kindle cord which is years old somehow starting cracking and falling apart.  I called Amazon Customer Service to find out which cord I should get - model # etc. and they offered to send me the replacement free of charge.  Wow!  This is what I call great Customer Service!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Well done in all aspects. If not familiar with this brand, avengers may be rather hard to swallow, but most Americans are probably familiar with the name and know what they are getting their self into.  Lol.
B00B23Z13U|5.0|The Charles Bradley back story is interesting and inspiring enough to make it worthwhile to catch up on.  This guy essentially was discovered at an age he should have retired from being a James Brown tribute singer.  He was signed by Daptone Records (same label as Sharon Jones & the Dap Kings) and teamed up with Menahan Street Band, a tight soul band in its own right, to record this gem.  This record sounds like it could have been recorded in the 1970s, but it is far from a novelty record.  Bradley is one of the best singers in the recent past, and is under-appreciated.<br /><br />If you like this one, his other album &#34;No Time for Dreaming&#34; is excellent.  Also, his band &#34;Menahan Street Band&#34; have their own records, too.
B0060D15AK|5.0|I loved this laugh out loud movie.  I thought the actors did a great job.  I would recommend it highly.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great music, powerful lyrics, and love what Macklemore stands for.  &#34;Same Love&#34; has to be my favorite, because it hits close to home.  Equality should not be an issue; everyone should be equal.  Nuff said!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|This is a neat prologue to TWOO. Sepia-tone opening sequence and great finale mark this as a fine rental. See it in HD.
0756686970|5.0|My bother loved this book, he uses it all the time. Its something I recommend for any kid who loves Legos.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Well directed story, stretches reality but what movie doesn't these days? Arnold is in fine form and the movie delivers fun and thrills. A must-rent!
B00340LM8C|2.0|To Catch a Thief was obviously an excuse for Hitchcock, Carey Grant, and Grace Kelly to vacation in Europe for a few months.  It is slow, boring, and unoriginal.  However, the scenery looks nice.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Definitely check this one out. Great take on Jack and the Beanstalk. CGI is first-rate and the cast delivers in every way. Don't miss it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have a horse of my own, this realistic game exhibits real care and maintenance of a horse the only thing I would change is being able to name your horse.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|I found Man of Steel to be an inspirational movie for our time. It is an epic in the highest sense in that regard with actors who were made to play the parts and a magnificent soundtrack that conveys the urgency of the combat between good and consummate evil with a portrayal of a humble Superman who proved beyond a shadow of a doubt the \\"He who humbles himself shall be exalted\\".  The spiritual parallels are unmistakable with the most glaring being the sub-commander of General Zod telling Superman that he was too weak because he had morals, and that she would overcome because she had none with evolution always winning out in the end, which it didn't in this movie mirroring real life. Man of Steel is the heroic exaltation of freedom over tyranny against impossible odds, and if ever there was a moment in history where that message of hope is needed, it is now where tyranny is having its way with the world to include our own country. This movie is a masterpiece which I highly recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Liked the challenge of puzzles and figuring out what next. Needs more levels but they are coming. Not too hard but not too easy.
B008ZENVNG|5.0|A great interpretation of the groundbreaking novel by Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games (3-Disc Deluxe Edition + Digital Copy) is definitely worth your while. Although the film is quite long, it is an enjoyable two and a half hours, and definitely worth it if you have read the book. This edition comes in a spellbinding case, with cool special features, and a play menu that is so stunning you don't want to press play! So good luck, watch the movie, and...stay alive.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Well worth the .99. I really hope they make more packs to play.  Did notice there is some lag in the movement.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love it, but it is very descriptive.  Everything that they do is stated to the exact.  Very easy reading and enjoyable.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|An Amazing well written book, nothing really beats the type of book and way of thinking this presents to the user.
B004L9KN8A|5.0|The parabola of Jean Valjean, a convict rising from the darkest sides of French society, during the first half of the 19th century: a fast-changing era marked by restoration and the July monarchy. Religion in its highest spiritual aspect and fatherly love are the key elements enabling the change in a man who spends the second part of his life working for the good of the poor and most disadvantaged. Cosette, his beloved adopted daughter, ultimately represents his only reason to live after a life of humiliations, changes of identity and hideouts.<br />With Paris as the main setting of the story, we get to know a wide range of characters whose lives intersect in a theatre of poverty, criminality, political turmoil and social isolation. But there is also room for picaresque poetry and light-heartedness in such characters as Gavroche, the sly authentically Parisian street kid. Political idealism is also vividly represented through the republican rebels defending the Chanvrerie barricade during the uprising of 5 and 6 June 1832. Romantic love is portrayed through the glances and secret encounters between Marius and Cosette, while unfulfilled love is depicted in Eponine's sad story. Victor Hugo cleverly balances a complex plot, subtle psychological insight and the poignant description of crucial historical events and their emblematic characters. Here, France stands out in the context of both contemporary Europe and wider general history. Les miserables is an amazing social novel having the power to capture your attention while inspiring many considerations about man's self-determination and some recurring mechanisms of relationships among different social classes.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. My only disappointment was having to purchase the full game after only ten minutes of play. The graphics are very good, and I got a lot of play time out of it.
B0098460O4|4.0|They have outstanding voices.  I really enjoyed tracks 1,2,3, and 6.  Others were good too, overall I would say it was worth buying.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Terrible ending!!! I hate Amy. Team Nick for life. That woman had to go. And yes, the ending seemed rushed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game. it is challenging but not too hard. same type of puzzles in each level got a little boring but it held my interest.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Easy read, but not 'thriller of the year'. Starts strong, ends less so. A little bit too wacky for me.
B004ZJADNQ|4.0|While this is not my favorite Thin Lizzy album, I do like it a lot.  Classic Hard Rocking songs.  Phil is the Man!!!!
B00005JM02|5.0|I could have done with the 1-disc version. There is no difference in the view. But simply love the movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Wonderful acting, costumes, scenery. Terrific story and characters you care about..all emmy worthy. (I dont know who won for season one) I bought both seasons fr my kindle hd and now am anxiously awaitig the release of season three!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is the female version of Fifty Shades of Gray it's an awesome series I didn't think I was going to find another book like it.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Although it is far-fetched I enjoy watching Sylvester Stallone movies, they are action packed and fun to watch - like it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Yes! If you're looking for a puzzle escape game, this is the one. This game updates itself and each level is harder than the last. Plus it's free!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One more of the hunger game books, and then on to the movie, which has got to be great also!
B002ZG974M|5.0|enjoyable show<br />can share with all ages of viewers<br />Iiked the follow up showing when the babies were older<br />thanks
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Of course this is fluffy pop music, but come on, this is Timberlake entertainment at it's finest. No regrets on buying this one.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Very moving movie. the story line was great as way the ending.<br />the movie can be shared with every one
B0000CFW87|5.0|I am one of the &#34;older generation&#34; that truly appreciateds a ballad singer.<br /> I also love the duets he sings with others.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|When I first started reading this book I thought it was a novel and then quickly realized it's the author's memoirs.  What an amazing story to tell and excellently written.  I'm so glad he shared this with us. This book would appeal to any adult.  It makes you laugh and cry.  I hope to read more from Mr. McCourt.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A remarkable look inside the world of Marcus and his experiences as a Navy SEAL. I will be forever in his and all servicemens debt that have and do fight for my continued freedom.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This is a very funny and touching story of a young man in Ireland who grew up in an orphanage.  I loved the descriptive setting and language.  It has an interesting twist at the end.
6305558167|5.0|I love this movie.  Merlin is my fave character.  This Dvd is great.  The coulor is outstanding.  get this movie if you loved this movie.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|this is a fantastic movie but not for everyone. The language and violence are rough to take. The racial truths from every side will make you think at first but then go to the usual violent end.  perfect example of where racism stands these days.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|love this movie,  It is one of my faves. and the DVD is great.  The movie looks better on the dvd than the actual movie when it was realized.  The quality is  outstanding.  Get this dvd.
B005723JSQ|4.0|A little crazy story line but if you want a good weekend read at the beach, this is it. Makes you laugh and roll your eyes.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|Watched the dvd the other day.  it is so good.  I love Hugh and Meg together.  It is such a cute movie and I love the ending
1608871827|5.0|This is a great book, all the artists are credited on every piece. (unlike a lot of recent art of movie books)  Lots of work that's not in the film is included. Lots of cool pull outs and posters included and they did a great job covering all aspects of the film making process. A+ worth every penny
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw this in London with the Original , with Sarah Brighton, and Michael Crawford.  They are the best.  But I love love love<br />Sierra, I saw her in the &#34;Little Mermaid&#34; and she was wonderful .  I love her voice,  I think she has one of the best voices out there.  I love this on stage and I love the movie  as the play on DVD.  get it.  You will love it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I think I may even like this book more than the Kite Runner.<br />The storyline is great, the experiences seems authentic and Hosseini captivates the reader from the very first pages with the father telling the kids a story.... an allusion of what is to come. GREAT summer read.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|I liked the diversity of this story. I disliked the depths of historical rhetoric at times.<br />I really liked this story. I wanted to keep reading and was disappointed with the ending and that it ended where it did.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Seeing the synopsis for this book on Facebook I decided to give this book a try, hoping it would give me some information on the time period. I didn't make a mistake with that decision. From the moment I started this book I enjoyed it. It follows the story of Greta Weisensteiner a young woman living in Brataslavia during World War Two. My only regret about reading this book is reaching the end and discovering the tragic way Greta passed on.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Sound quality is awesome, great features like timer for sleeping. Only wish it would go into landscape mode, but that is not a deal breaker. Love love love this app
B009FZHYKU|5.0|awesome. i can't wait til season 4.  darryl and rick got it under control. glad they got rid of shane and angela
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed playing all the levels. They were interesting and varied. I can't wait to play this game more.<br />Definitely worth playing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's probably the most fun game i have on my kindle and the game is some much fun i have so much time i play this game
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The book are better than the HBO series if you like to read. Chapters are short and the separate stories of the character are comprehensive. I'm reading the series and watching the HBO series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wow, what a mind-blowing, gut-wrenching, unexpected, yet oddly unsurprising ending to this season! Best season yet!  I can't wait for Season 4...
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Brings professionals into contact with one another while facilitating the job search. You can put your resume online.  There are also many professional groups associated with this site that you can join, and there are always ongoing conversations among members
B003O5MOES|5.0|This album reminds me a little of early Bob Dylan (who's music I have always loved). So when hearing the departure from most of his other work and hearing a more salt of the earth side to BRUCE, this became one of my favorites. Finding this missing was a disappointment, and replacing this album was a priority and replaced it the same day.<br /><br />This album might not be for everyone. If your in love with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band I would guess this departure from his Rock an Roll roots would not be one you're going have to have in your collection.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|When I'm feeling unhappy or stressed out, using this app helps cheer me up.  Better than taking an anti-anxiety pill.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Barbra Streisand is always a very good actress and she does not fail in this movie. But the movie story felt long sometimes and repetitive. In the end a light bulb goes on in your head and you think oh so that's what it was about. And it ends there. You will not watch this movie again.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie, I love that you can watch it with the orignal Japanses audio with English subtitles because it just makes the movie so much better. Without giving the story line away too much I'd like to say, Watch it!!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Okay i just received this cd from my girlfriend cuz she is into the same music as me(thankfully) and she sees that a major chunk of my collection is OZZY & Sabbath.<br />So i put this in yesterday when i was cleaning up and let me tell you,one time isn't enough ! So today i put it in again spun it once,and im spinning it again(im at Dear Father) so i figure now ill rate it. This is an excellent album and im so happy it's the old line-up(well 3/4) and i am just so happy. The sound on this just shows you that Sabbath is timeless,Ozzy & the gang are timeless ! This cd has that oldschool sound from their first 8 cds,i really really like the song Zeitgeist cuz it has a Planet Caravan vibe too it. It's like the part 2 of Caravan,Methademic is probably your fastest song on here,but hey they don't have to be fast to be heavy ! This has that undeniable sound of Sabbath snd it's a breath of fresh air in the music scene. Yes i am aware that they have been doing music since 69 but the original band has not been together since Never Say Die or the live Reunion. This album has all new material that i think is terrific,every song to me is a 10 and that is no bs! This just has such a crisp sound to it,as always Ozzy's voice is the holiest of unholy voices( i just love it) This cd is awesome it just bums me out that their are 3 different versions of it and i got the album with 2 discs and 11 songs,the Bestbuy version has another song Naievity in Black,the song is good and im not bummed that i don't have it but it would just be nice to round it out ya know? I don't really need to say anything else,if you are reading it you are familiar with Ozzy/Sabbath then you already know. The bass is nice and heavy i really can hear it flow thru on here. I am really hoping that they have some more juice in em to put out a tour or another album(ive never been able to see either live) But ive got this album and that completes my collection of Sabbath. My dad has the albums i don't have so it's all good,but when i told em they put out a new one and i played it for him it just took him back in time. We kicked back with a doobie and listened to this before it came out & we both loved it so im just happy my girl grabbed it. I highly suggest you pick it up, you won't be disappointed !good,but when i told em they put out a new one and i played it for him it just took him back in time. We kicked back with a doobie and listened to this before it came out & we both loved it so im just happy my girl grabbed it. I highly suggest you pick it up, you won't be disappointed !

B003EYDU60|3.0|My 4yr old is a huge Scooby-Doo fan, but I believed this one was a little bit too mature for his age. He doesn't like the ghost in the beginning and I think some of the monsters in it may have caused the few nights he woke up and came to mommy & daddy's bed. Special effects were cool but I would recommend for older children.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have purchased all three of the Flynn books.  They are twisted and interesting and I hate when they end!  She has colorful characters and the plot always keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B0084IG7KC|4.0|It's a good movie although I must say the book had some details that made the story a bit better. My family (who did not read the book) loved the movie, including my 23 year old male cousin. Although it's rare for him to not like a movie, he will find something good about almost anything.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|loving it fun love horses .I even made a songI love horses I love horses very much very much yes I do yes I do

B00BWLKTOS|5.0|The Piano Guys somehow manage to mix classical and pop music to create something both complex and very easy to listen to.  Several of the pieces sound like they were a blast to play, and they are equally fun to listen to.  While the best experience of The Piano Guys is on YouTube as you both hear the music and watch the visuals (Happy Together is a kick), the music alone is great.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The characters were not that likeable and eventually I didn't care what happened to them. There were some interesting thoughts and actions but not that interesting. I've already forgotten the book.

B00CF34B2I|1.0|This is a warning to Kindle owners. It shows as compatible with my Kindle. I installed and started it. Now my Kindle is bricked. So I do not recommend it. It's also 1.2 Gb (so keep that in mind). The version for my Samsung Galaxy is glitchy and has far too small a screen to make play practical. I'm out a Kindle and forced to go to Steam (which I was buying anyway for the multiplayer).
125000098X|2.0|Mr Archer is shortchanging his public.I have read the majority of his books and overall enjoyed the easy reading literature.I believe he is now \\"cashing in\\".The content of the third Clifton Chronicle is short of substance.I am most doubtful he wrote the script himself,it lacks his normal flowing style ,the story is highly unconvincing.When you think what Ken Follett gives the reader in\\"Pillars of the Earth\\" one feels shortchanged by Mr. Archer minimal effort to drag out the Clifton Chronicles to five short volumes.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|Easy and enjoyable enough to read.<br />The main character I found really endearing but couldn't relate to any others.<br />Certainly a bit of a quirky/different storyline.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Very well done in the realm of fantastical movie making. Good characters, some amazing cinematography, and a great story. Always nice to see a series that also doesn't taint a movie with some hidden or blatant religious agenda. A bit of violence, gore and sex but nothing out of the ordinary or too heavy. Now if only the big screen would follow suit and quit cranking out so much teen and religious crap.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|\\"Easy A\\" is easily one of the highlights of Emma Stone's career.  She plays up the wit of the script perfectly as the precocious Olive Penderghast.  Her parents steal the spotlight many times throughout, as they remind us of the weirdo parents we or our friends have.  Tackling sex, academics, and the rumor mill, Stone's movie is a smart, well-executed movie filled with countless allusions to literature and pop culture.  \\"Easy A\\" is an A+.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a child.  Being that I went to Catholic School, it interest me very much because of the nuns we had at school.  You see all the things that a nun has to go through before becoming a nun, she gives up so much.  They move them from place to place and they really have no say in it.  The places they had Audry Hepburn go to were very interesting and how she just followed orders to be of help.  Audrey Hepburn was an excellent actress.  This movie is incredible. I truly recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This was not as good as his other books. Interesting story, but very disjointed.  Hard to keep track of. But I am glad I read it.

B000HL0EEE|3.0|TNG will always be my star trek of choice.  Picard and the rest of the crew were absolutely perfect in my opinion.  Enterprise is good and I am currently watching the whole series for the first time, but it isn't even close to TNG level.  I think my two biggest negatives on the show are the two stars.  I really don't mind Scott Backula as an actor, but I don't think he fits into this role.  Not only that, but his character doesn't really fit either.  He is suppose to be a captain of the best ship in Star Fleet and yet he acts like he didn't even go to college(head engineer has the same issue).  He has very limited leadership skills and constantly does things that don't seem right for someone who presumably has been in Star Fleet for X amount of years preparing to lead a crew of elite men and women into the unknown.  Refer to Picard for what a captain should really be like.  The Vulcan is also out of place in this show.  I think her character is ok, but the actor is not.  She is clearly there to sell sex for the show and attract men to watch it.  Sex is not what Star Trek is about.  Why is there a female Vulcan walking around in a skin tight suit with double d's?  It is just weird and takes me out of the show everytime I see her.  It is illogical for Vulcans to be that sexual.  They should be pretty dull and boring in their appearance since they have evolved past having emotions.  Not to mention Vulcan parents choose mates for their children and they only have sex like 6 days out of the year(don't have human biology/aren't looking for sex all the time like humans).  There is no reason for Vulcans to show sexuality.  Apparently you can get breast implants on Vulcan though.  I hope with the movies being out now, they will create another series. Unfortunately, they will probably continue the trend of over sexualizing it  and making the crew act slightly smarter than a bag of rocks.  I am sorry Gene for what they have done to your baby.

B006RXQ8RI|5.0|This movie was awesome. I've never been a fan of Uma Therman, but after this movie I started to like her a little bit. This movie had just the right amount of Kung fu, and the story was great.

B00932AA5G|5.0|Excellent thriller. Would highly recommend it to anyone. Full with unexpected twists and turns......Not for the faint hearted. Good chice
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I have to admit I started watching White Collar because of the beautiful, attractive, gorgeous, sexy looking I want to dive and get lost in his blue eyes Matt Bomer, but the show got me hook on the plots and twists right from the beginning.<br />I love the way the two main characters interact with each other and even do they view things from a different angle, they complement each other. The rest of the cast is superb too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Got it on a whim, and have really enjoyed it. Like 100 floors, but better. Not so horribly hard that it's a pain, but not easy. Enough of a challenge to keep you interested.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|This movie was just as great as i remember it.  What a great treat to watch it with my own little ones!  They are 5 and 2 and LOVED it as much as i do! Classic movie that everyone should enjoy...no scary parts at all.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Good graphic and tech. for this kind of movie.<br />Would be more attractive if you add one good/beautiful looking character to balance the view.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This movie was great for kids! Fast paced so kids don't get bored and wonderful effects. A little on the corny side at times, but that was what made the movie so much fun. Definitely not a deep, complicated movie, so grown-ups be warned!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love a book that makes me laugh, and this was definitely it! I highly recommend this book. I hope the movie is as good.

B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|every track was beautifully made, you can tell that j cole put his heart and soul into this whole album.  Trouble really got to me tho
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|And no, I am not referring to an Axl Rose effort here, but rather an album that heralds a true return to form for one of the true pioneering bands of their era.<br /><br />Unless you have been hiding under a rock for the past year or so, as a Queensryche fan it has been nigh on impossible to escape the legal nightmare that has erupted over the rights to the name and assets of the band of late. This has sadly caused a massive division between fans which shows no sign of abating until at least November when the American legal system will hopefully swing into action in a decisive manner and settle at least one argument.<br /><br />Until then, fans have so far had the effort from Geoff Tate to digest and mull over, which has been controversial to say the least receiving an almost universal panning on several levels. I am not going into details here; my feelings on that album can be read in another review on this site. However, fans wanting the complete picture who have been patiently awaiting this release, which was delayed from an earlier release date, can rest assured that their patience will be rewarded!<br /><br />From the opening bell tolls on intro X2, we are already in familiar territory - Rockenfield's work on atmospheric soundtracks is well known and does well to set the scene here, building to a nice peak to lead into Where Dreams Go To Die which introduces a classic Queensryche element that has been sorely missing of late - the dual guitar attack! Stylistically, we're evoking an atmosphere that falls somewhere between the pomp and grandeur of Rage for Order and the slick songwriting of Empire, with more than a tip of the hat to Mindcrime. This reviewer is glad to report that this is evident in EVERY track on this album...no weak fillers here, this album is cohesive and consistent from the opening bell to the last note!<br /><br />Although I mention Rage for Order, this is not a nostalgia trip in my mind - this is a current album, a Queensryche for the 21st century if you will...they just seem to have rediscovered the creativity and energy that made them stand out all those years ago. This album is relentless in its aural assault with powerhouse songs like the opener and Redemption, fast paced rockers such as Spore and Vindication and the epic melodies of In This Light and A World Without, the latter featuring a certain Pamela Moore. All this, wrapped up in a neat production by Queensryche regular James 'Jimbo' Barton - you lucky people!<br /><br />Of course the big question here is around the new vocalist Todd La Torre. The best his detractors have come up with is that he is a Tate clone, which in some respects is a compliment! Tate, at his best, was a game changing vocalist who was able to emote more than most and boasted a range that set him apart. La Torre has already proved himself by taking on the job and successfully submitting killer live performances of the classics, but how does his performance stand up in the recorded format? Admittedly, there are times where he does sound very much like classic Tate. However, there are certain nuances in his voice that set him apart, especially in his ability to deliver a slightly more aggressive tone at times. He is not afraid to let his voice break away from the silky smooth, melodic tones to allow a certain raw element to come into the fore.<br /><br />La Torre has not just brought his powerhouse voice to the party, he has brought a level of musicianship to the band that has only enhanced the overall result here and he shares writing credits on several songs which, to him as a fan of Queensryche for years, must be a dream come true. Guitarist Parker Lundgren also does an amazing job by teaming his guitar with Michael Wilton so seamlessly, bringing a much loved and missed element of classic Queensryche back to the fold.<br /><br />This, for me at least, is the true Queensryche album this year. It was written by the members of the band as a true band record. No dramas, no pathetically gimmicky cover, no outside writers...just pure creativity from five musicians who have delivered finally the album that has been in them for 15 years or more. I am glad to see that the majority of reviewers agree.<br /><br />About time, boys!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Can't wait to read the next one! I love these types of books and stories, I enjoyed the book very much!

B009JBZH54|5.0|This is truly a great collector's edition set.  Special features discs are in depth and interesting.  The packaging is attractive, and the included photo book has some great shots.  Good gift for any fan of these movies.  (Note, includes no DVDs, Blue Ray only).
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie, it was really adorable.  Good movie for kids and adults alike.  Would  tell everyone to watch it soon.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|It was a wonderful prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However you could tell it was stretched way beyond the means of original material. I think everyone is tired of the Scrappy doo Orcs battles.<br />  It would be nice to show more backstory on the main characters. Use that for filler.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|this book is really cool i hope the 8th one comes out soon i just love the books they are long and funny.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the story of an older man who returns to his childhood home for a funeral. After the funeral, he begins to drive through his old haunts and winds up on a farm that has been in the area for centuries. A pond behind the farmhouse is eerily familiar to him, and memories begin seeping back into him as he sits by it. He remembers a strange and wonderful girl he knew when he was seven, named Lettie Hempstock. He remembers that she called the pond her ocean. And then, \\"I remembered that, and, remembering that, I remembered everything.\\"<br /><br />As the man sits by Lettie's ocean, he remembers the dark adventure he had the year that he turned seven. It started when his family's lodger stole their car, drove it to the end of the lane, and died there. That is how the boy first meets Lettie Hempstock and her mother and grandmother-three fantastic, wise, and strong women who protect him as terrifying events unfurl around him. The boy learns what it is truly like to feel frightened, powerless, and, ultimately, brave.<br /><br />This book is being marketed as Mr. Gaiman's first book for adults since American Gods and Anansi Boys. The book feels, however, much more in line with the tone of his books for children, Coraline and The Graveyard Book--dark and dangerous, but also beautiful and filled with wonder. While the book is told from the perspective of a seven year old boy, it becomes clear through the subtleties in the book why the novel is marketed towards adults.<br /><br />While, yes, there are some elements to the book that are distinctly adult, including an evil woman who would give Philip Pullman's Mrs. Coulter a run for her money, the true reason that the book is for adults is found in the novel's epigraph. The epigraph is taken from a conversation that Art Spiegelman, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel Maus had with Maurice Sendak, author of beloved children's books such as Where the Wild Things Are and In the Night Kitchen. Sendak said, \\"I remember my own childhood vividly... I knew terrible things. But I knew I mustn't let adults know I knew. It would terrify them.\\" This book is written for adults, not children, because it is filled with a type of nostalgia and melancholy that children cannot fully understand yet. As the adult narrator looks back on the adventures he had when he was seven, he remembers what it was like to be a child. Lonely, lost in dreams and worlds from books, powerless in the face of the adults around him in a frightening world. But he was also wise, insightful, and, at times, fearless.<br /><br />This book is seeped in nostalgia, a pain and longing for home. \\"So what will happen now?\\" the adult narrator asks one of the Hempstock women at the end of the book. \\"You go home,\\" she replies. \\"I don't know where that is anymore,\\" he tells her. The journey back into memories long buried in his mind is hard and painful, but also a piece of the home that he lost long before. The man remembers what it is like to believe in something, to have a deep sense of conviction, and to utterly trust another person even with his life. And as much as the journey hurts, as the man sits by the pond that is Lettie's ocean, he comes home for a while, able to see into the core of what makes him who he is, both dark and light.<br /><br />While Gaiman's new novel is a slender 178 pages, it is powerful because of the honesty with which he tells the story. It is an incredibly personal narrative, one that stays with the reader long after the last page is turned. Gaiman reminds adult readers of what it is like to be a child, and reminds us of how much children truly know. And, as Maurice Sendak said, it is terrifying, but also wonderful.
1936608898|5.0|Very well written book that gave me the best understanding of how food is broken down, and why certain foods cause problems (obesity, stress, & ultimately diseases) as they are broken down into their components.  Their diet advice roughly follows that of the 'caveman diet', (meat & veggies, a little fruit), but they make a good arguement for the diet, and personally it has worked for me: I've lost 10lb in 3 weeks, and my energy and attitude are up.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I cried tears of joy listening to this album. Scott kills it, Eddie is awesome, Whip and Parker are incredible.....and Todd La Torre?  His vocals are stunning.  A World Without really showcases Todd's voice.  This is the best Queensrÿche album in a VERY long time.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|this is not only a beautiful story, it is told in beautiful language.  It is not a quick read.  It is one that you need to savor and digest slowly to appreciate its flavor.  As usual, Hooseini gives us a profound education through a dynamic story.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Rihanna is one of my favorite singers to date. I always enjoy listening to her music and I love to sing along with her songs. I am looking forward to the future music she produces.

B0099G3I96|5.0|No Doubt has been around since I was 10 years old. I have always found their music to be fun to sing and dance around to. They are an entertaining band and continue to produce quality music and will continue to do so in the future.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. You really feel like you're taking care of the horses.the graphics are amazing and the mini games are so addicting.
B004PUG7MG|5.0|Avril Lavigne is such a wonderful artist. I remember how she used to be such a tomboy, but she has grown into a beautiful and talented young woman. I love listening to her music and I have a lot of her albums and enjoy all the songs on them.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The episodes of Castle are all so interesting and the dialogue so entertaining that I find my self watching them over and over.  I love the relationship between Castle and Beckett and hope the tension that they have always had will turn into happy situations for the characters now, not so much wrought with the uncertainity each felt in the past seasons.  I try to see at LEAST one episode of Castle a day and could watch this show every day for years to come...it's THAT GOOD!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This was an enjoyable album to listen to. Bruno Mars is a great songwriter and singer. His songs are catchy and heartfelt when they need to be. Here's to more music from Bruno Mars in the future!
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I watched this movie on VHS a zillion times with my kids when they were young. It was our &#34;go-to&#34; favorite! Now that I have grandkids, I wanted them to share in the love of it & they do!! It's always the 1st movie they ask to see when we have them over for &#34;fort & popcorn night&#34;. Plus...Val Kilmer's in it, so who wouldn't like it? ;)
B0083EW97W|5.0|It was nice to hear a new album by John Mayer. I still remember when his first album came out and he has been one of my favorite artists since then. I think that most people would find his music enjoyable and creative.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I couldn't believe just how much I loved this story, how impossible it was to put down, and how I reread the ending at least four times because I adored it so much!  I cannot recommend it highly enough. The characters become so real that you feel as if they are your neighbors--that you are the one taking the journey to Guernsey and discovering the treasure of the people who reside there as you are drawn in by their personalities and their stories. I will read it again at some point...it's just that good.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|I love Lady Antebellum!! They are one of my favorite country music groups and I find their music entertaining and heartfelt. I am looking forward to hearing their music in the years to come.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|This bulb puts out a nice comparable illumination. I wouldn't hesitate to spend more for general lighting with this bulb. Knowing that it's low wattage and it's output is very substantial I recommend you order one first to make sure it fits your needs. I replaced my bulb in the basement where I had the florescent bulb and this one outshines it and is safer.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|The Band Perry is one of my newest favorite country groups. It is nice to see a sibling group be successful together. If you love country music then you would love The Band Perry.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I loved this book so much.  I liked Something Borrowed, but I really really loved this one.  I enjoyed the characters so much and felt like I could relate to them because I'm a 20-something I guess.  I highly recommend this book.  It's a good read.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The book served for a good book club discussion.  It's an interesting tale that we enjoyed I  do recommend it!!
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|I think this is their best album since MHTRTC, and maybe even better. It's dark and slow and intense, but perhaps that's the reason I enjoy BoC so much.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|Kiss is Ace, Peter, Gene, and Paul. Much like Rush, you can't replace any member in Kiss and still call it Kiss! This is a tribute band. I'm just glad I got to see the original band once. I'll never go see them or buy anything without the original members.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|My son loves the game, he finds it very interesting to combine elements together to create things. Easy to play!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love deciphering and solving puzzles or brain teasers.  This game met the challenge of keeping me interested and having me think.  After the first puzzle, I had to keep going.  I can't wait for a new puzzle to become available.  It's definitely a thinking game.
B001NA6096|5.0|The actors are so believable & charming. The dialogue & editing make for an unforgettable experience of delicate & intriguing drama. Linklater & crew & have woven together a beautiful tapestry. We are so glad we own this film; we will enjoy it often.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|It's an excellent option for Superman fans. It has the music and a bonus like trailers and pictures from the movie.<br />I put 5 stars because it has a 2 in 1 CD.<br />For lovers of Chris Reeve Superman movies' this is a nice &#34;sequel&#34; of Superman II, and Ottman has a &#34;John Williams effect&#34;. You can feel the movie with the music.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Works great and has a lot of nice features and options to customize how you see fit. I use this for all my alarm/timer/stopwatch needs.
034580404X|5.0|i bought this series for my mother-in-law. this is one of her favorite books. the price and value of it was definately worth it
B009K0P10K|5.0|I feel the real Emily's pain.  I love that Emily has chosen to take back everything that was taken from her.  she is a survivor not just a victim.
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|I have to say this is one of the better movies I have watched this year.  I absolutely loved it
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I would recommend this drama series - it's interesting and the characters are believable. It's set at the beginning of World War 2.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|You will fall in love with this animal and want one of your own. Great narrating and awesome color and filming.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a great introduction for writing a kindle book and I should have read it before I started. Clear instructions and a great help. Particularly helpful was how to format the text so that my kindle book looks professional and readable. It's clear that the author knows the subject inside out. I recommend this book to anyone who is thinking of writing a book and wanting it to publish on kindle.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I teach middle school language arts.  I read a lot of YA and middle grade literature.  I'm also the mom of a thirteen year old girl.  I'm often a bit put off by the sex in YA books and even when the book is a great read have a hard time either putting on my shelf or letting my own daughter read it.<br /><br />I've already put this book in her hands.  It is a wonderful story about two dorky kids who forge first a friendship and then a romance.  It happens slowly and magically.  There is some make-out scenes, but the author handled them beautifully and didn't cheapen the romance by putting it all on the page.<br /><br />This book is funny and real and doesn't end up happily ever after.  In 1986 I was exactly the age that Eleanor was, and I could totally relate to feeling that dorky and alone.  I also loved all the musical references!  I hope kids start to look up some of the music listed in this book.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|I like it because my Grandchildren like it and asked me to get it for them.  Seems like a fun game for them to play.
B005CRY2O6|4.0|This cookbook has innovative recipes and easy to follow directions.  The pictures are gorgeous.  I have taken the basic ideas from a few recipes and modified to fit my personal taste and available ingredients; they were a success.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|What I like about this series is it is taking off with a lot of different things popping up as it goes along. I see the integrity of the main characters and it sets a standard which I then can see the good from the evil and wise from wrong decisions, etc. In other words it get me thinking about things. It is enjoyment for sure.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|fun intelligent movie, with full spectrum of entertainment<br />also pretty long, but not boring, so good value<br />overall great movie
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing. people who dony love this are crazy. this is the game to die for. jow you get to take care of the horses so fun.  people wiil love this game for a long time
B0031RAOVY|1.0|I am a huge animal lover, but this movie was so freaking slow and pointless that I stopped watching part way through to check some of the 1-star reviews to decide whether to bother finishing it. Turns out the movie is nothing more than a one-dimensional (and extremely fictionalized) dramatization of a 30-second true anecdote, dragged out excruciatingly in order to make it long enough to sell as a movie. Here comes a spoiler, but if I were you I would read it anyway and save yourself an hour & a half out of your life: a guy adopts a dog that he found; the dog waits every evening at the train station for the guy to get home from work; one day the guy dies, but the dog continues to wait for him for years, living out in the elements the entire time. The end. If you are a parent of small children, run screaming from this film because even though it is rated G, it features extended, traumatic scenes of a dog being neglected and suffering. BTW If I were a parent, I would also not want my kids to watch a movie that glorifies and renders \\"heartwarming\\" the incredibly cruel and irresponsible behavior of most of the adults in it.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I was looking forward to this movie because of it's concept and cast.<br />Lots of action and a solid story. My only complaint is the modernisms that<br />don't really add to the story - language, weapons, etc.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like dragon vale ALOT it's awsome there so many things to do and alot of cool and exciting things.Also dragon vale  has alot of cool  dragon's there like so awsome I have sommany dragon's there so cool and awsome . That's why you should get dragon vale also it's free . And that's why you should get dragon vale.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|since ur reading this ima be honest &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;um when I tryed to download this app it said &quot;were sorry this app can not be installed&quot; and of course I tryed to install it more than once but it simply did not work im not sure if im the only person with this problem well&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&infin;toodles&infin;
1616551631|5.0|The book is jammed with a lot of very nice art. It depicts a nice variety of the environments, characters and weapons. You can flip through parka's video review to see for yourselves.I think people who like concept books will be pleased with this one.
B004S9AJXW|5.0|Ken Follett is a brilliant author no matter what genre he chooses - I could not put this book down even for a minute!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I think this is such a beautiful and romantic cd.  It was chosen for an Italian dinner party (background music)  It was a hit!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I HATE U<br />I HATE THIS BOOK IT IS THE WORST BOOK EVER I HAVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
B0094K1MH2|2.0|Prefer the books...Action in an animated movie is somehow less engaging. Didn't care for the Thompson twins neither. Just a let down.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|THIS WAS BETTER THAN THE OTHER DICTIONARY<br />I LOVED THIS IT WAS AWESOME THANK U VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME
0451232852|5.0|I LOVE this book! One of the best that Follett has written (and I've read them all), and it's the best WWI historical fiction novel I've ever read. Amazing :)
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack Joyride is a game about Barry Streakfires (I think that's his name). Anyways time for the review. This a game where Barry steals a jetpack from a laboratory and (I guess) tries to escape. Controls couldn't be simpler. You tap and hold to go up. You release to go down. Graphics couldn't be better. The gadgets are cool. Some are Flash, Turbo Boost, and Lucky Last. The jetpacks are awesome. Most items are inexpensive. The missions are sometimes easy ans other times hard. Overall this is worth your time.<br />  -GameBoss
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As a true introvert who learned to play the &#34;con&#34; of becoming a Type A in order to meet expectations in the workplace, could totally relate to the information presented in this read. Recommend for anyone interested in either a technical or human (aka team or &#34;management&#34;) leadership position.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I thought Angry Birds Space would be a little better than it is. The concept is cool, but the game sucks. The Angry Birds series has plundered. The objective is to destroy the bad pigs. It couldn't get anymore repetitive than that. I hate the ads. They pop up once or twice a game. They have an ad free version, but who wants to pay when there's a free version. I only like the graphics. That's it. In the new Angry Bird games I hope Rovio adds something new to the table.<br />  I'm new to this and I know people will judge me. But there's one thing I have to say for that... I call them as I see fit.<br />  -GameBoss
B000HF0IIC|4.0|This is a good way of keeping the old style comic with a bit more reality and much better acting than the 1966 movie.  However, Nicole Kidman is entirely too forward and the comment from Jim Carrey about Robin's purity could be skipped completely without losing the plot.  Overall, a really good movie for my son.  I just needed to distract him a couple of times (easy enough).
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is just like the original Temple Run. You jump, run, turn, and slide. But after playing I noticed some new things. There's mine carts, zip lines, and (I don't know what to call them) planks of wood. There's some new features and I will name one of them. It's the save me. I (personally) don't like it because I think it's a cheat. I bet the top players used the save me feature to obtain there top scores. I know I said I would give one new feature but I can't help it. It's the daily and weekly challenges. I think Imangi Studios stole the idea from the creators of Subway Surfers but they made it better. The challenges are harder and I like hard. The reason I didn't give the game 5 stars is because the background is repetitive. In conclusion, Imangi Studios thought well.<br />  -GameBoss
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I think that this second AIC album without Layne Staley is easier for fans to initially enjoy since 2009's Black Gives Way to Blue required us to accept, and get used to, a new lineup. As time went by, I enjoyed Black even more than ever and was really looking forward to The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. \\"Hollow\\" and \\"Stone\\" were released early to help the album buildup, and have the classic hard AIC sound. Lead singer(s) William DuVall and Jerry Cantrell really click together, and slower songs such as \\"Scalpel\\" and \\"Choke\\" also deliver the goods. There is no fluff here as they tackle some heavy topics such as religions that won't accept others who don't follow their ideals (Dinosaurs) and personal pride causing people to leave the ones they love (Choke). You hear the layered sound and heavy chorus that were a signature in both Dirt and Jar of Flies, but the album stands on its own and isn't trying to copy old material. I hope Alice in Chains continues to make great music, and Dinosaurs proves they still have a lot to offer their fans.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I think this application is great.  I can check it at anytime and I know exactly how much battery life is left.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The first half is a little slow, but the second half has kept me up past 2am every night reading. Excellent!  I can hardly wait to read the next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everyone who reads my report should really try this app! it's more awesome than temple run I can assure you reader. And besides it's free!who could possibly turn down a game recommended by a game player like me? So get the app you won't regret it.
B0048PU7TC|5.0|How did I miss this cd.... the duet of &#34;Baby It's Cold Outside&#34; with Willie Nelson alone is worth the price.... I've always liked Norah because she really relaxes and calms me down when I need it most at work... this cd was her best in my opinion.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love the game and its graphics, but after ya play the game to a certain point you have to buy the full version to finish the game. Otherwise it's a really good game :)
B004NELBPC|2.0|HUGE Huffpo fan but after reading all reviews I realize I am having similar problems and will remove the app. I don't mind the new large picture, small font format, but am so frustrated by wanting to read an opinion piece and getting nothing but a blank page or a half page. Is HuffPo reading this feedback and responding? I thought removing it from my device and reinstalling would help...nope. I can NEVER read Maureen Ryan, this is problematic for a major Mad Men fan. Hope it gets more Kindle friendly.
B005HSL626|4.0|I have a grandson who really like it and it keeps him busy sometimes . If other customers have grandkids age from 3 to 10 this would be a great game for them to enjoy
1451695195|1.0|I had a hemorrhagic brain stem stroke and was in a coma (Rancho code 1) for three months. No pearly white gates...nothing. Unless a person comes back AFTER going through RIGOR MORTIS, I have a hard time believing these accounts, although I do believe in God. I believe books like this are respectfully, a scam.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Beware!  You'll have these songs stuck in your head all day long!  Big fun summertime CD.  Enjoy being a teenager again!
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Good family film, a little slow at first and a little sad at the end.  Good surf footage and Jays story should be seen.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|they skipped too many things & trivialize all the relationships plus the ending was horrible. the table scene and the visualizes I really liked and wanted more the acting was ok but jeremy irons was the best.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game because it is fun and  affordable it is the best game and I believe if you don't have it you should get it.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|The post WWI history of Germany is terribly complex.  This movie is a great way to see what was happening to so many people, gays straights, decent citizens facing a rapidly and dangerously changing world.  Liza and Joel are great is this and the musical numbers are at time heart rending in a world about to go under Hitler's domination and into WW2.  The scene with the Hitler youth song is heart stopping and chilling.
B001G9F9IW|5.0|The dvd was a great price for a blu-ray! I enjoy watching this movie! It is a favorite of mine!
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Sometime you want a break from big important movies and have some like SHORT CIRCUIT in reserve for those quiet times you want a really positive heart warming movie with decent values.  This is one that I enjoy watching again and again and finally after my old copy (VHS and the player when the way of 8 tracks) I decided it was worth getting again.
B00CBKVGGY|4.0|A good action film based on a true story.  The old gangster movies are some of my favorites and I love movies based on true stories.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|I grew up in NY and went to graduate school in upstate New York so the history of the borsch belt resorts was of interest and passing of the 1950's age of innocence into a newer sexually charged era of the 1960's and beyond.  This is a warm hearted view of coming of age in a time without HIV or tectonic shifts in gender and sex roles.  Both leading characters are done well and this is a deligthful movie to watch on a warm summer everning to remember this by-gone era.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love the game!BUT  I purchased coins twice and I sent in a complaint and still nothing.. that and if you play bingo most of the tokens are seven eight a card so you dont even get to play maybe 3 times before your out of tokens..
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lots of fun for a vast range of ages! I recommend for new takers as well as seasoned. The graphics are beautiful and the story keeps you interested. I will definitely be playing it again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy the hidden objects games and I'm enjoying this one alot but I'm stuck! I can't find the blue weight in level 6! I've stopped playing out of frustration for a few days but will continue to play until I'm done.
B000002KFJ|5.0|One of my favorite bands and one of my favorite albums. This is pure black sabbath sound. The heavy guitar cranking bass Strong drums and Ozzie
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This app is simply what the title says. I have had so much fun! It's as close as you can get to the real deal, and I think anyone who plays or is interested in MTG should get this.
B009K0P10K|5.0|It was very interesting and held my attention for the both seasons. Their were so many twist and turns that it demanded my attention. The acting is superior.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Great movie to watch with your family. Its showed the importance of teaching each other how to love and not to hate.
B005OP7162|5.0|It was very interesting and held my attention for the both seasons. Their were so many twist and turns that it demanded my attention. The acting is superior.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the next season. We have enjoyed all three seasons. We hope that it can continue to be a plot that can grow.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Characters are subtle, complex, and constantly evolving. Each episode brings some intriguing or surprising plot twist - all the while progressing with a relaxed feel where deeper plots unfold slowly across whole seasons. The characters are totally believable, the acting is amazing, and the film locations and costumes literally sweep you away to another time and place. A must see (start with season 1, though)!!
B000EWBNMS|4.0|The disks seem to work very well in our Blu-Ray player and the picture and sound are very good also.<br />No complaints; am a happy camper !!!<br /><br />RearView
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a great read! Didn't want to see it end. I wish there were more book like this. It had the perfect mix of humor and romance!
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Stitch is so silly and my boys love the &#34;potty humor&#34;.  Love the friendship that Lilo and stitch form.  So sweet.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|i purchased this c/d after watching The Crossing Guard. When i heard the song Missing-i lost my breath. it is sexy,<br />sensual, it has pain,tears,sorrow....I play it at least twice a week.  it is music & feelings that get to your soul.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I am an avid JRPG player, mostly focusing on Final Fantasy (until XIII which I was unable to really \\"get into\\") I was introduced to Persona 4 Golden recently which at first glance looks a bit childish and obscure. Give it a chance. I am a huge relationship sim fan as well, which is a bonus to this series. Imagine the sidequests of Final Fantasy VI (all the additional characters) but with a relationship kicker.<br />Seriously, it's a great game and likely one of the best games i've played in such a long time.
B002DJSBMA|5.0|Brad,Anthony,Clair, Marsha, are all winners & this movie so impressed me that i also went out & got the c/d.
B00622D3BS|5.0|Moves fast and very entertaining. Seen it a dozen times or so now, 4 starts IMO. Gossling is especially great.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|I am a missionary and I think the game is very cute. it is nice to see a biblically themed game for once. do to the fact that it does stray from the true story, we will not be letting our 5 year old son play it. he would love it but we also know it would confuse him. since I am an adult and have studied exodus I can obviously spot the playfulness.<br /><br />this game is not what is destroying Christianity in America. lukewarm, halfhearted Christians who tell people how to behave but are not truely living out their faith are the ones that will cause people to fall away.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Cant help but enjoy this series. This one does not dissapoint with the action you expect. It has moments that are an extreme stretch on reality but I didnt mind. This is a great father/ son duo and will keep you engaged from the first 5 minutes on.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Light at times, but kept you engrossed in it's plot.  Good movie, without excessive violence or language. Better than we thought.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|This was a good movie but i found it to be a bit confusing. At one point they are making the lead character out to be something less than the hero of the story and painting a picture of him being a bit of a nobody. The next thing you know, they are making him sound like a super stud. I think the director should have followed one path or another on this one. With that aside, it was good and I would watch it again. Lots of action in this one and ends well.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|At first I was reluctant to read past the events of the red wedding, since I'm watching GoT on HBO, but my curiosity got the better of me. A Feast for Crows lives up to it's title--there is more death, more despair, than ever. It seems that Martin is out to subvert the theme of heros and legends that his characters constantly refer to; none are safe, heroic action more often than not leads to pitiful death rather than glory, and no one can be trusted.<br /><br />Sometimes it was difficult to read through the sorrow and gore, but I couldn't stop!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|And better than ever. This updated tale brings it to full scale using modern CG technology. It is a fun adventure that can be a bit intense at moments but avoids any real gore. I watched it with my 5 yr old daughter and she loved it so much she watched it twice in a row.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|The game is lots of fun, graphics are great, and it has all the charm of LBP. I knocked 1 star off because controls aren't perfect but they work fine. This is one great game.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have read all 3 of her books and can not wait for the next one. She writes about craziness in an unique manner.  This is not your &#34;girl meets boy and falls in love&#34; stuff.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Great Calculator App! Love that you can edit it to make paying bills so much easier. Would love a send to printer mode.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|The acting was cheesy.<br />The fact that it actually happened<br />was AMAZING! I love whales, and<br />to know people actually will give their<br />all to save them is just<br />AWESOME!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is so addicting. Only semi down thing about it is how short it is, finished it in four hour. That being said, those four hours were so much fun, I just want more!
B003SI6C4O|5.0|Loved how this keeps you on your toes.<br />For all the times you think 'I've done this<br />before' ...<br />You need to watch this.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|I really enjoyed getting this backstage view of Bob Dylan.  The only thing I wish is for it to be in color.  A lot of Bob Dylan's 60s footage tends to be in black and white.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I had no IDEA how this movie would<br />transform into what it actually depicted.<br />Great job! But how sad to have to live with<br />the consequences of what life throws at<br />one.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is ok but the way it moves makes it kind of tricky and when you are supposed to move fast you don't move for very long.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Very well done. With all the<br />devastation, still able to focus<br />on family. Watch!.<br />You will not be disappointed!<br />Promise!
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Laughed a couple times. Mainly grinned and then slept. It was boring for long sections. I wish I'd of passed.
B007Q476KU|5.0|Have owned my own horses throughout my life.<br />And they can get under your skin like no<br />human can do sometimes.<br />This is not only true, but it is believable!
B000002JSN|5.0|Saw Led Zeppelin play this CD 6 months before it was released. Kasmir through a quad PA live, never having heard it before was simply unforgetable!
B003V5CFV8|5.0|I had studied Homer in high school.<br />The fact that this movie is based on<br />Homer is a scream!  Okay,<br />i'm going to R U N D  OFF!!!!!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Although the quality of the music was not that good, the drama, story telling, and filming was excellent and held your attention
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Love the characters, plot, exquisite meanings & references, oh just love the entirety of this book! Austin rarely disappoints me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great and lots of fun for all. I would recommend it for all who love horses. great animation.<br />pleasesp<br /><br />A
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|The script makes you relate to the characters as does the fine acting.  When you finish the movie you have something to think about that resembles the world we live in.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|The special effects and makeup were amazing.  Some of those witches were definitely on the spooky side.  However, the storyline was (uncertain what word to use to indicate juvenile and silly) less than great.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|difficult to follow in some instances.  didn't hold my interest as his previous book did.  just not that interesting to read.
0374139563|5.0|This lady's credentials are out of this world.<br />She has rubbed elbows with Naill whom I consider one of the greats.. so i'll let you decide, but this is definitely a must read for every highschool student~esp economics class.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a really good book - really hard to put down.  It's a shame that the movie received so much attention when so much of the real story was missing from the script - and every other word in the movie was a curse word.  The book was much better and well worth reading.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Just a fun shoot'em up bang-bang movie that makes being middle aged not look so bad.  Crack a beer and have fun with it!
B008QTVNUI|2.0|Too violent.  Nothing to think about.  Belongs to the tradition of substituting sound and visual effects for a script with something to think about.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I have read the other novels by this author and she never disappoints me. Her view of race relations in the United States should be a must read for everyone. She never loses sight of her story or her amazing characters in making these points.
B00333NCTM|4.0|Ozzy does a great job of writing his stories of success, failures,addiction and madness. I read Tony Iommi's bio a while back, and between the two I have  become an even bigger Black Sabbath fan.
0375826742|5.0|He's been bugging me to get each book in the series and refused to read anything in between.  He really enjoys these stories because they are action-packed and there is something happening from the beginning.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|It is a cute lttle game and quite different from any other game I've played.  Great for kids and adults.
0802473164|5.0|When you dont understand why people dont accept the love you are giving in the way its meant, frustration and ill feelings begin to slowly creep in. When you are on the same page, love given is love received!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I Got This App Because I Havent Seen A Simple App For Measuring And Monitoring My Battery. I Love That It Shows Up In my Notification bar.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good escape puzzle game. Not too hard but somewhat challenging. I am not particularly good at puzzle games, but I got through the first ten levels. Was disappointed it stopped there.
B009RH9J7W|3.0|I find it very helpful to be able to stand my Kindle Fire---as light as it is, I have pain in my arm and shoulder from holding the device. It's not really complicated, but it took me a while to figure out how to make it work. It does hold the Fire in either a vertical or horizontal position, which is helpful.<br /><br />Update 11/13/13: One of the things I appreciated about this cover is that it turned the device on when you opened it and off when you closed it. Unfortunately, that didn't last long. After several months of usage, that function quit working. That was very disappointing to me, as that was one of the features I really liked.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a fun game & I would have given a 5 * , but I do not like the pop-up that makes me purchase for $ 1.99 before I can unlock the sites I could go to to play.<br />if this was only way I could continue you should mark the price as 1.99 not free.
B00821OX98|5.0|Not JUST another alien invasion movie or series.  Good storyline, good photography, better than average TV Movie acting.  My measure is you forget you are watching actors, and with Falling Skies you do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once I got this to run ... which required a 2nd installation of the app ... it turned out to be fun and entertaining. I zipped through most of the levels pretty quickly, but found several to be more challenging. For a free app, the limited number of levels was acceptable. I'm looking forward to more of these creative puzzles from this developer soon.
B002M3GPOI|5.0|Can't beat the completeness of this set. It sounds amazing and will keep me busy at least until the 50th anniversary of the album.
B008220DGE|2.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie after all the hype. When the film was over, I was relived and glad. I almost stopped watching 1/2 in because of the overacting by Joaquin Phoenix. Not quite sure what he was going for, but couldn't connect or feel sorry for anyone. Just a bunch of people I didn't really like, making poor choices. No resolution at the end.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This is a great show. I don't know what else to say. Either you like it or you don't. Matt Smith is amazing. I refuse to pick a favorite Doctor however because all the actors bring something unique and spectacular to the role. I will say that I enjoyed the stories under Russell T. Davies better. Stephen Moffat's stories are more violent, less suspenseful, and he got rid of the great tradition of having lots of 2-parters. I miss those.
B005TUAKOM|5.0|The female vocals soar like nothing I've ever heard before.  I frequently get goosebumps.  This album makes me want to gallop into battle to fight an evil centaur.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|So, after the implosion of Queensryche in 2012, the subsequent dismissal of Geoff Tate, the court battle over the name, the dueling versions of the band and finally, with each band putting out a new CD under the band name, we, the buying public can finally announce our verdict. After seeing both versions live and listening to both bands CD's, it is apparent to this life long fan that THIS is the winner. THIS IS QUEENSRYCHE! The trademark dual guitar harmonies. The thunderous bass lines and drums containing more than a decades worth of fury and frustration. The \\"Thinking Man's Metal Band\\" has returned with an incredible offering that harkens back to the glorious days of a bygone era, but still has a modern feel. Scott Rockenfield, Michael Wilton, Eddie Jackson, Parker Lundgren and new vocalist Todd La Torre, have embraced their legacy with this CD and have shown their fans, that they intend to build upon it. If there is one draw back, it's the length of the CD, but that's just nitpicking. I would rather have a shorter CD with quality material, than a longer CD with a few filler songs. The final decision on who the one TRUE Queensryche is won't be decided until November, but as far as I'm concerned, THIS IS THEM. Period.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun I really like it its kinda adictive tho but fun!!! I really like the graphics.. I like this game.
B004LWZW6K|1.0|This was a cheesy, poorly filmed movie with very bad acting.  Gratuitious boob shots were nothing worth remembering.  This was a cheap ripoff movie.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This item was as described. Any product this seller has, I am confident the quality will be great. I recommend purchasing from this seller if you want good service and quality.
B000O14VAU|4.0|This movie set a new approach along with the Van Helsing of the supernatural themes of wolfman and vampires. Sexy and thrilling with Great special effects, cinematograohy and soundtrack.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I love the ability to build and create your own sounds. Quality recordings, no looping (I'm VERY sensitive to that, esp when I'm mediating) noticeable. Like the ability to use it to add visual stimulation to a dark room via my tablet.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|What fun. I found this by complete accident and glad I did. It's free and reminds me a lot of Excitebike on the original NES with an added twist. Good way to kill some time if you don't want to play some of the more popular logic games.  You can't go wrong here, after all it IS free. 5 stars easy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great app for a game. If you love horses, this game is for you... I found that this game is really relaxing if  your waiting for a plane or just plain board...
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|J Cole  got a  nice spit  game and  he  got  some heat with a pen and pad, problem is the  production doesn't take  him to the next.  however its  cool. his mixtapes are bit more on point. if he gets the right Producer and balance of  sounds he could  be the next  because his flow and  lyric  game is nice. i just hope  the production matches what he is  bringing, because he got game.
B004W4N55C|1.0|This was once the go to app for tabs, but since I tried installing it on my tablet I get nothing but force close.  If this app gets updates to work with new android then I'll be happy again, but I'm severely displeased for now.
B00B4804KS|1.0|The 3d disc did not work. I checked my equipment to make sure.  It was definitely the disc.  I think it was just something wrong with this one not all .  I will prolly just buy another copy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|First time playing this type of game and I became hooked. It helped to keep paper and pencil nearby...did I just give a hint away?
B005K17RU0|4.0|I gave this four stars for the simple reason that it has come closer to what occurred than our two most experienced tv weather predictors.  That alone deserves a four star rating!
B009AJDDQU|4.0|I don't always want my scifi to be thought provoking, but when I do I enjoy Ridley Scott's take on it.<br /><br />This quasi-prequel to Scott's scifi classic Alien is nearly as thrilling to watch at home as it was in the theater.<br /><br />The only downside is that it won't play over the Amazon Instant Video app on my iPhone 4S.  FAIL
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love using interesting words and knowing their real meaning as opposed to those meanings that folks think it means.  Fun to get the word of the day, and of course, nice to be able to look up the correct spelling when I am in doubt.  This app is VERY handy to have available.
B005K17RU0|3.0|why doesn't Amazon support the Android Apps like ABC NY Accuweather? It is frustrating to see these apps supported on Goggle and not on Amazon.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|If you enjoy the fantasy genre - these books are a must read.  I enjoy the author's use of different points of view of each of the characters.  The only thing I don't like is the series never ends.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Such a fun movie for the whole family!  We have watched it multiple times and enjoy it every single time!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I think the title says it all. Some of these levels are quite tricky which makes the game even more fun. If you like these types of games I would definitely check this one out, it's very well done. Check this out if you're looking for something free and fun!
B001D1SRRS|4.0|Short, insightful and as fun a non-fiction read as you're going to find.<br /><br />It should be required reading any current or aspiring manager.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey has never skipped out on the drama and suspense. This season has more than seasons 1&2 combined. You won't be disappointed!
B005HED11Y|5.0|Ingenious......taking the original script and making a master peace..... Seeing it in HD makes the experience better than watching it the first time.........So Resplendent....!!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I'm so glad I read the books first.  You can really feel for and understand each of the characters.  I must admit I was a little disappointed when I got to the end of the fourth book and found that the story wasn't ending.  The story reminds me of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan.  I gave up after book ten.  Not many people have that much time to invest in a story.  I hope Mr. Martin ends the story at some point.
0060989157|5.0|Bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He really liked it, but it is really &#34;rough&#34;.  Lots about sex, drugs, rough language.  Obviously, considering it is about Motley Crue this should not be a surprise to anyone.  Hubby thought it was a good book and enjoyed it.
0547258305|4.0|Some Graces are good, while others are easily exploited by the rulers of the kingdoms. Katsa has a killing Grace and her king loves it. He loves using her to instill fear into his people. Katsa tries to use her Grace for good on the side though, which is how she runs into Po. Po is Graced too. Katsa leaves him alive, though she could have killed him, and finishes her mission. What she doesn't expect is that she might need Po's help because they are on the same side.<br /><br />I don't know why I waited so long to read this book. It was a really fantastic read. The characters were enjoyable. The setting was lush and vast. All around it was just a really great read.<br /><br />I especially loved Katsa and Po. The interactions between the two of them were amazing. They played on each other so well. Po was a lot of fun. I like the ease with which he spoke and did everything, I'm sure part of it was his Grace. Katsa had a hard time getting out of the role she was forced to play for so long. She was in the mindset that she was who she was made to be instead of who she really was. She did lots of great things, but in her mind all the horrible things were piled higher. All the characters were fleshed out nicely and it made it easy to choose sides and favorites.<br /><br />I loved learning more about this world. Each of the kingdoms came to life and I would love to visit and explore the sights. It was a very full world and I can't wait to dive back into it with Fire and Bitterblue.<br /><br />I always think I don't like fantasy that much and then I read books like this and I remember how amazing it can be. Really I just appreciate any book that's well-written and has a great story. This book totally fits the bill and I will be checking out the rest of this series as wel as future books by Kristin Cashore. If you haven't gotten around to reading this yet. I highly recommend you check it out.<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"In these dungeons the darkness was complete, but Katsa had a map in her mind.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Lines:<br />\\"She glanced up at him, and in that moment he pulled his wet shirt over his head. She forced her mind blank. Blank as a new sheet of paper, blank as a starless sky.\\"ad a map in her mind.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Lines:<br />\\"She glanced up at him, and in that moment he pulled his wet shirt over his head.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great show, especially when you compare it to the mindless trash that is on TV these days.
B000TLMWMY|4.0|What a trip down memory lane. I vividly remember watching this program on my parent's 19&#34; inch black & white Zenith. What a thrill to see the performances in color and in stereo. Would like to have seen more interviews with the guest performers looking back upon their appearnces, but still a great treasure.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|After all the garbage that Queensryche put out over the last 10 years, one would never imagine they'd be capable of bouncing back the way they have. This record would sit comfortably between Rage for Order and Operation Mindcrime. The new singer does an incredible job as do the rest of the band. This really is the best music they've done since Empire. I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun. It keeps me busy when im bored. Other games similar to this as in (floors escape) is not better than this game here. I just want to say well done on whoever made this app!  :)
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Had heard about this movie and wasn't very excited for it.  Downloaded it before a long trip and watched it on my Kindle.  The show is absolutely fantastic.  I even understood most of the game references in the movie.  I hate Sara Silverman, but she was enjoyable in this movie.
B0067EKYS6|4.0|I adore Baz Luhrmann and this movie only grew my love for him more. It's funny, I expected this movie to be a lot more fantastical than it was. Usually there is lots of extra silliness in a Luhrmann film(close-ups, sound effects), but this one was toned down. It was more fitting for the novel I guess. A bit disappointing, but still okay.<br /><br />The reason the movie ranked higher than the book for me is two main reason. First, there was none of that Nick Carraway dithering on bits. Second, When I can see people talking I know who is talking and I don't have to re-read the same chapter ten times to figure out who's talking. Both of those things made me like this movie a lot more.<br /><br />This seems like an easy book to film adaptation to be able to follow the book. I mean, it only takes a couple of hours to read the book anyways. For the most part the film followed the book nicely. There were a few things that were done differently and some were okay while others I didn't like. When Nick shows up to Gatsby's first party there is a strange guy pulling Jordan away from him the whole time. It seemed to set up a connection between Nick and Jordan that didn't happen again in the film. It was a bit strange but okay.<br /><br />One thing that drove me a little crazy was the \\"Old Sport\\" thing. In the film it sounded like \\"Old Spore\\". Why? Why was DiCaprio pronouncing it like that. It's probably the way that it's supposed to be pronounced, but there is a \\"t\\" in there! I hate it...I don't care if it's correct I still hate it.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie though and if you are looking for a book to film adaptation that works, check this one out.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|This mini-series is ok, but it didn't entice me to watch further than the first episode. Perhaps it is just that it is based on one of my less perferred Jane Austen novels.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like this game because it so many fun and cool games and if you dont like one game you can play a nother.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Love the show Castle and the book follows the details of the plot on the show. Great summer time read!
B008IJT0CE|3.0|I chose this app hoping to find a relaxing sound to fall asleep and meditate to.  I like that you can mix and match the difference noises to create your own.  However, nothing really grabs my attention out of all the options to use.
B0089LOG02|4.0|My parents and grandparents were still suffering the affects of the great depression when I was born. My family lived on a small farm that required everyone to work from dawn to well into the night in order to survive. So I can totally relate to Vivian's plight in so may ways. I was never farmed out to abusive strangers, but my family took in and helped to feed families that were even more destitute than we were.<br />At any rate, when I began reading Orphan train, I couldn't put it down. I would say it fits somewhere in between really good and almost great.<br /><br />Ethel Halstead<br /><br />Author of Haunted Flutes<br />Horehound road<br />Sangre De Lobo<br />and soon to be published<br />Ghost Chaser.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Had fun figuring out the various puzzles within this game. Was disappointed with the ending. But it leaves you wanting more that's for sure.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|If I had to pick two words to describe this book I would say LIVE ACTION so LIVE ACTION from The Turtleman
B008HK3XYK|4.0|The case is very sturdy. Fit is exact.  Doesn't have any pockets but is very snug with no movement when case is closed.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Never played this before getting a kindle but it's easy to pick up the rules.  I find it a nice mindless way to relax although losing can be frustrating.  I especially like the hint feature.  Well worth the price.
B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVE THIS SITE... FUN... EASY AN I Saw A PINK OCEAN LOL ...I HAVE SEEN AMAZING STUFF HERE AN I THINK IT'S COOL THAT YOU GET FOLLOWERS... KINDA CREEPY BUT NEAT AT THE SAME TIME!!!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I Loved this movie as did my wife and kids .there where a couple parts they could've elaborated on a little more but other wise we all enjoyed the movie
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i am addicted to this show.  it is the best show in years. My favorite character is Glenn.  I hope he doesn't get bitten.
0765365278|5.0|To begin, this was written for me.  I loved so much about the way it was written, style, structure, and development.  The characters didn't take long to learn but were still able to surprise you. The world was fantastic and new, without stretching the boundaries of science.  If anything, this books was about the yin and yang, the duplicitous edge of life; sacrifice without knowledge of reward.  Each character, from different backgrounds, finding meaning in the struggle..<br /><br />I might be the only one but!  I really enjoyed the \\"break\\" from some story lines, even if I didn't want it to happen. When the reader was taken away to a flashback or new strand it was for a specific purpose, almost as if we were like High Prince Dalinar, living a vision, unknown to its meaning, but searching for clues.  Sometimes it turned out to be an item that would help you understand someone's motivations, or actions.  Sometimes it was to learn about this brand new world and how it worked.  Each part a piece to a larger puzzle.<br /><br />Perhaps the part I found most disappointing, most likely due to the extreme build up, is the flashback to Kaladin's brother in battle.  Other than that, I just really wanted more!  I wanted to learn about the Shinovar, about the Parshandi about the world, spren, stormlight, cremlings, everythign!  Give me an encyclopedia on this place!!<br /><br />The most likely reason for my enjoyment in this book is the sports fan in me.  You'd probably be able to figure it out after this, but I live in a city known for how bad its sports teams and figures can be.  Not only that, but I have some connections with sports teams in the area.  I'm not saying sports is everything, but, for whatever reason (maybe something in the water), we still hang on to some false hope that because we have this struggle, we should be approaching something that looks like success or victory.  There were times reading this book were I felt that rush that makes you clench your fist andsquint your eyes, your heart picks up a beat, your vision narrows, and you feel justice or.. something..<br /><br />To finish, I cant say this book is for everyone. For me it hit some personal cords, whether its the curious scientist, small child who believes in super powers, the detective, or the sports fan.  It could drag on to some, and I understand that.  But to me, this is almost as good as it gets.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This is a great story and even better knowing it is a true story.  Don't expect the highest quality acting but it's still nicely done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing it keeps you in suspense! This book deserves more than five stars!<br />I can't wait to read MockingJay!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Since Kill Bill, I've been buying everyting Tarantino's made.  And again, the long wait was worth it.  This movie does for westerns what Inglorious Basterds did for war pictures... smushes together bold, gritty, sometimes shocking action with snappy dialogue and in-your-face humor, and delivers it unabashedly and stylishly.  (Why aren't more films like this being made?).  The only thing I didn't like at ALL was the unrealisticly exagerated volumes of gloppy looking gore errupting from every gunshot wound or head cracking. Of course this was intentional, just as in Kill Bill, but to me such blatent butchery is only appropriate in slasher movies.  And they don't pretend to be anything else.  Keep it up Quentin, but in the future, try to keep the bloodlust within apocalyptic limits huh.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|The graphics for this game are great. Easy to play but it gets harder. Nice game. You should try it
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I do not understand this game why do we have to use real money I mean really wake up people I think amazon had the stupidest idea of making this game I mean really no wonder they made this free because its so stupid and cheap
B00B99KJR0|5.0|The game play is fun with several different obstacles to keep levels feeling fresh and challenging. The story line is cute and the graphics are beautiful. I really enjoy this and recommend to all who enjoy match games.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It held my attention enough to sit and play all levels in first sitting.<br />Mid level challenge. I look forward to added levels they promise.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun to pass time. Some levels are to simple others are challenging. Would recommend this anyone looking to kill time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very good graphics, and I like it. but if you are easily frustrated, it is not for you, as it can be difficult and a little challenging.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|TOO MANY POSTS OFF THE MARK. BANDS ONLY MAKE NOISE NO MUSIC.CAMERA'S OK SUBJECTS ODD STUFF THEY GET SUJECTS OFF LINE NO COMMON SENCE. LIKE OUR CURRENT MOVIES.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|The process of the US becoming a superpower was not a clean consensus decision to take up the mantle of leadership.  Rather, a vicious debate involving the entire country ensued for a number of years before Pearl Harbor occurred.  This amazing book shows that many of the same frustrations we have with contemporary domestic politics, whatever your political party, have always been part and parcel of the American Experience.  All the elements of the current culture wars are present in the early 1940s as the country debated whether the US should enter World War II.  Conservatives who are uncompromising in their beliefs, the well-to-do attempting to influence public discourse, intellectuals battling against politicians who had their own agendas; it's all here.  As obvious as this decision appears to us now, it wasn't back then.  And while we know how this issue was settled and how right those people were to push for US entry into World War II, most people initially didn't see it that way.  Once we entered the war, there was no going back.  This is a grand story about the people on both sides as they debated a decision which would ultimately lead to the start of the American Century.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is going to be  so much fun with my horse<br />I just love horse so much and my mom thanks this game  Will get me loving more animals cause I have some  problems  with animals
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Was unsuccessful in downloading the first time.  Tried again and was successful. I like it better than the one on my pc.
1451696191|5.0|Originally posted here: http://theloyalbook.blogspot.it/2013/06/noi-siamo-infinito-perks-of-being.html<br /><br />The perks of being a wallflower, or my worst review so far. Sometimes you just cannot convey how much a book gave you, how much you loved it. I admit that I'm not a teenager anymore (haven't been a teen for the last... few years) so I really can't relate to the protagonists of the book, dealing with the problems of such a problematic age.<br /><br />Hovewer... I couldn't help but love every single word, every single page, every single scene. The perks of being a wallflower (re-edited in Italy thanks to the movie) is not a simple book and does not have the 'happily ever after' ending that many novels have. It's not predictable, does not have a love story like the one you would expect or a love triangle. It's a complex novel, dealing with such a honest and straightforward way issues that many teenagers can relate to: love, friendship, sex, drugs, fear of the change, expectations. It does that not using a patronizing language or a simple one, but through Charlie's voice, which is incredibly powerful and believable, reflecting with absolute perfection Charlie's thoughts.<br /><br />Charlie's story is similar to that on many teenagers: he has two older friends, Sam and Patrick and for the first time, he has to face hangovers, parties, the first approaches to girls and his first sexual experiences. He's confused and feels like he doesn't belong and, through letters, he tells us his thoughts, his feelings, everything he does and would like to does, everything he does without really knowing why till a shocking final revelation that, although slightly hinted, leaves you speechless.<br /><br />I have nothing to add to the tons of words used to describe this little, precious book. The emotions pouring out of Charlie's words go straight to the heart and are so immediate and disarming that made me love this story, this book, this protagonist. All the characters are wonderful, made of lights and shadows, so real and well-depicted. There is no romanticism, but a take on reality that I find much easier to relate to. Even if I was a teenager a while ago, this book was so engaging and captivating that I would recommend it to everybody.<br /><br />My favourite quote:<br /><br />\\"We accept the love we think we deserve\\"<br /><br />\\"In that moment, I swear we were infinite\\"
B008K6HN8I|5.0|We were initially a little frustrated with our first kindle, but were able to download Adobe by following a youtube video.  ES is one of the necessary steps, and it helped immensely.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|VERY SOOTHING AND ENTERTAINING. HER VOICE IS LOVELY. I MOST ENJOY C D. LOVE OLD SONGS THAT BRING BACK MEMORIES.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game. just a few tough areas but if you think through them the levels are fairly simple. keep adding levels and I will stay playing
B007A4SDCG|4.0|Captivating and pointed read regarding the challenge of letting your personal muse out and fighting away self created resistance to doing your art, whatever your 'art' is.<br /><br />Some of the references to god started to a tad too far but if viewed as metaphor to a higher plain of consciousness it's  a valid point.<br /><br />I recommend it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My 8 year old son handed me this when he got stuck on a puzzle in level 1 after I helped him I downloaded it to my own kindle an hour later and I had all 10 levels completed. I love puzzle games and this one has promise if it will add more levels and build on its complexity otherwise it's too simple to entertain me for long. Good game for younger puzzlers!
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great game, play it over and over.  this is one of my favorites.  try it, I'm sure you will love it as much as I do.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a super FREE app!  We listen to lots of Blackhawks hockey games, and this app made it possible to listen to several of the playoff games. GO HAWKS!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|ROD STEWART AT HIS BEST. USED THIS C D AS GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTR. SHE IS A FAN, SHE LOVES C D.
