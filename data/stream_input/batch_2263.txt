B009XTF8JM|5.0|I am an avid horror movie fan and this is one of the few movies I have ever seen that has affected me.  I watched the short piece on the real Dibbuk box before watching the actual movie and it made it very creepy.  I almost didn't watch the movie after watching the short. BOO!

B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Downloaded this app to play my .m4v files.  Doesn't work, and throws my Android tablet into an endless loop that forces me to reboot it.
B000LPQ6DE|1.0|i generally read reviews along the spectrum, especially the rock-bottom reviews on a nearly perfectly-rated production.  in this case, i did not and regret it entirely.  the 1-stars have it here.  I do not need to repeat.  read them.  didn't even get as far as the romance because, in fact, i couldn't keep watching after the first hour.  normally the scenery, sets, and direction keep me interested in a production as lavish as this.  but in this case every mark was missed; every characterization failed, down to Adele and Mrs. Fairfax.  lead acting:  a complete disaster.  Ruth Wilson's solid acting self-contained and adorable with nothing to play with: no other character on the screen to match.  My god what were they thinking?  Not to mention she is mis-cast... a beautiful, saucy jane eyre? along with the sub-par Rochester, absolutely zero chemistry between the two, the main story line falling worse than flat: actually boring.  substance of Bronte's novel?  soul and spirit, unique connection between J and R:  all completely missing, forgotten, over-written.  Goodness, what a terrible disappointment.
0553386697|5.0|\\"The Whole-Brain Child\\" has put words and concepts to the ciaos that was formerly my outta control three foster sons (soon to be adopted sons) ages 9, 8, and 4 years old. Foster children that are institutionalized (probably 95% of them) have the same problems that birth children have - times a thousand. Not only do they not have the tools to cope with the baggage that was hung on them from the people that were suppose to love them the most, but any moral gumption that might have sprung up through normal childhood has been beaten and stripped from them through multiple placements, cold social workers, and a judicial system that currently favors the perpetrator; which in my opinion is child abuse in and of itself.<br /><br />A must for any problem child - a moral obligation for any fost/adopt child!!!
B004WGIXX4|4.0|This was a very cute movie. A bit predictable, but cute, funny, and just the kind of movie to watch when you want to end the night with a little smile. Another thanks to amazon prime.
B00AQ08W22|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this movie. It's one of the best Colin Farrell movies I've seen in a long time. It's loaded with action but if you're expecting it to be like the original Total Recall then you're in for a surprise, it's only loosely based on the original move and I do mean loosely. I enjoyed this one so much better. If you're looking for action and a great storyline then this movie is for all those Sci Fi people out there!! ENJOY
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Michael Connelly writes very intriguing police books.  I enjoy reading Harry Bosch, &#34;the overlook&#34; was not disappointing, provided me with several hours of enjoyment and relaxation.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|Love this product, had been using for a while and haven't seen any problem at all, I'm strongly recommending to buy it.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I got this to boost the volume of my smartphone when watching videos while riding a noisy exercise bike. At the maximum setting it increases the volume just enough to listen comfortably, but no extra available (my phone is a 2011-era Samsung Sidekick, and I'm using cheap airplane earbuds).<br /><br />You plug this amp into your device, and plug your headphones into the amp. There's a convenient clip to attach it to your clothing or other thin object. They include a short audio cable so you can keep the amp right next to the device, or a 3' long one so you can let's say put the device in your pocket and clip the amp to your collar or something.<br /><br />It's easy to charge, just by plugging it into a USB jack with the provided power cable. I charge it after every time I use it, so I have no idea how long the battery lasts, sorry.<br /><br />The buttons are small and a little hard to operate for that reason. Overall construction quality looks good; strong metal body.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|If 20/20 was a courtship, Justin Timberlake would be the perfect date. 20/20 is love, passion, rhythm and beats, and as close to perfect as you can get. That is, if you love the art of musicianship. Anyone checking for JT knows of his talent. He couldn't hide it even if he so desired. He bleeds sound like the musical giants that came before him. 20/20 is a &#34;back in the day&#34; fresh homage to how a whole album should sound. And it's sexy to boot. In fact, its sex appeal is only the tipping point. 20/20's grand architect, Timbaland, stays true to his innovative genius while simultaneously flexing his creative muscles to produce unique songs with a collective sound. Bad*ss, to say the least. This, combined with Justin's vocal perfection (and that ooh-la-la falsetto), is the 20/20 experience. And we see you, Justin. Clearly.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|\\"The 20/20 Experience\\" is not much of a departure for Justin Timberlake from his 2006 \\"Futuresex/LoveSounds\\" album - long, sprawling songs based on up-to-date r&b sounds dipped in old school flavor. It is not much of a fodder for radio, either, but who cares, really? Still, this album is almost on all fronts some steps up the 2006 predecessor.<br />Timbaland stamp is again unmistakeable (like on the groovy, fascinating \\"Tunnel Vision\\"), and Justin's trademark falsetto is in top form throughout. Don't expect a pounding party jam, though, this experience passes also for a background music. If you listen closely, though, you will find a lot to discover (and treasure) with repeated listens - including great musicianship (like the guitar solo on \\"Spaceship Coupe\\"), tribal vocal riff on \\"Let the Groove Get In\\", the melodious \\"Mirrors\\" or just excellent chillout stuff \\"Don't Hold The Wall\\" or \\"Strawberry Bubblegum.\\"<br />This is a pop album to beat in 2013.

B006TF6WAM|5.0|What a magical journey of hope, life, death and joy. This is a compelling read that takes you on a trip through voluntary simplicity. Harold Fry is a modern everyman that speaks to us all.<br />We learn of all the perceived inadequacies of Harold's adult life, of his failed relationships with his wife and his son, but also of the joys and awe of a time when Harold and Maureen were new.<br />We learn of innocence and passion and that it is never too late to reach back for what once, long ago, you took for granted.<br />I could not stop reading this book, and will be carrying Harold Fry in my heart for a long time.

B000031EGV|5.0|While this book was an all time favorite growing up, the movie did a surprisingly good job of staying true to the story, but still making it long enough to be a movie.  It was great to watch w/ my kids.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|The game is very good and if you like Match 3 games this one has a good story, good graphics and decent background music. The levels begin to get challenging at five due to time limits. The one big problem however is that this game installs only to device memory and it is 82 mb in size. It cannot be installed to USB/SD Memory, despite permissions to allow the app to write to SD storage. Unfortunately, 82 mb is a lot to take up in device memory for a game. I have another Playtrix game app - Call of Atlantis - that does store in USB/SD Storage. If the developers correct this app and update it so that it can be stored to the SD card, then I would add two stars to make this a five star game spp.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is actually a really good application if you have great wifi. All you need is patience! Give it some time, and you'll really love it! Get this app if you like viral videos! I love it and you will too!

0307744434|3.0|Overall, not a bad book though it did get me confused with the time switches.  In the beginning, I found myself flipping pages back to previous chapters trying to make sense of the dates.  Eventually I gave up.  The descriptions of the circus where interesting and magical but the plot was confusing and really, what was the point of the challenge? In the end I found myself rushing to finish the book just to find out how it all ended.

You want to meet these people and see how society has survived living underground.  As the series moves on you find out secrets that even the residents of the silos down't know and it draws you in even more.  I found myself caring about the characters and wanting to know how things turned out.  Love Hugh Howey as an author too, I recommend all of his books!

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|The plot boils down to basic story formula, a misunderstood protagonist seeking acceptance from his community, goes off on a hero's journey to transform into something he's not and alienates important characters in the process, then discovers this transformation doesn't bring the acceptance he seeks, and in the process of making amends to the characters he's alienated finds the acceptance he sought was really self-acceptance thus enabling redemption.<br /><br />This story has been played out in millions of stories before and will continue to be told in millions of ways into the future.  For example this basic plot premise, just within the Disney catalog is played out in Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and many more.  This plot plays out in live action films as well, such as Muriel's Wedding, and Jerry McGuire, and pretty much every coming out story ever told.  Even though the plot is as clich&eacute; as it gets, it's still how the story gets played out that makes or breaks the story.  In this case, Ralph is a video game character seeking acceptance from the other characters in his game.<br /><br />I am personally a big fan of movies that have moments where the characters seem to transcend the scene and come across as real life people, and there are a few of those moments here in this movie.  I feel Ralph's confessional at the Bad-Anon meeting of video game villains is a brutally honest monologue of someone just wanting to be understood and appreciated for his role in his game. Additionally a homemade medal moment with Penelope just before Ralph is at his most alienated point stands out, as well as when his fellow game companion, Fix-It Felix finally understands how Ralph has been feeling stand out as great moments.  And lastly, the moment some lines first heard at the Bad-Anon meeting make a repeat appearance (trying not to give away the details of that moment), I felt Ralph was as real as any person can get and for those moments I am a big fan of this movie.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray set has some really nice special features that round out the making of the movie.  I just wish there was an audio commentary track, but all in all, it's a great package and I heartily recommend the movie as a fun way to put a new spin on a very familiar type of story.Blu-Ray set has some really nice special features that round out the making of the movie.

B009KNPPS0|5.0|This is the 35th anniversary set w/the LP.<br />When you slide the contents out of the jacket you think&#34;Huh?Why won't it come all the way out?&#34;Not a mistake.They designed it to stay attached to the box.Then you start thumbing through the pages and how nice!These super deluxe discs are just shoved into cardboard pockets with no protection against scratches!Another &#34;page is an envelope open at the top with photos etc dumped in.Yet another similar &#34;page&#34;has a book.And the last one is actually the LP jacket.None of these parts can be separated.What stark raving mad idiots.So when you open it you have a 2 foot by one foot THING in your hands to juggle in order to remove or replace your chosen item.I did find that you can fold back the two cardboard flaps that keep the insert captive and then remove it.The contents are still one piece though.All the discs and the LP are immediately going into standard jewel boxes and jackets and this monstrous packaging abomination will sit on the shelf.<br /><br />The sound is great so far,I have more to listen to.Recommended.

I have an Asus Transformer tablet running android jelly bean. Of interest, though, may be the fact that I was able to download and run the app on my android phone running gingerbread. Perhaps it&lsquo;s not compatible with the newer android platforms. Does anyone have a solution? Fortunately I got this as a Free app of the day; so it did not cost me anything.<br /><br />Follow-up: The next day I tried again and had no problems getting this app installed. Not sure what the difference is but I suggest you do not give up; just wait a day or so and try again. In the meantime, it sat in my cloud.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The last few Michael Connelly novels got poor reviews from me. The Black Box bounces back up into four-star territory because Connelly seems to have re-established control over the character of the now-aging Bosch and has given him the kind of task that Bosch has always excelled at solving -- old cases with complexities in the past that resonate in the present. Other reviewers have laid out the central story elements, so I won't repeat them again. I will just report that I enjoyed the way in which Connelly let me tag along on this case looking over Bosch's shoulder as he made sense of this piece of the puzzle, then that one. Moments of annoyance at weak plotting or authorial sleight of hand were far rarer in this book than in the recent preceding novels.<br /><br />If you have been disappointed in the recent Haller and Bosch novels, I can understand why you might be leery of this one. But even if The Black Box is not up to the high points of Bosch entertainments from a decade ago, it is good enough that the suspicious probably won't be let down if they decide to try it. If you buy it on my say-so and don't like it, come back and ding me on this review.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Dang seven years?  What happened to my life...!<br /><br />Timberlake's new album is different for a pop album in that a majority of the songs contain quite varied passages and are over five minutes long.  The album is 70 minutes long and it contains ten tracks, and each song is its own rollercoaster, weaving different rhythms into a cohesive \\"experience.\\"  It almost feels like a double album because of the expansiveness of the content.  Of-course this type of length isn't new in other genres, like classical, or post-rock and edm type music, but in a vocal based pop album I haven't seen it.  Timberlake takes us on a ride, and it's awesome.<br /><br />I honestly can't think of anyone who I'd actually want to hear make a seven minute pop song, and when I first saw the track lengths I was a little befuddled.  Ofcourse all my apprehension disappeared upon listening to the album through.  As a fan of groups like \\"Rachel's,\\" \\"Phantogram,\\" and \\"Zeds Dead\\" type stuff I really appreciate the musicality that Timberlake brings here.  There's no one genre I feel like I can pin him in.  He goes everywhere using elements from classic soul (pusher love girl, that girl) to indie experimental (Blue Ocean Floor) to hitting on the classic Timberlake sound we're used to (Mirrors).  The thing is, each one of these different Timberlakes that we see is nothing short of brilliant.  I hate to admit it, but the dude is a current music genius.  Sure he's probably had good guidance, but here's a guy who's pretty much got it all, and yeah as a 29 year old dude maybe I'm a bit jealous.<br /><br />The only real criticism that I've seen is that Timberlake may not expand enough on the type of vibe he showed us before on \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\" but to be honest that was a pretty good sound and he does build upon it here.  The vibe is more complete and you can tell he put in the utmost effort into making this album all is could be.  Timberlake is one of the few artists that is unmistakable when you hear him.  You just know a Justin Timberlake song when you hear one, and to me that's the sign of a great artist.<br /><br />My favorite tracks:<br /><br />\\"Blue Ocean Floor,\\"  Beautiful closing track.  Shows the beauty of his voice well and this song is truly a sonic journey.  Deep bass, swaying synths and his voice is clear and true here.  Unexpected but an incredible track.<br /><br />\\"Mirrors,\\" Love the musicality of this track and yes I'm a sucker for this \\"vintage Timberlake\\" type vibe.  Great theme about examining oneself and how you live your life.  This is a pop-song on steroids and it's a great journey.<br /><br />\\"Pusher Love Girl,\\"  I love the classic R and B feel here and the horns add a great \\"aroma\\" to the track.  Can't believe some of the high notes he hits seemingly with ease.  Saw him perform this live on late night and anyone who questions his voice can put their apprehension to rest.  It's for real.<br /><br />Hard to believe it's been seven years, and it's even harder to believe that it seems like he hasn't missed a step since then.  If anything could possibly be as good as or better than \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds,\\" this is it.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Addendum:  Those looking for strictly the \\"old Timberlake\\" may be slightly disappointed.  There isn't much that is completely by the book here musically and that's why this album is such a brilliant journey.  But inevitably an artist must grow.  Personally I don't think this is a huge departure from the sound he's provided us before, it's just more layered.  If your on the fence about the album I think you'll find out pretty fast if it'll be worth it for you by sampling a couple of the tracks above, or on one of the many programs that allow you to play songs.ar him.

There isn't much that is completely by the book here musically and that's why this album is such a brilliant journey.  But inevitably an artist must grow.  Personally I don't think this is a huge departure from the sound he's provided us before, it's just more layered.  If your on the fence about the album I think you'll find out pretty fast if it'll be worth it for you by sampling a couple of the tracks above, or on one of the many programs that allow you to play songs.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I like all her books, a nice and easy read. I did lose interest a couple of times but got right back into it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love this show! I watched the first season on Netflix but of course had to find the remaining episodes of this season somewhere else. I love how easy it is to view Amazon videos on my smart tv.

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game was fairly fun. The hidden object scenes were challenging. The game is a little short but if you are bored its an ok buy
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This 7 disc, 129 track retrospective of Duane Allman's recorded legacy is nearly Bear Family quality, making it by far the best representation of Duane's career.  The biggest deficiency of the box set is the relatively small booklet, only 72 pages in length, 2/3 of which is devoted to track annotations.  That aside, the collection covers Allman's entire career, from his earliest recordings in 1965, at age 18, done with his brother Gregg under the moniker The Escorts.  These 3 tracks are among the 9 previously unreleased tunes included in the set.  The anthology moves to 1966 recordings, a total of 6 done with brother Gregg as The Allman Joys, variously released as 1 single side, 3 album cuts and 2 unreleased sides.  Then come 9 recordings as The Hour Glass again with brother Gregg as a band member.  A couple of songs the brothers released as the 31st of February follow.  The next disc and a half are comprised of session recordings Duane did in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, with artists such as Clarence Carter, Wilson Pickett, Arthur Conley and Aretha Franklin to name but a few.  Pickett's killer take on \\"Born To Be Wild\\" contains Duane's jet fueled guitar work, with same being true of Aretha's \\"The Weight.\\"  Disc 3 contains 3 tracks Duane cut under his own name and include his more than acceptable vocal efforts of \\"Happily Married Man\\" and \\"Goin' Down' Slow\\" a cover of St. Louis Jimmy Oden's blues classic.  The disc also has what may be Duane's most recognizable studio effort, his incredible guitar work on Boz Scagg's take on Fenton Robinson's blues chestnut \\"Loan Me A Dime,\\" a 13 minute magnum opus.  The remaining 4 discs include a virtual best of The Allman Brother Band, both live and in the studio, as well as studio sessions with Johnny Jenkins, Ronnie Hawkins and of all people Lulu.  None of these tracks are to be taken lightly.  Allman's versatility shines through as he recorded with Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett and their Friends, among others, before landing in Criterion Studios in Florida, and recording 11 tracks (4 of them found here) with Eric Clapton's Derek & The Dominos including their smash \\"Layla\\" followed by Duane and Eric doing their cover of the Little Walter blues classic \\"Mean Old World.\\"  Also included are session tracks done with blues legend John Hammond and jazz great Herbie Mann.  The box ends with studio and live tracks from the Allman Brothers LP \\"Eat A Peach\\" released just after Allman's tragic death at age 24.  So, what we have here are 7 cds, 129 tracks, well over 8 hours of incredible tunes spanning the all too brief 6 year recording career of perhaps the most highly rated slide guitar player of all time (the only player possibly more noted would be Ry Cooder), who proves with this release to have been a master of the guitar, both electric and acoustic as well as the dobro.  Allman's daughter, Galadrielle, is to be lauded for her time consuming effort in licensing all the tracks collected here and for her heartfelt essay which joins an overview of Duane's music by Scott Schinder in the booklet.  As previously mentioned, the one shortcoming I find in this set is the lack of a more in depth essay regarding Allman and his many musical journeys.  That aside, this is without doubt the best box set release of 2013, and indeed one of the best box set releases ever, both in conception and production.  Much time was obviously spent in obtaining the best possible sources for the numerous rarities contained in \\"Skydog\\" and Paul Blakemore's mastering job is impeccable.  With only 10,000 numbered sets available, many people will no doubt be left out in the cold on this release and already I see sets being offered at more than double the original asking price.  I pre-ordered my copy from The Allman Brothers site and paid $99.99 plus shipping and received my copy on 13 October, 6 days prior to the official release date.  My advice, seek out a copy of this set as soon as possible and hope that you are able to find a copy before the price gouging begins.  This is definitely one set you do not want to miss out on.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I started watching season one about a month ago (2/2013) after longing for a sic-fi x-file-ish type of show.  Wow what a great show!  After 5 years the special effects hold up nicely (unlike some other shows i.e Dr. Who season one-awful special effects but of course it's because the show is older).  Each episode, although capable of standing on it's own, always has further character and over all storyline development which makes it easy to enjoy individual episodes but leaves the audience curious to see what happens next.  I would give this show 5 stars but I haven't made it past Season 1.  So far I would give it 5 stars and highly recommend it, but there are 5-6 seasons available and I want to wait and see how the show develops before committing to a 5 star rating.  I will amend the review once I get closer to the final season.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show keeps you wanting more,The action Along with the plot ,Ilove it.This show is worth the money to own.
B0028KF4ME|5.0|A great season! Things get more and more interesting as time progresses and the characters evolve. I highly recommend it!
B005ZUR724|2.0|I hope no one else makes the same mistake I did. This game looked amazing and I was looking forward to playing it. I wish I could rate higher but a kindle version app should NOT be available on the Android Market. If I could be refunded in someway I would instantly rate the game five stars because I know it is an awesome game.
B0027I93U6|5.0|A great season! Things get more and more interesting as time progresses and the characters evolve. I highly recommend it!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|AMAZING GAME! I got lucky and got it free but this game is worth $2.99 and MORE! Great game everyone should play. The graphics and music are BEYOND beautiful. The game play is challenging yet oh so rewarding.
B002ELIXCA|5.0|A great start to a great show! Already on Season 4 and going strong. Certainly a must watch! Highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|To begin, I do not read books of this genre often. Possibly, most probably, because of their tendency to be extremely negative and downright depressing in nature.  Nor am I so easily impressed as to actually write reviews often, however, with that said, I am absolutely compelled to share with others my joyous feelings that this is one of the best-written, most finely and expertly crafted books in any genre that I have ever had the extreme pleasure of reading!  From the set-up to the very last words it excels any lofty expectations I had from reading the reviews of others. I hope those reading this who are debating the purchase will heed my plea for them to just begin reading it.  Afterward is a no brainer as I'm certain you will agree within a very few pages.  God!, I do so hope this is made into a movie by someone competent who is as appreciative as I am for its genius!  Keep up the great writing Hugh Howey!  We need more a.s.a.p.!
B002QNEJT2|5.0|A great season! Things get more and more interesting as time progresses and the characters evolve. I highly recommend it!
B00BG08FKK|2.0|I was looking forward to two FULL cds when this deluxe version was announced.  Most annoying to me is that the fabulous orchestral closing credits music is nowhere to be found.  Given that there is room for more than 30 minutes more of music on disc 2 alone, this seems more rushed than the initial highlights release.  Will we have to wait for another \\"definitive\\" edition before there is a true soundtrack?  Expected better (and more!)
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I think the movie itself was excellent. I've read (in paper) the LOTR trilogy and the Hobbit several times since 1968. I've also listened to the audiobooks multiple times, so I'm no stranger this great achievement. And, hey, I know the Hobbit departed from the book in many ways, but I really didn't care about that. I loved the LOTR movie trilogy, but think The Hobbit is every bit as good and in some ways better than the first three Jackson films. I just loved it.<br /><br />Now for the UltraViolet digital \\"download\\" controversy . The UltraViolet thing, I'd have to rate \\"no stars\\" if I could. Crap. A trick to get you to participate in flickster.com nonsense. A real digital download would have been much better. I wrote Flickster and told them to shove their Digital Collection bull____ and to do the same with my free movie. Anyway the whole thing is moot since the idea of watching a film like this on anything other than a large-screen TV is silly. Since I bought this disk set, I obviously have a BluRay disk, so why would I want to stream the movie to some small-screen device and have an inferior audio and video experience?  I don't get it. But some people like McDonald's hamburgers...
B008CYDDWI|4.0|The 1980's were certainly a game changing time when it came to horror films. There were a series of outrageous, imaginative horror flicks that combined humor, horror and art in some unique ways showing the influence of directors like David Cronenberg (who checked in with two classics during the 1980's [[ASIN:B000MNOXZ8 The Fly [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B0009298N4 Dead Ringers]]). Sam Raimi's films [[ASIN:B003IY48PS The Evil Dead [Blu-ray]]][[ASIN:B005J9ZE5I Evil Dead 2 (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]][[ASIN:B0025VLEMK Army of Darkness (Screwhead Edition) [Blu-ray]]], like Stuart Gordon's, mixed each of those elements in a new and appealing way.<br /><br />\\"Re-Animator\\" helped redefine the genre at a critical period when it had slumped into cliche. It's a pity that Gordon's film didn't get a definitive restoration. Shot on the cheap for under $1 million, \\"Re-Animator\\" nevertheless makes good use of its money with some terrific effects (for its time)and a great, campy performance by Jeffrey Combs.<br /><br />The presentation here might be from the 2002 transfer which already makes it a decade old. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing but the film has plenty of speckles and some print damage evident in the image and it could have used a bit of digital clean up for its Blu-ray debut. The image quality is somewhat soft--that's how the film possibly looks. However, that isn't to suggest that a new transfer using the latest tools couldn't have improved it--they could have.<br /><br /> Nevertheless, this IS an upgrade compared to the conventional DVD's--you'll see more flaws in the picture, yes, but you'll also see better fine detail in the presentation. It's unlikely though that this transfer will knock your socks off but it looks pretty good in spite of its flaws.<br /><br />The original audio was presented in mono and, at some point, this was remixed for a 5.1 presentation. I wouldn't call it a state-of-the-art presentation for 5.1 but it does give the soundtrack (particularly the music)a bit of extra kick and depth.<br /><br />The special features are largely ported over from the Anchor Bay edition of the film for DVD. We get a commentary by director Stuart Gordon along with a second commentary track by producer Brian Yuzna, actors Jeffrey Combs, Bruce Abbott, Barbara Crampton and Robert Sampson. Listening to the commentary track, you'll discover that Gordon was influenced by Roman Polanski in terms of his approach to his film. The latter commentary track is also a fun listen. Both of these are older commentary tracks with the first coming from at least the 1990's.<br /><br />The Anchor Bay documentary on the making of the film is included. We also get the interview with the director and producer from the previous set. Richard Band who composed the music also gets two featurettes to discuss his contribution which is clearly influenced by Bernard Herrmann's atomospheric scores.<br /><br />We also get a collection of alternate takes and the deleted dream sequence for the film that run about 25 minutes.<br /><br />Finally we get the original theatrical trailer, TV spots and a brief appreciation by Fangoria editor Tony Timpone.<br /><br />While this isn't the definitive edition of the film on Blu-ray, this is a pretty good presentation of the film. The film is definitely NOT an upscaled standard definition transfer as there is noticeably more detail that wouldn't have been evident in a SD DVD. Having said that, the high def transfer that was prepared for release here should have received a clearer and cleaner restoration and transfer.<br /><br />The extras are terrific and I'm happy that they carried over bulk of the most important extras from the previous editions of this film. Still, I would have liked to have botht he \\"R\\" rated and unrated editions for this edition.<br /><br />Nevertheless, most fans will be generally pleased with this Blu-ray. I'm hoping that the Blu-ray (which comes out next week as of this writing) for \\"From Beyond\\" from Shout! Factory gets it right the first time out of the gate.<br /><br />I'd still recommend this although you should temper your expectations for this Blu-ray. I've docked this a star for the lack of new extras, the fact that we don't get a better, restored transfer for the film.rom Beyond\\" from Shout!

B0001HAISG|4.0|my grand daughter loved this show. we saw it on TV and she had to have it so of course i bought it for her
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I already watched this movie many times. It is a great movie watching with children together. Still these original Star Wars are much better movies worth of collection than the new series. Price is good.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This is a book that really hit me hard...in a good way. Yes, it's fantasy, it has elves, dwarves and even gnomes, but there is more to it than that.<br /><br />This first book, you follow the beginning of the young drow, Drizzt Do'Urden. He is a special case. Growing up in the land of drow elves who are mortal enemies of everyone and everything it seems...even each other. Following his story, you see him grow from a boy into a weapon master, and at the same time, you see him question the faith of the drow. They serve a Spider Queen by the name of Lolth, who requires death, sacrifice, and murder.<br /><br />Drizzt though, begins to question what he has been trained and forced to believe, not agreeing with anything that the drow society has taught him about life.<br /><br />In the end, he finds what is truly important.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I really loved this book, it was a very realistic book and I<br />I could totally relate to it. Even though I don't really read classics all that often, this one touched me very deeply.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: THINGS I THINK<br /><br />I would have liked it if Mr. Baer were a little younger, although it did work out quite nicely. I shed a tear or two when Beth died, but Louisa May Alcott put it so nicely I couldn't help but feel better for Beth, since she is happy now. I think Amy and Laurie were perfectly suited to each other, and I am glad they ended up together. I was very sad when this book ended. :-( although it was a very good ending. :-)
B00B99KJR0|5.0|i love these playrix match-3 games. i played fishdom and call of atlantis over and over again until i finally got sick of them. so i was very excited to see this game as FAOTD. it is a huge download, but once you open it you understand why. the graphics are superb and the game is very responsive - i love that you don't have to wait for the jewels to fall all the way before making more moves. there is no wait. you can just keep playing and playing.<br /><br />i think what i like most about this game though is the music. it's really lovely and catchy too, and it doesn't get too repetetive. the music was one thing i did NOT love about call of atlantis. it was too repetetive and got old quick, so i had to play with the music off. not the case here! i love the music and find myself humming along. i hope the music for this game has won some awards, because it really should.<br /><br />this game does a good job of being easy and challenging at the same time. i'm not sure what difference it makes how many stars you get on each level, except that you can re-play levels if you want to try &amp; get all three stars. it still lets you proceed without them though. i think this game will have a lot of replay value because it's not easy to get three stars on a level.<br /><br />the only thing i don't like is the debris! it's ugly to look at. but at least it was explained!  &quot;this is debris.&quot; it showed up in call of atlantis with no explanation and i wondered why there seemed to be lumps of coal that did nothing.<br /><br />overall this is the best playrix game i have played so far and it was the FAOTD on my birthday so i was really happy! it would be worth paying for if you had to though. just make sure you have enough free space on your device before downloading.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I bought this mainly to shoot pictures of my son (a trombonist in the HS band) while they're playing for basketball games in the gym.  The gym is pretty much a bat cave, and using my SB-400 wasn't helping much.  The SB-700 is far more powerful, and it allows me to focus the beam, and get a lot more light just where I need it.  It allowed me to drop my ISO from 1600 to 400, and eliminate a lot of grain and noise.  The difference in image quality between the two flash units under those conditions is truly night and day.<br /><br />Mounted in the hot shoe, I'm only using a fraction of this unit's capability.  Eventually, I'll get a couple more speedlights and use the Nikon Creative Lighting System for portraits, but in the meantime I'll continue to experiment and learn how to best use this this off-camera with my D7000 in Commander mode.  It's a very powerful tool, and a good investment.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|On top with Easter and Wave. I heard a couple three tracks on local independent radio and was delighted by the writing and tweaked by some very sweet singing--and the Neil Young cover! Absolutely solid from start to finish--at the top of her game. Show this treasure some love--pay for a copy right now!
0765325950|5.0|This series as a whole was great.  To summarize my thoughts on this final book, it wraps everything up that you could want and leaves you wanting more at the same time.  I was happy and sad all at once.  If you are a Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and/or Game of Thrones fan, I highly recommend this series!
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Here is a tenor at top of his career. He infuses each selection with power, intensity, warmth and clarity. A true artist  in full command of his singing at every minute.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! The character and story development is smart and dynamic.  Always wondering 'what's going to happen next?' Atlanta and surrounding as setting is refreshing.  I am hooked!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very refreshing story of a young woman who has never belonged or been understood until she learns the language of flowers from the first mother she has ever really known.  Very good story line, alternating the past and present in Victoria's life as she deals with her own skewed view of the world and how she fits in.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A very provocative and thought provoking finale to the Hunger Games trilogy. At times it is a difficult read but worthwhile.
1444727338|5.0|MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS<br /><br />I am not normally a Stephen King fan. Indeed, believe it or not, as avid a reader as I am this is the first King book that I have ever read. So I cannot compare it in any form to any of his earlier works, and there are evidently references to some of those earlier works that I have therefore missed.<br /><br />It doesn't matter. This is simply one of the most engrossing novels I have ever read - and I have read more than I care to remember. For all its great length, I wish it had carried on for another several hundred pages. In part a time travel saga, a love story and a wonderfully evocative rendition of an America which has long gone, this book sweeps you along from the opening sentence to its touching finale.<br /><br />Okay, so there are a few minor quibbles. As some critics have noted, the minutae of the Oswald family's daily life could have been trimmed. King's almost endless criticism of smoking gets a bit boring (I freely admit that I am a smoker), and you have to wonder why, really, does Jake/George wait until the last minute (almost literally) to try and stop Oswald from assassinating the President.<br /><br />However, none of this is remotely enough to justify less than the maximum five star rating. Time travel stories always have to be taken with a large pinch of salt, and it is to King's credit that he does not even try and explain why walking out the back of a diner in 2011 would lead anyone to come out in the same spot in September 1958. That's what is needed to make the story work, so it just as. Similarly, who knows and who cares why only two minutes elapse in 2011 even of the time-traveller stays in the past for more than five years. Just accept that that is how the author wants it, and move on.<br /><br />I must say that I found the depiction of America in 2011 after Kennedy's live was saved to be a touch unlikely and a bit over-the-top, but you can always mentally substitute your own vision. We will never knowwhat the present would be like had JFK not died in 1963, and King's apocalyptic vision could be just as accurate as someone else's vision of a utopia in which everybody under the suns gets on just fine with one another. Now that is also not very likely, but that's the point. It's fiction, and nobody will ever know.<br /><br />All in all, this is a hard book to put down. The author's wonderfuly detailed picture of small town (and big city) American life in the late 50s and early 60s is so good as to carry the reader there. No false notes are struck as Jake/George works his way towards Texas and passes the time between 1958 and that fateful November day in 1963. On all counts this is a memorable book, and I recommend it enormously - even (especially?) to non-King addicts.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I first saw this movie late one night when I was flipping through the channels. We used to have a dog that looked just like Hachi so I put the remote down and watched.<br /><br />Hachi is a beautiful dog, I loved the way they told the story. It is very easy to get pulled into the story as you watch it unfold.<br /><br />I was boo-hooing by the end of the movie, more so when I found out it was a true story which made it even more sad and sweet. Poor Hachi! :*(<br /><br />I bought this before the holidays and gave it to my Granddaughter and we watched it together. A very good movie.
B000YKE87W|5.0|After hearing Kauffman singing German operatic roles so beautifully one might wonder what he'd do with Italian and French tenor roles.  Romantic Arias offers the chance to hear this commanding tenor perform arias from Carman, Tosca,Verdi, Massenet, Gounod and others. The aria from Carman alone is worth the price of the album!
B00BMVTTJ4|4.0|No long review, just a thoroughly enjoyably movie experience. Did not want it to end and probably would have watch ALL three in a row. Alas, we will have to wait for December 2013 to see what happens next.
1608870081|4.0|Nice book, delivered promptly.  It is simplistic, but detailed.  Any big Harry Potter fan will enjoy.  Buy this for your favorite muggle.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I love Emeli voice.  I find it interesting that she has her degree in Neroscience.  She is talented on the piano as well.<br />Great talent seems to always come out of England.  I would recommend this CD to anyone. Thank you very much.<br />Maureen
B00B31D5UW|5.0|I wondered how they could top the phenomenal release Phlegethon, and they put those doubts to rest. This is Prog done right.
B0013TPVGK|5.0|This book is a good read. I could not put it down. The author is almost as good a writer as he is a musician.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was not what I expected at all. I was pleasantly surprised. It is one of the hottest books I have ever read. I could read more of this. The sex was hot hot hot.
B008220DGE|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't make movies for wimps. From \\"Boogie Nights\\" to \\"There Will Be Blood\\" Anderson challenges the viewer to look at all sides of the characters and decide who (if anyone) is a \\"good guy\\". \\"The Master\\" takes that idea to a new extreme. Philip Seymour Hoffman turns in another great performance as Lancaster Dodd, a 1950s fictional version of \\"Scientology\\" founder L. Ron Hubbard. Hoffman brings a clinched intensity to the roll that is hard to look away from, he has convinced himself that he has found the key to life and spirituality and has made it his mission to convince everyone else of his discovery. Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell is the quintessential lost soul. A haunted WWII vet Quell is unable to reconcile his life and has become a powder keg ready to blow at any moment. The Master is not an \\"easy\\" film. It is not pretty (in an emotional sense) and it doesn't leave you with a warm \\"fuzzy\\" feeling after viewing. But if you are looking for a dynamic, challenging piece of cinema, you won't do much better.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is the best show ever. I highly reccomend it to anyone. Christopher Eccelton and Billi Piper make the best team
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|&#304; bought this for .99 for my son through amazon bc he saw me play it on my phone which i have google play on it. Well idk if its bc i downloaded it from amazon but it doesnt work on my sons nabi 2 tablet. When u go to play it there isnt a problem until u try turning left or right and for some reason it jumps instead of turns. So it was a waste of a dollar spent on amazon bc through google play i had no problems what so ever on it. Disappointed bc my son shouldnt have to play it on my phone when he as a tablet he should be able to play it on :(
B0041G683W|3.0|Nick Jonas ruins this otherwise good cast. Even if you'd never heard of Nick Jonas, it's easy to tell he doesn't belong.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|...as well as a wonderful way to build patience, and spatial awareness.  I am exceedingly pleased with the Perplexus Epic.
0446572764|4.0|Good book. Really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The author presents a solid mystery wrapped up in the enigma of Stalinist Russia -- where murder and crime doesn't officially exist. Although Stalin himself murdered millions.<br /><br />I thought the story tied together well although the book plodded a bit in the middle. The author sets up sequels which I will have to check out.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Enjoyable too short though would have liked to have more content for the money paid had to pay 4 99 for full version
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it! Great graphics, dynamic gameplay, everything! I do think that there prices for things are high, but it is not that bad!

B00A8ECU24|5.0|THIS IS A GOOD GAME!!!!!! ( PINKEY PIE STYLE)<br />Also I have to say that the game is good for people of all ages
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I would not recommend this story, it is a bit bland and not exciting. It does not describe anything nor have any adjectives in this story. Avoid.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I have one in my kitchen and one in a closet.  they would both be completely awesome if, on one of them, I didn't have a problem with the velcro.  the adhesive on the back of the velcro strip that went on my ceiling, stayed on my ceiling and the rest came crashing down, it's not broken, so I'm just going to get some adhesive velcro from somewhere.  Other than that, I love these things!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm so pleased that this was available as I missed the entire second season.  I look forward to seeing more
B000002H6Q|5.0|What can be said that's not all thumbs up on this one. Still rocks twenty years or so after it's release. But it and play it loud-LOUD!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I'm a Potter fan!  What else is there to say.  Had to my own copy to re-watch at my leisure.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Yet again the Oscars show they can't be taken seriously, choosing based on political motives rather than sheer quality. The movie isn't bad, it's entertaining and if you don't have anything better to do it's the best second option after taking a nap. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and it's ridiculous to officially endorse it with an award.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|this is a first hand account of one of the greatest military operations in american history, and a very well written one as well. Thank you to all our armed forces.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|It stutters on the kindle, and takes forever to load.  Game play is fun and distracting.  Great for a time killer.
1451695195|5.0|This book is in my view the true science of God and our relationship with Him. Notice that not any one religion was allowed into Heaven. What is the bottom line. God is Love and if you embrace his love, there is nothing you can do that will prevent you from becoming one with Him in Heaven. Not a great sale for those organized religions seeking 10% of your income, claiming that they are the only ones that will be allowed into Heaven. But in my view, very accurate.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever for animal or horse lovers .the horses actuality look like horses it is a fun game  I love
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book has been very difficult to put down! Right from the start, the mystery of who Thor really is and what powers he has, captured me and held me fast to reading more. His struggle and determination to make his dreams come true is inspiring. Yet because of his determination and actions, he's looked down upon by the other boys in the Legion. Through acts of bravery and by simply doing the right thing he ends up earning their trust and respect and even finds love along the way.<br /><br />I love how this story constantly keeps you guessing. A thousand questions went through my mind as I read through each chapter. And each time I thought something was going to happen, there was a twist and I found myself asking more questions. The characters have been developed wonderfully. I found it quite easy to identify with some of them. Each character has a distinct personality, and the author has done a wonderful job of creating them in such a way that I came to completely love some characters and to strongly dislike others.<br /><br />I got the kindle edition of this book and I did notice some editing issues throughout. It seems to be a common occurrence in the free books I've read, although this book's editing issues weren't as bad as other's have been. Once in a while I had to stop and re-read a sentence so that it made sense.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book and will definitely be reading the next one. I'm anxious to see where the next book goes as the story unfolds!
B008D19WBQ|1.0|If you want to pay a lot of cash and get less content than the DVD version of this set then you should buy this. But that would just be silly.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Game is a very fun one!  My little girls love it, They laugh and laugh when they miss the mouth!!!  LOL
B004P68T30|5.0|This was a wonderful product.  It was exactly as it was described. Quick Shipping.  I would order from them again.  My son loves it!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love the series and I can hardly wait for Season 4. Regular TV programing is so lacking in true entertainment and cable TV is just more regular TV on more channels. But, PBS Masterpiece Theatre is the rarity. PBS has the highest quality and most entertaining programs on the airwaves and best of all we can purchase their programs on DVDs to watch over and over again. Great quality and great performances. Love it, love it, love it!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this film.  It was wonderful. Once it began, I found that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  Rarely, do I feel this way about a film.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning.  I enjoyed the fact that it was all in song, and sung live as the film was made.  I didn't enjoy Russell Crowe's voice, but not enough for it to change the way I felt about the film.<br /><br />... And, the story is thought provoking on many levels.<br /><br />I thought the film was under recognized during awards season, and wished that it had hung out on the large screen longer... I wanted to see it again in a theater, and missed it.<br /><br />Lose yourself in this one.....<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|This album is mediocre, at best. The hype did not live up. Please listen to the full album before you buy it.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|Third CD from BCC surely didn't disappoint.  They keep getting better and better.  Can't wait to see them on tour.
B004I744AS|5.0|Love the homepage with fun trivia. Also it's easy to use. Great for translating English words to Spanish and other languages. So much information...so little time! Download this now and you will be instantly smarter! Don't know what I did without it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|that game should be plays by everyone in the WORLD!I just LOVE it!<br />every one,  download this game NOW. I don't think u can find a better game that this. ohhhh u cant too bad.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I chose this movie because amongst the cast were several of my favorite British actors. Dame Maggie Smith's acting abilities are the greatest of all actors. I really enjoyed every minute of this movie. I loved the time travel element of the movie and felt a part of the main character's many discoveries. This is a very entertaining movie and a movie I will watch over and over again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is very addicting.I recommend this app for anyone. Very user friendly. I spend a lot of my free time playing.
B005FMZWD8|1.0|Intermittently stopped, thinking it was a flat battery, I replaced the battery to no avail, still stops working. Have returned watch.
1609611543|5.0|My older daughters were all into this gluten free ....wheat free diet for good health and they rave about the information in this book as to what's been done in processing this modern day wheat ...it's a life changing book though I confess to not following the abundant knowledge in it. My doctor told me to get it so I didn't dare not too! Not your average run of the mill book in any spence of the word.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I got this app a few days ago and I have played it pretty much nonstop. To me it's kind of like a mix between Temple Run 2 and Mariokart. The controls are great. You can tap the screen to steer or tilt the device (you can adjust the sensitivity on the tilt). The graphics are awesome, though I have had occassional problems with the game not responding, but nothing serious.<br />You don't race against cars, but the clock. You attempt to make it to each checkpoint before the time runs out. If you do well you get to explore more of a huge island, and earn coins to get new cars, characters, power-ups, and other things. I currently earn about 200 coins per game, but I get anything from 100 to 500 at times. The prices range from 200 to over 10000 coins, that I have seen so far. The games go quickly; I have completed more than a hundred over the past few days, and earned a total of 10000 coins. You can also purchase more coins with actual money.<br />All in all, this game is fantastic. Considering it's free, I love that I haven't seen a single ad yet! It's right up there with my other favorite time wasters, Temple Run 2 and Angry Birds. It's a must have!
B000001FKY|5.0|Brings back great memories. This was one of their best albums, if not the great album they made. Glade to see they are still popular.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I enjoyed the book, the review of the history of the time, the people and how it progressed. Very good
B00A6C3JN2|4.0|If you are buying this, odds are you are a tinkerer who wants something a bit more powerful than an Arduino Uno. It has an exhaustive list of useful features such as 4 UARTs, 512K flash, etc. One feature that caught my eye were the 2 digital to analog converter (DAC) pins. To test them, I used them to dim an led which is nice, but pwm can do that too. My main interest was in sound synthesis so I hooked up an 8 Ohm speaker between DAC0 and ground and wrote a sketch to generate a saw wave. It worked for about 5 seconds and then stopped forever.<br />I then did research after the fact and found that the DAC pins can only source 3mA. After doing some Ohm's Law, (V=I*R)=(R=V/I)=(R=3.3/0.003), in order to safely hook stuff up to the DAC/any low current pin, you need at least 1100 Ohms of resistance between the pin and ground. I was conscious of the fact that it uses 3.3V logic, but forgot to consider current draw. The Arduino Uno seems a bit more \\"rugged\\". I have hooked up the 8Ohm speaker directly to it without any troubles which is why I thought I could do the same here. Luckily, the seller has been very kind and understanding and is replacing it for me despite my oversight.<br />Overall, it is a great product, it just requires a bit more caution to use over previous arduinos.
1401322786|3.0|On the whole, a well-written story about the nature of time. True, the people are stereotypes, and the message is on the preachy side, but it is mostly rescued by its engaging language and imaginative presentation. Only one thing kept breaking my concentration and distracting me with momentary annoyance: the persistent use of \\"man\\" and \\"mankind\\" instead of \\"people\\" and \\"humanity.\\" It may seem like a small point, but in today's world when most writers attempt to be inclusive, the use of exclusively male language was jarring. To me it felt vaguely insulting in a way that would not be true of older books written when such language was the norm.
B009EE1GC4|5.0|This, combined with a captivating story, and great acting by the guy from 'slumdog millionaire' make this a wonderfully engaging movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very enjoyable read.  It was similar to a Kelly Martin movie I have recently watched and just as funny.  For all those who love light romance.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Boring! Not one of Johnny Depps best works. Based on a old soap opera. Must be why my mother liked it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This very detailed look at the life of Abraham Lincoln is rich in historical detail, lavishly researched and very well written.  The personal glimpses into the the life of Lincoln afford the reader a new look at this iconic figure of American history.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|A classic movie, really shines on blu-ray, this edition is a much better value for money then the &#34;skimmer edition&#34;
B008YI91HS|5.0|Jurassic park is a classic. My family really enjoyed it, and it got my kids really interested in dinosaurs. Great movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a good game to play if you are bored. Just get on whatever you play minecraft on.and just start playing.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good description of job appeared to reflect the energy and love for his job and his commandment to his country I liked his wife's contributions
B000HKW7E0|5.0|No cable, no problem. Rented this movie on Amazon.com and streamed it to my t.v. Couldn't find it to rent in the local stores and didn't have cable so I rented it online and watched it without ever leaving the comfort of my home.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Loved it, and bought it....  Acting and plot was great!!  Action packed, and loved how it went back to the very beginning on how they all got together!
B000002KOQ|5.0|What a great album that has stood the test of time; in fact, is one of the best ones she has ever released.
0307596885|5.0|All stories met my expectations of Alice Munro's.work.  The stories were realistic, but had an unexpected turn of events, that made the stories more realistic than you might originally have expected.  However. the unexpected event turned out to put the story into a very believable, and good ending.  Loved them all. Janet Anderson
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game as most of the others I have tried is fun till your extras run out. To get more extras they want your money...why cant they give us a free 15 second add instead of our cash.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Forget what you have heard! Anne Hathaway really does rock in this movie.<br /><br />I'm not really a fan of movie musicals, but this movie stuck with me. Hathaway plays a great Fantine and she does the role justice. My only complaint was R. Crowe. He just doesn't fit in with the rest of the casts enthusiam. Other than that, it's not a bad movie and it's pretty entertaining too.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|I love this movie! It has always been a favorite. it's great for the whole family. You should definitely watch it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I've read 5 of the Reacher novels and was dying to read the first one, the introduction to Jack Reacher.  It didn't disappoint.  I love the premise of the story, getting off a greyhound bus to find out about the murder of Blind Blake, only to get arrested for murder.  The story immediately grabs you.  The first book is just the beginning of getting to know JR; with each book Lee Child gives you a little bit more and a bit more about who he is and it makes you want to keep reading more of the novels.
B000002KOJ|5.0|I highly recommend this album and Ladies of the Canyon. The music, lyrics and singing are superb.I know noone who isn't satisfied with this recording.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|The game has a really interesting premise (especially if you're into end-of-the-world scenarios such as zombies, thrillers, etc.) After the first one or two tries, the difficulty really ramps up until you realize the trick required. Once you know that, every disease and infection type becomes easy to win, and the game loses its re-playability.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It makes you just want to keep playin it!!  It needs a timed version like the regular jewels had on it.
0345803485|5.0|the book arrived quick and it was amazing  i finishedit n less than 48 hours. i loved it. great book
B008OOYALE|5.0|Anyone else's app stop working after several months of working fine? Says its wifi conection issue but other apps and Internet still work...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun game! My sister loves it too :) There is a variety of horses you can choose from, though you have to work to get them!
0743270754|5.0|I really feel like I know Lincoln.  I learned a lot about what it was like to live in those times and that people never change.  We are the same from generation to generation; the surroundings are the only thing that ever change. [oooh..., deep!]
B00A6D5GBE|2.0|I downloaded this app and was never able to get it to work.  Frustrating and a waste.  I was hoping for more.
044655667X|5.0|It was/is a good book, because it holds my<br />interest and I'm with the Defense Lawyer<br />as he moves in the book.<br />Michael Connelly's use of time works<br />the present tense in that it physically<br />transports me and the lawyer  through<br />the story. The tense acts as a escalator<br />that stops at times and then continues<br />on throught the story.<br />Bravo! in the way Connelly uses time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Keeps me entertained. It doesn't take that much build up. I just wish there was more to or a breeding stable
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Doom seems to be a bound you cannot escape from.<br />Or Is just that what we are is what we are no matter how hard we try to change ourselves?<br />Why cannot a man rest peacefully, after a life of mistakes?<br />Btw is not like that for everyone. Someone manage to escape from its past and give it a new and promising beginning.<br />Besides, people even thought behaving against every moral, seems to be aware that an ethic exists; probably this is the hopeful face of Abercrombie's humanity. All of them ( quite ) seem to share some value. Some manage to live according to these; others, the doomed ones, regretfully, don't.<br />Great book great idea this &#34;western&#34; like background into a fantasy background... Even though the fantasy side seems to fade, inexorably and a new era, tragically similar to our, taking shape.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|The movie started with excitement, but boring toward the middle-end. Getting silly and unreasonsble toward the end of the movie.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I cannot wait to get Season 3... these are great books and the series are really good. Awesome job HBO
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This ranks high among the best adventure fiction I've read and it's non-fiction! Luttrel's writing made me feel that I was not just reading about something, but that I was actually there with the author. His account about the Seals makes me thankful that we have men like this willing to do what they do.
0061353248|4.0|I can't remember how I came across this book but recommend reading it. Though many reviewers pointed out specificity of experiments (proved only by the college students), I agree with the author in general. Of course, there are cultural differences between western and eastern hemisphere, espeically emphasis on individual or society. Still, many topics in this book cover what is human rather than age, race, or religion. I have to admit that some of materials are already well known or familiar to us but proof by scientific experiment itself is a different story. Many surprising aspects of human beings entertained me a lot and gave lessons especially procrastination.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|very good. I have a loyal dog like Hachi. I am very lucky. my dog waits for me all day when I work
B007REV4YI|5.0|Its a great movie at a fare price, it is definitely one of the greatest Bond films and it is a great addition to me collection.
0385344333|5.0|I love the author and his books. I visit their WEB sight often and enjoy the insights and schedule of the author.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|enjoy playing. helps pass the time while sitting. just hard enough to keep me amused. challenging enough to play over.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|fun sequal with good graphics, but after awhile it stopped working. I've rebooted, reinstalled with no luck. frustrating to start playing a game and have it stop working....
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very familiar style, but with some new twists on the &quot;Atlantis &quot; theme.<br />Well designed and good graphics,  a nice faotd!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I got the 3D Bluray version. I was a bit surprised that the entire movie fits in one Bluray disc, yet the 3D discs are part 1 and 2. Although if you think about it its a movie shot in 3D at 48 frames per second that goes on towards almost 3 hours. So after realizing this I am not surprised. The 3D version comes in the typical larger Bluray holder with 2 3D discs, 1 Bluray with standard form, Another Bluray for the \\"Special Features\\", DVD of what I guess is the movie as well, and a redemption code for the Ultraviolet Digital Copy and the Sneak Peak event. All in all, a really good deal, and certainly the typical 3D Blu ray package. The Movie is amazing, I was simply blown away in the movie theater when I went with my Best Friend and have waited to see it again in 3D in Bluray format. Again just to remind people you need a 3D bluray player or PS3, 3D TV, and 3D glasses that go with the TV, this is not a 3D with glasses included type stuff that used to happen awhile ago. (Although I'm guessing everyone already knows that. Just thought I'd mention it.) I'd say everyone should get this, its a can't miss movie and in my opinion better than all 3 of the Lord of the Rings movies. 5/5<br /><br />As far as extended edition goes, there is not much info out there but I hear around Christmas there will be a release of it that includes 20 to 30 minutes more of content. While that is probably a given, 3D is mostly not a given. I almost doubt they would re-release it in 3D, mostly because Avatar extended 3D didn't happen, as well as others. If WB wants more money they may milk it that way by having this only 3D and the other not, so you pay double for the experience.  Also given that 3D isn't still in every home TV so its a select audience that will be paying for it, and might not be worth the cost of making more 2 disc 3D Blu Rays (maybe 3?) Again this is my speculation that this might be the only 3D release of this movie, until maybe a box set. Also, I personally don't need the extended edition, this has enough movie for me. My extended editions of The Lord of the Rings tend to be watched on rare occasions since they are SOO long. This movie in its Theatrical format is pretty long and I don't need to have 20 minutes to 30 minutes more. I'm content with this film and expect the other two to just be as amazing. Anyways, I hope you enjoy The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.xtended edition, this has enough movie for me.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love this. Easy to get into facebook. Would recommend this to everyone. It is one of the best on here.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch is still breathing, but his handler is taking weekends off. Flynn still gets to the action much more quickly than Baldacci and most of his peers, but some new twists and fresh energies are badly needed.
B00BJA2VFW|1.0|After three attempts to download this app and one hour later I am out $1.99 and got nothing.  One star is over rating this non-existent app! Where's my refund?
B0001I561E|5.0|We love this movie and are thrilled to add it to our Disney collection.  The prongs that hold the DVD in place were broken and it took a little longer than we had hoped to receive it, but we are happy.  Thanks
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|He is great in all the movies.  I would recommend this to all and make sure you have popcorn lots
B000UR9QIK|5.0|I bought this for my son. I am not sure if he has watched it yet, but the case was in good shape.Was delivered promptly as well.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this. It keeps my mind off of other things. Would recommend this for sure. Very interesting game.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|5+++++++*********....<br /><br />Ooooohhhhhh Myyyyyyyy Gosh!<br />I cannot believe how amazing this story was. The suspense is so intense, I had to stay up late to keep reading! And the suspense NEVER lets up, NEVER!<br /><br />Having said that, this book screws with your head so much that I am still not sure which life of Teddy's/Andrew's was real. I am not sure about anything I have just read!!! Other than I have not read a suspense novel that was so utterly captivating in quite a while!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|In this book, I liked how Thor struggles to control his powers( obviously magic). The ways they are trained really caught my attention. It was interesting to hear them struggle to survive a single night on the other side of the canyon. It's hilarious when Thor struggles to keep his feelings about Gwen in check. When hatred between Thor and Elden turns into friendship I almost laughed out loud. But it makes sense because Thor saved his Elden's life. Thor is lucky to be the squire of the best knight in the kingdom, Erec. O'Connor is funny and kind. Reece is fierce and brave. Gwen is quick-thinking and witty. The instructors are total jerks, especially Kolk. Thor is brave, smart, loyal, quick-thinking,funny and magical. This book is full of magic and heroes. This book is totally incredible.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Definitely still enjoying this show.  Really dislike the Govenor character, hope we see the end of him shortly.  Can't wait to see what happens next
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Clear picture and has enough extras that helped explain the movie to her mother and I.  Love the fact that now we can access this movie anywhere (ultra-violet).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|sub serf is an awesome game for any one its like temple run but even better. You should download it right now. You will be glad you did.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Have used it in several places and it works. I have always been able to find a good connection using this app.
1439102813|5.0|I was able to read this book in two days.  It flows nicely and the story is wonderful.  I would recommend it to anyone.
1451627297|4.0|It's long, but well worth it. Anyone who enjoyed the TV series LOST will enjoy this; and even if you weren't a LOSTIE, it's a fun read.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Absolutely adorable movie! Watched it more than once in a weekend's time.  The kids really enjoyed it and we parents did too!
B000008GHW|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out and it's special to this day. For me, it's the last Hendrix studio album, it's a gem and it's a bonafide 'bookend'.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Loved this book. Took me about three weeks to to finish it and as I read, it felt like I was each character in the story. This is the kind of series that sucks you in and makes you obsess about the story until the very last page.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really entertaining when your bored. And its free so you cant lose. cant believe that there is so many games in one app for free
B001UV4XHY|5.0|My boys and I were waiting to see the first of the last book of the Harry Potter saga and we finally did!!! Purchasing the second part soon!! No complains on this one.
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|I don't buy a lot of movies since I have Netflix but there are a few favorites that I must own to view when ever I please and this is one of them.  Such an epic movie and every time I was it I'm brought back to when I was 17 watching it in theaters and just as I was then, a sad that we lost such a great talent too soon.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Psycho-thriller deluxe!<br />&#34;nothing is as it appears&#34;<br />I watched this years back. I re-watched it Mar 1, 2013. Still caught me off-guard. Well done suspense.
B00382S9N2|1.0|This is the third one I've purchased. Two were replacements.  The digital copy you get is<br />out of date and Lionsgate won't do anything for you.  The Blue ray is sort of an enhanced<br />standard definition copy and is not really HD.  After a few playings the disc refuses to play.<br /><br />No there are not any scratches etc on the disc, nice and clean.  This is the third that just stops working.<br />I have 3 blue ray players and the same in all of them.  It is not my player(s).<br /><br />Although I love the movie this particular version just plain sucks.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Seems Like An Instant Replay Of Aliens.<br /><br />Not A Whole Lot Of Difference. Kind Of Boring A Movie.<br /><br />Better Luck Next Time.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was really good. I am glad that Jaycee found the strength to tell her story. I'm sure it was hard to relive those horrible things that monster did. I hope this story has helped make her a stronger woman! It really is a well written book!
B00886XQO0|5.0|I am an avid gamer and have owned almost every wireless headphone set Turtle Beach has come out with. These are by far the best they have come out with. The most comfortable, with ease of use. Only thin con about them is the fact you can't charge from the base. I would have thought they would have made a base with a plugin for charging,
B001RUXW48|2.0|I happened apon this movie while scanning through amazon instant videos.  I originally thought I must have missed a good movie that came out and never even heard of it-I have a 2 year old so this happens sometimes. I mean Russell Crowe and Leo Dicraprio usually make good flicks.  I could not have been more wrong, I had a hard time paying attention and the whole movie just kept thinking-wow this is boring.  I'm a movie buff and will watch a crappy movie all the way to the end hoping it'll redeem itself before the credits roll.  I kept having to stop and start this one and my rental period ran out before I could catch the last 10 minutes and I honestly don't even care.  I'll never get that time back.....
B000025ZX6|5.0|Loved this group back in the 70's and still enjoy their sound.This was great album with at least 10 first rate songs.package was deliverd quickly and well protected
B005LAII80|4.0|This is good one for the fans , as I said in my other reviews , I do not want give to much away . The 3D disc is good with no shift and dropouts , Home 3D is still in development , and it is getting better , as package shows ,,<br />I gave it a Wow for the 3D disks ,<br />  Thank You

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Our family (including the 3 year old) really enjoyed this movie. A new twist on all the familiar holiday characters keeps this movie fresh, and the humor is spot on. We rented it this time, but will be purchasing soon!
B007ATNHLI|5.0|Great movie, great price.  A great movie to watch with my kids, since they had not seen it before now.  They actually saw MIB3 first, them MIB2 then finally the first movie... made for a great movie night.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the kids love playing this game they r better then me  I recommend it to any one is n easy game for the kids n adults
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|There is no wonder this series is the most watched story on Basic Cable.The characters all elicit a strong emotional response-whether good or bad.I'm hoping it continues for years to come-Der Vorleser
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|I love these actors! I've seen other renditions of Mansfield park and these actors are my favorite. very convincing portrayal of the austin characters.
0425252868|5.0|If there is not a movie in this story, I don't know what book should be made into a movie.  Over the years I have seen stories of when John McCain goes back to Vietnam, Harold Moore goes back to Vietnam and Pearl Harbor and Iwo Jima survivors meet with Japanese soliders all the reunions are touching.  Now to the book, five stars does not do this book justice.  Women flew planes during WWII, fly the planes from factory to airfields, that alone is a story. There are religious overtones to the book but I thought it enhanced Franz's character as to what type of person he was.  He was sort of the Dick Winters (Band of Brothers fame) of the German Air Force. War can make one barbaric lose your sense of humanity.  There are so many things I want to say but do not want offend anyone.  So I say this I waited to read the last 15% of the book alone because I knew I would cry, which I did.  I am actually thinking of re-reading this book again, the only book I have re-read is Band of Brothers, this will be another. Even if you are not a WWII buff, this is a great book, you will NOT be disappointed.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Follows on in the same manner where it left off. Wonderful escapism. A must read for those into genre of this subject
B00190N4E4|4.0|How do I download this to my ipad? I cant wait to find out! Please let me know asap. Thank you!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a great movie...we've watched it too much.<br />I got it for my fiance' since he is a HUGE James Bond fan and Daniel Craig has replaced Roger Moore as his favorite Bond!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; met my expectations.  It is very good quality and I have no problem using the charger with it.  I like the elastic closure.  It is secure and looks great!
0525478817|5.0|It was a rough journey. But I was happy to make it with these two exceptional people. I cried till I bled but it was well worth it... Will I read it again? Maybe if I can ever get my heart back into my chest just to have it ripped out again. haha <3
B000IZXR7U|5.0|What can really be said about Mad Max that hasn't already been said?  Awesome movie and honestly the groundbreaker for Gibson.  Was just super glad to find this on Amazon using my Roku player, and in the original Australian accents.<br />Well worth the rental.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|My son talked me into buying this movie for him.  I originally thought it was a remake to the John Carpenter classic but was quite surprised to see that this preceded the original and the ending picks up with the John Carpenter classic.  It was woven so perfectly.  I actually watched John Carpenter's right after and was amazed at how true to form this was along with John Carpenters' and it tied up loose ends.  If you liked John Carpenter's The Thing, you should definitely rent or buy this movie.  I wish my father was alive to see this because The Thing was one of his favorite movies and he would have been able to actually see the origin of The Thing....get this movie!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|never a bored moment. Was hard to put down...so addicting. Cant wait to play some more of these G5 games!
B00A50PDDY|5.0|If you doubt that you might not like them or more than just the few songs you've heard look up the rest of the songs quick. I love how each song is different and he raps! The first day I heard them I already declared them one of my favorite bands and it hasn't changed.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This would never happen in real life...but it's believable if you let your imagination run with the \\"stays in Vegas\\" frame of mind. For some, \\"if only,\\" for others, \\"been there, done that\\" and for even more, \\"imagine that!\\"
B00008EY7H|5.0|I saw this live years ago and was intrigued and loved it and wanted to see it again. the video was just like the live performance.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This epic video game for kindle fire is the best game I've ever gotten. Minecraft pocket edition is completely worth it.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|One star for concept/cuteness/fun.<br />Zero stars for immense problems.<br /><br />I will only add my problems to the discussion rather than rehash others so here is my experience below. I strongly encourage reading other reviews.<br /><br />I played this app to almost level 15 and was quite satisfied with graphics, animals and how my reserve was shaping up until the game simply quit on me and would not load. It would spin uselessly and give me the error message \\"wonder zoo has stopped\\" but actually it simply wouldn't load no matter what I did. I restarted my Kindle Fire HD and my wireless multiple times but to no avail; it was dead in the cyber ocean. So I came here (not being able to link to Gameloft to look for solutions) and saw the ominous reviews about crashing the Kindle completely and wiping out everything without exception to the point of factory reset and decided to cut my losses and removed it from my device promptly. It also would never let me connect to any friends or invite anyone to play (a good thing I now realize). So I am thankful to have learned what I did before I lost a tremendous amount of progress on my other games and books.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a really amazing book. Filled with romance, this book is defiantly recomendable to all people at least over the age of 12. Some parts of the book might be confusing at first, but in time, all of the little tid bits of the story come together. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.
B009HSPODE|4.0|The wonderfully concise writing, with not a word wasted is truly inspiring. The stories are peopled with characters who are all needy in some way, but a true reflection of one side of life.  For me, it would have been nice to have some lightness in the stories, instead of the constant grey (but not black)
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Amazing it sucked me in everyday I read the book I couldn't put it down. Thought it was greater than any other book I've ever read

B002VECM6S|5.0|This show is so good.  It captivates you from the start.  It makes you wish  there were more people out there doing the things that this family did for this wonderful person.  Everyone deserves a break.  He got one and showed this family love and taught them just as they did him.  It is a wonderful, true, and great movie.  I highly recommend it.
B00867GHS8|5.0|You would not be able to tell that this movie was not originally made in 3D because it looks so good!  They did an awesome job re-mastering it.  There are so many epic scenes where it looks like the fish are floating outside of your screen and the adventure scenes all look really good!  If you enjoy Nemo and you enjoy 3D movies, I'm sure that you will love it!
B00A3XWAU2|5.0|WHY It grabbed me and shook me! Track 3 got in my head and just would not leave me alone but, that's ALRIGHT ! I like it! Fantastic ! I like this better than anything \\"Company of Snakes\\" \\"The Snakes\\" OR \\"Whitesnake\\" has put out for quite some time. Marsden is not on this one but Mick and Neil went and got Laurie Wisefield from Wishbone Ash so it's cool. Top notch engineering, production and mix as well as stellar performances by ALL musicians involved make this a great choice. If you like blues based hard rock like \\"Bad Company\\" \\"Badlands\\" and \\" Whitesnake\\" OLD WHITESNAKE ! THEN COB ON TO ONE HOMIE  OR you could sit around and listen to some more Boston and Fleetwood Mac on the radio... BUT DON'T LET OLGA CATCH YOU
B0091REZMW|4.0|pretty fun game.  no need to spend money.  just quit for a little while for energy to build back up.  there are lots of other games to play.
1416914285|5.0|City of bones is the start to an amazing series! you will not regret buying these. Definitely worth putting on your book shelf.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|Ordered for my 3 year old grandson.  I asked him if he knew who Horton was...looked at the Blue-ray and said &#34;Yes, I read the book but I haven't seen the movie.&#34;  Now he's seen the movie and loved it.  Seller shipped quickly, and the DVD was well packed and arrived early and safely.  Would recommend the seller to anyone.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have watched these shows more than I can remember.  I love them all.  If you haven't watched these shows, I highly recommend them.  They are exciting.  They hold your interest, you get involved in these people and thier lives.  They are are great.  I am 57 and started watching them with my grand-daughter when they first came out.  She is now 17.  We have watched these shows a lot.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|don't see how anyone could give this less than a five it has everything typical Quentin Tarantino does in a movie, super violent and gory, long and humorous dialogue, stereotypical profiling of different ethnic groups... what the hell else do you want. If you don't like this movie than you might as well say you don't like any Tarantino film. Jamie Foxx and Waltz do an excellent job in playing their roles as well as being believable in them. Dicaprio does a great job as well as the owner of candieland. To be honest its a simple plot, Christoph Waltz is a bounty hunter looking for two murdering brothers and gets help from Jamie Foxx who use to live on their plantation. The terms are if Jamie helps him then Christoph must help Jamie find his wife who he was separated from.I recommend this movie to any Tarantino fan and anyone who enjoys good story telling and cinema.
B009NPA3MS|4.0|My wife and I became huge Phillip Phillips fans during last seasons American Idol. We waited anxiously for his debut CD and we have not been disappointed. Great music for this down to earth young man. The track &#34;Home&#34; is still my favorite.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I started watching this half way into it on the TV and when it was over , I thought I was watching a real life on the sean news cast !<br />Sure fooled me !  It was that good !  I was glued to the TV .
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is great! The only thing that would make it better would be to make it available offline. I would recommend this to all I know.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like xbox minecraft because you dontneed to make a cave. in pocket edition you dig down and hope you run in to diamond.
034580404X|5.0|I could not put these books down. They were amazing. Better then I could have imagined wish there were more books after. I did not want them to end!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Great. Not to hard not to easy. Way better than Bejeweled! The items and challenges as well as the bonus puzzles gives this game good replay value.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|As I get older, I find it harder and harder to find music that appeals to me. The Lumineers certainly fit the bill. The folk-tinged music is very pleasing to my ears and it has received multiple plays in my stereo. Anxious to hear more from these cats.
B00B23O96A|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD!!! I am a long-time Clapton fan, but this CD is not typical Clapton. In my opinion, it is one of the best. Hope there will be more like this! I have had it about 5 days and have listened to it for hours on end.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I am curious to know if seven years is too long for Justin Timberlake fans, because I know for a fact that many have been feigning for what feels like forever for some fresh, new music from him. Many were upset (myself included) that we were hearing that only ten tracks were on the album, with an additional two if you purchase the deluxe version at target. However, word got out on the 18th of March (via ?uestlove of The Roots, then from JT himself), that more music from the recording sessions will be released later in the year, to complete the vision of the 20/20 experience.<br /><br />Pusher Love Girl - For a quick second, this beat reminded me of something that D'angelo would have used in his earlier music endeavors. I really like the beat and musical arrangement of this song. On the track, Justin sings about how he is so enamored with a certain girl's presence, that he has become \\"a junkie for her love.\\" I can see this song fitting its way into many genres, and for that reason seeing it as definite single potential.<br /><br />Suit & Tie - I will be honest, I did not fall in love with this song upon release. I still am not in love with this song. I felt as if the inclusion of Jay Z did not mesh well, as they were not complementing themselves at all on this track. To me, it was as if they were on two total different tracks, speaking about totally different things. This songs succeeds in creating an urban-pop record where JT cockily proclaims, \\"I be on my suit and tie s***... let me show you a few things about love...\\" I am a sucker for big-band music (horns in the background), but I felt like a lot of different things were experimented in here (the chopping and screwing of the beginning and toward the end, etc). It is not my favorite.<br /><br />Don't Hold The Wall - You can clearly tell that this is a Timbaland production. I was immediately drawn it this song, where he sings about letting yourself go and dance instead of being somewhat the likes of a wallflower and \\"holding the wall.\\"  This is a track that really allows the beat to be showcased, as singing parts are omitted in a few portions of the song. I immediately gravitated to it in the beginning, but felt like the seven minute song dragged a little bit toward the end.<br /><br />Strawberry Bubblegum - I did not imagine the result of a song titled `strawberry bubblegum' sounding like what I initially thought it would. With a fun and wacky name as the title, I imagined something loud and over the top. This song is surprisingly super mellow and clean. JT sings about loving the taste of his girl, and hoping that she will never change. Now, you can take this song metaphorically, or literally - that is up to you.  Simply put, he is intoxicated with this girl and does not know why but figures he does not need the answer -- he just needs his girl.<br /><br />Tunnel Vision - It seems like this boy is really in love! In this song, he sings about being so in love that even in a crowded room all he sees is one person. He is so gone in love, but it seems as if upon realization that he really is in love, he is a little scared. Maybe scared about being so gone, for he sings that \\"now that I know the truth, what am I supposed to do?\\" He can no longer deny it, which he also iterates, for he knows that she already knows his feelings. This is really an interesting song about finally having to come to terms with your feelings and emotions, and being ok with it.<br /><br />Spaceship Coupe - In Strawberry Bubblegum he begins the song by saying, \\"this song goes out to you, this is dedicated to you,..\\" while in Spaceship coupe he starts off similarly by saying, \\"hey, I wrote this song for you.\\" It is a little obvious, but by this time you clearly see that this album is starting to have a certain theme. This song is about being alone with the one you love, just the one you love. He sings of obtaining seclusion with his love, the image of the two of them getting away together in empty space, and enjoying it.<br /><br />That Girl - Back to the big-band-like I was writing about earlier, thanks to JT and the Tennessee Kids. He is proclaiming that he is in love with \\"that girl\\" and does not give a damn what the opinions or stares of others are. She is his in love with his number one girl, and is already happy because she already told him that \\"she's in love with me.\\" For some reason, I felt like this could be an answer to Alicia Key's song [[ASIN:B002Y544YM Un-thinkable (I'm Ready)]]. Weird, I know, but I felt like these two songs are along the same themes and lines, where they both sing about no longer ignoring what is so obvious to them, and no longer caring what others think. Great song by JT and the Tennessee Kids.<br /><br />Let The Groove In - When I first heard this song, it kind of reminded me of \\"Se&ntilde;orita\\" from Justified. There is a lot of repetition that is so stretched in this song that I really did not care for, and he sings about enjoying the groove, and moving like there will be no tomorrow. Maybe this song will do well for a commercial, but I do not see it as one that I will have on repeat.<br /><br />Mirrors - Clearly this song is about the woman in his life, and how she is the better half of him. This is a pretty deep song about finally finding the one who completes you, and how he does not want to lose that person and how no one else could fill that place. He sings, \\"it's like you're my mirror, my mirror staring back at me.\\" Simply put, he has found his equal in the love of his life.<br /><br />Blue Ocean Floor - This song is really slow, and honestly a little depressing. He sings about being able to understand some one so much, better than anyone else, for they are so in tune with one another that they are on the same \\"frequency.\\" Nothing can incapacitate that fact, be it man-made or nature bound, is what I'm getting from this song. If you got a different vibe from this song, let me know. It is kind of a quiet song, reminds me of the ending of the movie Inception for some odd and random reason. Needless to say, not a favorite at the moment.<br /><br />I have got to be honest, I am a little confused at what Justin would consider himself music-vise, or what others think of him as. It is obvious that there are r&b related in some of the music he releases, but he is still considered to be pop. He definitely is Popular music, but I see this body of work as vastly different from what is considered as today's pop (i.e. Ke$ha, One Direction, Justin Bieber, whatever the heck else). This is even different (of course it would be) from when he was in his band days. With this album, you seriously see the growth JT has had as an artist, and how he has matured with age and where he currently is in life thanks to his marriage. Huge difference from his Justified days.<br /><br />I am eager to hear the other music JT and Timbaland have in store for us later this year. This is a pretty solid album, but does not get me over the moon excited after a 7 year hiatus from this man. However, there are plenty of songs that will be on my repeat list while I wait out for the completion of this experience. I am, however, if the other (currently unknown number) tracks will follow along the same theme of this album and will just be a continuation, or if it will be in a absolutely different direction.nd enjoying it.<br /><br />That Girl - Back to the big-band-like I was writing about earlier, thanks to JT and the Tennessee Kids.

B008XX6J4C|2.0|I just got the CD and quite frankly i was very dissapointed. The sound quality and clarity of the different sound tracks was ALOT better on youtube than on the cd. on youtube i can turn the sound up as high as i like, on the CD the sound breaks up and are marred by static noice at half the level of youtube, even though im using the same sound system for both.

B00B99KJR0|4.0|What a fun game! If some of you have played Call of Atlantis, this same has eerie similarities to it. But I still enjoy the concept, graphs and gameplay of this game. However, when I desire to have no hints, even though you manually turn it off they still come on.

B00008GKEG|5.0|As a huge Beatles fan, I've been wanting the Anthology on dvd for a long time, so I'm very pleased to have this.  I've only watched the first disc so far, but it's thoroughly enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Having owned horses my whole life, this game is pretty fun. Not quite what I was expecting, but fun none the less. I would get it again for free.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I started this book in paperback before I bought my kindle. I was interested right away. I love the way this writer takes you to Bombay and how he writes the way his friend speaks (with an accent and little English). You feel like you are there and can hear him speak. The paperback is very thick and hard to hold but I was so enthralled in this book I wanted to finish it before I started using the Kindle. I loved the book so much I decided to buy the ebook so that I could finish reading it easier. I loved the story and the way this author writes so much, I think I'll read it again. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to be themselves. The wizard of oz is one  of the best books that I have ever read. And I am a book lover that has read over 1890 books and  I am 12 years old. Thanks so much!!!-hailey brown
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is mind twisting. By far best book I've read in a while. Where is the movie? Hint! A must read
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I love this product.  It was money well spent.  It syncs perfectly with my Gmail calendar, which syncs with my Microsoft Outlook calendar on my desk top.  I don't have to drag a big bulky paper calendar with me to my meetings any more and I get reminders of upcoming appointments.  I also like the option of a day, week, month or list view of upcoming appointments and events, and that I can print from my Kindle.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great romantic love story.  I could watch it over and over again.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazon suggested this, and after reading the sample, I was hooked!  You can barely tell that this started as a short story, and got expanded.  Definitely a fun read!
1844137872|2.0|This book documents tagging made by the author, contributing on short time scale to medium funny experiences, on a little longer time scale (two weeks) to destruction of the cityscape for most people. Probably less to those that are free city riders and most to those that contributes to the city. The author will probably claim that he is a free spirit, and that cities need free spirits. That I agree with -within limits. I suppose graffiti and street art can be regarded as a sort of street theatre, there are players that willingly play the villains, and there are the players that unwillingly play the good people, that is, the clean up -ladies and men. But they do so, probably with compensation.<br /><br />However, to be a street villain, it is sort of a paradox, at best - to claim copyright to the work. I don't think you even can claim that you are contributing street art only, - because street -art, unavoidably - becomes graffiti after 1 week and tagging after two weeks. Nicely documented by the author, by the way. To get the book balanced, there are problems that have to be solved. I cant see that the author manages to solve them, but maybe he tries?<br /><br />I found the tagging only medium funny, and not very artistic. And not really important. However, there are street- art that are both funny and important. And artistic. And thus contribute better to the balance sheet for street-art.<br /><br />Generally, it is a hazardous endeavor for (small) wrongdoers to embed their (little) wrongs within a framework that makes the wrongs morally acceptable. (This is not relevant for the present author; I suppose he had permission to paint his graffiti).  But, I don't think the author succeeded to defend himself well, if some wrongs were made.
B0013V3GN8|5.0|There were a few songs that I hadn't heard on this. One that we had looked for but not on other CD's
B00003CXA6|5.0|I love this movie!!!  I played my other one so much, I wore my old one out.  Thank you, the cost was very much worth it!  It's one of the most accurate  Civil War movies ever made.
0783225881|5.0|This has always been a movie that I watch when spring training for the major leagues is getting underway.  Always enjoy the cast and how well they all played their characters.  Truly a great movie to add to anyone's collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I have had it for awhile. It doesn't force you to buy things if you bing want to. It is a great game for horse lovers of all ages!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Easy to play! Fun adventures and challenges. Love the idea of it and the dialog. I like that it is a fast paced game and it isn't one that can be completed in one day.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Perfect to keep me happy in the office for hours. . .This CD set includes 31 of Il Divo's greatest hits.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie, and would definitely watch it again.  It was a wonderful depiction of the way Canada and the US worked together to rescue six US diplomats who avoided capture during the Iran Hostage Crisis.  Although it wasn't exactly accurate in how the rescue was depicted, it definitely was an incredibly well-done movie.

B009CCBCU4|5.0|The Highlander, set in the Aztec lands of long ago, is an exciting adventure that follows the growing friendship of two boys from opposite sides of the beliefs of their heritages. This completely engrossing read grasps your attention and never lets it go.<br /><br />Their clandestine meetings spark much interest, learning as we go along, that Kuini is an excellent artist who learns to read, with help from Coyotl. These characters are so engaging that every time they meet, there's a bit of anxiety for their well being. They can be found out and attacked at any time, yet they still keep meeting, each entranced with the other's background stories and adventures.<br /><br />Adding to the mix is a poor servant girl who just so happens to be one of their sisters and adds to the romance and mishaps that go on between the two young people infatuated with each other. Customs demand that those two star-crossed lovers may never find each other again, once the girl is fobbed off onto a husband she does not want, just so her father can appease the leader of another land.<br /><br />When Kuini puts his hand on the exalted Great Pyramid, for the very first time in his life, not only is he spiritually-lifted up and is enthralled to touch such a magnificent structure, but the descriptions have you right alongside him, feeling the cold stone and marble, and sharing his excitement.<br /><br />The descriptions of when Kuini gets to see the revered hidden drawings and writings kept in the temple, makes you feel as if you are honored to see them, too.<br /><br />The Highlander is extremely well written with the words pouring onto the pages as smooth as satin, leading you to be completely involved in what the main characters, and the supporting characters, may do next. Misfortunes arise that round out the story of these Aztecs of Pre-Columbia Americas that propel you forward, page by exquisitely written page.<br /><br />I adored every bit of this book and highly recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />When you have a chance, please visit this author's blog to see the lifelong research and endeavors she has put into the study of, and the sharing of, the Aztecs.br /><br />When you have a chance, please visit this author's blog to see the lifelong research and endeavors she has put into the study of, and the sharing of, the Aztecs.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|Love this series.  Season 2 is great also... Just wish they had made more since there are 11 books in the series.  Just started reading the books.  Finished the first book &#34;Wizards First Rule&#34; by Terry Goodkind which matches Season 1 with some differences of course.  Currently reading the second book, &#34;Stone of Tears&#34; which seams to match the second season.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book as as great as the other two. I enjoyed all the books and wish They would of gone on and on. They were all full of love ,angry, suspence you name it it had it. Thanks for the good read.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|amazing production,special sounds and effects on the drums..best album!<br />and the delivery of it....REAL FAST! this is the best album of fiona,i recommend the whole collection
B009DB60W4|4.0|Basicly I don't like so much \\"concept albums\\", because, according to me, every time there is something bad, that in the conventional albums there is not.<br />I mean, for example, that trying to do something of epic, great, the bands usually exceed becoming boring, repetitive, noisy.<br />Or to follow the text of the opera, they force too much the music trend of the band doing music, strange, not in their style.<br />I think Therion do not escape to this tendence.<br />But in despite of some tracks that sounds a bit strange, the great Therion art absolutely compensate.<br />It is strange to ear the singing in French, but they follow the original languege of the opera.<br />In conclusion, considering all, another Therion album, another \\"must have\\" album!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game i play it all the time and i love the how the themes change and its really fun to try our hardest to get the limited edition items

B00B99KJR0|2.0|Read this for quick review from previous game, Call of Atlantis.<br /><br />Normally this type of game is the type I really do not care for. Tiles fall down in various grid designs and you have to match 3 or more tiles in a row vertically or horizontally and it is also timed, two things that I would not usually want. Yet there is something about how Playrix created it that is very addicting. It is very much like their other game called &#34;Call of Atlantis&#34; but simplified, without the bomb, lighting, heart, or move over one space icons. And now when you use the power up button (hammer), you can only take out one tile once powered up.  But if you wait and let it power up twice, it will turn into lightning (you can take out all of one color of tile).  If you power it up three times, it turns into a bomb which can take out lots of close tiles.<br /><br />Game tiles are a little busy and harder to see than most match games.  They have drawings on them and different shades of color (kind of gives it a ‘glare’).  Also to make it worse, every few seconds a beam of light passes over the tiles.  I am sure this is for aesthetics, but I find it a little obtrusive.<br /><br />The amount of lives (hearts are used in the Atlantis game) has been replaced with an Angry Birds style method.  If you do not finish the level in the required time frame, instead of losing a life, you just will have to start the game over at the last level passed.  And you get scored as a one through three star score.<br /><br />The description of this game by the developers is confusing since it says; &#34;Travel back in time to the late 19th century&#34;, makes you think this is an adventure game, not a match game. One small con is the Hints are much more intrusive, not at all subtle like on the Atlantis game (which did it perfectly).  And there is no way to turn it off (well there is in Options, but it does not work).<br /><br />Found a strange quirk on the &#34;Kite&#34; level in Japan.  I had three of the same tiles in a horizontal row and they did not destruct like they are supposed to.<br /><br />Installed on a Kindle Fire 1st generation.<br /><br />Edit...5/4/2013 I had to downgrade my rating (originally I gave it 5 stars) due to my battery was being discharged every 2 days.  So I downloaded a battery monitor app and found that this app was using 30%-40% of the battery when NOT in use.  I tried different things (deleted my saves, I had finished all levels) but that did not help much.  I forced closed the Kindle and that did help, but I do not want to do this after playing a game each time.  I wish you could just close games like you used to on a PC. Draining the battery makes this game unusable.  I have many apps, most of them are games, and the battery moniter does not even register any of them as using power when not in use, just this one.ee of the same tiles in a horizontal row and they did not destruct like they are supposed to.<br /><br />Installed on a Kindle Fire 1st generation.<br /><br />Edit...5/4/2013 I had to downgrade my rating (originally I gave it 5 stars) due to my battery was being discharged every 2 days.

B0010DRYP0|1.0|I'm ready to rant about what must be the worst DVD transfer in history. Sadly that horrible transfer is also one of the best movies, Goodfellas. It is so sad that in 2013, I am writing a review about a terrible DVD transfer that people were already complaining about in 2001, in the very early days of DVD.<br /><br />So, what is it about the version of Goodfellas I recently purchased that makes it suck such legendary ass? Well gather around children and let me tell you.<br /><br />1.) \\"Widescreen Edition\\" - \\"Presented in a matted widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition. ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS\\".<br />- This is absolutely completely misleading BS. The name of the actual title encoded on the disc is GOODFELLAS_4X3LB_NA . That doesn't sound like a widescreen presentation to me -- no, in fact, it is not a widescreen presentation. It is a 4x3 aspect ratio version cropped heavily on the top and bottom, and on the right and left. All told, I expect only about 2/5 of the screen is used for displaying the movie -- it is just a tiny rectangle in a sea of black borders at 16x9. It is REALLY terrible.<br /><br />2.) I imagine a Warner Brothers DVD Production meeting: \\"Let's have the viewer flip that disc over half way. Preserve that 2 VHS tape presentation that they loved so much in the 1980's!\\". This is also inexcusable that such a version of the movie persists on store shelves to this day. Literally at 1 hour and 12 minutes. Yes, 1 hour and 12 minutes into the disc, you have to get up, go over to the DVD player and flip the disc over so you can watch the other 1 hour and 12 minutes. This also means if you copy your DVDs to your home network you'll have to load up another file half way through as well. Long-ass Michael Mann movies originally on 2 VHS tapes like Last of the Mohicans and Heat which released in the early days of DVD alongside Goodfellas and were on a single side disc (in a proper widescreen format to boot) even then.<br /><br />3.) Considering the two above gripes, the fact that this disc shows a 2013 copyright on it is inconceivable. It came with an Ultraviolet copy, but that's almost a minus to me, sort of the red-headed stepchild of digital copy. What gives? What fricking intern made this DVD transfer and why does it still exist in this day and age? AAARAARRRGHH!!!<br /><br />This literally should be one of the very few open-package media returns that should be allowed for full credit. Beware of the copy in the gold cardboard packaging touting the \\"Academy Award Winner for Best Supporting Actor (1990)\\", at least you can know that is the CRAP version and you should try your luck with a different version. I see there is a 2 disc collectors edition out there with a printed top side to the feature disc indicating that it is at least a 1 sided copy.<br /><br />Unfortunately Amazon reviews seem to aggregate across all versions of films despite the media and version/release of the film so it is hard to filter out the copies of this movie which you shouldn't purchase on the basis of customer reviews, quite unfortunately in this case. If you look at one star reviews like this, you will see lots of people dissatisfied with the version of the film in 4x3 touted as widescreen, requiring you to flip the disc, etc.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it is so addicting once you start playing you cant put the game down
B009VYAVTG|5.0|I saw the last episode of Merlin and decided I want to keep the whole series of 5 seasons so I started ordering. Apparently they made the blu-ray version started season 4 and 5 is still pre-order. Seasons 1,2,3 are available on DVD but may be produced on blu-rays as well. Hopefully.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was actually a really cool game for me and my friends to enjoy. I also thinkyou will have a great time using this and playing this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful read.  Keeps you on the edge the entire time.  Way better than the movie.  Ready to read book 2
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Fun to play, good story line and the games were challenging but not to hard.  A Great point and click game.  Played with noproblems on my Kindle Fire HD.  I have played almost all of the point and click games I could find and this is one of the best I think.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|An amazing story of wonder, awe, gratitude and optimism.<br /><br />I've never read the book, so the movie was my first exposure to the original story. From a viewer's point of view, despite its remarkable visual and narrative mastery, \\"Pi\\" felt like just another high-quality Hollywood production - one that makes you feel good but is easily forgettable - until the story took a suddenly turn toward the end and Pi confronted us with the brutal truth and challenged our faith in humanity with the ultimate question: \\"which story do you prefer?\\". Without the last 10 minutes \\"Pi\\" is a 3-star movie; with its last 10 minutes it easily claims 5. Thanks to his extraordinary cinematic talent, director Ang Lee was able to do justice to the story itself - that is no small feat.<br /><br />\\"Pi\\" is not a religious movie - not in the sense that it preaches anything. It simply asks us a question and leaves the rest to us. For some of us it's uplifting; for the rest of us it does nothing - until a later time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awesome game.Worth the pay.Try creative mode it gives you any block to your supplie.Survival mode is awesome too.You get armor to wear.I never knew that.There is baby animals too

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a great conversation piece, and can be enjoyed by a wide variety of individuals. I liked the romance, while my boyfriend enjoyed the action! It gets you thinking a little abstractly, with believable characters.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is informative .  Easy to use.  I t has all the weather information I need in one quick location.
1439156816|5.0|This is a must read if you want to be a writer. Even if you don't agree with everything King says, this is a great book for ideas, story telling, and advice. It is also his most well written book and a great addition to your &#34;books about writing&#34; shelf (I know you have one).
B00APUYWYA|2.0|This movie was a pathetic representation of what college is really like.  The only good thing in the movie was the singing.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's okay but ,if you want to really do anything you need to buy stuff and who has money to waste on this.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|That book was so boring it was terrible it should have been more exciting and I couldn't get caught in the book sorry Suzanne
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This is a fantastic release. It does a great job of filling in the blank spots of the series. Armed with this knowledge, the viewer can better understand the main series and how things came to be. TOP NOTCH acting and the usual great action.<br /> It is a MUST HAVE for any fan.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Well, were you really expecting anything but camp?  I've been watching action movies since forever, and the constant movie references were hilarious.  I haven't had this much fun since &#34;The Last Action Hero&#34;.

141970642X|5.0|Your book is amazing I love your books I have 7 of Jeff Kinney's books thanks for creat this novel
B00004Z459|5.0|This entire album is top knotch. Although a lot of casual listeners will find the rhymes a little juvenile; upon closer inspection, one will discover that this is a unique album and that Linkin Park deserves all the success they've earned thus far.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|I love that this was pretty much the full album but without the cd and plastic case. All my other downloads have never came with a digital booklet before so seeing this really surprised me and I absolutely LOVE it!!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It's a nice light read, but I can't wander through it without constantly thinking about the similarities to &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34;.  It's a little light on character development, but the exposition is beautiful.
1449410243|5.0|This is a book worth buying for someone that loves cats. Not only is the illustration clear and funny, it is exactly what the cat had in mind.
B004D2A04M|5.0|Fits both my PD32 UE and my LD22 nicely. Can't find anything particularly annoying about it, seems to work well.<br />My PD32 UE is resting comfortably on my hip in the horizontal position as I post this in the AB02 holster.<br /><br />Fenix, unlike Nite Ize, was smart in centering the rotating belt clip on the back. Makes sense for twisting it around or for horizontal carry. The belt clip itself looks tough and is made of nice chrome plated spring steel. It rotates easily, but the click stops are very positive and I don't think it will spin around on you inadvertently.<br /><br />I also bought the Nite Ize universal holster to try it out, it sucks. The Nite Ize holster is a lot bulkier, and the rotating clip is offset towards the top of the holster back which doesn't make a lick of sense for the rotational belt clip. It's just a bogus design. Waste of money. I should have scrapped the Nite Ize purchase, spent the extra 5 bucks and got another Fenix AB02 for my LD22.<br /><br />The Fenix is a lot more compact, and I like the velcro tension strap as an extra measure for security. I wouldn't be happy with my PD32 UE slipping out to whereabouts unknown due to insufficient tension on the hoster. Not at all.<br /><br />I doubt that will happen with the Fenix AB02.<br /><br />At 12 bucks, it's worth it. Hopefully the stitching holds up.<br /><br />Agree with a previous reviewer that Fenix should use this as an included accessory for their higher end ($50++) lights.<br />The default holsters that Fenix includes with their flashlights are a joke, they should just do away with them.
B00005QGAV|5.0|This album is a timeless treasure and easily contains some of The King of Pop's greatest, most thought-provoking songs. The album takes the listener to a different place with each song.
0345803493|4.0|Bought this for my granddaughter, so I don't know if it was good or not?? I don't read many books.<br />But, It was a good pricce.
B000002KOO|5.0|Awesome! I just got a free card code for iTunes from freeitunesforever[dot]com<br />This is a pretty awesome tool for free music, I use it all the time and it's pretty awesome, this song sucks I hate it, five stars is good though
B009NNG202|4.0|Well done, but a creepy story and very dark....but interesting. Well cast and good acting. Sets and scenery were excellent.
B001EC3JME|2.0|It's just OK. Barely.<br /><br />Not particularly impressed with the design. One of the key things is that the rotating belt clip should be centered on the back of this holster for horizontal carry or rotating into a particular position if you want to use the flashlight on your belt as the design intended, but fails to deliver.<br /><br />Belt clip is offset towards the top so it kind of negates the rotating feature and makes it pointless.<br /><br />It's bulky for what it is. I really should return it, but I've already mutilated and ditched the packaging.<br /><br />Maybe I can use it for something else.<br /><br />I bought the Fenix AB02 ballistic nylon holster at the same time, as I have two Fenix lights that I wanted carry holsters for and the Fenix design is totally superior to this, although they are similar in function. The Fenix clip is metal, centered on the back for sensible rotation use/horizontal carry, and the whole unit is less bulky with a velcro retention/tension strap that goes around the holster body that the Niteyes holster doesn't have.<br /><br />Fenix AB02 was a few dollars more, but well worth the extra bucks.<br /><br />Save your money on this one and look at the Fenix AB02 if you're looking for a holster of this style.
1616550414|5.0|This is a great thing to pick up if you're a Zelda fan. Anything you've ever questioned about the Zelda universe, the continuity between games, or simply what the designers were thinking when they did certain things is answered in these pages. Plus it's a great way to enjoy the games more; reading it gives you even more of a feel for what's going on in each respective game, and it provides a closer connection to the characters as you play it.
B000002W8O|5.0|Love this album...<br />I gave my youngest son every record/album that Elvis ever made....as Elvis was his favorite!!<br /><br />My son, was killed over 20 years ago, so now I have all of his Elvis albums...love them !!
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|new style for hollywood; full nudity of a woman older than 20 in a drama film.  Helen Hunt is raw, genuine, and  fabulous in her role. The cinematography is superb. No predicted hollywood ending. just life as it is.  would recommend!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This isa great app for solitaire except for the constant pop ups. I use it while watching tv with my husband when he is watching yet another csi.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I won't spoil the ending but this movie had so much hype that I expected more from it. That aside, it was among the best Bond films I've seen and it set up a story line for the next installment - and I'll be watching that too,
0345803485|4.0|Bought this for my granddaughter, so I'm not sure about the reading of it...??<br />She apparently liked it., and it was a decent price.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|After the gargantuan success of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the billion-dollar box office take of only part one of The Hobbit movie, it's fun to look again at Ron Howard's hobbit-like adventure from the land of Lucas.  When young Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) finds an abandoned baby girl, he learns she is destined to end the reign of the wicked Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh). In order to protect the child, Willow must team up with a rogue swordsman (Val Kilmer) and - big surprise -- overcome the forces of darkness in an ultimate battle of good and evil.  This new transfer, with never-before-seen exclusive bonus material, deserves fresh consideration.  Digital effects were in their infancy.  Look for a morphing sequence that was, for its time, state of the art.  This was the movie where Val Kilmer met his future ex-wife Joanne Whalley.  Keep an eye out for ideas from the Bible and fairy tales like Snow White.  Producer George Lucas has even added bits of his own Star Wars saga!
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Loved Casino Royale, hated Quantum of Solace. Skyfall has to be an in between for me. It was ok but not anything close to Casino Royale. Daniel Craig does a good job playing Bond so that's not an issue for me. I guess Quantum of Solace and Skyfall just seem sort of boring to me.
B00BESM14U|5.0|The dialog and acting were very smart - and I appreciate a movie where it actually surprises you with an ending. This one had a last minute change up that I did not expect and it actually made the movie deeper on a number of levels. Well done.
1423140605|1.0|My son loves these books, but was disappointed when he got to page 440 or so just to find a big chunk missing.
B0043UB0EI|3.0|I was disappointed in this show. Not the plot, but the quality of the graphics. I felt like I was watching one of my daughter's violent video games. The blood and guts didn't bother me... it is a very violent time period after all. Just not very realistic. If you want an awesome show set in the same era... check out ROME. Much better quality. If you love video games.. Spartacus just might be your show.
1455121924|5.0|I'm so glad I bought Wheatbelly.  I had just read Younger Next Year which advised that it's sometimes easier to give up problem foods than to try to manage your relationship with them.  I knew I was addicted to wheat so it had to go. Then I saw Wheatbelly on Amazon and, having read it, understand that wheat is addictive to many if not most people.<br /><br />On the down side, the author is given to hyperbole in his efforts to amuse the reader.  (I'm from a big city.  Anyone who has ever seen a person high on heroin would not describe them as frantic, violent or anything close to that.)  But that's a small failing.  I can still get the point that wheat may affect the psyche.  I thought I used to binge on cookies BECAUSE I was moody and depressed.  Now I wonder if I was caught in a self-perpetuating cycle.  His science is on the money.  This is an important book.  I've read it twice in one week just to get the fine points down.  Physically, I feel better already.  There's less belly to grab and it hasn't been a month yet.  Doing without wheat uncovered symptoms I didn't know I had or, perhaps more accurately, couldn't name.<br /><br />I have the audio version.  The author is the reader and he's quite...  enthusiastic.  I liked it anyway.  It arrived on time, well packaged and in good condition.
030759565X|5.0|This was one of the hottest cookbook releases in the last year, and the photography, layout and recipes are all very strong. Top quality book and written in great conversational voice. You feel like Deb is across the kitchen table sharing her food and family stories.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it's a simply &amp; fun way to kill time it is easy to start and pick up where  left off
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best fictional shows on TV for educated viewers! Beautiful, historical fiction; three-dimensional, well-developed characters; top of the line acting; intriguing plot! I am an acting instructor and I have to say that Maggie Smith is brilliant. Her performance is flawless down to the smallest detail. The rest of the cast is also outstanding. Very few TV shows have been set in this particular period of British history which makes Downton Abbey one of a kind. Sophisticated with a touch of soap opera. I have enjoyed every episode and look forward to the next season.
0739380729|3.0|I bought \\"When You Reach Me\\" to share with young neighbors here in a rural area of the Gulf Coast.  If time permits, I read books I've gotten for children before I give them away.  When I was closer to book stores, I'd read them before I bought them.  If the stories can hold my interest, the kids usually like them, even if they're not big readers.  But this time, I found that the book was so New Yorky that rural kids might find it too foreign to relate to.  Also, it was rather slow going and I eventually put it down.  But, I grew up New York City and can testify that it realistically portrays city life from a kid's perspective.  Perhaps the end makes up for the slow middle.<br /><br />The book arrived on time and was as advertised.
141659521X|5.0|I think that of all the writers doing this type of political action thriller book, Vince Flynn along with maybe Tom Clancy are doing the best books currently.  Reading his work is like drinking a chocolate malt, I love it and it goes down quickly.  This book is very topical involving Pakistan and Afghanistan plus the incompetent and corrupt Washington bureaucrats, Vince is totally in tune with the realities of today's world.<br /><br />The only slight complaint I have about this book, is the placement of the character Joe Rickman, with all the intelligence supposedly in his head, in a totally exposed position for kidnapping in Afghanistan.  This is not believable on two counts.  First, I doubt that any field agent could come close to having the amount of knowledge that he was thought to have.  Normally this knowledge would be very compartmentalized and no agent could know that much.  Second, if there were such a person, he would not be left out in the field in a hostile area with no protection.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I really did enjoy the book and the various characters, especially Mitch Rapp, Dr. Kennedy, and some of the bad guys in Pakistani intelligence.  The plot was complicated, well executed, and a lot of fun.  I look forward to Vince's next book, keep up the good work.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book start to finish. I didn't want it to end. I also read Slammed and Point of Retreat. Colleens writing style is in a word amazing. If I can say one thing negative, and I'm reaching I wanted to know more about their future, what happens next. I don't like spoilers so I'm not giving any.  5 stars
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this game is awsome! it is fun and really builds you up. if you want really scary download slender rising that is even creepier!!
0938045768|5.0|Forget about pumping iron. Barbells, dumbbells, and the like - to say nothing of gym machines - are relatively recent inventions, and have only become widespread in the past half-century. But it's not like guys weren't getting ripped before our age of steroids and iron. Just look at the masculine and perfectly-proportioned Greek sculptures of their gods and war heroes if you have any doubts about that.<br /><br />Back then, men trained their bodies using calisthenics - manipulating their own bodies to strengthen their joints, increase agility, and grow muscle. As the author argues, modern weightlifting methods are only any good at the latter, producing \\"drugged up jerks\\" who can barely stretch their arms back to comb their own hair.<br /><br />He really does not like modern bulking methods - period, comparing its practitioners with \\"Brazilian rent boys\\" in another passage. A tad too harsh? Probably. But I don't begrudge him that, as the rhetoric is entertaining to read - and more importantly, it is backed up by fairly convincing arguments as to the superiority of calisthenic methods. Way back, the ability to bench press 400 lb was quite irrelevant, whereas climbing up a tree quickly and efficiently was very useful for evading predators. And to do the latter you need to be able to do a lot of pull-ups. Evolution designed us to be climbers and wrestlers, not symmetric-iron bar lifters. Why fight evolution then, as opposed to working with it?<br /><br />This is the philosophy. The real \\"meat\\" of the book is Paul Wade's comprehensive exercise program, which consists of the \\"Big Six\\" movements (push-ups, squats, pull-ups, leg raises, bridges, and handstand push-ups), each of which has ten progressions that logically lead on to each other. So the \\"push-up\\", for example, starts off with the wall pushup - an easy exercise that almost everybody, including the very weak or obese, can start off with - that progresses to incline push-ups, normal pushups, supported one-arm ups, and culminates with the daddy of them all: 100 repetitions of the one-arm push-up. Following this program, you should become a lean, mean, well-oiled strength machine well before you end up mastering the entire program.<br /><br />I have only recently finished reading the book, and am looking forwards to putting the program into practice. I used to do iron, on and off - never could keep indefinitely motivated - but got destroyed by my dad (who had trained, ages ago, using only bodyweight) in pull-ups even though he's far older and I can lift much, much more in the gym. As such, I found the arguments in favor of calisthenics here intuitively persuading. Even though I have not yet had the chance to comprehensively assess just how good or bad the Convict Conditioning program is going to be for me specifically, my expectations are high.<br /><br />PS. Some reviewers have raised questions as to whether \\"Paul Wade\\" really did spend 19 years as a convict, or whether he even exists at all. If I had to guess, I'd say he's legit - if the publishers really, really needed a marketing ploy to sell the information in this book, surely passing him off as a former Spetsnaz soldier (as is Pavel Tsatsouline, incidentally) or somesuch would have made much more sense than potentially driving away buyers with the entire convict theme? But it really doesn't matter. After all, you're buying this book to get fit, not to read prison diaries.and culminates with the daddy of them all: 100 repetitions of the one-arm push-up.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is the best Clancy novel to come along in quite awhile. Tightly drawn plot, entertaining characters and Clancy's signature super denouement.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I consider the Eagles the best rock band ever. I have seen them on tour several times and have never been disappointed. This concert gives backstage insights not seen before. After all the things I have read about their inability to get along as a band, this concert was a pleasant surprise. I never get tired of their songs, old and new, and I hope they make through my area one more time. I will be in the audience for sure.
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|didn't really know much about this group, but this song was suggested f0r me. Downloaded it and immediately loved it -- great song.
B0049IWQJW|4.0|buena  calidad  de  imagen  y  buen tema  para  los niños.les  enseña a ser buenas  personas  y  humildes.lo  recomiendo  y es  mejor comprar el video.

B007REV4T8|5.0|That pretty much says it all. All the nay-sayers who predicted that Daniel Craig would never BE Bond have proven to be very wrong.<br />Javier Bardem is a great match for 007, and the introduction of some new characters joins the old and the new very neatly. I'm looking forward eagerly to the next Bond. I never thought any of the other &#34;Bonds&#34; came close to the original, Sean Connery-but look over your shoulder, Mr. Connery. I believe Mr. Craig is rapidly gaining on you.
1451695195|4.0|I believe the author of this book had the journey and the experiences he had.  The book gets too technical into his own personal expertise as a scientist though and some parts were very boring for me.  But all in all a good recollection of his experience.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Okay, I am afraid to eat ... anything ... now.<br /><br />Dating back to Dr. Kellogg's brother, who discovered that when he added sugar, more people would eat more of their flakes, companies have been 'teaching' our taste buds what to like. And, consistently, for more than 100 years, it's been sugar, salt, and fat that makes our mouths happy.<br /><br />Or so manufacturers would like us to think.<br /><br />The problem is, after all these years, those taste buds are well-trained. It takes concerted effort to break away from what has become, over time, a plethora of lab-created concoctions that, at the heart of it, bear little resemblance to food. And the consumer watch dog, created to protect our interests and intercede when companies go crazy, has no teeth.<br /><br />Moss's years of investigation have uncovered frightening truths: Manufacturers are only concerned with profits. They hire experts to create products that make our mouths happy, with total disregard for our health. They have an army of marketers who are more than willing to lie through their teeth about the value of the company's products, just to keep us buying what they make.<br /><br />This is neither an easy read nor a comfortable read. The truth is shocking and scary. But, if you think about it, it shouldn't be.<br /><br />How many times have you purchased a product, something you've used for years, only to find it doesn't taste the same? Maybe it's saltier, or sweeter. Or just ... different. Odds are, that product you've been buying isn't performing as well, these days, against its competitors, so the manufacturer has upped the salt, sugar, or fat.<br /><br />You don't have to be a fast-food-junkie, cook-it-from-a-box kind of person to benefit from the findings in this book. The fact that hamburger is treated with ammonia to kill pathogens, is just one thing every consumer needs to know. And if you've ever had a soda, the sugar volume will send you running for a glass of water.<br /><br />Salt Sugar Fat is filled, pardon the pun, with thousands of facts about the food we eat. And food we probably shouldn't.<br /><br />~*~*~<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary electronic galley of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.com [...] professional readers program.

B00B99KJR0|1.0|APP WILL NOT INSTALL ON MY KINDLE FIRE. IT DOWNLOADS THEN GIVES A ERROR MESSAGE THAT SAYS IT CAN'T OPEN. AMAZON NEEDS TO TEST IT'S OWN STORES APPS ON IT'S OWN TABLETS. TOTALLY RIDICULOUS AND UNCALLED FOR.
0240815807|5.0|This is a great resource for anyone starting out in the recording/mixing/mastering process.  It's written on a level that a newb like me can understand and I've learned a ton.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|The book is entertaining and well written. I read it in few days and decided to buy the next one in the series for my long trip to Tahoe.
B008OOYALE|5.0|A fun game that is frustratingly slow at times just so you will spend money to speed things up! I like the ease in making neighbors and giving gifts! bring your patience and hide your wallet!
B00992CF6W|5.0|if this game was rated from 1 to 10 I would rate it a million because its so awesome I play it everyday it is so fun and addicting so you should get this app since its cool no matter who says bad stuff about this app they probably never played it you should get it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|One of the most unique mobile games I've played, and surprisingly fun.  Very simple concept and easy to get the hang of it.  Running on a Galaxy Tab 10.1 (1st gen)
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This movie is awesome!  Reading about how it was made will impress you and make you want to watch it even more.  I don't want to give it away and tell you why, just read the background to the movie.
B008133MDK|5.0|The show was as great as usual! I absolutely Loved it!<br />I can hardly wait for the next season to start!
B000HZGCEG|4.0|little cheesy haha but pual walkers a bad ass in any movie lol highly recommend pleasantville though!!!! watched it with my wife because i love the whole medieval thing and she knows it haha. good time though.
B00003CXA6|5.0|this epic movie captures the brutality of our war  brother v brother  amny who fought side by side in the Spanish-American War and who trained together at West Point
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I went to see this movie with no expectations, and it turned out to be very very good!  I love all the seperate plot lines and the performances are outstanding!  I was amazed at how it all weaved together.  The writing was very good and so was the direction.  Also the sets were perfect!  I wa sad that this movie did not do as well as it deserved.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|We really enjoyed the Avengers. It brought all the various characters from other superhero movies together seemlessly and was quite an enjoyable experience.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|Once Upon a Time in the West is a silent movie... with sound... as an afterthought. Large chunks of it can be viewed with the sound turned down (particularly the first fifteen minutes) without detriment - and sometimes with profit.<br /><br />This is my favorite Sergio Leone movie. It's also my favorite Henry Fonda movie. It's my favorite Jason Robards movie, and my favorite Charles Bronson movie. But most of all, it's my favorite Jack Elam movie.
B002P8O29K|3.0|the stines with Hells Angels and the flower children get together for sex, drucks, beer -beer brawls and yes,  poorly recorded music
B001NEK2GE|5.0|showed up on time and works great.  install was easy, but that is probably due to the fact I downloaded the newest driver from logitech instead of using the cd which it came with.  the software found all my games and I like the fact there were already pre programmed macros I am able to use or customize.  i would recommend this to any gamer that can learn to use their left thumb for the joystick control.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I can't perceive why this would be such a highly rated book.  My only thought is that people rating it so highly have never delved into the category of  Fantasy fiction. This does not compare
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|got to chat with people all over the state, quick exchange in conversation without any hang up or delays perfect app
B0042J6VUS|2.0|I thought the holder would be adjustable to for a larger phone. Wrong. Still, I got what I payed for.
B004V5QWU2|4.0|I was pretty excited to see this app but wish I had read the more recent reviews regarding the kindle fire HD. I'm noticing lots of gaps in different sounds. I don't mind looping because you get that with every type of sound maching product, but gaps are horrible. Maybe if you combined 3 different sounds, it wouldn't be that noticeable.<br />What I like:<br />*choice to use up to 3 different sounds and set volume levels for each<br />*variety of sounds, like 4 or more rain sounds<br />*being able to save your favorite combination<br />What I don't like:<br />*GAPS<br />*Strange sounds that wouldn't be that soothing, like snoring. really? And the fountain one sounds like my husband peeing, don't need that one.<br />*not being able to listen to a sound before downloading it or deleting it if you don't like it. I only see the choice to clear all which I did by accident and had to start all over again.<br /><br />I still rate it with 4 stars though, because I think it's a cool app and it's much easier to pack your kindle with you on a trip rather than a bulky sound machine, which we do. I hope the dev. will read about the gap problems with the HD and fix it soon.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|after completing all except 1 objectives, the damn thing wont open on my kindle anymore it opens and then justly goes to the home screen what the hell!!!!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|The kids (6, 8, and 11) were skeptical at first, but they were hooked within 20 minutes.  The action moves at a fast and furious pace, and there is enough to keep the adults interested.  A great diversion for a rainy evening.
1616550414|5.0|The book was delivered before I expected, and in great quality.<br />If you are a fan of The Legend of Zelda series I strongly recommend this book.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie as essential viewing by people with severe disabilities, their carers and their families.  Top stuff.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|it starts off very slow but is a very good book.  The end was very exciting and found to be unexpected
B0013D8LOU|5.0|bought this for my daughter she has wanted it for a long time, was great that it was a special edition
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|A more mature and full sound from JT and while not every track is a hit every track is definitely a good one and worth repeat listens.<br /><br />Favorite tracks: Pusher Lover Girl, Strawberry Bubblegum (the breakdown on that is awesome), Suit & Tie, Blue Ocean Floor, That Girl<br /><br />I'm being really lazy right now not writing a full review but bottom line is this is up there with FutureSex/LoveSounds I just haven't decided which one is better yet.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|The second season has less impact than the first season. But production quality stays high level. Highly recommended. I hope that the production arrive to sixth season following the books issues.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is very addictive. I really enjoy it. If you like puzzle games, you will love this game. As you progress the puzzles get new twists to keep it interesting.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|A little hard to follow at times, with all the time shifts.  But a very interesting plot!  I was afraid before watching that it would turn into a really bad Die Hard clone of a movie, I'm glad it did not.
B0085A9HXS|1.0|I recently saw the raid redemption after my friends recommended it to me and unfortunatly found it to be quite disturbing. dont get me wrong i love hardcore action movies and enjoy many martial arts movies new and old but just some parts were so unnecessary that it ruined the movie for me. i realize they made the movie off of a million dollars and the action was awesome most of the time but there was so to much blood added to each killing it unfortunately ruined it for me.I am not looking for an argument, i just want people who havent seen it to know it has a LOT more gore than they would expected
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Just like your on the website, except now you can take it with you! Easy to use and shows everything you'd view on the website
B005J32Y6Q|5.0|Word of advice---buy the 3D edition. You get both the standard bluray and the 3D version on the same disc. And, since someday you'll PROBABLY upgrade to 3D----you'll be glad you spent a few extra bucks and splurged on this 3D version. It's really awesome. I upgraded my sound system particularly for this disc....the music is unbelievable and the stage presence is memorizing. I have no idea how these performers do what they do....it's definitely a crowd pleaser!<br /><br />Word of warning to parents: this particular version does include much more risqu&eacute; dances as compared to previous versions of Lord of the Dance. One particular scene has all the women strip down to their underwear to perform a dance in sync. This was a bit of a shock. Aside from this one dance----it's great family fun!
030758836X|3.0|The first part of the book was painfully slow in many parts and I forced myself to push through based on many of the reviews that said the second part would be better. It definitely was. The second part picked up and kept me captivated all the way through. There were some unexpected twists to this story, which made it good. For awhile. The third part was also good however all the time and interest put into this book felt for not. The end was HORRIBLE. It didn't have to have a happily ever after ending, or an ending that we all wanted (you all know you didn't want it to end that way!) but it felt like all this incredible build up and a quick let down. I kept turning pages expecting I had missed something. It almost felt as if the author ran out of steam and just quickly wrapped it up to get it over with. Is it worth the read? I don't know. You'll have to decide for yourself.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Although one may not have the exact same experiences as the character within this book, I think philosophically every one of us can not only make a mutual connection to our own lives, but also take a lesson from this book. No matter if the experiences appear unrealistic or not, the true lesson comes from the understanding of what happened.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Unable to put this down, I read the three books of the trilogy in three days! It was well worth the purchase because I can read them again in the near future.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I LOVE PLAYING THIS GAME!!  I spend hours on this mindless concentration!  It's very relaxing.  The kids in our life like a simpler version.
0062012339|5.0|If you're a fan of Mötley Crüe you will absolutely love reading this book!  You learn about all the guys and their journeys...it's pure sex, drugs and rock and roll. That's honestly the best way to describe it!  I hope the movie comes out soon!! :-)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is an amazing way to discover new trends, recipes, etc. It allows you to express what you like through pictures too! I am so obsessed with this website because it really never gets old and is just a lot of fun!

B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is the best alarm I have ever had I can set a different time for everyone in my house or for different days of the week it never fails in less I forget to set it that only happened once
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is the best app ever! I played this app for hours on end. This is the best app if you like towns or SIM city. This is my favorite app of all the apps I have so far. The only downfall of it is you only get one city. But still I recommended this app.
B00B2166BS|4.0|I just got one. I plug one in to my original wall charger and the other into the tablet. I get nothing. The battery indicator screen says \\"not charging.\\" Guess I will send this back. So far a waste of time.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Finally got a replacement and it works great. I wish the magnet was just a tad stronger, but it is very usable. I recommend this over the usb charging cable that comes with the Nexus 10. The pogo is much easier to plug in and out.
B008220C38|5.0|I loved this adaptation! Setting it so it feels like it is on a stage is such an interesting way to film it.
1451629184|5.0|This book carried me through an incredible story. My heart was with Jaycee for every word of it. I am so glad that she wrote and shared with us all what it was like to live through the ordeal that she did. She is a remarkable young woman for making the best of a horrible situation. May God continue to lead her and bless her and heal her.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome, its the first app I got so I didn't need another one for a long time. The best thing about this app in my opinion is that the game never ends so you can go on and on. I recommended this app for all ages and espesaly if you just got a kindle or iPad or whatever, but yeah its great.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Heard the one song last year on the TV. Thought it was great!! The group is awsome!! Could not wait till the album came out but it was well worth the wait!

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I think my title sums it up. It is a good app. The graphics are nice and the puzzles are good. If you like bejeweled you will love this one.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This series is seriously addicting. Once you start watching you just can't stop! The plot line always keeps me guessing. Michael C. Hall is captivating. It's a show worth owning and I'd recommend not only the series but the books as well.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|For me, The Racketeer had the same drama and intrigue as The Firm and The Pelican Brief.  I couldn't wait to find out what happened next, but didn't want the book to end. Grisham is the only author that can keep me spellbound with narrative and little dialogue. A Grisham book wouldn't be complete without an implied, at the least, protest of some inequity or abuse and this book is true to that form.<br /><br />As for the book being unrealistic in some ways, who cares? It's fiction and artistic license doesn't take away from the suspense and fun of this book.<br /><br />I'll admit it, I love John Grisham's books, even if they cause me at least a couple of sleepless nights because I can't wait for what comes next.<br /><br />The Racketeer would make a great movie.
B002RSQGQK|3.0|If you like older classica and Alfred Hitchcock movies<br />this is for you. At the time it was a very suspencful movie<br />and still is.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|It's a well executed game crossover, with nice touches from both sources, the Angry Birds mechanics and the Star Wars chapter 4th, story telling
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie has a great story and well placed actors. They're all amazing and the fantasy mixed with reality pulls you in.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really loved this book. I'm a busy mom with very little time to read and my kids and I have been sick during the time I was reading it. I didn't feel like doing anything, but this book was so hard to put down my tired eyes made an exception. I read this book over the course of less than a week despite my crazy schedule. Each chapter takes place at a different time in the past or present. Yes it's back and forth each one, but that's what makes it so hard to put down. Just when you're ending one chapter, there's more information waiting for you to get to. But first you have to be in a different timeframe for the next chapter, and just as you get caught up in what they will find in that chapter, it ends and you're back to the time frame you were in two chapters before! But you're happy because you were dying to see what was going to happen next when that time frame's chapter ended. I would definitely recommend reading this book. It takes you back to how things were during WWII, which is of great interest to me, but from a civilian perspective.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Failed as a movie I think Bruce Willis should have<br />turned this down and walked away before it got<br />off the ground.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Having long been an avid reader of neurology and self-help books, this title definitely intrigued me.  It is written well and in easily understood common language.  It utilizes appropriate examples to support and further explain concepts.<br /><br />If, after completing the book, you don't have an immense desire to begin changing your habits, then I can only think that electroshock therapy might be for you.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|This series is seriously addicting. Once you start watching you just can't stop! The plot line always keeps me guessing. Michael C. Hall is captivating. It's a show worth owning and I'd recommend not only the series but the books as well.
1401937519|5.0|This is a milestone. Not related to a organized religion, this will help anyone in their spiritual search. One book that does not muddy the water more.
B009KHCT94|1.0|Iron Sky.<br /><br />Bad acting, Bad story line what more can i say. this should have been<br />thrown away before it got started.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is such a great movie and fills in some of the blanks for the people who were not readers of the books when they were a kid. Richard Armitage is GREAT as the head warrior hobbit and even shows talents not previously seen by him. LOVED this mnovie.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie is for just about anyone. It'll give you a laugh and is cute for the kids too. I'd recommend it to anyone
B000002AGN|5.0|Landmark music. The first 5/4 time jazz that hit the mainstream with Take Five. Paul Desmond's Sax has that sound.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have just finished the complete hunger game trilogy. These have to be three of the best books I have read. I believe they even beat twilight
B004I744AS|5.0|This does exactly what I need it to do. It has come in really handy when I'm stuck on certain words when studying my Bible and such. :)
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This series is seriously addicting. Once you start watching you just can't stop! The plot line always keeps me guessing. Michael C. Hall is captivating. It's a show worth owning and I'd recommend not only the series but the books as well.
B0000549B0|5.0|The movie arrived on time in perfect condition.  This is a classic that I will cherish for years.  It is so amusing how Jimmy Stewart makes &#34;Harvey&#34; so real.
B008P9M614|5.0|It was a great purchase because I love House and I like how the case organizes the dvds.<br />I think that it does not compare with the individual episodes.<br />Thanks Amazon
1468179993|4.0|Fantastic read that really helped me as I prepare for my first TEDx next month! Even as an experienced speaker, this quick and informative read helped me clarify and organize my thoughts. I know I'll be better than I would have without it. Thanks. Highly recommended for any speaker
B001QOGYFO|5.0|I think anything Kate Beckinsale decide to act in she dois the best actiong job she can.  I also like her in Underwold series.
0762439009|5.0|This is a great little toy to have for true fans of this ultimate king of cult films. I get to just sit here and finish my coffee, the mouse pad/rug really tied my desk together and I had my toe.  I did get the toe that was in the collection but, like and idiot, let my 2 year old neice play with it.  so now I gotta go find Walter to help me get a toe. My Dude patch is properly secured to my bowling shirt (thanks mom) and I have my Little Lebowski achievment certificate.  I also would recomend people who get this to go to the church of Dudeisim website and be obtained a priest in the church.  Help the cause.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I found the series to be quite predictable. They were indeed good entertainment but I would have liked more in an ending.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Very good story about solving 40yr. old murder. Anyone who loves mystery and suspense will love this movie. This movie is very graphic(which did not bother me in the least).
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|It's a good picture, beautiful visuals and merits more than one viewing. The allegory, be it spiritual or illusory, felt a little underdeveloped, or perhaps it will make more sense to me later on. Being a sincere fan of Ang Lee's oeuvre, I was already inclined to favor this movie beforehand - and more so after it didn't turn stupid or fall apart in the third act, like too many epic films by big name directors. However, I still enjoyed those other movies, mostly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple yet able to more complex problems with pi, square roots etc. Love it on my kindle...nice and big and not sluggish.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|This is my first of AKG headphones after owning Grado, Sennheiser, Audio Technica, Pioneer and Ultrasone. And I am impressed! The build quality and sound makes puts this in the same league as the very popular and highly regarded [[ASIN:B000G3LCQC Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone]]. Right out of the box these sound wonderful with no sharp treble or muddy mids issues. I own the older version of the SR80i and these AKGs are better built and just as comfortable or even more so. You want to hear all the music you are missing with iBuds or cheap headphones? These would be a great first step into better sounding headphones.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This movie is a prequel to the Alien movies. Story was very good and special effects were awesome. I would recommend to any sci-fi fans.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I couldn't put this down when I started reading.  The language of the story is well written and compelling.  The novel deals with something that is very scary, but it is told in a way that shows the tenderness and strength between the mother and son.  I think it is very honest, never felt sappy or forced. I think there have definitely been more powerful books written, but this was a great story and well told.  I read this on an airplane and couldn't put it down for a second, made the trip fly by!
B00B99KJR0|3.0|It's a very fun game. I gave it 3 stars because the game keeps closing in mid game on me. I am glad I got this game for the free app because I would be upset if I paid $5 for an app to crash on me. :(
B0080R7Q70|4.0|My first listen to the Flower Kings was good. The more I listen to this CD, the better it gets - like all symphonic progressive rock.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book gets a 5 becasue you will not be able to put it down. It is very intriguing and racy.
1592407889|5.0|I love books that expose people whose public facade is quite different than how they are in private. And so it goes with Shirley. Sadly, MacLaine was a mother, who, like most Hollywood stars, wasnt fit for the job. She palms off her daughter on her overseas hubby who is another piece of work. How Sachi survived all this, and became a level headed person is a mystery, but somehow she did. And more power to her. Despite what some of the unfavorable reviews on here say (die hard Shirley fans, no doubt) this is not a hatchet job. Sachi spent most of her life without a mother (or father) who often didnt even know where she was. It's a heartbreaking story, but full of interesting twists and humorous tales, well written and insightful. Miserly, narcissistic and so jealous her daughter might upstage her in the acting realm that she sabotages her career whenever she gets a chance, Shirley pales in comparison to Sachi's father (who may or not be her real father) a sleazy, violent con artist who remains a mystery even after the story ends. Sachi spent most of her life on her own fending for herself all over the globe. The stories of her travels are quite interesting. While it shares some similarities to \\"Mommy, Dearest\\" and there are some mind boggling revelations, this is quite a different tale. Sachi never had a Hollywood life, but its a strange tale nonetheless. The book is partly about Shirley, but mostly about Sachi. With and Without in the title is the key. She writes about the good and the bad, and in the end is forgiving. Something I'm sure Shirley will never be...Great book!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This one didn't have the same flow other of his books have, for that reason I'm glad I didn't plan to read it on a flight.  But basically it was enjoyable.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|David Bowie is a genius; I will not add to what others are writing about the musical content of his album. Instead, I will complain about two specific problems with this product.<br /><br />1) The packaging was incredibly bad. I sent the album to my mother, who, after opening the jewel case that the CD was shipped in, was unable to remove the CD. My father tried to help, but eventually had to destroy part of the jewel case using a screwdriver to free the CD. My parents have plenty of experience with CDs and I am sure the problem would have stumped me as well.<br /><br />2) I ordered the more expensive version of this product in order to get the MP3s as well as the CD. I didn't realize until after the CD was shipped and received that the MP3s were not available if the product was ordered as a gift! Upon selecting the gift option, why was I not warned automatically that this was the case? I am annoyed with Amazon for such misleading advertising.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I give this book a 5 because it is the first book I have read in a while that I could literally not put down. It is very racy, but so intriguing. I would recommend this book for sure!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is awesome!!! With great graphics, and cool extra items.  Once you get the black suit, you get stronger and look way cooler, and after you buy the black suit get a camera and take a few pics (in-game camera)!!! Controls get a little bit to get use to, but still very good!  Great game!!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I flew through the entire first season over a weekend, and pre-ordered the second, which also was watched in its entirety in two days. Compelling story line, well-acted characters, and plenty of intrigue to keep viewers interested. Highly recommended.
B00A4TKDKY|1.0|Ok... I've got 20 or so Buddy Guy CDs... stretching all the way back.... and I've seen him three times.  The first time he was really good, that was in 1994 or so.  The second two times? Well this CD describes it perfectly.  Start, but don't finish a song.  I don't think I've ever heard him play more than the very intro of \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return), but they list it as a track, as they do \\"Strange Brew\\" which he plays a few bars of.  Be a showman with the crowd as far as talk and response goes, but don't play music.  I won't ever pay to see Buddy Guy again, and I won't ever buy another live CD of his again.  It's fallen into the same old schtick.  In fact, his best stuff in my opinion is the late 70's, early 80's stuff.<br /><br />Maybe he has paid his dues and can do whatever he damn well chooses, but I've heard enough of this kind of Buddy Guy to last the rest of my life, and I've paid my dues to earn my $$$, so there won't be anymore going to buy Guy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the whole trilogy of these books. They are amazing and I would recommend them for sure. You will not be able to put them down.
B009K6GLM6|1.0|It's worth pointing out to those not familiar with Johnny Hodges's oeuvre that \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" is available on a Lonehill CD with a far better coupling - \\"Buenos Aires Blues\\" - with Lalo Shifrin as his partner.<br /><br />And that \\"Sandy's Gone\\" has to be the worst LP Johnny even made. Note nearly all tracks are only 2 minutes long.  But for the curious 3 of \\"Sandy's\\" tracks are available on a far better investment - a Lonehill 2 CD set containing 2 great Victor albums he made with Wild Bill Davis. 5 tracks from another Davis outing \\"Blue Notes\\" and 8 tracks from \\"Blue Pyramid\\" - one of his less frequent solo LP's from the mid-60's.<br /><br />My real recomendation is to purchase all 6 of Lonehill's Hodges CD's. Each one filled to the max with every track he made with Wild Bill.  Johnny Hodges in his prime and in far better sound than on his prolific but rather uneven 50's Verve output.  Hopefully my reviews of all 5 Lonehill issues are still posted on Amazon.
B00005JM02|5.0|this is one of my granddaughter's favorite movies. i would recommend it to anyone. it's cute and has a nice moral to it.
1616550414|5.0|I am a fan of the Link & Zelda Franchise that has been going on for quite sometime (aka NINTENDO). Although most titles came out before I was born I still grew to love the classics. This book brings you in depth into the various worlds of Link and his adventures. Every zelda game known to man is in this book. Great visuals and awesome design insight on how the worlds, creatures, and characters were made.<br /><br />I very much recommend this book to gamers, zelda fans, and even artist or non-artist who appreciate artistic design and concept views on how things came about.<br /><br />The shipping was very fast, it came two days before the actual delivery date.<br />The book was in perfect condition.
157330087X|5.0|THIS I S A  WONDERFUL TRIBUTE TO STEVIE RAY VAUGHN . THIS HAS GREAT ARTIST DOING THE TRACKS I LOVE THE VERSION OF TICK TOCK ON THIS DISK. IT HAS A GREAT 5.1 AND 2.0 SOUND TRACK. IF YOU A FAN OF STEVIE RAY VAUGHN OR THE BLUES BUY THIS DVD.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I rarely criticize writers and books, but this book really does not deserve a good review. Although it was clear from the very beginning that the book was poorly written, I suffered through it hoping it will get better, eventually. It never did. The vocabulary is limited; there are occasional spelling errors (foul instead of fowl, for example); the characters are unidimenstional; the author sometimes forgets previously written narrative, so the main character, for example, experiences his first hangover twice; emotionally, the book is unbelievably simplistic; the book is written in fits and starts, and feels more like a recipe for some video game than a well-developed story. In my estimate, it is a waste of time unless the author goes back to it and spends some serious time rewriting the text and creating a story worth time and effort of reading it. The only redeeming quality is that the plot shows some promise, but that is simply not enough to recommend this book to anyone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm definitely not one to read science fiction but this  is one  of the best books I've ever read!!!!!  Love  Love  Love
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Sad its book3! Such a great trioogy! Book 3 is by far my favorite! May have to start back at book 1 :)
B004XZR63M|3.0|This book is all about changing your perspective on money and how you handle it.  The style is in very simple language that makes it easy to understand.  But it could be a little more specific in some areas.  This seems to be deliberate on the part of the author.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Although confusing in the beginning, Nesbo does a wonderful job of drawing you into the thriller. The story unfolds as it might to the hero - slowly and in pieces.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|This was a good sci-fi movie!  The characters were good,too! Good story line! Would recommend this movie to my family & friends!
1423151054|5.0|beautiful artwork and drawings by the masters of animation.  I like the packaging, and the size of the books makes it easy to flip.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Some of the setting elements are a little dated, but still a very good read.  Card's style is quick and to the point very reminiscent of Hemmingway.
0307591549|5.0|As a person who never buys into self help books, this one is amazing! Highly recommended, so much so I actually had the audiobook but bough this to take notes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|even though I have never played minecraft before, I still say it's a great game because I have seen my friends on this app, &amp; they have the BEST time playing on it.  watch out 4 creepers, though.  this is actually Kim H. rating this.
B007M45PMU|4.0|To start off, I'd like to admit that I'm not into folk music.  Granted, when I was a kid, I did like Peter, Paul, and Mary.  But, that was the 70's (yes, I know I'm admitting my age).  I'm more into Rock and Alternative.  And like most people, I was turned on to the Lumineers' 'Ho Hey' from that Bing commercial.  That said, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually do like it.  Of course, I have to give credit to Amazon for bringing the price of the MP3 album down to $3.99.  I may never have bought it if wasn't that low.  I'm more of a CD buyer, because I like idea of a &#34;collection.&#34;  But that price made this album my first digital only music purchase.  That's how much I liked 'Ho Hey'.<br /><br />So now that I bought entire album, I listened to it on Amazon's cloud player.  And, I was surprised I liked it as much as I do. The whole album is quite enjoyable.  Yes, the stand out song is 'Ho Hey', but as much as I listen to that song, I find myself equally drawn to 'Submarines' with its upbeat warm feeling.  Kind of gives me that warm feeling of being wrapped up in a blanket on a cold morning.  Another song worth mentioning is 'Stubborn Love' with its haunting cello.  While I do think it's somewhat of a sad sounding song, it somehow keeps drawing me in.<br /><br />So, I'm sure you're asking yourself, if I liked this album so much, why did give it only 4 stars?  As pleasant as the album is, a lot of it sounds alike.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's just not my thing.  Bands and artists that keep me buying their CD's have some variety in the album.  Of course, I'm sure the die-hard Lumineers fans will say I don't know what I'm talking about, because that's their style.  And, I'm not going to argue.  Because they do what they do very well.  And, I'm looking forward to their next album.<br /><br />To sum up, as a whole, the album is quite an enjoyable listen.  So, if you're on the fence, I say buying the album is worth it.  In my opinion, if I had just bought one song, namely 'Ho Hey', I would have cheated myself out of an entire listening experience.  And that would have definitely been a shame.
0143115014|4.0|Turin and Sanchez' tastes are a little more mature than mine, judging by the sampling of the fragrances I've sampled based on their recommendations. Nevertheless, the book is an accesible, fun read, and offers a baseline entry point into fragrance that I really couldn't get anywhere else in hard copy. Worksks very well in tandem with fragrance review websites.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Afleck, but I liked him in this movie as a director and actor.<br /><br />The pace was good, the story intriguing and smart.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I especially like how this one will let you replay a level until you're satisfied. One problem I have is the size of the download.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Too much fantasy without any material. Maybe teenage boys may think it is cool. It is a test of patience. Special effects may be nice but again I would not waste my time again. As a video game it may be a nice concept though.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I was disappointed in the turn of events but this book was great all in all. Please read the Maze Runner series first.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Lots of action, so-so plot, trying too hard.  It's time to retire the MI series.  It's a good movie if you want some brainless action with lots of gadgets.

B008FRFN7A|1.0|I haven't been able to figure this one out and be able to use it yet. I followed the instruction and have not been able to get anything to print from my HD Kindle to wireless Epson printer. I can't discover where the problem is so this is a waste of space. It isn't very good when you can't print a picture or a recipe off of your device.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I use the Scarlett 2i2 on two separate computers.  One is a Toshiba laptop with Windows 8.  The other is a dual boot desktop, running both Windows 7 and Mac 10.5.  With Windows, I use Mixcraft 6 Pro Studio.  On the Mac, I use Garageband.<br /><br />My two primary microphones are the Rode NT1 (requiring phantom power), a Sennheiser e855 (dynamic), and a Sennheiser e906 (dynamic).  Most often, I use the 2i2 for tracking guitars (acoustic and electric) and vocals.<br /><br />First, let me say this unit does a fantastic job in capturing a high quality audio signal.  Vocals and guitars sound stunning.  If you have high quality equipment running into the 2i2, there's no reason why you should not be able to capture a completely professional sound.  I am also very impressed with the extremely low level of latency I have been able to achieve.<br /><br />There is one thing that I should mention.  If your tracks contain periodic clicks and pops, you might need to increase the number of buffers.  Normally, unless it's a huge project, leaving the setting at 3ms (I use 24bit, 44.1 kHz) takes care of the problem.<br /><br />The second issue, and one that has been discussed in other reviews, is the driver.  About 3 months after installing the driver, I started having major problems.  The recording software would completely freeze up.  Sometimes this would happen while trying to record and, other times, while listening to pre-recorded tracks.  I thought something was wrong with my computer or the software.  However, the software performed flawlessly when I selected any of the other drivers.  After uninstalling and reinstalling the Focusrite driver, everything worked properly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, based on my experience, I've just come to expect that the drivers will malfunction every 2-3 months.  For this reason, I keep a copy of the driver file saved in my download folder, just so I'm prepared.  It's an inconvenience, but it's something I can live with.<br /><br />In summary,the Scarlett 2i2 if a fantastic unit capable of capturing professional sounding audio with extremely low latency.  My rating is based upon the unit itself.  Hopefully, Focusrite will be able to correct the issues with the drivers.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|They get you to buy the app and then your child plays it and keeps getting billed for $4.99 for playing it. Amazon is a ripp off this should be banned
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I played previous hungry shark games! But this one is VERY fun nice upgrade from the past Hungry Sharks I will definitely be playing this game for a while!!
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. However, I think just as much attention could have been given to the military side of the operation as to the CIA portion. Understanding of course, that the CIA portion was a longer period of time. I just think there was an unfair balance where we came to know the CIA analysts well, even up to how they socialized. And as this is a movie of somewhat historical proportions, with historical figures, it would have been nice to have seen a more Leon Paneta looking actor play that role, instead of Tony Soprano.<br /><br />Apparently, there was some rehearsal raids before the actual raid, in a 'kill house' based on the available information about the compound dwelling. This could have been depicted. Also, the chit chat en route to the compound never happened and should not have been added. I think the tension that could have been brought to the scene, traditionally known as the 'pregnant pause' was lost with the back and forth banter. But overall, a good thriller BASED on true events.<br /><br />As a critique of the actual DVD itself, the flight and arrival to the compound was very dark, but worked okay in a darked theatre. However, for home viewing, I find it difficult to see the images even in a darkened room. I think those parts could have been lightened for home viewing.<br /><br />Oh, and before some adolescente troll/genius tells me I should adjust the brightness control on my TV, sufficed to say genius, I tried that already. But thanks anyway.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This series is obviously centered around the Historical Ragnar Lodbrok and is exceptionally well researched and filmed. As a child, when other kids were being read, well, whatever the hell normal American families read to their kids, I was getting Odin and Thor, Tyr and Loki, Heimdall, Frigg, Freyr and all the rest. I also learned about the real life Heros, among them, King Ragnar. As someone who is VERY familiar with these stories, I have to say Vikings is EXCEPTIONALLY well done

B006P0FICE|1.0|This movie had nothing to offer - sub-par story and sub-par acting with absolutely no chemistry between the characters. The movie also suffers from bad editing that jumps between gags / one liners in attempt to be clever and hip, but that just feel out of place for the period and honestly aren't funny.  I should have stopped 15 minutes into the movie when D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) tries to use the \\"apologize to my mule\\" bit from the classic Clint Eastwood movie A Fistful of Dollars.  Don't waste your time on this movie - you're much better off watching THE THREE MUSKETEERS and THE FOUR MUSKETEERS with Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlin, Charlton Heston, Faye Dunaway, and Christopher Lee.
B003XU02QG|2.0|This review contains MINOR SPOILERS. The biggest problem in the logic with this movie is that it asks you to empathize with the Romans, after establishing that they are the imperialist invaders, crushing the native Picts by any means necessary, and delighting in their torment. At one point, they even murder a child, and you're STILL supposed to empathize with them. One of the primary \\"villains\\" of this movie is a woman who was brutalized, had her tongue cut out, and watched her family get murdered before her. Yet, she's not the character that the filmmaker chooses to create empathy with- nope, he chooses the Roman who's trying to escape her justice.<br /><br />It's also hard to lose yourself in the movie when there are jarring inconsistencies that were included either as an appeal to juvenile sensibilities, or as the result of some writing that's so lazy it borders on the incomprehensible. As an example of the former problem, every woman who appears in \\"Centurion\\" looks like a supermodel who just waltzed out of a dressing room where she was pampered by professional hair dressers and makeup artists. I don't know about you, but I find this pretty amusing, when the women in question are barbarian-hunters riding around on horseback, or an exiled witch living out in the middle of the woods. This glaring contrast takes me out of the fiction that has been created on screen, and makes me consider what was going on in the director's head as he issued his orders to the wardrobe department.<br /><br />As an example of the latter problem (lazy writing), there is one scene that is so absurd, it completely takes you out of the movie. It is established that the Pict tracker has such advanced abilities that she can detect the presence of her quarry a quarter mile away, simply because she's downwind from them. That's a bit silly, but I'm okay with that. What makes it absurd is that just a few minutes later, she walks into a small hut where all three of the men she is tracking are hiding. Yet, despite the fact that they are only a few feet away, she cannot detect them. Never mind the fact that they had only a couple of minutes to hide, and they're sweating profusely and bleeding all over the place- nope, our superhuman tracker is completely baffled. What's the explanation? It's simple- the producers painted themselves into a corner and they were too lazy to create a feasible solution.<br /><br />On the positive side, this movie does contain some great geography, striking cinematography, and good choreography (although the gore is over the top, and again directed at juvenile sensibilites).ding. Yet, despite the fact that they are only a few feet away, she cannot detect them.

It's simple- the producers painted themselves into a corner and they were too lazy to create a feasible solution.<br /><br />On the positive side, this movie does contain some great geography, striking cinematography, and good choreography (although the gore is over the top, and again directed at juvenile sensibilites).
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Nice read .....lots of romance mixed with breakups and make :.  Would read again.ii. now on to the next book
B00B99KJR0|1.0|This looks like a good game but an error code kept coming up when I tried to install it. I finally gave up and deleted it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Too much description of who was in attendance with too much descrptionn of what they wore...we don't need the namesbifveveryone...distracts from the thrust of the story.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|stories are good; amazon streaming is terrible- blurry, cuts off and on.  My daughter and I have enjoyed watching.  Amazon, invest in quality streaming!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Love the features. I have not but it down since I started playing. I now want more games like it.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Nothing more to say than this is another superb CD from Andrea!!!!! Music is great, he is one talented entertainer!
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|My kids really enjoy this one.  The TV series that follows this is fun to watch also.  The storyline is exciting and has a lot of people / ships / robots that my kids are familiar with from the Lego Star Wars games.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great improvement over the original. smooth and addicting. only problem is I wish there was another feature that kicked in to make more difficult like the cart.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|This may be the best game ever, but I'll never know because it will not download from the cloud to my device.  I have tried several times and it always fails.  The kindle froze during one attempt.  Glad it was free.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I don't review often, but this is a good pick up. Quick learning curve, nice look, nice feel. Great on the go game.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I cried several times while reading this book because I felt like the characters were real people I knew. They also felt very original and unlike many other YA characters I've encountered. Excellent writing quality, too. Will definitely be reading more by this author.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|So much fun!!!!!!! Soooo many big BABIES leaving whiney bitchy reviews because they don't know how to play, can't control it, don't get enough coins, can't find checkpoints, bitch, bitch, bitch, whine, whine, whine. Instant gratification it does not provide. It's super fun and visually intriguing so just have fun, upgrade your powerups when you can. Get used to your car ALL over again every time you upgrade and feel free to groan about it. I do :) A good game isn't instantly beatable and keeps you going back. Well done, Vector!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Keeps one's attention, but clearly the work of a feminist author focusing on young lady readers.  Nevertheless, the theme is an interesting concept.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|3 Devices, 6 downloads, 0 installs<br /><br />The game looks great in the images but unfortunately like others I have been unsuccessful at installing it on any android device.<br /><br />Will update the review if they ever fix the problems.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />------<br /><br />The game is now working and was all I hoped. It is colourful and has presented a perfect platform to introduce countries other than the USA to my children. Plus it is fun to play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love it it teaches me how to care for a horse!!!and my mom is going to let me get a horse!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It totally took me for surprise and kept me hanging on! The ingenuity is unbelievably innovative and outsmarted me at every turn!
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|This was a horrible, disjointed, poorly acted and predictable yawner.  I had hoped for something worth watching and got another worthless piece of Hollywood carp instead.  Avoid.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Like the willfully annoying cover art, David Bowie continues confounding his audience with his first album in 10 years. \\"The Next Day\\" finds the former recluse coming out with a bang, teasing with samples from his storied past. There are touches of \\"Heroes\\" here, along with \\"Station To Station\\" and a few of the stronger moments of the underrated \\"Hours.\\" And he can't seem to stay away from the space thing, with the best song on the album being the mesmerizing \\"The Stars Are Out Tonight.\\"<br /><br />Or, for that matter, the minor odyssey of \\"Dancing in Outer Space.\\" Which is one of the songs he actually sings on. Many of the songs are barked in a staccato fire method, including the blasting opener of the title song. Bowie is not edging into is older years quietly, but still challenging his own work. The anger in the war protest \\"I'd Rather Be High\\" contrasts to the weird doo-wop of \\"How Does The Grass Grow?\\" Finally, there's the mysterious closer, \\"Heat,\\" which floats on a muted guitar and ominous cushion of electronics as Bowie murmurs a lyric whose odd reveal is \\"My father ran the prison\\" and \\"I tell myself I don't know who I am.\\" Musical chameleon that he's always been, David Bowie is still, pushing 70, happy to play around with the perception of who we think he is.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks, the instrumental \\"Plan\\" is a dud. Why \\"So She\\" missed the cut is odd, as it has one of the prettier melodies on \\"The Next Day.\\" The same speculation could be applied to \\"I'll Take You There,\\" which rocks more than most of the album. You might as well buy the deluxe version as two of the three bonus cuts rival anything on the proper disc.
B008VO3PA4|3.0|I don't think I've ever described a book as cute before, but this one is cute.  Easy read and some funny insights into the feline mind.  On that note, I think I need to give my furry friend a treat.  Enjoy!
B004DM0UII|5.0|Just have a hard time deciding which station to listen to the most!!! Love all the gospel music  options since that is my preference and the Lord is being Glorified in it. Thank you all for sharing the gospel WORD!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book captures your imagination and tells a story of magic unlike most magic stories.<br />It's so well written that you just can't put it down without reading just one more page.<br />Highly recommended.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|My teens and I can watch it again and again and again!  It's a decent program that doesn't take itself too seriously, unlike its parent program, SG-1.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|This book was recommended to me because I love Chuck Palhaniuk and I understand why. It's a pretty similar style of prose, and some of the the plots of each chapter are quite alike. But this book was a little too confusing. For most of it, I felt like I needed to go back and look up what had just happened. There are a lot of characters and the chapters aren't chronological so you get a little lost while you're reading. I had to look up the chronological order of it after I was done. However, I really enjoyed the basic premise and enjoyed it. I'll read more by this author.
B0091LS07E|2.0|This was not one of her best. I have all of her other albums. This one to me was the worst. I hope here next one os slamming. I really like her music. Not this one.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I saw the movie in IMAX 3D with the special 48 fps version and found it to have the soap opera look, i.e., like it was filmed with a camcorder.  There was no theatrical feel of atmosphere and depth but instead it was jerky and awkward.  The movement of the actors felt rushed and lacking in fluidity and made for some scenes with Bilbo that looked like they should have had another cut.  Assuming there is any hope for this fast format at all, I wonder if they aren't properly treating the film in the post processing side of things perhaps because they are releasing so many formats that the 48 fps version is an afterthought and not given its due. But i'm skeptical.<br /><br />In any case, for me the soap opera feel made it hard to enjoy any part of the film.  And it has nothing to do with having experience playing computer games or anything else.  I grew up and play to this day computer games.  I know all about and enjoy them and the benefits of high frame rates that make for fast smooth movement.  Films are not computer games.  I think some people are more sensitive to this and some aren't, judging by the comments here.  On my 60\\" Elite LED TV, i have certain filters turned off so ever blu-ray i watch doesn't have this super clean camcorder look.  Needless to say it was disappointing to see PJ usher in an era (possibly) where the theater will suffer this problem for me and many others.  Hopefully we'll be given a choice about which version of a release we can watch.<br /><br />Beyond that issue, I also felt the movie was way to long which is a severe problem Peter Jackson has, judging by the monstrosity King Kong turned out to be and now The Hobbit (one small book turned into a sprawling trilogy).  PJ really is guilty of, creatively speaking, the sin of gluttony.  Movies are supposed to be concise productions with every moment distilled to its essence.  Instead, this movie is an orgy of self indulgence and fabrication.  Sadly some people do not handle the creative freedom of success and become undisciplined.  Instead of focusing on Tolkien's story and realizing it faithfully it's now Peter Jackson's story and never mind the source.  In movies and many creative endeavors, less is more.<br /><br />In any case it is what it is and I intend to next view the standard theatrical edition Blu-ray and it should not have the soap opera look.  I will finally be able to experience the movie properly and have a better experience.  I'll update this review after purchasing the extended edition (better value that includes both versions).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Been using this app February 24th and let me just say I love this app.  It does what it is suppose to do. I hate having to go through strings to find out how much battery I have left on my Kindle Fire Touch HD.  I like the fact that the app tells you when you battery needs to be charged.  I use it to tell me when my Kindle needs to be charge and to tell me when it's finished and I have a full battery.  This is a must get app.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The clock is really good. I don't know how to access where it tells u the weather but it's still good. It wakes me up each morning which is saying something cuz I'm a deep sleeper.
B007N31YH0|5.0|So much fun to watch, with a great cast! Movies from this era can't be beat. We folks from the 'senior crowd' have seen so many great movies such as this one and wonder how some of the ones produced today can ever make it to theaters!
B005LZYL3G|4.0|This is a great dvd for any Pearl Jam fan, I would recommend to anyone looking for more back story on the band and there history.
1451695195|3.0|The first part of the book was interesting. The last part of the book was too clinical, wanted more story. His rendition of the afterlife was quite different than what I've read before.............a little dark.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Darn good read. Excitement, suspense, hopelessness and hopeful. Really enjoyed it,  can't  wait to read the next instalment.  Recommend it.
B000026C3T|4.0|I purchase these new releases for the novelty of hearing the songs in a different arrangement, ie, different order.  In this case, there was not much creativity put into the ordering of the songs; but the digital sound is nice.  There is absolutely nothing inside the casing to tell you the story behind this release, however, which is disappointing.  It's just another of the many Led Zep re-releases.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Compelling story based on true events that reflected a world in which our steadfast friends (Canada) still enjoyed our loyalty. Not to mention great acting and direction. Loved it.
1592407889|3.0|The book is good so far but it is missing a bunch of pages. Not sure what the deal is or whether to return it in hopes of getting a complete book. At least 20 pages are missing.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Apparently, a common problem is downloading and installing this app on a Kindle Fire. It worked perfectly on mine. I haven't played much of the game yet, but so far I'm liking it.
B0095P31L6|1.0|not worth your time.  drags on and on.  very little music and it would not interest any child.  it is not funny and it makes you want to call up the writer and ask them if they even have kids or understand how long they could hold a child's attention with this boring movie; probably not even for two minutes.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|My toddlers love this movie. Anytime its played, they have to watch the entire DVD, (including the special features.) My son's wish that the train sequence was longer, (but that could be said for the whole movie!)
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|How is it possible to review a film like this? I cry every time I watch the movie and I don't think that will ever change. Content of the film aside, the blu ray transfer is AMAZING. I didn't think it was possible to get this level of detail in a 20 year old (mostly) black and white film, but I was surprised. Sound and picture are perfect and it's light years better looking than the original DVD release. I'm so happy this film has been restored so it can remain a reminder or the atrocities that happened in World War 2.  Never again!<br /><br />I recommend ditching your dvd copy and replacing with this ASAP.<br />Also, the feature length documentary is riveting and a must see.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but I wish you could tame wolves, make buckets to collect lava, and make better clothing. Also I wish you could teleport to people in your server so they do not have to find you and your creations. Otherwise I love this app because the baby animals are so cute, you can make houses almost everywhere in creative mode, and you can fight creepers, spiders, and the skeletons. Also I just found out skeletons can shoo through the holes in the door. ^_^
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|A very poor viewing experience -- frequently blurry and fuzzy.  Something to do with the FPS experimentation?  In any event, it looks odd -- colors over-exaggerated and then the constant blurring.  Almost unwatchable.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|This game was so much fun, I almost had the great white shark then when I went on today, ALL of my progress was completely erased, it has me all the way at the reef shark,  absolutely no way to get anything back &amp; I am very disappointed especially since I've seen that I am not the only person  to experience this &amp; no attempt has been made by the makers of this game to get this bug fixed.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My son loves temple run 2 game. he plays it every day after school. I also love this game too.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|It was a lot different than Phantom and not what I expected but I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />Thank You!
B005Q1W10A|3.0|even though it is brand new, there are parts that either get stuck or it skips just a little bit. Very frustrating, especially since it was supposedly brand new!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like these games. I played the first one and then decided to get the second. Glad I did. the only problem is that at the end it got stuck so my score isn't going up so I am not leveling up, but all in all I really enjoy this game. Easy to play and helps you ignore any annoying person in the house:)
B00B23O96A|1.0|My goodness. This is one of the worst albums I've ever wasted my money on. I'm a long time Clapton fan, and I'm so disappointed. Now I know why there were no sound samples when I bought it.<br /><br />The entire album reminded me of your typical band in a Tiki bar on some beach somewhere. Clapton's wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and sandals. Then later, he moves into the lounge to croon All of Me, Goodnight Irene, and Our Love is Here To Stay (I actually started laughing it was so hokey). And there's one with kid's singing backup that sounds like those little people from \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Oh, and those dreadful strings. I couldn't believe it. There's Henry Mancini type strings throughout this pos. You see his picture on the cover? Well, that's exactly what this album sounds like if you get my drift.<br /><br />I thought I'd hear some nice guitar work when he played Gary Moore's Still Got the Blues, but alas, your typical pentatonic noodling. In fact, most, if not all, the short guitar solos are pentatonic crap. Nothing you or I couldn't play (assuming you're a guitarist following E.C.).<br /><br />Seriously, this album is terrible. It wouldn't sell at all if it didn't have Clapton's name on it. Wow, what a waste of my time. I'm gonna give mine to a friend (enemy?) - I don't even want it in my collection. And wait, there's more. There's an advertisement inside for a signed leather bound copy of a book of his guitars that you can buy. OMG, it's over $500. That's not a typo. He better be stopping by my house for dinner and giving me a guitar lesson for that kind of money.<br /><br />You've been warned!

0385349947|2.0|I truly think that she landed in the right scenario and is looking for a cause.  Read the book, just does not come across as authentic, more of a shallow lesson from a tier 2 executive.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|There are basically three games in this app.  That means, when I get tired of one game, I move onto the next.  I could easily waste hours on Jewels Star.  Great app.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love the app keeps my kid happy but wish there was more coins per day because forty is gone in five minutes
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is awesome, really. In my first couple times of trying it out it was kind of hard but once you get the hang of it it's a very fun and addicting game to play.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|I love this movie Tom cruse my first crush ! The DVD is a good copy I love the way it sounds on my system but the movie u can tell is old but over all I recommend it ! It looks good on my 60\\" so that's a plus !!!

0307591549|5.0|Shawn Achor has done all of us a huge favor by writing The Happiness Advantage.  He reveals that happiness propells success.- not the other way around.  The more you increase your happiness the more successful you will become.  Shawn cites hundreds of studies and experiments to support his assertions.  What is most powerful and helpful is that Shawn explains what you can do to positively effect your own level of happiness.  He explains specific activities and habits that a person can engage in that boosts a person's level of happiness.

B000002G0P|5.0|If you are an Extreme fan, or a fan of either Nuno Bettencourt or Gary Cherone, you will enjoy this record. Although not as mainstream radio ready as More than Words from their second album, still an electrifying rock riff with a lot of funk.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|A wonderful app for those times when soft, unobtrusive background sounds are desired. There is a wide range of sounds available. Worth buying.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|this game is adorable, and since it's MLP, I love it. Although, it is very expensive when it comes to buying currency for the game. lock the in-app purchasing, parents!!
B008CYDD7I|5.0|In the traditon of Dead Alive this gross out horror film is full of laugh-out-loud moments. When new student Herbert West developes a formula to re-animate corpses his fellow student Dan Cain has no choice but to go along with his plan until things go horribly wrong. Perfect for any classic horror movie fan.
1616550414|5.0|A must have for any Zelda fan.  Spent so much time reading through this.  It clears up a lot of questions that a fan would have about the series
1455502758|5.0|I never met Christopher Hitchens, but he is my friend. His wit, his irascible tone with bullies, and his contempt for the religious, and his<br />defense of reason are just a few hints at his allure. The greatest and most thought provoking line in the book was when he reflected on someone asking him, \\"I'll be in town next week, will you be around?\\" And Christopher fumbling mentality with the implications of such a question given his condition.<br />Although the book is incomplete and missing his thick commitment to detail, I'll take it. And I'll take with great gratitude these additional pages of fellowship with him that I never expected to get when I read he had passed. If there was ever a reason to hope, even in desperation, that consciousness lives on after the body the reason is Christopher Hitchens. For the thought of such a great emancipator and intellect disappearing into nothingness never to pen another word or be heard from a podium again seems more than tragic to me. It feels unjust, cruel, and immoral. I write this review with a snifter of Johnnie Walker Black at my side.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Talented cast is able to portray the drama without needed the trappings of the set, using dramatic lighting effects in its place.  The bonus material - joining together of 4 &#34;Valjeans&#34; is supremely entertaining.  Must see.  Alfie gets 5 stars!
B0094K1QR8|5.0|Cute movie.  I laughed alot.  Just what a long day needed.  Amazon is the only store to turn to.  Thank you prime :)
B0053O89XI|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my sister.  She's a huge fan of the show.  The shipping package was perfect no damage done to the product itself.  And it being Blu-ray DVD and ultraviolet is perfect for her.
B000068OCS|5.0|The only previous copy of this film that I had was a poor quality air check made on VHS tape back in the '80s.  This remastered, surround-sound version is like getting a fresh update.  This is an essential document of environmentalism, no matter what side of the debate you take; the director, Geoffrey Reggio, explains all that in an excellent bonus feature.  The music is vintage Phillip Glass and matches his finest.
0425252868|5.0|Simply one of the best books I have ever read. It was hard to put down. Read most of it in one setting, it was that good.

B00ADS98FC|5.0|LOVED it, really. Just snarky enough to resemble college--but with funnier and hipper students. And the music is just terrific. I didn't even know I liked acapella. &#34;Right Round&#34; has to be a classic.<br /><br />The characters were really interesting as well. Rebel Wilson has amazing presence and is just trashy enough to bring a real edge to what could be just &#34;chubby girl&#34; humor. And I really enjoyed the small roles by Elizabeth Banks (also a producer--shout out!) and John MIchael HIggins--both truly hilarious.<br /><br />I loved the movie so much I checked out the soundtrack--which was something of a disappointment. It had all the great acapella songs, but none of the other music, and that's a real loss.<br /><br />The movie is highly entertaining, and well worth the money!
B0081HLMD8|5.0|This movie will keep you guessing and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Great acting by all actors.
B00AFZ86D8|5.0|* Original Post March 19, 2013 *<br /><br />Anyone who is reading this, are these remastered or not?  Cannot find any information if they are remastered or not?<br /><br />* UPDATE: Oct 28, 2013 *<br /><br />Purchased this box set and obviously these are not remastered, but I had to purchase anyway because my CD's were lost years ago and I had bad copies of them in the lowest mp3 compressed setting possible.  I consider these some of Lou Reeds BEST albums and if you're a new or old fan you will surely enjoy this box set. New York is the obvious hit CD here and it brings back so many memories for me. It also sounds new to this day! While Songs for Drella and Magic & Loss are my least favorites, this box set is still worth getting for the other 3 CD's. Each CD comes in a miniature vinyl sleeve with no liner notes, but I still recommend this box set for the quantity of music vs price.<br /><br />Rest In Peace Lou: Just found out about your passing today, your music inspired me since the 90's and also inspired my travels! My favorite is obviously the New York album, it reminds me of traveling across this great country and out west. God Bless & Rest In Peace my friend.

B0052AC8C6|5.0|OK, he can be the campiest thing in town, sure. But his character in this animated feast is just dead on. He's neurotic, he's charming, he's a scared baby, and he's a fearless hero. What's not to love here?<br /><br />The animation is terrific as well, and what a great cast. Your kids will love it, and you'll love it just as much.
0547884591|3.0|The book is not meant to be consumed in one sitting. It is more a reference book. Also meant for you to rethink how one does daily task or to embrace the love of learning new things as Tim does. Evident by the books Four Hour Workweek and Four Hour Body.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This book moved a bit slower for me and I felt like we are starting to get lost in characters. I had to start forcing myself to read just to finish the book. It's still overall good and has some great moments, but I feel like the series has started to slide down somewhat.
0817439390|4.0|I chose this book to be my first book for learning photography after I bought my DSLR (Nikon D90). I just entered to the world of photography and everything was new to me. So, when I started reading this book, I found many concepts were explained nicely, and some of the concepts could be explained better.<br /><br />The best chapters I found are Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO.<br />The chapter on LIGHT is ok.<br />To my point of view, the chapters those could be improved were : Flash, 18% Reflectance, White Balance, HDR.<br /><br />Brian explained Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO very good, no complain about it at all. And as these three things contributes to the exposure, the Title for the book made valid judgment. But, he also covered White Balance, Reflective Light-Metering And The 18% Reflectance, HDR, Flash,.. which were not explained well. Again, as this book is already titled 'Understanding Exposure', I should not complain, but I am just giving a little feedback. I really could not get the White Balance concept at all from this book. After some failed attempt to grasp White Balance concept, finally I understood what is White balance from internet blogs. At the end of the book, he covered Flash. I really felt hopeless when I was reading that chapter. I wish I did not attempt to read that 'Flash' chapter at all. He explained Flash in 2-3 pages, that was really overkill for me. I was really struggling to understand why and when I would need Flash, what is the correlation between Photographic Triangle and flash. Later, I bought his book '[[ASIN:0817439560 Understanding Flash Photography: How to Shoot Great Photographs Using Electronic Flash]]' which satisfied me in the fullest. Actually, Flash is a broad concept, it needs a dedicated book, but as a beginner, it was confusing me a lot from his Exposure book's 2-3 page short notes.<br /><br />Brian covered HDR in this book. Same like Flash, HDR is a broad concept which needs more examples and details, maybe a dedicated book. From his writing, as a beginner, I could not make any sense about what is HDR. I got the HDR concept later from reading internet blogs as well.<br /><br />The Chapter on LIGHT was not bad. But I wish the author provided some diagram on what is Front Lighting, what is Back lighting and what is Side Lighting. A diagram is better than thousand words of explaining what is Front Lighting/Back Lighting/Side Lighting. When I read this chapter for the first time, I was confused. After a while when I read some other books and internet blogs, and came back to this book and read the chapter about Light, it made good sense to me. Maybe as an absolute beginner, I found that chapter little bit confusing at the first time. So, I cant say, this chapter was bad. But as I said, some diagrams with pointing how light casts shade from angle could help better for the beginners.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: In order to understand just the 'EXPOSURE', as a beginner, this book could not be better. I am happy that I bought this book.d book. From his writing, as a beginner, I could not make any sense about what is HDR.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Personally this movie scared me way too much, but I bought it for my father for xmas and he loves it! If you enjoy the suspense, things popping out at you, and some neat special effect...it's a good movie. Also, sets up well to tag into the Alien series (as it was meant too). Just a bit too scary for my taste :)

B000J10ER4|1.0|My DVD came scratched and I will never get back the money I used to by it. It really makes me mad because not only did I want to watch the movie but spent hours trying to fix the DVD to my luck nothing fixed it.
1932907009|5.0|I had borrowed this book from a friend and found it useful, so useful I had to have a copy for myself to be able to review section to help improve my fiction writing. I'm not a screen play writer but this book is great for other types of writing too. Check it out and you'll quickly see what I mean about needing your own copy for reference.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The way the book is organized really threw me off at first, but once you get the hang of it, it works well and really helps build the anticipation. It's a bit gritty leaving nothing to the imagination, but overall great book!
B004SEUIWO|5.0|If you love musicals, this is one for you!  Great story, lively music, big celebrities.  Entertaining & fun.  I highly recommend it!
B0033H7VI6|4.0|I checked out this knife on some YouTube reviews and decided to try it out.  Finally got it today after a really long wait.<br /><br />PROS:  The  blade comes out of the box really sharp.  It's about a quarter inch thick and full tang.  The sheath has a small, detachable, pouch for some small survival items.  It has a Choil just forward of the handle for making it easier to use for finer work.  The handling and balance are really good.  For the price it's a nice choice.  I called the manufacturer prior to buying it and found out that they couldn't keep them in stock as they were going out the door faster than the company could keep up.<br /><br />CONS:  A couple of grommets on the top of the sheath for a loop of 550 cord would have been nice.  I'd also like to add some Micarta handles to replace the ones that it has now, but the grip on the current ones is really good.
B000MD9UJC|1.0|Product does not work well at all. First of all it was difficult to put together and once there it leaves much to desire. Spend the extra money and buy a led flashlight and toss the old one.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The second book continues off the wonderful story telling of the first book. We continue to follow characters we love and those we hate.
1594744769|3.0|The author had a rather unique premise for his book...write a semi-gothic novel around a collection of strange antique photographs. The problem is that somewhere in the middle of his story, he seemed to have run out of steam. Frankly, I was both interested (where is the story going?) and bored (Oh, dear God, not ANOTHER photo!). It would have been better if he'd remembered the old adage that less is more. If he'd cut out about a third of the pictures and allowed the reader's imagination to take over, I think it would have been so much better.<br /><br />One irritating detail (of several):  did anyone else notice that the photo for \\"Claire\\" was actually that of a young boy? If the editor had done his/her job, and a little research, he/she would have known that in the past, young boys grew curls like little girls until they reached a certain age. Often, they were even dressed in girl's clothing. The photo clearly was that of a little, long-haired boy dressed in a suit with a bow tie.<br /><br />It wasn't a bad read, but it definitely didn't live up to its potential.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Well plotted novel with good three-dimensional characters and sense of place, keeps you turning the pages with exciting twists of plot.
067942850X|5.0|I read Joh Krakauer's other mountaineering books Into Thin Air ...5 stars and Eiger Dreams 4 stars. I like him as an author, so I bought Into The Wild.<br /><br />Into The Wild is a true story, 209 pages of interesting comment mainly about Chris McCandless a young college graduate who withdrew totally from his parents and a lot of society, gave $25,000 to Charity, dumped his car and headed to the deep wilderness of Alaska. He was looking to find the enjoyment of living off the land with as little outside help as possible. The book reads fast and is a joy to read.<br /><br />Ill give you some tidbits to wet your appetite without ruining the story.<br /><br />Krakauer traces Chris's route through infrequent letters, postcards and interviews with some of the people Chris \\"Alex\\" met. The few friends he made liked young Chris who changed his name to Alex Supertramp. \\"Alex\\" was intelligent, a college grad, an avid book reader who had major ideas of freedom in a wilderness without civilization. He liked authors like Jack London, Thoreau and Tolstoy and authors who liked simple nature without the strangulation of civilization.<br /><br />Many thought \\"Alex' had a death wish to go into deep wilderness Alaska alone and very unprepared with very limited supplies, no heavy guns and little food. He had a big bag of rice and ate native plants, berries and the small game he could get. He does shoot a small moose but much of the meat spoils as he didn't know how to make jerky. Alex was no woodsman and very inexperienced. He becomes trapped and cant get out. Krakauer shows he may have poisoned himself accidently eating the wrong part of the wild potato plant. This alkaloid part would not let his starving body metabolize the limited food he could get. We see poor Chris \\"Alex\\" losing massive amounts of weight and strength. He lasts over 100 days and tries to get help,knows he is dieing, and dies in an old broken down, gutted bus in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />He had no US geological maps and was only 6 miles from a few cabins that may have had some food and 2 miles from a easier wade through a fast running potentially lethal river. Very poor almost no planning.<br /><br />The reader develops empathy for poor Chris \\"Alex\\", his parents, sister and the few friends he meets on his journey. I felt sorry for the young man and could understand his wanting to see the beauty of nature in deep Alaska by himself but not his lack of planning and complete abandoning of his family. INMO the kid had serious issues but was not suicidal.<br /><br />Jon Krakauer  gives his perspective having climbed the difficult Devils Thumb in Alaska. Also about his earlier years as a framing carpenter and comparing his earlier life with young Chris.  Having read about this in another of his books, this part was a little redundant.<br /><br />I won't ruin the sad ending for you. Another great book by Joh Krakauer and proudly added to our family library. 4 1/2 starsical maps and was only 6 miles from a few cabins that may have had some food and 2 miles from a easier wade through a fast running potentially lethal river.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|'<br />I have played many, many 'Build It' games as I call them and MLP beats many of those! The graphics look good and the Ponies are as adorable as ever. Some of the tasks, such as raising a point to having full stars, can be a little tedious and there can sometimes be a bit of a lag during Playing Catch. I really enjoy the building aspect and getting to see all the Ponies running around the town and interacting with each other. It' all very cute!
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I admit I was ravenously hungry for new music from The Voice.  I was not disappointed.  The new material has a fresh inviting sound....very listenable!  I must tell you about my pet peeve with this CD, though.  First, no artist should ever put a song on a CD that you can get on another CD (ala Moody Bluegrass 2).  Second, never re-imagine a song and re-do it when it is perfect to begin with (ala Broken Dream). Third, never confuse a listener by including music which detracts from the CD as a whole (ala the club music at the end of the CD).  I will forgive the repeat of one of the songs because it is so good!  Despite all those violations, the new music trumps, wins and will be what you and I will remember.  The Voice is not through (and may he NEVER be through!).
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I loved all the songs on this CD.  We need more singers with voices as good as hers is. thanks
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Although the author said he looks down on numbers as pertaining to kills, he alludes to his numbers several times.<br />I know he is deceased now, perhaps karma caught up to him, the book will appeal to gun freaks and the uninitiated.<br />I had a problem with his references to Yankees. A typical Texan or southern arrogance, however, his story reveals the deep sense of brotherhood and dedication this group breeds.<br />He was very honest about how his service affected his marriage and family life. He was loyal to his colleagues.<br />Only someone that has walked in his shoes can truly understand  this. He was a brave man.<br />Just my opinion. I earned two combat stars in Viet Nam.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I have this hooked up to my gaming headset on my PC, and it gives just enough extra whallop to really make my headset shine. I'm pairing it with a Steelseries 5H v2, and it really brings out an additional level of depth and sound from my headset. The bass is deeper, the sound is richer and everything is more full of life.<br /><br />Downside is it's a mobile version, and given it's battery powered needs to be charged or plugged in non-stop. The only thing I find lacking is battery life, so just keep it charged/charging at all times.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|This movie was ridiculously terrible.  It was deplorable in its presentation and decadent in the extreme.  This movie glorifies drug use, prostitution and then tries to say you should have a conscience.  It drags on and on in places and is not enjoyable at all.  I wouldn't own this movie if someone paid me to own it.  I wouldn't even give it one star but Amazon is making me give it at least one.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|This has to be the BEST Blu-ray (DVD) on this planet. Highly recommended you won't be sorry. Eagles BEST band out there! Need to see Joe Walsh, I can't say anything else. You need to get this Blu-ray or DVD. You won't be sorry.
1567184855|3.0|I wasn't too impressed by My. Newton's soul work. Some of the information was interesting, but most of it just didn't seem to hold my interest. I found myself easily laying the book aside and getting involved in other projects, and not being in any hurry to continue my reading. Having been a reader for many years, this is a good indication that the book is lacking either in it's material or it's presentation.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I bought this book right before moving to Australia. The insight into this land  and the people is incredible. His humor is a great balance to the history. The book is an enjoyable read. My one regret is that I will not remember all the interesting facts and figures that are in here.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I always if she is related to the Swift's on my dad's side of the family! Anyway, great album... a cross of country and rock with Taylor's typical introspective (and great) lyrics... This album is simply more proof that she earned those CMA awards!
030758836X|2.0|I just finished this book after not being able to put it down for two days and I feel utterly deflated. I can NOT believe the ending. What a shameful disappointment.<br /><br />Who ends a book with such a thick twisted plot in such a disappointing way?!<br /><br />I'm an avid reader of all genres and have never felt the need to write a review before. But this one I just couldn't let go.<br /><br />It's like warning a girlfriend not to date a guy because you have first hand experience with how horrible it will turn out.<br /><br /> Don't waste your time Or money on this one.
B003FSTN5C|2.0|Something lacking here. I can't exactly figure out what's missing, but something is. Not impressed at all by this spin off from NCIS.  I really like NCIS, so I thought this one would be good too. Didn't happen. I haven't seen a bad episode of NCIS, and I have all the seasons. Where as this program, even with all it's action, intrigue, and sunny Cal. location, just seems to miss the mark. Have no plans to invest in season two.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|Great movie for the kids, I even liked watching it. This was a fun movie to watch over and over.
B001ROZIA0|5.0|Great romantic comedy, and you don't need to love dogs to love this movie! Lane and Cusack have great chemistry and as always, bring warmth and humanity to their roles.

B00190N4E4|5.0|In 1982,  a great film about the trials and tribulations of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born. This film is about a key period in 1893 when Gandhi, who is an Indian lawyer and activist, is thrown off of an African train for being an Indian sitting in a whites-only first class compartment even though he had a ticket to be there. He became a leader of a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa as well as leading a non-violent independence movement against the rule of the United Kingdom in India during the 20th Century. This review will cover the plot of this movie as well as the significance of Gandhi's actions on world religions.<br /> Gandhi was arrested numerous times while facing intense pressure and attention nationally and internationally. As a result of  the enormous swell of attention and pressure, the actions of the practicing Hindu Indian caused the South African government to begin giving rights to Indians. Gandhi then becomes a national hero in India and naturally he is brought into a movement as a leader to gain India's independence from British rule. Consequently, he is imprisoned and arrested multiple times yet eventually brings enough pressure from the international public that the United Kingdom grants India independence as a result of his leading the movement. Unfortunately, Gandhi's problems are just beginning as Muslims and Hindus begin fighting all across India. By the time fighting stops, the northwest and eastern part of India becomes what is known today as Pakistan. It was Gandhi's hunger strike that caused the fighting to stop, as he refused to eat until all killing had ended. Despite Gandhi's  wishes, India was split into two nations. The nation was basically divided in areas where the Indians were a majority. Gandhi spent the rest of his life fighting for peace until he was finally assassinated.<br /> Gandhi was widely popular for his actions and heroism of not only the self denial in Hindu practices, butalso his acceptance of other major religions including Christianity and Islam. This embracement of other belief systems paved the way for peace and changed the face of world religions forever. None of man-kind, involved in religion as a leader, brought as much successful and righteous change to the world without the use of force as Mohandas Gandhi did.  He showed it was possible that all people, of all colors, nationalities, and cultures could come together for the cause of civil rights and human decency. These actions brought a new precedent for leaders of the world to be forced to work together and to have no excuse for the use of violence to solve problems. In closing, this film holds the world record for the most extras ever used in a film and in my opinion, Gandhi himself holds the world record for the most successful, non-violent activist that ever lived. Gandhi changed the world of religion forever.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie was well done, very moving and taut.  Loved the characters, believable and interesting.. It is a classic story that is fascinating...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was so so so funny i almost fell out of bed on the part where they kissed and he would kick her and i liked the part when Greag's mom put the speaker 2 her stomach and Greag said the upstairs bathroom was his...............SO FUNNY!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy the game but it's another &quot;real-time&quot; game that requires more time than I may be able to give it in the future.
B004SYP5WC|3.0|Been using this app for about a year now. It does what I need it to do...reminds me of my bill payments. This app won't show any graphs or charts of your expenses or anything.<br /><br />A couple of annoyances that I wish the developer would fix are: 1) an option to sort my paid bills by dates with most recent at the top (currently showing most recent date at the end of the list, and I have to scroll through my entire list to get to the most recent one). 2) when selecting to &quot;View/Edit Reminder&quot;, the &quot;Payee/Item&quot; field is always highlighted with a drop down that covers up &quot;Amount&quot; field that is being changed a lot. It just takes extra clicks here and there to get to where I need to get to.
B0037Z8SLI|4.0|Short and to point, a good informative read and worth the time to read it. Real world examples are great also.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|My 11 year old daughter downloaded this app.  However, it wasn't enough to keep her attention.  It has the potential to be a good game with a little bit of tweaking.  Players shouldn't be allowed to tell you the answer.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|It was a cute movie.  It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen but it was worth watching.  I don't even have kids and I still liked it.
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much even though it was pretty predictable. If you have read any of her other books you will also like this one. If you are looking for a great meaningful award winning book then don't read this but if you like silly love story British type books then you should like this one. I have yet to find a book by Sophie that I did not enjoy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was phenomenal, Augustus and Hazel Grace are heroes. This is unlike any book I have read, will definitely remember this one.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This game is great!!! It will keep you occupied and kill the boredom.  I love the way you can reposition the cube for better moves.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|It was a very beautiful movie in terms of the animation and color.  However, the story line was not that great.  I fell asleep twice and finished it because I paid for it.  However, if I was a kid I would love it.  I think it's a great kids movie, I wonder if the parents will love it too.  I still liked the movie but I wouldn't watch it again.
B000YAA68C|5.0|In my favorite chick flick collection, yeah it has some sad parts, but they're not excruciating and it just makes you feel good in the end.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|So many twists and turns, I hate what has come of the Starks of Winterfell.  So Nobel was Lord Eddard, it turns my stomach just fast as I turn the pages.  I filed through book 1 and 2 in a week's time frame, fabulous read, I will tell all my friends about it.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|too slow.  the movie is very slow with to much dialog. the opening made me believe there would be more action. not the usual denzel movie.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This movie was really really good.  Right from the beginning I was hooked.  It was so intense I had to stop the movie a few times because it was that intense.  Fantasy movies are my favorite genera, therefore for me to love this non fantasy movie says a lot.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey is so full of life and I love listening to her play, plus she has the whole electronic mix thing going on that spices it up even more. Love it!

B001RHPJBU|5.0|Awesome CD!<br />I'm a fan of Phil Collins but not so much that I listen to all of his music.....I wanted to find something that had most of the songs I like from him which is pretty much this one. =) I'm sure true fans would disagree, but I doubt they'd be buying a greatest hits instead of single albums.....<br />Anyway, if you like him you'll like this CD.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|this screwdriver is absolutely FANTASTIC (see what i did there?) except for the bottom the bottome stays extremely sturdy the first few times you pop it off and then it loosens up and just pops off every time you want to sonic the screwdriver. It pops off alot in my pocket (yes i carry a sonic everywhere shoot me though i'll regenerate) and it becomes quite an annoyance when i have to tell the Daleks to hold on while i pop my pen back into place. AThe ultraviolet light with the invisible ink is really cool though and i do love it very very mcuh great product and it makes me feel like the 10th or 9th doctor =)

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is addictive!  Fast, fun and easy even for an amatuer like me.  Now if I can just improve my skills so my scores are more consistant. ( Play more?)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Brilliant acting, engaging story lines, gorgeous period dress and scenery.  I love that the story keeps getting better.  Many dramas start becoming mildly unbelievable after the first season, as if the writers have nothing left to create.  The Downton Abbey writers are excellent at creating unique and believable characters and situations.  At Downton, the upper crust becomes more human with each episode and the lower class becomes more enchanting.  After being inundated with American TV where &#34;drama&#34; = &#34;promiscuous and/or graphically violent&#34;, Downton Abbey is like a breath of smog-free air.  Thanks to the series creators, writers, actors and off-camera staff for their excellent work!
B00634GHJA|4.0|This is a fairly simple app and once you get the hang of it ,it works really well it's amazing to me how nice this app really is
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is a great time passer. Love it easy to operate and easy to use. Great for kids love the little graphics.
B008CYDD7I|5.0|Good Lovecraft movie, not as per Lovecraft's original story, but still good.  Lots of nudity, gore, and horror, the three things that make a movie great.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|My 5 youngest kids love this game.  Simple enough for my 3 year old to play.  My Autistic daughter can play alone, but she often will play with one of her siblings when they challenge her for a game.  Great for hand eye coordination and visual tracking.  Good occupational therapy tool for those needing to learn independent use of fingers for dexterity.
1582701709|5.0|I heard about this book from a class I was taking at work (working with mentally ill patients). I was so intrigued by the 5 min of video I decided to try the book. It is a very fast read and very inspiring! I've even talked about it with some patients and they loved it as well. I really do believe in the power of the mind now!
0545123291|5.0|Am hooked on this series I have one more to go!! Love the story line and how different the book is.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Because they are gripping reading - I've learned the hard way not to start on these books unless I know a sleepless night won't be a deal breaker. Enjoy! Wisely!
B00BG08FKK|3.0|I loved how they added basically all the songs on the album, but I was kind of disappointed at both the casing of the CDs themselves and the editing. The album itself is made of cardboard...were we too cheap to use normal CD casing? Idk, but it seems cheap looking, but I guess it pays off for all the songs. That's what I want to stab at next. Although I love the songs and the singing, how come some of the editing seems halfa**ed? &#34;On My Own&#34; sounds so amazing and perfect, yet the song cuts off on her last note and is played in the next song, &#34;One Day More.&#34; We listen to 30 seconds of the workwomen fighting in &#34;At the End of the Day&#34; and yet they cut off Fantine's solo singing to the foreman.<br /><br />I am pretty happy that &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing&#34; and &#34;A Little Fall of Rain&#34; are on this though
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very addictive. I love all the animals. You can earn money easily witch helps make the game fun.
1452113432|5.0|A great book with many unique and interesting recipes, very simple to cook as well. I loved Rachel's tips in the recipes, something that most book lacks. A good range of recipes, I have wanted a French cookbook for some time now however I have been lost as to which one to buy - there are so many. All the recipes are grouped into sections - picnic, snacks, dinner with family and dessert. Rachel does put a twist on some of the recipes but it is not outrageous.<br /><br />Great gift idea and something for someone that needs a little bit of inspiration.

1616550414|5.0|I bought this book for my husband as a surprise, and a surprise it was. Great book with all the Zelda games ever issued with descriptions and drawings. I have to say that delivery was very fast, thank you Amazon!
B001EAWMGA|4.0|I like me some Jim Caviezel and Ron Pearlman.  Basically a sci-fi twist to Beowulf.  Worth a look if you like that kind of stuff.  Pretty good!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|My only complaint when I purchased my GoPro HD was the lack of screen. Even though I didn't NEED a screen (since the camera would be mounted all the time) I still found myself in situations where a screen would come in handy. When GoPro came out with the LCD BacPac attachment I picked it up right away. After an easy installation I tried it out and the thing worked perfect!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I played the &quot;temple run&quot;, I thought it was amazing. But now... I'm speechless.( But in a good way!) It's harder this time.( And I love challenges.) And I really like the cave part and sliding on the rope at the beginning. It makes you feel like you're in the game!;) So as you can see, I gave the game 5 stars. They deserved it. Oh, I almost forgot! Did you here the new games &quot;Brave temple run&quot; and &quot;Oz temple run&quot;? I never played them before but they look good..... oh look at me! I'm starting to talk gibberish! :P
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|it could be longer but the concept was pretty good.  I'm only doing this rating to get the sequel.  I don't know if I would say it's worth $5 but I liked it well enough.
B000JLSLZG|1.0|My dvd player would not play for some reason.  I guess HD DVD is ls like Beta cassette or something.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Witty, intelligent, humorous, fun drama.  I have binge-viewing habits and this was a fabulous time. I love the many characters and their depth.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|A most unusual story, interesting but tended to be drawn out in some chapters. It was a bad sad that the Tiger had such an abrupt exit from the story
B00782O7IY|5.0|The viewer with a knowledge of film history may see many references in this movie. The character George is reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin who produced a silent film Modern Times as late as 1936. The girl Peppy is a blend of Ruby Keeler in 42nd Street and Clair Bloom in Limelight. There are also references to Greta Garbo \\"I want to be alone\\". The viewer may recognize the Vertigo style background music. The attempted suicide with the pistol in George's mouth may remind the viewer of Hitchcock's Spellbound. The final scene is a tribute to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and their achievements in finding joy in sound movies.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|One of the best movies ever on Blu Ray?  Hell yeah I'll sign up.  Nice to see.  I've probably watched this movie over 100 times.  Can you dig it?
B00846REIS|5.0|OMG I heard about this book and so glad I took the time to get it, I downloaded it to my Kindle and I could not put it down, I could not wait to go home and read every day. I didnt want the book to end....SO GOOD!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I heard about this book from a friend.  It was a great recommendation.  I've been off science fiction for a few years and was a little hesitant, but I figured \\"why not?\\"<br /><br />Mr. Howey has constructed a post-apocalyptic world that is well-thought out, logical and viable.  No huge suspension of belief is required.  The characters are interesting and their problems are fascinating.<br /><br />Best of all, at the end of the book you want more.  So I'm going to wrap this up and find more written by Mr. Howey.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie for forever! at walmart it's like fifteen bucks (if you get the cheapest version). I happened to have UP on my wish list and this seller popped up with a great deal!!!! thanks so much.

B00B99KJR0|4.0|Good game to pass the time. I didn't realize it was the same game over and over so it's a little monotonous but still entertaining.
B005SH5K7I|4.0|My 10 and 11 year old like this movie.  Lots of good kid humor.  Nice to download and take it with us.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Please please please download this app. I promise you that it's amazing!!!always New scenery and cool characters to play as.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This was a very interesting view on Sherlock Holmes.  It brought him up to date and into our time with all the things that crime is about now. Too little is used to make people realize that things are not all calm and the criminals easily caught. Also having him know some form of protecting himself that is modern was even better. It made him more alive that fictional as well as the criminals he had to deal with.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I bought mahjong artifacts two last year's and enjoyed it immensely. I like this game more. It's surprisingly not quite the same. I recommend this for the fun I'm having playing it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm liking this app so far.My grand daughter will love it as she also loves horses.I got this mostly for her.
B00BFUC8RC|2.0|I dont think this is a good game. I just deleted it from my kindle because it froze up and wouldn't let me turn on my kindle. At first it was fun then it said I couldn't get on right don't ever get this game it has bad bugs.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This product is the best product on the market and I recomend using it for quality performancy with the Internet. I'm a Technichian and know what works best.
B00ARA4SLU|2.0|I received my blue ray dvd combo 3/15/13 and I wasn't impressed with the movie, very unpleasantly surprised. there was not enough intense depth from central character and even more disappointedly, the extra features were not included in the package only advertisements for upcoming movies that was a real SHAM.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Love this game. But I'm having trouble connecting to fb so only gets four stars.  Also the in game purchases are a bit steep.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My friends like to call it a book hang over... there is just so much to take in and think through. This is my second time reading this book and I still have the biggest hang over! All I can say is read hunger games, catching fire, and mockingjay!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Dad, Mom, and our toddler want to play this game. It is Too addictive. Nice graphics, music, and surprises. We will buy more apps from this maker.

B00AYCOUOG|5.0|After 11 years, Suede are back and have put out an album called, \\"bloodsports\\" which is just as consistent as any of their first three records. It may not reach the heights of those efforts, but still contains that 'Suede' sound that lifelong fans have grown to love. My favorite thing about this album, unlike 1999's \\"Head Music,\\" is that they sound like a band again. The first 3 albums strung together so effortlessly. Even the chronologically tracked Sci Fi Lullabies had an album-like flow, even though it wasn't even intentionally structured that way.<br /><br />At this point, many have heard the (non-single) \\"Barriers\\" and \\"It Starts and Ends With You.\\" The sound of Ed Buller is very apparent on this album. I've always loved the spacious, almost 70's retro sound he achieved with the band back in the early/mid 90's. Now, even though this album recalls their earlier sound, it does also have more of a 'modern' touch. The drums sound is much more in-your-face. The kick drum is mixed a lot louder than in the past and the eq on the snare makes it rich and deep sounding. Ed has certainly grown as a producer, though I still wouldn't change a thing that he did on the earlier records. He has always had his own style, which you could hear on other albums, including Pulp's, \\"His N Hers,\\" one of my all time favorites. Also back to the forefront is the massive amount of vocal reverb which suits the melodrama in bretts lyrics and voice respecively. I consider him the 5th Suede member of Suede mk1 and mk2. He really takes their songs to another level and refines them. Suede played 8 new songs in 2011 and he told them to start over from scratch, which is a good thing considering there were only a couple good songs in that bunch.<br /><br />After the rocker, \\"Barriers,\\" we get another uptempo track called \\"Snowblind,\\" which instantly recalls the guitar tones of \\"Coming Up\\" and the almost megaphone-esque vocal sound of that same era. It has a strong riff, and the 'woo-hoo' hook is (always) more than welcome. The verse is very catchy, however, the chorus seems to lack an interesting hook. However, what makes this song great is its progression and structure. Like, \\"It Starts and Ends With You\\" this song takes through different sections effortlessly and keeps you interested straight through until the guitar soling at the end.<br /><br />...Which brings us to the 1st single, \\"It Starts and Ends With You.\\" Initially, I was disappointed that it wasnt terribly interesting sounding But after hearing it multiple times, I like whats here. It has a good verse, pre-chorus and chorus/post-chorus. I really think this song could have used a bridge, guitar solo or even a key change later on to break it up a bit. It gets a bit monotone after the 2nd chorus and could use something else. That said, this song really works well as a \\"track 3.\\" and really has an appropriate \\"place\\" on the album. It still does not strike me as a single though.<br /><br />It would have been smarter to release, \\"Hit Me\\" as the comeback single. Its a strong song that instantly recalls the sound of \\"Coming Up\\" and is arranged and structured just as well as any of their previous hits. The \\"la, la\\" post-chorus sections really make the song something special. Its the sort of hook that the first single was lacking. Another song it reminds me of is 'The Tears-The Lovers,' with better production.<br /><br />\\"Sabotage\\" and \\"For the Strangers\\" are as great on the album as they are live. When the band premieres this album live, most of it is probably going to sound just like it does on the album because the arrangement is very straightforward. They captured the bands live sound-something that they did so well on the first 3 releases. \\"Sabotage\\" has some of Brett's best lyrics since \\"Dog Man Star\\" and \\"For the Strangers\\" is a pretty, distorted ballad that sounds like an instant Suede classic.<br /><br />The second half of the album strips away the distorted guitars and replaces them with cleaner sound, complete with long trailing reverb and eerie keyboards to build those strange, 'Dog Man Star-esque' soundscapes. \\"What Are You Not Telling Me\\" is a beautiful song that recalls that earlier Suede sound. The wobbly keyboard and stacatto string rhythms really take this song somewhere else. A definite highlight. \\"Sometimes I Feel I'll Float Away\\" is another great tune. It has the atmosphere of \\"self titled, \\"is sung extremely well and it even has an interlude with a rhythm that reminds me of \\"Where the Pigs Don't fly\\"<br /><br />As far as vocals go, Brett is on the money this time. There were some dodgy lyrics and vocal performances on 2002's A New Morning,\\" but Brett is in top form here. The second half of this album sounds very much like Brett's \\"Slow Attack\\", except its done the way it should be done, with the musicians and producer that he belongs working with.<br /><br />\\"Always\\" is probably my least favorite, as the chorus falls a little flat. However, the verse is very melodic and it even sounds a lot like \\"Hey You\\" by Pink Floyd in the chord structure, guitar arpeggios and bass work. I really like how the drums come in during the second verse, giving the song some breathing space and dynamics.<br /><br />The album closes with \\"Faultlines,\\" which also references that \\"Slow attack\\" or \\"Wilderness\\" sound. In fact, the chord progression and vocal melody remind me of Anderson's song, \\"Clowns\\" but this is much better. Its no \\"Next Life\\" or \\"Still Life\\" but its a very good song.<br /><br />Okay, what album review would be complete without some slight criticism. I'd say each of the 10 songs are good. Some are even great.. It is a very consistent work. The (dare i say it) most consistent since, \\"Coming Up\\" for sure. I don't think its as good as the first 3 albums, but its hard to argue with any of the song choices for it...well, maybe until we hear the b-sides!<br /><br />This is simply a very good beginning to a new era of Suede, with the right producer doing hisjob. The lyrics are great, though, he really needs to stop using those 'Brett similes': \\"Like a __, Like a __\\" which he's been singing forever. Also, I do like that \\"Bloodsports\\" is a concept album about a relationship's beginning, middle and end. However, I hope he takes a new route for the next album. I believe this turned into a concept album about relationships because its all he really writes about lately. I'd love to hear more songs about, oh, I dont know, \\"jumble sale mums,\\" and \\"stolen ice cream vans,\\" for example. The lyrics seem to be more straightforward and I would like to hear him mix it up a bit<br />.<br />Another thing I would like to see in their next effort is catchier choruses. There are obvious singles from this album such as, \\"Hit Me,\\" \\"For the Strangers\\" but I would like to see some more \\"anthemic\\" tracks on an album. \\"Snowblind\\" could have been a strong single, but the chorus sounds kind of anticlimactic to me.<br /><br />I love the guitar playing of Richard Oakes, but if some more catchier riffs were thrown into the album, I believe it could have elevated my score. For example, that riff in \\"Barriers\\" And \\"It Starts and Ends With You\\" are a bit simplistic alongside, such riffs as \\"Animal Nitrate,\\" \\"Chemistry Between Us...\\" you name it. Now, I love Bernard Butler's playing just as much as anyone, but I consider Oakes a great guitarist in his own right. The guitar riff in \\"Every Monday Morning Comes\\" is probably one of my favorite Suede riffs. \\"Beautiful Ones\\" is just arpeggiated and suspended chords, but it works so well as a riff and is one of 'their' best.<br /><br />Another criticism is that I would like to see a longer album next time. The running time is around 39 minutes which might be their shortest album. I do like that there are 10 songs. Yes, 'Coming up' was 10 songs but this album feels like it should have more of an epic length because of the 'Dog man star-ic' qualities it has. I would also love to hear more string work and background vocals the next time around. They intentionally stayed away from using any background vocals on this album, like the first 2 albums, but I think the harmonizing on \\"Coming Up\\" really added something great to an already great band. There are strings on the album, but not a lot. The only 'real' strings are on \\"What Are You Not Telling Me.\\" As far as success goes, I think this album will do well with with old fans but I don't think it will reach many \\"new\\" fans. I think if they rely on catchier hooks might see a new fan-base and turn heads more, but like I said before, there are 10 good songs here and its hard to argue about the quality of any of them.<br /><br />So, in short, a very good, consistent effort. A welcome comeback and, most importantly, a beginning of a new era with the right producer aboard. it gives us hope that we will possibly see another classic in the future.

B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I have this app on my Ipad and it works just fine. But when I tried getting it on my Kindle Fire (not hd) . It wouldn't download. At first it was downloading slow. At the same time I was downloading the other shark game and it worked fine. Then I tried to download it again. It was still going slow. It didn't. I tried one more time. Didn't work. Grrr please fix this.

1452111014|5.0|this book has show great detail of how art of this film is been done. love it come check it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|18% of the way through the book and I'm having trouble tearing myself away from it.  I bought it because the story synopsis was intriguing and the reviews were good but I keep reading it because the story's great.  When you start to care about the protagonist from the first page, care about him as a person, care about his predicament and his continued survival, you know you're reading a good story.  The switch from Watney on Mars to the folks on earth was smooth and the story remains compelling.<br /><br />I can't wait to find out what happens next but I also don't want to finish it too quickly.  This far into it I have high hopes that the quality of the story will stay strong to the end.<br /><br />Congratulations, Mr. Weir, and I hope you keep on writing!<br /><br />Don W.
0316228532|3.0|I have to admit, I did read a lot of the reviews before requesting this book for Christmas and wasn't sure about really wanting to read it.  I loved the Harry Potter series and was aware this book as going to be very different from what I've come to expect from J.K. Rowling.<br /><br />This book did take me a bit to get into but the character development and details of the locations and their lives transport you into their worlds.  Even though I wasn't able to really feel attached to any of the characters since most of them were so self absorbed and uncaring; J.K. Rowling has a fantastic way of describing people and places so you can visualize what she's writing and trying to get across to the reader.  Her ability to do that is fantastic but with this book it turns out to be kind of disturbing and pretty sad.  The lives of the families followed in this book are not the average family I'm aware of but am sure exist more than I'd like to believe.  This story is raw and gritty.  If you're expecting a happy ending, don't count on it because it isn't there.  These families exist and are exposed to the readers with all their warts and secrets that have been so closely guarded within the walls of their houses.<br /><br />According to the reviews, some readers loved this book and some haven't.  I'm in the middle.  The writing is absolutely some of the best and J.K.'s ability to tell a story is better than most people could even dream of.  I didn't exactly like this book but didn't dislike it either.  Read this book for the supurb writing and descriptions but keep in mind the dark turn these people's stories take.  I could see why it would not appeal to a huge number of people but if you give it a try, you might appreciate this book.
B00001QEE6|5.0|Love, love, love this movie. My daughter actually ordered it from her kindle fire. But she wanted the dvd so she could watch it without her kindle. She loves it. Even though she is 12, she still enjoyed the innocent romance between the dogs. It's refreshing to know that Disney can still entertain the young people without always using half-dressed rambunctious teens. These classics will always be the best work of Disney. They are timeless!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good game I play it more than temple run¡Had no blips or anything like that. Definitely worth a download!
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|It is a very good rock album. I wish they would get back together again and make more music like this, even if they have to blend hip-hop with it.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I love this mic, we are starting a new youtube series and this covers all of our needs. It can record outside and inside perfect and the adjustable features really made it stand out. There is no hiss or hum with this mic and I am suprised of the range it can pick up. Best bang for your buck for sure.
0062209493|5.0|Great story about the life and times of a great navy seal. He does a great job of letting us into what makes a navy seal unique and special.  How and why we NEED to have these guys and all the special forces units.  A kick-ass story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought this book was a very funny and entertaining. My kids were very happy to know that weird things don't just happen to them. I loved it!!!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|It's definitely worth it.  The lead singer of the band is the Janis Joplin of this generation.. I want to hear more from her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing game that definitely keeps you on your toes. Takes a bit of time to increase your multiplayer, which makes the game a bit difficult. Eventually it does become easier. Totally worth the wait.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|its the best season so far; lots of hilarity now that Castle and Beckett are together. The episode about the divorce attorney has the best line of the series (between Beckett and the Medical examiner)
B0026SCMNM|2.0|I really loved the book, until the end. She was on her way back and it just ended.  I was so into the story, but the end made me feel like I had wasted my time.  Actually, it's more that there wasn't an end.  I kept trying to turn the page, because I felt that that could not have been it.  I even restarted my Kindle to make sure.
B000YBWJH2|5.0|Dana Delany is a hot mama in this movie. If you ever been to Tombstone, this movie may be worth seeing. I am not sure how accurate it is.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait for the finale . Then I will start over and read all three again. I don't w as want it to end. I haven't read anything for two years and this is so exciting.
B002NANLCE|4.0|I watched the show first, loved it, but since it was cancelled after only one season, I wanted more.  Found this book, which inspired the show, and found that it had very little in common with the show, which was refreshing because I didn't feel like I knew what was coming.  The ending is really strange, but very stimulating.
B00006I53S|1.0|I bought this lense about 3 years ago and used it very little. I've used it at Christmas and various vacation trips. It's by far the worst lense I own. In fact I have several Canon lenses that SUCK!!It seems Canon has a problem with quality control. Make as many new models as possible to keep share holders happy. I would rate this minus 5 if I could. Canon want's $204.00 just to look and see if anything is wrong. Plenty, autofocus sucks, pictures blurry no quality control!!<br />Yes, I feel better now.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|sad story, and a scary thought when you fly the next time.  Washington plays  a believable character. the ending is best
B000YDAYK4|4.0|This boot is awesome after breaking in the leather they are so comfortable but beware the boots run super super small I normally wear 9-9.5 and a size seven fits me great!!! Sole is really soft so it wears kinda fast. I really do like this boot style comfort support really light weight great for hiking around
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Skyfall is a really good Bond movie, but it's not the standard Bond formula with the gadgets, women and quirky sayings.  That being said it's a fast-moving and well done movie with a great opening sequence and interesting plot development.  The producers have set Bond up for the next generation.  Well done Mr. Bond.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was chosen by my book club.  It brought back times in my youth when I struggled with issues of life.  She was braver than me, but I found my own &#34;wild&#34; to find out who I was and what I was in relation to life itself.  I enjoyed her revelations and understandings as she made her way along the trail.

B00322PKBW|4.0|I own numerous Swatch watches.  I ordered this watch because one of my other models stopped working.  While this watch is fine for the price point I have a couple gripes compared to my other Swatch watches: (1) no day/date on this watch; and (2) the band is too rubbery.  My other Swatch watches have a smooth plastic band, but this one is rubbery (so it's hard to take on and off.  Other than that the color is nice and it's a typical men's Swatch (larger face).
B000002UUX|5.0|Quite possibly on of Megadeth's best albums. But please don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't stop watching this show. It's hard not to watch the entire season all the way through from start to finish.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I play this game just about every day. I tell myself it improves my addled senior mind, but in reality I do it because it is fun!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|gotten for a gift they loved it and it was an awesome price! if your a fan of the series you should like this

B000MV9026|4.0|really enjoyed the movie. the sequel could have used more music as the first. Recommend to families with children. Everyone would enjoy it.
B005HSG3U6|2.0|doesn't stand at all very flimsy on that side and hard to get out once in case you really have to pry at it.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|works very simplymy only downsides are that<br />A. its hard to read sometimes and<br />B. when i add it to my favorites the pic wont come up. :( wish they would get that fixed!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Game of Thrones season 1 is awesome. This season is a must buy for any fan of the show. Love it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game.  I looked at it several times and on the day they had it as a free app, I downloaded it.  It is a race against the clock and yourself.  I have not gotten into the submitting scores online.  I find myself saying, just one more time and half hour later I am still saying just one more time.  I have played all 3 types and like them all.  Not a game I start playing if I just have a few minutes to kill.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|There was a great flow to the story. Very funny in parts and also very sad.<br />very well written and I couldn't put it down.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of Thrones season 2 is awesome. This season is a must buy for any fan of the show. Love it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This could keep me up all night! I am sure my kids will enjoy this game as they did Bejeweled.
B00992CF6W|3.0|this game is great I love it, but it doesn't have as many &quot;features&quot; as the minecraft on Xbox or PC such as a minecart, levers/switches, boats, etc. I understand its only the pocket edition but I believe it should have as many features as the xbox and PC.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game offers an endless supply of fun activities and challenges. It is quite different from the same old city games. Virtual City is in no way boring or stressful. But it is addictive,in that you forget what time it is is. So don't try playing Virtual City while at work :). IT'S A MUST PLAY!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome... Use every day for my crafts... Made jewelry and pined a million different items in a matter of days only downside is that not all the links work

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I'm writing a book at the moment and this helped me know what was ahead, it was confusing at times.
0736092269|5.0|This book is worth every penny, You will not find any other book that matches the detail and quality as well as the explanations given in this book.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|works better than than original charger cord. kindle plugin fits snug.  thank you amazon for your great kindle customer service.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing! Someday it could be as big as Harry Potter.  I wish there had been more books to read though. It all went so quickly!
0689835604|5.0|This is a simple lift the flap book but I love it because the flaps are nice and big and my daughter really likes the illustrations of the cute babies. My older child loved this book so much that some of the flaps tore off so I am here to buy another. Highly recommend!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Great book, Great series.  Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a great read with a different twist.  Loved it!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|i could not figure it out and want a regular bingo  this one keeps advertizing on words with friends app
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Loved the first book, but unfortunately story line starting to wear a bit thin.  Skip read a lot, but still wanted to keep reading to know what happens!
B005FITIDC|3.0|Guess it was &#34;real life&#34; and true, I am sure.  It just was not from my life experiences.  Would not let kids watch it.  He had/has a great ministry to orphans!!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Great book, Great series.  Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a great read with a different twist.  Loved it!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|the game itself is very addicting. but its glitchy and hasn't updated for months :( I know there are updates available because my fam plays too.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|Lots of repetitiveness here, I didn't particularly enjoy, but I read all the same to find out what happened to characters.
B0015DROBO|4.0|If you've heard anything about this book, it's usually one of two things: It's my favorite ever! OR I couldn't get past the first few chapters. My advice: keep pushing through! You have to get a lot of backstory at the beginning for things to make sense. The action does eventually pick up, and it's good! The next two books are like the last half of this book: hard to put down. Your patience will be rewarded!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Great book, Great series.  Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a great read with a different twist.  Loved it!
B0010SKSTO|3.0|This could've been much more concise. The author offers many unique insights, but if you don't take notes (or make use of highlighting) these gems will fall by the wayside.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Had to read (like many others!) to see what the fuss was about!  I guess it's a dream.... a rich, handsome man, sweeping us off our feet....  Intriguing and just had to keep reading to the end
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|the game it shelf is great but it takes way to much space and you might have to delete some good apps to get it
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I was a Fine Arts major and have a little knowledge of film making.  I found this film to be flawless.  The casting, directing, cineamatography, the shot angles, the acting were exceptional.  I recommend it highly.  If you haven't read the books, I suggest you do.  The writing flows, the characters develop, the plot carries the books to the end.  I couldn't put them down.  They just flowed.
B00BESCUKK|3.0|I expected better.  I did not like some of the fight scenes.  The story line was not so great.  The picture quality was good.
B005LAII0I|5.0|saw this movie and knew it had to be part of my personal collection. already forced 4 people to watch it with me again!
B00336G7HI|5.0|Price was good and I needed a extra battery.  Could have went with off brand but stuck with sony.  I never had trouble with sony quality.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I love Downey and Law together.  Timing of comedic parts are well done.  Rachel McAdams, is beautiful, funny and witty.  Great job.
B001JP5JRY|5.0|Love the show, love the book. Me and my wife are going through the past seasons, and I love the hidden jokes in both the book and show.
141694737X|4.0|I bought this book because I remembered liking it as a kid and wanted to read it again and share it with my son.  When I got the book, I had not remembered how simple it was.  There is no real rhythm or rhyming scheme to it so it doesn't flow as well as some kids books.  It does have repetition that kids respond well to and flaps are always a plus!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a fun game to play when you have a some time to waste.<br />The images are so attractive. Nice little match 3 game.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I have ever watched.  I was a big fan of the book series and the HBO series follows the books very closely- a wise choice.
B005K2XNGG|5.0|The Timbuk2 provides a nice snug fit to protect my new Kindle Fire.It has enough padding that gives it a cushion too against bumps. I really like it and it fits perfect. Thanks Amazon.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My first Lee Child book--and he has me hooked. His writing is so visual you can see each situation as if you were there.EXCELLENT READ.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|To say it in simple words: inspiring, very well written, emotional and simple. A must read, it pretty much tell you to make the best you can in what you are best.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I picked this book up for some light reading on a day home sick from work. I saw the high reviews and thought, not my typical read and I certainly am not the target demographic but, I'll give it a whirl.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting what I received from reading this book. How to explain what I did get...and the following isn't intended to be melodramatic.<br /><br />I was sucker punched, emotionally invested (hugely), horrified, awed, saddened, at times uplifted, grateful for some aspects of human nature and then human nature made me horrified by morally repugnant events. I guess what I'm trying to communicate without being overly sappy (and failing) how much this book made me feel. Highs and lows. It was demoralizing and insightful at the same time. There are so many simple moments of raw emotion on each opposite end of the spectrum and they transition so rapidly, you find yourself going, whoah how'd we get here when we were literally just over there? But in a good way.<br /><br />It is an emotional roller coaster, but one of simplicity. The writing is fairly clean and well presented. The characters are complex in their simplicity and they invoked strong reactions in me. I wanted to get to the next sentence, paragraph, and page as quickly as possible to find out more about them. I was cheering and jeering alternately for almost each primary figure and several secondary ones.<br /><br />The book starts a little slow and then when you're not looking or expecting it, your stomach drops out on you, just like riding a roller coaster. All of a sudden your roped into this complex scenario which almost everyone who's been in high school has experienced to a lesser or greater degree. (I mean the broad picture of high school and interactions within that framework not necessarily what specific circumstances that occur with the female lead. I don't want to elaborate so as not to give away the story.)<br /><br />The writer sets her hook in you without you knowing it, and slowly begins to reel you in and then wham - you're in the boat and being filleted thinking how did that happen so quick? I couldn't put this down (but again starts a wee bit slowly) and tore through it.<br /><br />The author alternates viewpoints without rehashing the same events to death and keeps a very good rhythm and flow.  She doesn't answer all the questions for you or wrap everything in a pretty package for you. It's gritty and raw enough to sink your teeth into and yet still leaves room for you to form your own opinion about where the story takes you and how it ends.<br /><br />It is not a warm fuzzy happy book in most ways but there is redemption and hope in the bleakness that does make it worthy and not a tragedy entirely. I feel as though I'm not doing the story justice with this review but I don't know how else to word this tale. It's sad and inspiring with sarcasm and loathing and real life undiluted through teenagers eyes who are dealing with feelings and experiences that is beyond their years that they shouldn't have to deal with but are none the less. And they do so while experiencing and exploring normal facets of growing up. I guess that's the summation. It blends what is normal and right with what isn't and it doesn't sugar coat the journey while doing so.<br /><br />I hope you read it. It was worth it and then some. Sorry for the long review but for such a short read it has so much depth that it's difficult to write about the reading experience of it (particularly without spoilers) and convey all its beauty and sadness.<br /><br />P.S. after posting my review I noticed most of the other reviews were by people who were given copies to read for reviews. I paid for this book and felt it mandatory to say I bought this. There's nothing wrong with that system but sometimes I wonder about those reviews. Are they truthful. Well for this book, I agree conclusively that the reviews were merited in my opinion.<br /><br />If I could've I would've given 4.5 stars. Enjoy.<br /><br />EDIT on 7 July 14:  I recently re-read this book again due to how wonderful and touching I think this story is. (I swear it gets better every time I read it).  Previously, my review garnered some questions regarding what my opinion was on what age level was appropriate for reading this book.  My initial review didn't touch on this topic - but you can see some of the comments/discussions on that topic if you hit the comments button below my review.  I figured I should go back, edit, and add \\"my opinion\\" in the up-front review - this is especially relevant as when I re-read the book this time - I did it with that very topic in my mind.<br /><br />This book has some graphic language in it.  To be clear - the areas that deal with the graphic language and subject matter are a part of the story line and have relevance to the story/plot.  It is not just thrown in for the heck of it.  It reflects how some (not all) persons of the age group in this book talk however, the truly graphic language (and scenarios) I'm specifically speaking of - without trying to give away the story - have a direct nexus to the plot of the book.  This is a young adult book with crossovers to adult readers, but some parents may find some of the subject matter or language objectionable for their children depending on their age/maturity.<br /><br />I can't speak for every child nor parent out there or what they deem appropriate, want, or don't want their child to read.  I can say that after re-reading this book with a young adult audience in mind - parents may want to read the book prior to making a decision based on your child's maturity level.  I think 15+ is reasonable (again this is a broad based statement and shouldn't be taken as a blanket response).  If you allow your child to watch Rated \\"R\\" movies than you may not have an issue with the limited explicit language in this book.  Make no mistake, this book has very little to do with throwing around explicit content just to throw it around.  It plays a role in the story.  It is a touching tale that has aspects which deal with a teenager who is exposed to a negative situation, and that is where the language plays into it.  But there is more to the plot of this story than just that negative situation.  I'd be very sorry if someone completely missed ever reading this superb story based solely on some limited dialogue.  There are very innocent and beautiful aspects of the story as well - which are the majority.  The language and scenario I am speaking of is a part of the story, but there are many aspects of the story which are perfectly acceptable and, in my opinion, those aspects are not objectionable.<br /><br />I wouldn't dismiss this story out of hand because of the language.  If you are on-the-fence regarding subject matter content, I would suggest reading the book yourself to decide if it is suitable for your child.  It is a worthwhile read for an adult as well.  You may end up wanting to wait to let your child read it or deem it OK.  In either case I think it is safe to say many people who read this book to screen it for their children will find it moving and heart rending.<br /><br />This book was written with the intent of young adults in mind, and has receive awards/nominations in the young adults genre.  I hope this assists a little more with determining the age level.. Enjoy.<br /><br />EDIT on 7 July 14:  I recently re-read this book again due to how wonderful and touching I think this story is.

B0083ZM4TO|2.0|Purchased because book club was reading it.  Language and approch extremely biased although issues raised were thought provoking and important. The book would be difficult to understand if you were not familiar with christian terminology and church history and you did not have a vast general vocabulary.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy and amazing animation. The character development is excellent, its just an all around fantastic movie. Seriously. Watch this.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The plot had interesting an unforeseen twist and turns, which held the interest even though there was pages  of simple recounting, documentary style, without a lot people interactio.  Overall a very enjoyable book.<br /><br />Regards<br />Ian
0374203032|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It opened my eyes to a number of things that really surprised me. Kind of scary also.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is really cool. You can draw to anyone people you know and don't know. And if u don't want to draw with that person anymore you can delete them. I highly recommend this app.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book because it holds your attention and keeps you wanting to see what happens next. WOULD RECOMMEND FOR ALL
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is great, no problem with losing my stuff when I updated, not problems with the game, but it can get a little boring after a long while. Otherwise, ENJOY!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Collector's of this author's work are never disappointed. The historical data is mesmerizing and his characters are impeccable. His work is highly detailed and encompasses many families and places but one is never lost as you travel through his stories in great expectation of the conclusion, while at the same time regretting that your journey will end. I await in wild anticipation for the third book of the trilogy. Write forever Mr. FOLLETT!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Just get the first version, this is worse. But if you do get this version, try to enjoy the new fetures.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is pretty cool. I love these kind of games. So far so good. Can't wait to get to the end.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I just got this app today and I have not had any problems with it. But after reading threview about the shuting down, i am geting suspicious.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Does have a kindle fire hd and isn't able to download this app I keep trying but I won't let me
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I like  this but i think that we should be able to just search up the words we are looking for because  it takes too long to go to the  word we are looking for!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The description of each of the scenes is very detailed and it looks as real. I hope to see the movie soon!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is an epic by game. I tried it because I love temple run and I heard this was like temple run so.. ya

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very entertaining i just wish it didn't need WiFi beside that it is a very enjoyable game
B000F0UUIM|5.0|My all-time favorite movie.  I am thrilled this movie is on DVD and the extra DVD on the making of the film is fantastic.  I had a VHS copy of the movie which was not easy to get and the DVD is so much better to watch.  I never get tired of watching this movie.  A must have for the true John Wayn fan.
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|Being a Hendrix fan since to '60s I will buy every \\"new\\" album released. That's what the Hendrix estate expects and will make a ton of money off it. I can't imagine JH releasing anything like this himself. He was a perfectionist and recorded many, many takes until he felt he had enough takes to work with. This certainly would have been relegated to the to the editing room floor. Having said that it's also sad that there probably won't be anymore studio \\"albums\\" coming out since this indeed seems to be the bottom of the barrel. Being a Hendrix junkie I look forward to being taken advantage of by the Hendrix family. Sad indeed. How about some more live albums!
0375869026|5.0|This is a great learning tool for children.  Unfortunately, when I showed it to my granddaughter she wasn't impressed and I think it's because there are no pictures.  Although she can read at age 7 she is still into the visuals.  Later this year I plan to give it another shot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was one of the best free games I have ever got off of the kindle fire app store so that is why I chose it as a 5 star game
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Fan since 1971 ... last few albums just didn't get me exited, but this one is fantastic.  He only wrote a couple of the songs but they are classics.  His selections and renditions of the others are superb.  Great musicians on every track.  I've been playing it at home, in the car, and at work.  This is the Boz I remember ... wow!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I bought Hopeless because the reviews were pretty good and because I wanted to read a light and fluffy romance.  The first half of the book mostly delivers on this promise. The kissless, clothed sex scene with Sky and Holder, the two main characters, is particuarly original and hot.  Unfortunately, the second half of the book dissolves into a heavy, implausible lesson about surviving early childhood incest.<br /><br />Holder's life is supposedly shaped by the kidnapping of his 3-year old neighbor, who conveniently turns out to be Sky, a/k/a Hope. The title \\"Hopeless\\" comes from Holder's tattoo, which he gets to never forget the abduction. Sky turns out to have been incested by her father and then rescued by a kidnapper, but she doesn't remember anything at all about her past until she and Holder are on the verge of doing it. Holder's sister was also incested by Sky's father, but she conveniently commits suicide before we ever meet her -- presumably because she never got over being incested. And, yep, the woman who abducts Sky and becomes her adoptive mother was also incested by Sky's father. At the end of the book when Sky confronts her father, he immediately kills himself.  See how goofy and contrived the plot gets?<br /><br />There's more silliness, too.  Sky and Holder somehow fatefully reconnect 13 years later when they both end up in the same town at the same store at the same time.  Holder instantly recognizes Sky.  They share a magnetic attraction born from their prior love for each other as children, and then they end up committed to each other forever.  Even though Holder is a teenager, his voice is all wrong, and he sounds like a 40-year old man.  This makes his character a little creepy and very hard to believe.  Sky starts out as a sassy, hip teen, but she morphs into a one dimensional lame caricature.  I didn't end up caring about the happily ever after ending because I was just too bored.
B009VB97EY|3.0|not Mathews best work.  but I like Mathew.  good for a lazy sunday . could enjoy with few girls and drinks
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  Contents appeared to be accurate and I would buy another book from the same author.  I received it in a timely mannor
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Because of him being a wimpy kid. Also I am a big fan of the wimpy kid books and books by Jeff Kinney.-Alex Everett
0345803485|3.0|Books arrived timely but overall the content of the books failed to meet my expectations.  Dull and not interesting.  I would not spend my money on these again.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Audrey Hepburn  regal in her role. A model for those who wish to act effectively, yet fun entertainment. The &#34;plot&#34;<br />is a bit far fetched ,yet overcome with the exuberance of the actress.
0345446798|5.0|Another great book from Patricia McConnell.  Very informative on animal behavior to understand the reasons behind why your dog acts a certain way.  I love the personal stories that she includes in her books.  I will be purchasing another book from her in the near future.
B00AATV046|5.0|The age of innocence,superb acting with spiritual overtones. Whole some entertainment.<br />Good chemistry among the 3 main actors , Gregory Peck ,Loretta Young and David Niven.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it is not a fun game there is only a set ammount of time and it is really hard to control
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the app it's amazing. But I wish it wasn't so much money to get your horse things,and gain energy. needs more things to do with your horse too but still love it
B008ASLNN2|5.0|rented it through Amazon and was pleased. It was in HD and wonderful to see. I am glad we ordered it

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|i absolutely loved this book! it was fantastically written and the author used vivid verbs. good job Frank Baum! :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run2 is an exciting and fun game.  My granddaughter actually wanted this game but it is quickly becoming a family favorite.
B009SCRERI|5.0|Great family movie. We all enjoyed it. Kept us tuned in at all times.  My grandaughter watches it everyday.  Very good for toddler viewing as well as adult viewing. So clean and loving.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Who is giving this a 4 star? This is by far the best calendar app. Don't look any further. Thanks to amazon to offer it for free long ago as the daily app. Just buy it and enjoy it. So many widgets and customizable functions that puts many developers including  Google's own calendar app.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Very interesting story line.  Time travel has been brought to view in several movies and over several time periods.  Interesting what future would be like.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|It's hard to say I didn't really love this album...because I think Josh Groban is FANTASTIC and I have been a fanatic of his since before his first album came out. But as gorgeous as his voice is even in this album, I can't help but think his song choices (cool as they are) aren't always the most fitting to his gorgeous voice (not that he can't make them sound amazing, because he does!)...but I just love the style of his first two CD's better.  But as much as I say this...I know just as with all of his albums, I'm going to listen to this one til...forever.  So really, even though it's my not my favorite, I'm positive that by the time the next album comes out, it WILL be another favorite and I will have complaints about the new one. lol.  Long live Groban! :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it!! Provides very good ideas, recipes and tips.  I've reviewed and have used some of the recipes.  Very good site and reccommend it to everyone.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|My adult daughter and I fight over my kindle all the time.  She is addicted to this game.  But then, so am I!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It meets all my needs to protect and keep my kindle fire clean, neat and safe.  It is convient to use.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|As you get up into the higher levels you really have to think.  I've had to buy 15 cheats so far and I'm up to 13x13's
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|I like Denzel Washington.  He is an awesome actor. The story was interesting and identifies issues we have in the present time with flying.  Airlines should own up and take responsibilities if their product has a problem.  If it is Pilot error, Pilots should own up also.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love the book. The subject of child abuse s very sad and unfortunately is still current. The pure love of the young coup keys beautiful; I fell in love with both of them with their beauty and strength they carry.
1616550414|5.0|This book met and surpassed my expectations of it. The artwork and storytelling were amazing. Every page was a surprise to me.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|We love this movie.. we bought 2 .. one for our house and one for my in-laws for Christmas.  We got the one for 3D as well it's amazing.
B002KKCVQO|5.0|Tough as nails - Tevas are great! You won't be sorry! I'm very happy with this purchase. Good construction and finish.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|This is a fantastic cd, and I'm not one that usually likes bands doing cover songs. But Adrenaline Mob is not your average band, and they do more than justice to these songs:  they make them fresh, modern, and heavier than the originals (which are great songs in their own right, so they are starting off with great material to cover).<br /><br />I have always liked Russell Allen in Symphony X (which led me to  Adrenaline Mob in the first place), and I think he's got some of the best vocal chords around.  He always reminded me of Ronnie James Dio, and this cd really makes that connection. They cover two Dio songs, one solo and the other from Black Sabbath.  And Allen just nails his performance.  Ronnie would be proud and impressed.<br /><br />Their cover of The Doors \\"Break on Through\\" was refreshing.  I was wondering how they would pull it off when I read the titles before listening to it, as The Doors were not metal and this song in particular was not even hard rock.  But Adrenaline Mob owned it and made it their own.  I hope they are playing this one live.<br /><br />There are not many bands talented enough to cover such a diverse set of cover songs.  But the musicianship honors those that they are covering, from Jimmy Page to Eddie Van Halen to John Bohnam to Ronnie James Dio and on and on. I highly recommend this cd to any fans of Adrenaline Mob, Russell Allen, and the bands that wrote the original tunes.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Revisionist history at its worst.  The Shah of Iran was America's best ally in the Middle East.  A great reformer, among other things he took one of the most illiterate countries in the world and made it one of most educated.  He sent 100,000s of Iranians to the best schools around the world.  You could meet Iranians at almost any university.  The American Left hated the Shah.  My lefty friends were always telling me that the Shah's secret police beat up students.  'Mr. Human Rights' Jimmy Carter despised the Shah, too.  Carter famously told his Cabinet that the U.S. had nothing to fear from a non-aligned Iran.  So Carter threw the Shah under the bus, paving the way for Ayatollah Khomeini and Islamic dictatorship.  It was the happiest day of my lefty friends lives when Khomeini took over.  First the revolution killed 50,000.  Then the Islamists executed 6,000 political prisoners.  Then the Kurds tried to break free and that killed 20,000.  Then Iraq attacked and Khomeini gave the students 'Go to Heaven' passports and marched them by the 10,000s thru Iraqi minefields ahead of the Iranian army.  Every evil alluded to in this movie has Jimmy Carter's bloody fingerprints.  So when his voice-over at the end of the movie claims this partially factual story is a victory of his administration I wanted to throw up.  The Left fought for years for the overthrow of the Shah.  Spinning the resultant disaster as Jimmy Carter hero is pure Hollywood whitewash.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is one of my 'go to' movies when I'm in a lot of pain and need a funny movie to take my mind off of how I am feeling. It was a delightful romp with some older favorite actors.
B00BG08FKK|3.0|First off, let me say I love the movie and its music. I bought the original \\"Highlights\\" soundtrack and couldn't wait for this \\"Deluxe\\" version to be released. I was very disappointed, though, when it arrived and I found that it contains some of the same truncated versions of the songs that were on the \\"Highlights\\" soundtrack, starting with the opening song, \\"Look Down.\\" What, are they going to release a \\"Super Deluxe\\" version in a few months that gives you the full version that was in the movie? Not cool.<br /><br />Still, all the music that's here is outstanding... it's great to finally own \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" \\"Paris/Look Down\\" and so many other awesome songs. Just be aware that some of them are cut short, which is really tough to justify in a \\"Deluxe\\" 2-disc soundtrack.
B003O86FMW|5.0|That book was even crazier than the first book. I can't wait to read the next book. Very good book
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game is definitely a hidden object game and not much else. If you are looking for a really challenging &quot;I spy&quot;, then here it is. Some of the items were literally nearly impossible to find. You may get frustrated waiting for the hint button to recharge to help find the next couple items. Not much to the story line, it seems intriguing at first, but just sort of dies out and leaves a feeling of dissapointment at the end. If you are looking for a more interactive, in depth game I suggest trying out &quot;Wraths of Eden.&quot; or &quot;Nightmare, a Cursed Heart.&quot; both are very interesting and well worth the $4.99.
B001BKG9RQ|2.0|Who can argue with the songs Pink Floyd's David Gilmour has composed and sung? It goes w/out saying that the live at Gdansk is a concert for the eyes and ears if you watch the video but... the CD set...well, whomever cut and spliced this into two CD's wasn't appreciating the momentum and tempo that a live concert has when they cut apart each song with 3 sec. of deadair. Wow. I'm more surprised that Gilmour and his folks approved this.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is really really great!  I tried it on the demo, which is really long and allows you to really get a feel for the game. The storyline is interesting and original. After I bought it I still found it interesting and challenging. The hidden objects aren't always super hard, but the involvment of the game really makes up for it. I have played other games from the producers &quot;Artifax mundi.&quot;  (think I spelled that wrong) and really enjoy them. Not sure what I will play now. This really raised my standards for all the other games!
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Love hearing Josh Groban sing his songs but felt that this album wasn't his best nor strongest. I know he went mainstream with his song set but wasn't sold on the whole set of choices.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|100 hours not 100 days of war!<br />He was in an Army squad in Iraq? Really - not company, battalion or brigade?  Just say in the Army and served a tour in ... .<br />And the saying is &#34;I couldn't care less&#34;. Not I could care less!<br />I've read a great number of Baldacci books and this was not well written and poorly edited. Not anywhere near his best work. Probably the worst.

B004FP1WX0|3.0|The movie was ok.  The sound quality i would rate as poor.  At times the film quality was poor as well.
B009738XXM|4.0|Carly Rae Jepsen keeps up with her &#34;teen pop&#34; sound on this album. The songs are fun and catchy! I don't regret buying this one.

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Pitch Perfect is hilarious! It is what I would call &#34;estrogen filled&#34; so my wife seemed to enjoy it much more than I did. But I still laughed pretty hard at some of the great one-liners in this. What makes this even better is that it is a collection with both Blu-ray & DVD; having the digital copy is nice too.

B004Y1WCDE|1.0|I've got to say that I absolutely LOVE Plex on my Roku. I needed a good solution to stream movies from my mac to my roku, and was suprised at how easy it worked.<br /><br />So installing this app on my Kindle Fire seemed like a sure win.<br /><br />Setup and installation was a breeze. It automatically joined my network and instantly loaded all of my videos, etc. But playback was absolutely horrible. Very choppy, audio out of sync, and the picture quality was horrible.<br /><br />This app may work well on other Android devices, but after the abysmal performance on my Kindle Fire, I'm not willing to give it another shot.<br /><br />Very disappointed.

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I totally enjoyed this show and this dvd is a must for all Celine Dion fans. Her talent is awesome and the stage effects are really entertaining.
B00B5A9FLY|2.0|I liked the show until season4, but I must say this ending is a disaster.<br />The mission of Merlin was to save Arthur who is to become the 'Once & Future King' who would bless the Old Religion in the end.<br />This never happened. Merlin served Arthur with his life, but for what?<br />The core scenario of the series seems to be neglected in the final series.<br /><br />--- Spoilers ahead ---<br />Merlin advises Arthur to deny magic so that Mordred will not be saved.<br />His purpose was to build a kingdom where druids and sorcerers are not treated as criminals.<br />At least that is what thought the whole story was about.<br />I almost fell out of my chair when I saw this episode. Overall, the executive producer had no control over the writings.<br /><br />To many open ends untied. So many inconsistencies. I am truly disappointed with the final series.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Another great performance of Charlton Heston depicting one of Spain's influential figures during the Middle Ages. Fantastic scenery and a stirring musical score make this film especially enjoyable to watch.

B003M70O5O|3.0|Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty good. The main actor sucks (Jax) and there is a lot of unneccessary violence in these series.  I started season 3 and got to ep 5 and gave up on it.  I'd rather watch something else or sleep.

B00B99KJR0|4.0|Good game, noticing all the people having problems have similar restrictive devices that always have problems. Amazon should give you folks free apps that actually work on the Kindle. Agree with the one user that says just another Bejeweled game, but dev did a good job adding a story twist. I'd be upset if I paid 4 bucks.

1455113549|5.0|I love books where I don't know what's coming.  Combined with the excellent writing, I look forward to the author's next book.  I listened to this on audible, and the narration was top notch as well.  This book is one that will stay with me for a very long time.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Just to let you know where I'm coming from right up front, I watched this movie on DVD last night, not knowing what to expect, and then watched it again this morning. The first time through, I didn't know if I could trust it, which I could have, and the second time through, I wanted to watch it without the anxiety.<br /><br />Also, I want to say that this movie is so profoundly good, that it's one of my favorite movies of all time, regardless of genre. It has one scene (involves a kiss) between the young high school freshman protagonist, Charlie (Logan Lerman) and a senior girl, Sam (Emma Watson) who is his friend that just simply is the best and emotionally truest I've witnessed on the screen in a quite a while, possibly ever. And I've been around a while. It's not the only amazing scene, it's just the one that blew my heart away.<br /><br />The director is Stephen Chbosky, who also wrote the screenplay and the semi-autobiographical novel from which it was adapted. Although he's been writing for a while, this is only his second directorial outing and his first since 1995. It seems these days that you have to say first what stupid things the movie doesn't do. It doesn't have a lot of ignorant made-up conflict that infects it with embarrassing scenes. It doesn't have a stupid gross-out hook upfront that leaves a bad taste in your mouth the whole movie and spoils memories of it later. Everyone is not against the main character. Universities teach that in screenwriting and all fiction writing actually, the only thing of interest is conflict, and of course that simply isn't true. All our main character's friends, and Charlie has many, are on his side and care about him. So is and so does his family. My God what a concept! And still the story has a deep conflict running through it that holds the story together perfectly, and makes for a much more emotionally felt and intellectually compatible narrative. Truly remarkable.<br /><br />The story concerns a young high school freshman, who has just returned from time spent in a mental hospital. He's apprehensive of his first day at school and with good reason. No one who has known him before in middle school will have anything to do with him. And then at a high school football game, he meets one of his classmates, Patrick (Ezra Miller) a senior, who befriends him, introduces him to Sam, and takes him to a party afterward. Thus begins Charlie's saga with this little band of wallflowers. Logan Lerman is excellent as Charlie, and Emma Watson is just simply breathtaking. I had the feeling Ms Watson had never been allowed to reached her potential as Hermione in the Harry Potter series, and wow! Was I right. Ezra Miller is also simply amazing as Patrick.<br /><br />Although about high school students, this is an adult movie that will be enjoyed by anyone from the age of 12 through senior citizen. Sit back and enjoy yourself. You can trust this one.freshman, who has just returned from time spent in a mental hospital. He's apprehensive of his first day at school and with good reason.

B000069KIZ|4.0|I purchased this thinking I was a bigger Karl Bohm fan than I guess I actually am. This is some of my favorite music, but these interpretations didn't have the swirling richness and density that I love in Brahms. It's still thrilling music, and clearly a great orchestra etc. But it wasn't the ultimate for me.  The trick with Brahms is to not let it feel square. His color is not in ostentatious instrumentation but in the harmonic, rhythmic and contrapuntal depth. These felt a little square and dry and hurried and perfunctory and 2-dimensional to me. But then, who am I to critique Karl Bohm??
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a really good movie.  So much of what is out right now it either bullet, blood and explicitives or drugs, alcohol and sex.  It was nice to be able to watch a movie with my teenagers that didn't embarass me to be in the room!!

It is silly but also helps in teaching colors and she even contributes to reading the book with me,  needless to say by this time I know the book by heart without needing the actual book. A must have for every child! I'm buying another as a gift!

Given where we are in a sluggish recovery, we could grow the economy, produce needed jobs, and convert the deficit into a more manageable proportion of our GDP if we were to increase spending on items like needed infrastructure repairs.<br /><br />Our politicians should have their salaries put on sequester until they read and understand the themes of this book.

B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Since this was may very first novel by this author, I did not know what to expect.  I'm not an avid reader, I only read when I can spare the time, so as a result, it took me quite awhile to finish this book.  I don't know if it was me, or if it was kind of slow-going.  It did give the reader a chance to get to know the characters and I can see now why......Hoover's many books sort of go into each of the characters lives.  The characters remain intact in each of the other stories, I presume.  I would still recommend it, it kept my attention throughout the book even though it took me a few weeks to read it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is one of those books, where after you've finished reading it, it leaves you completely devastated.  Not because it was a bad read, but because it's over.  It's one of those books that after you've finished reading it, your still thinking about days after the fact that you've finished it.  This book is what really turned me onto contemporary romance novels.  I was a die hard paranormal/dystopian society book junkie.  After reading this book though, I literally had to google \\"books like beautiful disaster by Jamie McGuire\\".  Surprisingly, I wasn't the only one who had done this.  I would definitely recommend this book and cannot wait for \\"Walking Disaster\\" to come out.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great Book! I started reading this, the second book in the series, with the intention of taking my time and reading a couple of chapters a night. However, once I started reading I was four hours into and halfway through the book before I realized what time it was. I finished the next night. The story, having gotten to know and become invested in the lives of the characters, was so captivating that I couldn't put it down. As I am writing this know I find myself wandering where these characters will end up and how will they accomplish it in the next book. Garcia and Stohl have created a wonderous work of fiction. The writers added another element to the already packed first book by embarking the characters on a quest of sorts. The storyline pulls you in but an emotional investment in the characters keeps you turning pages long after you should be sleeping. I loved that the authors did not write this book and leave major plot or character developments hanging in the unknown at the end. They made clear the story was not over and they left some of the characters in various states of their own personal crisis, but they wrapped up this story at just the right place. To anyone thinking of reading this book, do it. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to loose themselves in a book for a while. Once you start reading it you will find that it delves deep into the fantastical, the magical, the strength of the human spirit and love; many forms of love.

B00B10HAO2|3.0|Alfred Hitchcock is rightly regarded as one of the greatest movie directors of all time, and \\"Psycho\\" is rightly regarded as one of his greatest films.<br /><br />So how better to tell the story than with a light, tongue-in-cheek tale about Hitchcock's marital woes and battles with the studio? \\"Hitchcock\\" is a fun movie with some genuinely brilliant acting, particularly by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren, and it does show us how even the greatest have to fight for their art. But it also shies away from any kind of depth.<br /><br />In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock (Hopkins) had another runaway success with \\"North by Northwest,\\" but is bothered by a reporter's implication that his best work is behind him. While the studios offer him their best (such as adapting \\"Casino Royale\\"), Hitchcock wants to reclaim the raw artistic thrill of his younger days. So he decides to adapt a bestselling horror novel, \\"Psycho.\\"<br /><br />His wife Alma (Mirren) quickly warms to the idea, despite wanting to do her own writing projects with her friend Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston). But the studio balks, forcing Hitchcock to finance the movie with his own money.<br /><br />But Alma is soon annoyed by studio meddling and Hitchcock's constant ogling of the beautiful blonde Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). Hitchcock begins to suspect that Alma is having an affair with Whit, and the stress takes a toll on both his health and the movie shoot. At the same time, he is plagued with insecurities about the movie's future, and whether it will sink his career.<br /><br />Hitchcock is a man who is still something of an enigma today, but \\"Hitchcock\\" doesn't really try to explore him in any depth. Instead, it dances between the Hitchcocks' marital problems and the trials of making a movie that no studio wants anything to do with -- and it does it with a wry, witty touch that borders on comedy without ever quite crossing the line.<br /><br />The writing tends to be airy and clever, especially when the writers dabble in Hitchcock's notorious macabre streak (\\"By the way try the finger sandwiches... they're real fingers,\\" he remarks when showing people pictures of a serial killer's work). In fact, he's at his most charming when he's lighthearted, such as the little stabby dance he does outside the theater on opening night.<br /><br />However, I felt that \\"Hitchcock\\" avoided handling its story with any depth. The marital spat is cleared up too quickly and cleanly, and his controlling nature towards the \\"Hitchcock blondes\\" is briefly touched on but never really explored. And Hitchcock's conversations with an imaginary Ed Gein seemed strangely out of sync with the tone of the overall movie.<br /><br />But Hopkins plays Hitchcock as a genial, witty man with some darker sides, and he mimics Hitchcock's speech and body language nicely. On the flipside, Mirren plays Alma as a fiery, intelligent woman who is content to remain in her husband's shadow, but also wants to be appreciated for it. And James D'Arcy and Scarlett Johansson do fine smaller roles as Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.<br /><br />\\"Hitchcock\\" is not a bad movie, just a lightweight one -- excellent acting, a somewhat flimsy story, and plenty of behind-the-scenes woes for a now-beloved movie. See it for the performances and the banter.dabble in Hitchcock's notorious macabre streak (\\"By the way try the finger sandwiches... they're real fingers,\\" he remarks when showing people pictures of a serial killer's work).

I no longer find the award shows stimulating because I just don't relate to the majority of what serves as &#34;hot, hit music&#34; today. In a year when &#34;Motown: The Musical&#34; is finally coming to fruition, but, Clive Davis unexpectedly released his second autobiography, you see the difference in quality and endurance between two men who have both known their share of hits and worked with stars. Berry Gordy's light shines ever so brightly because just like &#34;Motown: The First Decade&#34; was the definitive boxset of a label to ever be released, &#34;Motown 25&#34; was life-altering winning the Emmy for Best Television Special and captured Michael Jackson's &#34;Moonwalk&#34; for the ages, during its 50th Anniversary, &#34;Motown: The Musical&#34; celebrates the legacy of easily one of the greatest music labels and its great visionary, Berry Gordy. Whereas, Clive Davis repeats chart stats as if they are part of the lexicon of American Life, when it clearly does not save for maybe Whitney's career, which ironically was patterned after Diana Ross' at least in the beginning. So what does this have to do with &#34;The 20/20 Experience&#34;? Graduates of the Disney school from Justin to X-Tina to Ryan Gosling, learned the business through the old way by lots of rehearsal and living the blood, sweat and tears of their success. Upon initial listening, &#34;Suit & Tie&#34; grabbed me right a way. Because and due to its classic sound. He proved the alibum's consistency with his performance of the 2nd song. The reason I will never be able to give any Timberlake release that fifth star has little to do with his current music. It has more to do with the fact that he has still walked away from that Super Bowl wardrobe malfunctioning with his &#34;Suit & Tie&#34; on. Janet Jackson is still gathering what's left of her music career, relegated to celebrating her marriage to the admittedly super wealthy and sexy Wissam Al Mana. So I guess she is still in &#34;control&#34; of her finances. I'm glad I only paid a measly $7 for this, well, experience. Here it is almost 2 years later and I'm still loving this experience. Just discovered a new favorite &#34;You Got it On&#34;! Such a mini masterpiece that truly deserved to win the Grammy Album of the Year!!!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is an incredible movie EVERY guy should watch weather you are a Dad, plan to become one, are there as one, want to be one, or need to become one. Great movie, powerful and inspiring message. A must have for REAL men.
B006MBX90O|5.0|A lot of people (not that many actually) complain that this show either has no plot or that it is convoluted. Well, I guess that would be there opinion were it not for the fact that is simply false, opinions aside. A simple search online would explain to you the plot. May be they were impatient and didn't want to wait, after all the audience is not supposed to understand everything in the first few episodes. Then there are people who say that this show just rips off other sources of horror. My only response would be for them to speak to the people that say the plot is too complicated. Overall, I would say this show is pretty dang good and I recommend it. Also, obviously it's TV MA, so there's going to be some of \\"that\\" stuff in it. Sex and violence galore. Also, you'll see this in the first episode, a character cuts themselves frequently, so beware if you're sensitive to that topic.

B000W93CHC|2.0|REVIEWED BY LAURA<br /><br />It pains me, seriously pains me, to have to write this review. Me, who wants to shout Ken Follett's name from the rooftops! Who wants to evangelize the Follett really-long-historical-fiction gospel! [[ASIN:B002570J0M The Pillars of the Earth]] was THE book of 2012 for me. And I won't say that WORLD WITHOUT END didn't have promise, or even some very, very good parts. As my blogmate Emily would probably say, \\"Even a subpar Ken Follett book is better than most books.\\" (I'm paraphrasing; I don't think she's read any Ken Follett, but the sentiment is the same.) And, interestingly, I think if I had read this book without having read Pillars I might have been seriously charmed. But coming right on the heels of Pillars it was hard not to compare, and WORLD WITHOUT END just doesn't measure up.<br /><br />It's loosely considered a sequel to Pillars, but it actually takes place 200 years after the events of Pillars. So, really, it's not a sequel at all, except that it takes place in the same village. Very occasionally a character will make reference to being distantly related to a character from the previous book (Jack, Aliena, Tom), but that's pretty much it. Oh, except for the fact that the PLOTS CONTAIN ALMOST ALL OF THE SAME ELEMENTS. Unrequited love that goes on for decades? Check. Treachery and perfidy involving the church and who gets to be appointed prior/bishop? Check. A man with an ambition to build the biggest/highest/best building in England? Check. A mysterious occurrence at the beginning of the novel that isn't understood until the last chapter? Check.<br /><br />The one thing that this book had that Pillars didn't was the plague. Which was actually interesting for a while. Medicine was so rudimentary at the time that they didn't really catch on that the plague was, you know, a COMMUNICABLE disease. And even when the thinkers of the time did sort of cotton on to the fact that people who came in contact with people with the plague were more likely to get it, they thought it was (I kid you not) transmitted through looking at people. The plague traveling right through your eyes to infect other people! So, as I said, super interesting from a historical medicine point of view. THE FIRST TIME. When the plague comes back, 10 years later, it's just...enough with the plague! We get it! It has served its plot and educational purpose!<br /><br />Oh, this book also had nuns. So that's a plus, if you like nuns.<br /><br />As I've said before, Ken Follett books usually center on the characters for me. And this one's characters were just...sort of dull. Merthin and Caris were OK. (Merthin = Jack; Caris = Aliena; they are star-crossed, etc.) Philemon and Godwyn were yucky. Gwenda was a nice enough gal, though Wulfric was kind of a moron. Ralph was horrible. The trouble was, I wasn't really rooting for any of them. I know I was supposed to root for Merthin and Caris, but they both drove me nuts.<br /><br />And then there's a plot line right in the middle of the book that is so ridiculous I almost laughed out loud. I think I can talk about it without giving too much away. So, Caris is a nun and she lives in the convent and finds out that there has been some SERIOUS WRONGDOING by the monks at the monastery. Now this is all taking place while the King of England is fighting one of his infinite fruitless wars in France for no apparent reason. So Caris feels that the best plan of action is for her and another nun (Mair) to JOURNEY TO FRANCE to talk to their bishop about this wrongdoing. While he is fighting a war with the king! Seriously? Yes, seriously. (If you're wondering how a bishop could be part of the army, it's complicated. They can't instigate but if they're attacked they can fight back, or something. It's a total loophole to the whole \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" mandate.) Anyway, Caris and Mair travel all the way to France to catch up to the bishop and the king's army. And, predictably, when they catch up with the guy, he's like, um, hello. I am fighting a war. Could this issue about stealing money possibly wait until people with swords are not trying to kill me? K, thanks. Buh-bye now.<br /><br />And the whole mysterious thing that happens at the beginning of the book that you have to wait until the very end to find out about? Total nonstarter. I mean, by that point, I didn't care what the surprise was, as it seemed to have little practical relevance to anyone I really cared about. And the final scene of the book can only be described as a Titanic moment (\\"I'm king of the world!\\") (and I'm totally not using that as a complimentary reference).<br /><br />Now, there is the distinct possibility that if I had read this book WITHOUT reading Pillars it would have blown my mind. Because there is a lot of cool stuff that happens. It's just not as cool the second time around. So if you have not heeded my advice to read Pillars, you really might enjoy this one. Another option would be to read this one like a few years after Pillars, so maybe everything will seem a little fresher and less repetitive. All I can say is that listening to them back to back was not a brilliant plan.<br /><br />I would, of course, like to take a moment to mention the narrator, my BFF John Lee. (Using the term BFF a little loosely, obviously, seeing as he is unaware of my existence.) He is still amazing and it's not his fault that I didn't like this very much. I especially love how he said the word \\"Lolla\\" during this book. It was pretty sweet.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />If you read only one Ken Follett book in your life, please don't let it be this one. If you loved Pillars and feel the need to dive right into another medieval adventure, might I suggest waiting a bit? It's not a bad book, but unfortunately it suffered from my sky-high expectations.<br /><br />RATING: C- (2½ stars)e guy, he's like, um, hello. I am fighting a war.

B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This game was ok. very short only took about two hours to finish. Over all I would recommend this game.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|I believe I have not heard this album/CD in it's entirety for at least 40 years. So, I've been ordering lots of my old faves here at Amazon lately, including this and Crown of Creation. The real surprise is the ballads and mid-road tunes like \\"Today\\"  (amazing), he haunting \\"Come Back to Me\\", and a couple which sound a bit like the Mamas and Papas. Even the raucious \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\" which is explained in the excellent notes (which also go into this band's relationship with the Jerry Garcia, plus lots more). The fact is this band had everything: top musicianship, songs in every range (haunting ballads, Bluesy blasters, great singing/ harmonies, by different vocalists, plus the best rock female vocalist ever...Grace Slick!...So way beyond the two hits here \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\", there is a lot on this album, their first with Grace. At least as good as say, Sgt. Pepper, or Pet Sounds, the songs here seem more \\"grown up\\" than either. Plus the add-ons are worth listening to, including another good moderate ballad..No doubt this was the top late USA 1960's rock-pop band, since they came along as the Byrds had hit their peak, and the Beach Boys were simply not with it then(!)...So after over 45 years years, no doubt this stands the time test. Again, just listen to \\"Today\\", and you'll agree I'm not exaggerating!)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this was not my usual choice for tv shows. but everyone was talking about it so i gave it a try. i watched all of season 2 and 3 in one weekend. i am hooked.  can't wait for season 4. this is GOOD tv. wish there were more shows like this.
0312360258|1.0|If you're looking for a shallow, judgmental, hypocritical and all together unoriginal heroine-you've found her.<br />From the first page, the Casts expose readers to a protagonist who is neither a good role-model nor thought-provoking. In order to draw the reader's attention they use the typical claws of mocking religion, handsome consorts and pop culture references. Their writing is highly repetitive and they use flashy plot twists to draw away the reader's attention from their lack of english mastery.<br />This book, and the series in general, is written in a markedly dull and mundane style with a clear absence of thought relying on teenage drama to pull the reader in.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i was hesitant at first to even bother watching this show. once i realized i could watch it on my ipad i tried it and was hooked. this show is so enjoyable to watch. the dowager (maggie smith) is a real hoot. i just wish there were more shows like this on tv. i'm so tired of the violence and corruption on tv today.<br />although i had to pay for season three, i cannot wait for season 4.

B0078X2LKY|4.0|Good book that my parents read to me.  Now I get to read it to my girls.  Don't like that I'm forced to review it, though.
1416905014|5.0|This book is a &#34;must have&#34; for every family with children, or even for those without children.  It has the most unbelievably complex pop-ups!  The story line is well told. I would not advise allowing children under 12 use the book alone, as the pop-ups are a bit delicate and you will most assuredly want to keep this book as a family heirloom and in good condition.  Both children and adults are mesmerized by the detail and number of pop-ups in the book.  My 2 yr old granddaughter likes to look inside Cinderella's house and the barn (to see the cow).  The figures &#34;dance&#34; in the ballroom.  The rat magically transforms into a coachman.  Cinderella's beautiful gown magically changes back to rags. The coach is beautiful, as is the enormous castle.  This book is ridiculously reasonably priced.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I wanted a free alarm clock, and my son suggested this one.  It lets you use tones or playlists, and works even when the Kindle is turned off.  You have option for specific days of the week as well.  For example, I use my heavy metal playlist for when I have to wake up early on Monday and Wednesday, my fun playlist for Tuesday and Thursday when I can sleep in until 9, and my instrumental to gently wake me on weekends.  And you can set all of those at the same time, so you don't have to go in and set the right one every day.  It automatically keeps track of the days for you.  I was very impressed.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I have watched  the show already, and I thought that the book would be closely related but I was very surprised to see that the book was certainly different than the show. I loved the dynamics of the characters and thinking that Dexter could or could not be the Bay Harbour Butcher the whole time. I also loved that the characters were so different from the show.Excellent read!

B00684J49U|5.0|Greys anatomy and have every season. i watched the entire 9th season (so far) online last night and cant wait for the dvd set to come out! I always reserve my copy. It's so odd how they become your friends (and enemies!). I missed the entire season to the 19 th episode which i watched until 4:30 this morning. I missed my friends so much! I was exhausted but so excited my friends were back, I got to work EARLY!! (i know i know, makes no sense and im a wack job!)
B00AF6B22E|4.0|I thought the movie was great! Brought me to places I didn't expect it to go.<br />Shows what can happen to even the most talented among us by substance abuse.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|I got a brand new Blu-Ray  copy of this movie through amazon for a mere $3.99. Unbelievable. It took a while to get here, but for the price, big deal.<br /><br />Actually, what a deal!<br /><br />Recommended.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is by far the best book I ever read to date. Very intimate details into his private and business life.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I was first turned on to this movie by my Arizonian cousins whom we visited when I was in the 4th grade, first encountering this movie on their B&W TV. It scared the crap out of me, even though I had no idea what \\"monsters from the id\\" were, nor did I figure out at that young age that Dr Morbeus' thoughts were being transformed into the invisible monster that was killing everything in its path, even after viewing the picture a number of times.<br /><br />Needless to say, this film has been one of my favs for over 40 years. I've owned it on VHS, DVD and now, BD. The BD transfer is incredible, the best ever. It's better than the DVD, and the differences aren't at all subtle. It's really clear and crisp, with just the right amount of film grain that's typical of 1950s sci-fi fare. I have no regrets with buying this film yet again in the BD format.<br /><br />The sound is also great on this BD. Dialogue comes through cleanly and is well balanced against the sound effects.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|i just had to read the book before seeing the movie and i was glad I did.  Always better this way.
B000001GS0|3.0|There are dozens of complete Brahms Symphony cycles available on CD. This mono set from DG features the Berlin Philharmonic under Eugene Jochum. As such, it comes into direct comparison with Jochum's later, stereo remakes on EMI with the LPO, and Karajan's various stereo sets on DG with the Berlin Phil. This mono set places third in such comparisons.<br /><br />The interpretations are quite enjoyable, but I have concerns about the recorded sound, which is quite thin, even for its day. Over the years I've come to realize that the sound RCA provided for Toscanini was in many cases superior to what other labels were providing at the same time. At least it's more natural.<br /><br />Nice to have this set available again, but it's really only for die-hard collectors.
0767840135|5.0|Wasn't sure what I was expecting, but really liked this performance.  Great physical feats of strength, gymnastics and aerial stunts
B006SAR6P8|5.0|I got this brand new through amazon for a mere $3.99. It took a while to get here, so I assume I wasn't the only person who jumped at the bargain.
0765325950|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for some time and had even stopped asking at the bookstores, so when I saw it had been released, jumped on it.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|No need to comment on the film itself, which is a classic.<br /><br />The BD transfer is spectacular. The soundtrack sounds great, too. I like the Blu-Ray Book format, which adds just an extra whiff of &#34;nice&#34; to the packaging.<br /><br />Worth owning on BD, even if it means double dipping to replace your DVD.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|This was a very good product; I very much enjoyed the music. I wish it had included more songs though.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|The winner of Seven Academy Awards, \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" gets a wonderful remastering on this BluRay through a 4K restoration from the original negative. The results are spectacular, with David Lean's vistas as impressive as always. The acting is uniformly top notch, especially from the leads, who are cast perfectly. David Lean was broke at the time he made this movie, and yet he produced a triumph that established him as THE go-to director of big Hollywood epics.<br /><br />I'm also pleased with the soundtrack, which comes up exceptionally clean in this 5.1 surround mix. That's not always the case with films released on BD, even when copious amounts of cash have been spent on the visual element. This disc sounds great, with no hiss from the pre-digital source and with good, clean dialogue and crisp sound effects. Malcolm Arnold's musical score comes to life brilliantly, better still if your viewing space allows you to boost the volume control to something like theater level.<br /><br />Home viewing of \\"Bridge\\" was just waiting for the advent of HDTV, and the larger the screen you have, the better it will look.<br /><br />The extras on this disc are enjoyable, especially \\"The Making of BotRK,\\" which gives one an in-depth background on what went into making this movie. And, yes, they DID build a full-sized bridge and they did blow up the same...and it did have an actual train crossing it when they blew it up.<br /><br />This is a film that deserved all those Oscars and all the acclaim it's received over the decades, from a period when big budget Hollywood pictures meant BIG in every respect. I have to chuckle in bemusement at the amazon reviewers who can't seem to get how great this film is, from the story to the actors to the direction to the cinematography. It didn't win all those Oscars for nothing.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This version isn't just straight Sudoku.  It has so many different types of Sudoku puzzles it's awesome.  I love the &#34;Jigsaw&#34; games in which the zones aren't defined as merely 3x3 squares, but can be almost any shape.  There are also &#34;Asterisk&#34;, &#34;Centerdot&#34;, &#34;Color&#34;, &#34;Hyper&#34;, &#34;Percent&#34;, and X-Sudoku.  Asterisk requires not only that each zone, column and row have 1-9, but also that the highlighted squares (in this case, in the form of an asterisk) have the numbers 1-9.  This also goes for Centerdot, percent and x-Sudoku.  Hyper-Sudoku appears to consist of the normal 9 3x3 zones, but also four additional 3x3 zones overlaid on the game, shifted one column and row inward from the outer 8 zones.  I can only imagine how much challenge this is going to be.  Color-Sudoku consists of the standard 9 &#34;3x3&#34; zones, but each square in every zone is color coded and all squares of a specific color must contain the digits 1-9.<br /><br />I've played X, Color and Jigsaw so far so my assessment of the others might be somewhat in error at this time but none the less, this version is infinitely more enjoyable and challenging than the straight 3x3 - 9x9 Sudoku puzzles.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|I last owned this film on Laser disc, which was OK for its time. Obviously, I was due for an upgrade on this film!<br /><br />The BD print is incredible, especially the sound, which I find to be a major improvement from the laser disc and from the Sony CD I have of the soundtrack (\\"The Story of Kong\\"). One of the joys of a good BD transfer/remaster occurs when the studio spends some time and money on the soundtrack, removing blemishes, pops, cracks and wheezes, eliminating as much of the old scratchiness as is possible without harming the original sound source. That has been accomplished in spades here - this film now looks AND sounds as good as it ever has or probably ever will. This important piece of film history belongs in every collection.<br /><br />I like the Blu-Ray Book format which gives collectors a little bit of an extra for their money.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I follow up on alot of the marvel comic heros because of my son.He loves the comics thus I have to take him to see them in the movies and end up buying the dvd.I really like the way they had all five of the main marvel characters in one great movie.That was a good idea and I hope they combine others for furure movies!I I'm  just saying it was a good idea to have them work as a team  with alot of action and special effects.Our whole family can watch this movie with no disappointments or bad language!  Anyone that likes the super heros will want this one for their personal collection.

So sad that companies no longer send manuals with their products anymore. But then I guess that's why they created search engines to drive me crazy trying to find what I want. Too old for this trying to figure all the ins and outs of computers.<br />But,not too old to keep trying. Good for the old brain cells.
0062014102|5.0|I have a copy of this book that dates back over twenty years, and still read a chapter or so every now and then. Talbot's view of the universe as a super-hologram is difficult to conceptualize at first, probably due to our unfamiliarity with the structure and functions of holograms themselves, over and above the difficulty of becoming acquainted with some of the more esoteric concepts of particle physics. I especially found the sections on Fatima, UFOs, etc. as interesting to reread in the light of more recent excursions into what is now called &#34;high-strangeness&#34; by others such as Jacques Vallee in [[ASIN:1585428205 Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times]]. Talbot has now reissued his earlier edition of his book with a new forward, but his untimely passing makes one wonder what he would have made of the discovery of the Higgs boson and other developments in particle physics which would have led to a revised and expanded rewrite. Interesting and well worth the read, much less dated than you might expect. You may not fully grasp the holographic theory, but you will certainly be entertained and enlightened by other elements of his thought. Actually, this is an interesting if unintended introduction to Jacques Vallee's concept of high strangeness.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I installed this app out of curiosity; 4400+ 5-star reviews must mean something, right? This app is clearly for kids under 8 and should be advertised as such. So I uninstalled.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've been working out for quite some time and tried all various programs. Bigger, Leaner, Stronger is a great and pragmatic guideline that covers all relevant factors (working out, nutrition, rest, etc.)<br />I can already see first progress after starting to implement the first things from the book. I know it's still a way to go but Mike does a great job providing you with a 360 view on how to get the body you want. By also covering the aspect of motivation and goal setting, you should have the full drive to stick with the program and to finally achieve your goals.<br />I will definitely keep going with it and am quite positive.<br />In addition to the book you should also check out Mike's website, facebook page, etc.<br />He is totally accessible and replies very fast when you contact him - that is definitely another huge PLUS.<br />Thanks again for this great book and your support, Mike!

I almost didn't read the series because of the low 3rd book reviews but I am so glad I did it was amazing every single book loved them all!!! I read this last book in a 24 hour period *** it is a must read series ***
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Seen it in the theater and cant wait to watch again expecially in 3D . Start of a new collection
B005LAIIGC|2.0|I will probably send this back. Had trouble with both discs. The Blu-Ray disc would not play in our player but the regular disc did. The next day we took to to someone's house to play it and the regular disc would not play all the way through. Such a shame since the movie is actually a good movie.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Surprisingly good....a little trickier than the original and just different enough to feel new. You can still use what you know from 1 but 2 requires new skills.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is the best I love it my sister plays it all the time the best game of all time 2nd best this game is after subway surfers
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Must read for multiple generations. Those of us who where involved in the women's movement of the 60s-70s- wonder why it stalled. What are the messages we continue to give to our daughters?  &#34;What does having it all&#34; really mean on an individual level?<br />Sheryl .. is right on target.. women need to better understand their inner negative voice, support each other as we advance up the corporate ladder or start/own our own business, improve our ability to affirm own worth, negotiate employment contracts & hang with men & women who will re-enforce our positive image as we move forward- in business & life.

1451695195|5.0|...of an extraordinary experience, that perhaps only a neurosurgeon could appreciate fully.  He KNEW his brain was gone, completely; and therefore, that what he experienced could only have come from elsewhere.  That 'elsewhere'?  From consciousness.  A realm of.  Some parts of which he had the honor to go exploring in, and come back to tell the tale, from a scientist's perspective and in a layman's language.<br /><br />This is not a scientific paper.  It is the story of one man's journey into the unknown, who has helped us know it better.  An uncommon read.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Excellent piece of suspenseful story telling. Not to be missed. Spacey at his best.  The copy I got was flawless and too reasonably priced to pass up.
1616550414|5.0|This is a great book, I recommend it to all Legend of Zelda fans, you'll love it.<br />Some (like me) may think that their favorite games don't have enough content, but it isn't a problem as long as you are able to think &#34;Well this would have 5,000 pages if it had everything that I wanted&#34;.<br />Very beautiful edition and high quality material 5/5
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am very pleased with this SLR backpack. It's big enough to carry all my gear (body, 2 lenses, lens hoods, charger, etc...) but it's also small enough that it won't weigh you down trekking around with it.  Just took it with me to the ocean and I am extremely happy and would recommend it to anyone.
0807014273|5.0|This book helped me realize just how strong a human being is, it also made me realize that there are good and bad people, by choice not chance.  People do what they want to do period.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I loved this book,  couldnt stop reading.  I enjoyed it and told my fiance and he started reading and couldnt put it down.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Not quite finished with season 2 yet. Hope I don't have to pay for season 3, because I don't think that is fair.
B000687M48|5.0|This a a good live album we would recommend it to others who enjoy listening to the band Evanescence or live music.
