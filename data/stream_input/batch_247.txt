630451087X|4.0|I just started getting into David Lynch's films, and just like the rest of his films, Lost Highway is an acquired taste.  I sat down and watched this with my girlfriend who kept recommending Lost Highway to me, so finally I managed to watch it, and just like Lynch's other movies, it takes more than one sitting to make any sense out of the entire thing.  The storyline can be explained by the Amazon review, but there are parts that feel too drawn out, and the largely incoherent storyline just adds fuel to the fire.  However, there are quite a few redeeming qualities.  Lynch's style over substance direction is at it's peak here, his best since Blue Velvet, the casting is superb, and the dialogue is great, and sometimes just plain hysterical (especially at the scene where Robert Loggia's character expreeses his views on driving to someone who was tailgating him).  While Lost Highway isn't as good as Lynch's previous Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and the recent Mulholland Drive, this movie is far from a failure.  The ensemble cast includes Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette, Balthazar Getty, Robert Blake, Robert Loggia, Gary Busey, Henry Rollins, and cameo appearences by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez as a couple of unlucky porno actors.  The soundtrack is worth noting as well, featuring fantastic music by Manson, Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, Smashing Pumpkins, and Rammstein that help carry the film.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|When I saw the previews for this movie I was skeptical. <BR>The highlights looked funny but made me wonder if the highlights were the only funny parts. Well, the movie is hilarious. Stiller is great. To me, it ranks right up there with Austin Powers and I hope there is another one. Buy it. Watch it over and over again and you'll laugh every time. Will Ferrell is perfect, Owen Wilson is great and the two leading women {Chris Taylor and Milla Jovovich) are incrediby good looking....
B000066I6N|4.0|The few negative reviews this album received are probably reacting to maturity in the work and interpreting it as failure.  A mature artist relaxes; they don't have to prove too much anymore.  No, this album has none of the incandescent fire of Old Led Zep.  Plant doesn't have to do that anymore.  I like that about a number of older artists that have released albums this year (Bonnie Raitt, Boz Scaggs among others).  Their presentation and style might seem bored, slack, nonchalant, sloppy, etc.  But it's not.  It's the grace of old age showing up in their art.  All Robert Plant wants to do is present some of his favorite songs presented in a very mature, measured blues/rock/psychadelia style and let the listener appreciate those songs. Mission accomplished.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I have to say I enjoyed the heck out of this DVD and I agree with most of the reviews.  I hate that I missed this tour.  Actually, I don't believe they brought it down to Houston, or if they did I must have been dead at the time, but I got better.  The main thing I've got to say about this DVD is . . . Wow! There are some really cute women in the orchestra!!!!  I mean about the only time we see Steve Howe really smile is when they come out and dance during \\"Roundabout.\\"  Must admit, that put a smile on my face as well!!!!  YES is so awesome, I hope like heck that they take care of themselves so that they will be with us for a long, long, long time.  Enjoy.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Apocalypse Now.A true classic,and one of the greatest films in history.It shows the horror of vietnam more than any other movie about vietnam.There are excellent performances by Martin Sheen,Robert Duvall,but Brando in his 15 minutes is the best.The story goes like this burned out Captain Willard(Sheen)is sent on a classified mission to kill a renegade colonel named Kurtz(Brando) who is living with a group of vietnamese somewhere up-river in the heart of Cambodia.He and other men who he does not tell what he is going to do or where he is going go off on a search to find Kurtz.With oscar-winning cinematography and great performances this film is a hit.Now here is the problem.''REDUX''.The new scenes are boring and don't add nothing.Like the french plantation scene it is long,boring,and just shows the crew and the frenchmen sitting down talking and eating dinner.It is very long and the frenchmen are boring.They talk about why they are there and what not which doesn't matter because is to find and kill Kurtz.However the only half-way decent thing it does add is that Willard says he will not go back to america after the war.One of the other scenes is with the playmates that feautures the crew exchanging sex with the ladies for gasoline.This scene makes the crew and the playmates look like idiot.Like when one of the playmate's is having sex with one of the crew men sha talks about the animals she has in the helicopter.Stupid.There are also other lame scenes that are both some short and some long.I suggest to all people buy the original version and skip ''REDUX''.
6304316267|5.0|I love this movie, it's classic, 1970s, scofflaw fun. BUT-- If you're buying used, BEWARE. The one I purchased is a cleaned-up version. I don't know what gives there, but listening to Burt Reynolds say \\"shoot\\" an octave lower then the rest of his sentence, thanks to faulty editing, sort of ruined it for me, and that's not the only fault that was edited. A scene where he and Farrah make out was also deleted, and pretty much any cussing was dubbed over. If anyone has an explanation, I'd like to hear it.

B00005JLDW|3.0|Although I do think that I enjoyed this movie, I was a bit dissapointed.  There were only 2 real dragon fights and the accents were a bit too heavy to understand at times.  The special effects were incredible and the dragons truly life-like.  The characters were not as developed and at times seemed rather detached.  A generally good flick...perhaps a renter or matinee instead of Saturday night.
6303471714|1.0|The only part of this video I find useful is the ab work, and I tend to slow it down a bit, not relying on momentum to do the work.  I also use the standing arm work (as opposed to the floor work) and slow the reps to how ever many I can do in the amount of time for each set.  She moves way too fast and her form is awful.  She also has an erratic pace, getting faster and faster and then seeming to slow down as she gets tired. I wouldn't recommend this tape.
B000068PQ0|3.0|by the Flaming Lips. I had to pipe in with my own two cents' worth after seeing so much inordinate praise being bandied around---five stars? Please. One reviewer commented that the praise stemmed from buyers' desire to \\"legitimize\\" their purchase, another compared \\"Yoshimi\\" to Rolling Stone's Emotional Rescue, and yet another observed that this album sounds \\"neutered;\\" I am inclined, to a certain degree, to agree with all assessments. Flaming Lips has eschewed acoustic-based instruments for the most part in favor of a synthetic-sounding, computer-generated amalgamation of interesting sounds, yes, but where are the layered and intricate guitars of Clouds Taste Metallic, the interesting and unexpected sequeways of Soft Bulletin, the playfulness of Transmissions? Nowehere to be found here, unfortunately. \\"Yoshimi\\" is a continuation of sorts to Soft Bulletin, but it lacks a vital element, and key to Flaming Lips' sound: playfulness. Fun, in other words. Zaireeka, Clouds Taste Metallic and Soft Bulletin sounded as if the band was having fun, but there is something about \\"Yoshimi\\" that seems flat and dispirited, forced and unnatural, as if they felt obligated to mine the same vein as Soft Bulletin. Of course there are moments that redeem the album---\\"Approaching,\\" \\"Fight Test\\" and \\"Ego Tripping\\" are among them---but much of the album by comparison seems a little dull and routine. God, I hate to be so critical of a band I admire so much---and Wayne Coyne (sp?) seems like a nice guy to boot---but criticize I must, especially when other ... customers might be misled by obviously biased and sycophantic reviews. Though pretty, \\"Yoshimi\\" barely sustains multiple listens and lacks the layering, complexity and, most important, the giddy adventurousness of other Flaming Lips albums. Let's hope the next effort is just as much a departure as \\"Soft Bulletin\\" was, and actually sounds like the band WANTED to make it.
0316666343|3.0|Overrated to be sure, not as good as expected after the hype by Book of the Month authority.<BR>Subject was timely, straight from the newspaper but lacked the depth I kept waiting for. I did have trouble putting it down to see what would happen next but wanted to know the characters better. I did enjoy the fact that Susie did get to experience love in a physical way altho it seemed out of place. I kept wanting the guy and her friend to find the safe.<BR>Will be interesting to see what Alice Sebold does next.
0767830555|1.0|I find it hard to believe that so many people are able to enjoy this movie.  Though not particularly long, it seems to drag by, and Scorsese doesn't help by leaving so much dead time, it turns into a graveyard, literally and metaphorically.  The theme is poorly conveyed, the plot is vapid and nonsensical, and the acting is fairly sub-par.  The characters are barley there, and their lack of development and history really adds to the convoluted plot.  In the end, it turns into an average testosterone driven shoot-out, leaving you angry and confused.  This, next to \\"Runaway Bride\\" and \\"Home Alone\\" is the worst movie I've ever seen.
B00005JL3A|5.0|OK I have to start by saying that RE is my all time favorite video game series hands down, it kicks A$$.  The Movie, It rocked! Every aspect of the screamed resident evil, and it showed everything I love about The game.  Some parts were a little much in gore but it was presented well.  The visuals were some of the best to date.  The zombies looked awesome.  I cannot wait for the DVD to come out! Rent it buy it give it a chance before you listen to stupid professionals who said it [was not good]
B000021YQV|5.0|Most people unfortunately assume System of a Down is a hard, heavy, controversial band. They bring these aspects into play but they are by far one of the best bands at manipulating your emotions by the flow of their songs. old classical pieces were divided up into movements. Each movement represents a part of a story, every one coming together at the end or even throughout the piece. The new single Aerials follows this format aswell as most of their songs. They'll start you off with heavy guitaring mixed with a fast beat, then spin you off into a story which is mated to beautiful guitar and bass solos and melodies. <br />The lead singer's roots are from the middle-east. These influences are found throughout the record especially in Science. Science is one of my personal favourites because it is the epidemy of the movement theory, also bringing in east-indian instruments to emphasize creates an amazing combo of new and old. Those influences ARE System. Before you shoot down any band that has a heavy metal/hard rock feel, check this one out first for they are the masters.
B000002U8G|5.0|The greatest Prog - Rock floyd album ever ..<BR>Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall is nothing compared to this Master Piece of Floyd . <BR>The best track is ofcourse Echoes  , Itz a sweet harmony of emotions - Happiness , Sorrow, Hope , Depression ........<BR>A must have album for anybody who appreciates good music .
B00005JKJA|4.0|Let's get the mundane out of the way...a DVD without scene selection is downright ANNOYING! Not to mention that the new paradigm in DVD/Video release seems to be: Get the first copies out and THEN (when everyone owns it already) release the Special Edition. In that case, I would wait for the Special Edition, because this movie is STUNNING and I'm dying to see what they put in it!<br />Having read through some of the reviews, I noticed a couple things. First, it is rare and notable for a film to polarize the public as this one has...every review I've read has either LOVED or HATED it...no one thought it was just OK. That fact alone argues for it getting a second viewing from those who were not impressed the first time around.<br />Second, I have seen those who praise the movie point out many different aspects as contributing to its overall value(and I agree with nearly all), but I felt compelled to point out both the writing and the performance of Naomi Watts as particularly sparkling achievements. I felt as though Watts' performance was truly amazing and I am positively intrigued to see someone write about how horrible they thought the acting was...I think it was superb.<br />But then again...I've only seen the movie once...so perhaps everything will change! Seriously, I think this is an excellent film, though clearly not for everyone's taste...but I'd wait until you have a better DVD product to purchase.
0767853636|3.0|If you saw the Broadway version you be blown over. Then along comes Hollywood thinking that they can out do Broadway and they seem to screw it up every time. The cast is very good but why change some of the lead songs? Why add scenes like &quot;lets go to the movies&quot; which was filmed at Radio City Music Hall,,,,a place i love and have worked and admire,,,but there was no need to add that into the film version. Basically why does Hollywood think that they can create a better version than Broadway?  They were way off the mark.  Save your money, wait till it comes  to your local summer live theatre. Remember i love musicals and have been in countless numbers of them but trust me on this one, the movie stinks.
6305165912|5.0|...you're going to love this (eventually)...<br />The first time I saw it, I had no idea what I had just seen and I don't recall being at all impressed.  Since then it has become a movie I need to see every couple of months just to unwind...which is truly what the movie is intended to have you do, in my opinion.<br />You are to appreciate this film in the same way the Dude goes about his life...nice and easy, no need to rush, if it looks amusing go with it.  Those looking for a deeper meaning will never find it...those moving at the speed of the film just might...
6305878323|5.0|Probably one of the greatest works of the late Walt Disney himself. After this film the Disney studio completely lost their touch in creating a great film.\\"Mary Poppins\\" is everything that is fun and is wonderfully acted by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. The colors, the music score, the story, costumes, set design is all a wonderful tribute to the greatest creative artist of all times, Walt Disney.  The likes of him will never be seen again. The DVD version is also wonderful, the quality is excellent and is still one of my favorite films of all times. This is truly a classic for both young and old.
020530902X|5.0|How many times over the years have I referred mentally to this wonderful little book?  How many times have I heard White's voice saying something about a specific word?  How many times have I applied White's logic to other words, ones that aren't even in this book?  How much of my own writing has been affected positively from the discussion that takes place in this book?  I can't even begin to count up how often Mr. White has been on my mind as a professional writer.  White provides a silent voice of stability and assurance that allows you to feel confident as you build a permanent view of our language as both expressive and natural.  White's technical discussions of words do not at all take away from his belief that language is REAL and ALIVE.  In fact, somehow, White brings life to the technical aspects of language.  This is a special achievement indeed.<br />The largest portion of this book -- a series of illuminating suggestions and comments on word choice and usage -- turns the minutiae of grammar into a personal, fascinating expedition.  E.B. White finds many opportunities to express interesting opinions and viewpoints through his discussions of words.  Often, in my own writing, I ask myself what E.B. White might say about the word choices I make.<br />But the soul of the book is at the end, in White's succint, memorable, and effective essay entitled, &quot;An Approach To Style.&quot;  It is in this essay that E.B. White's philosophy of living language, and his creative energy, join together to offer something that can guide you in real-life writing.<br />Put simply, E.B. White's system of language beliefs really works.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Why do people get so excited and spend money to see a movie that is almost entirely filmed with special effects and a blue screen?  Movie making is surpose to be about acting, man made special effects that show talent and hard work and real settings all make up a real movie.  But this piece... with it's computer generated effects is the ultimate  of low class and i'm sorry to say should be totally beneath you.  Where was the acting? Was it the special effects or the actors that you wanted to see?    We as humans are beginning to look more at special effects than actors that have acting ability. Is this all part of the dumbing down of America?  This film is worthless and has no artistic value what so ever.  If you want to see a great sci-fi movie, buy or rent \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still.\\" Now that is a movie with great actors, great script, a plot and is very creative.
B00004SVID|5.0|This live rendition of the acclaimed Pink Floyd cd The Wall puts all other live cd's I have ever heard to shame.  We already knew the Roger Waters and David Gilmor were two extremely talented song writers (my opinion is that they were the greatest of all time), and we all knew of the ongoing onslaught of discomfort and tension between the members, but the band just let it all hang out.  If you have not heard the studio release of The Wall, I would recomend getting that first, then you should see the movie by the same name.  The movie is great!  Believe me, I know music.  My one qualm is that I was not lucky enough to be in the audience for a Pink Floyd concert.  I found myself enjoying this cd more than the actual original lp.  Many of the songs are extended with guitar solos that are just amazing. The sound effects are amazingly clear and audible.  From the Master of the Ceremonies to the tearing down of the wall, this is one of the greatest Pink Floyd cd's I have, and I have them all&gt;
B00003ZKRM|5.0|&quot;Glorious John&quot; Barbirolli wasn't as well-known for his Sibelius as a couple of other British conductor-knights (Colin Davis and the late Thomas Beecham). But this generous set--all the strictly instrumental symphonies (I don't believe Barbirolli ever recorded the choral symphony &quot;Kullervo&quot;), several of the tone poems, and some of Sibelius' incidental music--shows that he was AT LEAST the equal of Sir Colin or Sir Thomas in this repertoire. And the late '60s recordings still sound fresh today--just like the performances.

B000005IRG|4.0|Television is a good band, and Marquee Moon is a great record. The only problem I have is that I've never heard anyone posit that Tom Verlaine is probably a huge John Cipollina fan, of the first Quicksilver Messenger Service LP.  If you listen to Gold and Silver and Fool on QMS's 1st LP...Well, the main theme of The Dream's Dream on Adventure is lifted from a riff in the middle of Fool by QMS, I swear.  Just how Television covered 13th Floor Elevators, another obscure psych band, as shown on their &quot;Blow Up&quot; live album, a lot of the indie-influencing psych guitar excursions come from, and I'm positive of their devotion to the 1st QMS record-buy it and Marquee Moon too!  QMS delivers on the awesome indie-influencing psych guitar that shows up in a lot of Television's work.

B000055XMF|3.0|I was really looking forward to this release, I put it on and the intro was thrilling with motion background of all the scooters, The menu is totally within the spirit of the production, the extras are cool although I cannot find the portrait of a mod extra as referred to easter eggs. Thats where the good bits end, The scenes that were cut are unbelievable, The franking machine scene the hairdresser scene the build up to the whole weekend, the paying for his suit the mod attitude in the tailors, The pub scene in the toilets before the party all adds up to the atmosphere, With these excluded it will leave the audience baffled as to the story line, as these scenes are cross referenced elsewhere in the movie. Quite frankly this is a massive let down, The soundtrack is a million times better, the video is cleaner, But only to be let down by the omissions, I was almost ready to send it back, But I have the two versions and can probably remake for my own use on my apple the correct version. I leave it up to you to decide wether you should buy this or not, I don't feel that the it's worth the money but on the other hand I would pay more for the same with the main scenes included.

B00005N9CV|3.0|Very nice instrumental on every track, but Diana's vocal range is limited and it shows on various cuts.<BR>Overall a fair effort, pretty bland actually, with one cut in particular a real stinker. <BR>&quot;Besame Mucho&quot; is by far the worst song on the album, absolutely terrible. Dear Diana, stick to your Canadian English, please!
B000001EIA|2.0|Ancient as they are, Kiss is still a band with great range.  I'm not talking about the musical scale here, I'm talking about types of songs they are/were able to pull off well.  The Unplugged franchise has always been known for not only being an acoustic showcase, but for inspiring musicians to play the 'acoustic' versions of songs that don't exactly lend themselves to a folksy, campfire genre- see the legendary performances by LL Cool J, Nirvana, and if you can find them, the amazing Stone Temple Pilots and Queensryche sets for great examples.<br />Unfortunately, everything you expect to be on this album is.  Too many ballads, too many songs that sound like ballads, and not enough experimentation.  &quot;Beth&quot;, &quot;2,000 Man&quot; and &quot;Domino&quot; almost break out of the mold, but the rest of the set ends up letting you down.<br />All in all, good for a big time Kiss fan, bad for a casual fan looking for something more exciting than the overplayed acoustic version of &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;.
044022165X|5.0|I often wonder; if Grisham can write this well, why aren't the rest of his novels anywhere near as good as this one?  Is it laziness?  Or was he finally writing about something he cared about?<br />Of the two, my guess would be the latter.  One of the things I am struck by when I read the Rainmaker (and I have done so quite a few times, much to my own amazement) is the emotional content.  Grisham has always been about plot more than character, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.  Every person in this book hits exactly the right notes to become real.<br />The main character, Rudy Baylor, starts out as a third-year law student who just wants to do his job, collect a paycheck, and retire as soon as possible.  But along the way he is formed into a kind of crusading knight by his first client; Donny Ray Black, a young man dying of leukemia.  He should be covered by an insurance policy, but the insurance company won't pay up.  Rudy takes it upon himself, not to save Donny Ray, but simply to see justice done.<br />Another thing I was struck by was the lack of thriller elements.  There is no surprise ending, there is no cheap gimmicks.  Grisham does not clutter his story with the usual questions of \\"will they win the case/championship/battle.\\"  Nobody's life is seriously in danger (except Donny Ray, and it's made pretty clear at the beginning that it's already too late for him).  Instead, Grisham turns his attention to insurance companies in an expose not unlike Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\", about the Chicago meatpacking industry in 1906.  We learn about murky accounting practices, cold-blooded corparate decisions designed to swindle people out of the smallest amounts of money, and a company who is willing to hide documents and buy off or fire their own employees in order to allay the firestorm they know is coming.<br />I don't suppose that sounds familiar to anyone, does it?<br />Grisham has written a remarkable, powerful, absorbing, educating novel.  If only the rest of his work was up to snuff.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Leonard Shelby has a condition of extreme short-term memory. He lives in the immediate present tense. He remembers everything that happened to him prior to \\"the incident\\" but he can't make any new memories. He can only remember things for a few minutes, then everything fades. He's trying to hunt down the man who killed his wife during that horrible \\"incident.\\" He takes polaroids of things and writes notes on them as reminders. He tatoos notes and various facts all over his body. He doesn't know who his friends are or who he can trust - every time he meets someone, it's for the first time.<br />The film starts at the end and goes backwards in short spurts, revealing a little at a time - just like Leonard's memory. It'll take only one jump for you to realize what's happening. Just go with it. When it all comes together, look out!<br />Guy Pearce (The Time Machine, The Count of Monte Cristo) plays Leonard Shelby to perfection. Each situation Leonard finds himself in is a complete mystery. There's some slight humor in given situations, some fear and sadness. Pearce is so convincing. You find yourself really sympathizing with his character's condition. The two major co-stars are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, who also starred together in The Matrix. My first memory of Joe Pantoliano was opposite Tom Cruise as \\"Guido the Killer Pimp\\" in Risky Business. Always a great performance.
0440133688|5.0|This is now a hallowed classic, yes it's dated (set in the 70s) but that doesn't stop the impact and the occasional period point (like the sexual promiscuity) is easily overlooked.<br />I met Shem  (a pseudoname)in the 80s at a meeting (he's a psychiatrist from Boston) and although I'm sure other reviewers have met him as well, he was very much full of himself with us.  Most of us were not impressed....especially since he was not open to any criticisms of either his book or the issues surrounding patient care failings of the American health care system.<br />That said, the book should be required reading for anyone serious about a medical career.  But you should read better stuff as well....start with any poem or story by John Stone, William Carlos Williams' Doctor Stories, Richard Selzer's books (especially Letters To A Young Doctor), and Jay Katz' The Silent World of Doctor and Patient.

B000003BDY|5.0|The Stones 2nd US album, released Oct 23, 1964.  It cemented the early blues band legend with tracks from their famous Chess Studios session in Chicago during the 1st American tour (Muddy Waters helped carry their gear into the studio) and tracks recorded at Regent Sound in London.  Essentially, this is the album that finalized their status with Chicago blues forever.<br />The album starts with Check Berry's Around And Around, which the Stones had been doing as a show stopper in the UK, the big hits Time Is On My Side and It's All Over Now, and the great slow blues numbers Confessin' The Blues &amp; Good Times Bad Times.  Although they used to do a lot of instrumentals, 2120 S. Michigan seems to have survived as the only memory of this part of the early Stones familiar to most fans.  Personally I always liked Congratulations, but never cared for their version of Susie Q, although it was very popular at the time.<br />The tracks recorded June 10-11, 1964 at Chess Studios in Chicago were (Around And Around, Confessin' The Blues, Empty Heart, Good Times Bad Times, It's All Over Now, 2120 S. Michigan version 2, If You Need Me).  Tracks recorded at Regent Sound in London were done on Feb 25, 1964 (Susie Q), June 24-26, 1964 (Time Is On My Side version 1, Congratulations), and Sep 28-29, 1964 (Under The Boardwalk, Grown Up Wrong).<br />This album was never released in the UK, however the tracks were released in the UK as follows:<br />6-26-64 It's All Over Now, Good Times Bad Times<br />8-14-64 Five by Five EP - If You Need Me, Empty Heart, 2120 S. Michigan version 1, Confessin' the Blues, Around and Around<br />1-16-65 The Rolling Stones No. 2 - Time Is On My Side version 1, Grown Up Wrong, Under The Boardwalk, Susie Q<br />Congratulations was not released in the UK until 10-5-73 on the album No Stone Unturned
0790729342|5.0|In 'Mad Max', the title character is a family man whose job - a cop in the future - calls him to patrol the anarchaic highways facing down the punks, criminals and 'terminal crazies'. Max fears the job will soon transform him into one of them, but it's when his family is cut down by a gang that Max is truly pushed over into psycho territory. The film ends with Max completing vengeance on the killers and, like all avenging angels, rides off into an uncertain sunset.<br />This is how 'Road Warrior', second in the Mad Max trilogy of films, begins. Years have passed since the first film, a nuclear war has robbed the world of it's resources, and Max - No longer the humble family man - travels the blasted landscape burnt out and alone. But when a community of villagers is threatened by a vicious band of ruffians, Max's buried soul is slowly drawn out from his ruined identity.<br />'Road Warrior' is a great film. It uses a tried and true story, but one that is so simple that it is a part of almost every culture. It's every much a western, as the hero faces down the classic posse of villains in a high octane showdown. It also contains threads of the samurai mythos, a lone warrior with his own code of honour, yet bereft of a master and oweing nothing to no one. Also, like Lucas' 'Star Wars' films, many have drawn parallels between this film and the writings of Joseph Campbell. <br />Mad Mel plays Max perfectly, silent and stoic. This was the role made for Gibson, and it would be a shame if he didn't return to it in the rumoured 4th film. The rest of the actors are great as well, proving once again that Australia is a hidden wealth of acting talent just recently mined again with Crowe, Jackman and Pierce. 'Warrior' also gains credit for it's ingenious art design, it's deep innovative look of a leather jacketed, ruggedly punkish, S&M design that has so often been immitated.<br />The current DVD release is nothing special...a decent transfer, some interesting production notes and the trailer. This is a film that needs a Special Edition, just like the original film. <br />A true classic in it's own genre, 'Road Warrior' stands the test of time.

B00000JLWW|5.0|April 10, 1912. Technology had been delivering a steady stream of miracles for the better part of two decades and people were beginning to take this never-ending spiral of progress for granted. What better demonstration of humanity's mastery over nature than the launch of Titanic, the largest and most luxurious moving object ever built by the hand of man? But four-and-a-half days later, the world had changed. The maiden voyage of the \\"ship of dreams\\" ended in a nightmare beyond comprehension and mankind's faith in its own indomitable power was forever destroyed by uniquely human shortcomings: arrogance, complacency and greed.<BR>The goal in making this film was to show not only the dramatic death of this infamous ship, but her brief and glorious life as well. To capture the beauty, exuberance, optimism and hope of Titanic, her passengers and crew and, in the process of baring the dark side of humanity underlying this tragedy, celebrate the limitless potential of the human spirit. For Titanic is not just a cautionary tale - a myth, a parable, a metaphor for the ills of mankind. It is also a story of faith, courage, sacrifice and, above all else, love.<br />James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic, the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the \\"ship of dreams\\" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.<BR>The journey of \\"Titanic\\" begins in the present, at the site of the ship's watery grave, two-and-a-half miles under the ocean surface. An ambitious fortune hunter (Bill Paxton) is determined to plumb the treasures of this once-stately ship, only to bring to the surface a story left untold. The tragic ruins melt away to reveal the glittering palace that was Titanic as it prepares to launchon its maiden voyage from England. Amidst the thousands of well-wishers bidding a fond bon voyage, destiny has called two young souls, daring them to nurture a passion that would change their lives forever. <br />Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) is a 17-year-old, upper-class American suffocating under the rigid confines and expectations of Edwardian society who falls for a free-spirited young steerage passenger named Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). Once he opens her eyes to the world that lies outside her gilded cage, Rose and Jack's forbidden love begins a powerful mystery that ultimately echoes across the years into the present. Nothing on earth is going to come between them -- not even something as unimaginable as the sinking of Titanic.<br />Also inhabiting this floating microcosm are Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane, heir to a huge fortune and Rose's fiancé, and Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's socially driven mother, played by Frances Fisher. Oscar winner Kathy Bates is featured as the ship's most colorful real-life passenger, Molly Brown. Other historic figures include Captain E.J. Smith (Bernard Hill), White Star Line's managing director J. Bruce Ismay (Jonathan Hyde), and master shipbuilder and primary architect of Titanic, Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber). Also participating in this devastating hand of fate dealt to the passengers of Titanic are an Italian emigrant named Fabrizio De Rossi (Danny Nucci), Jack's poor but determined best friend; and Spicer Lovejoy (David Warner), Cal Hockley's ruthlessly loyal valet. <br />Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox present a Lightstorm Entertainment Production, a James Cameron film, \\"Titanic,\\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Danny Nucci, David Warner and Bill Paxton. Written and directed by James Cameron, the film is produced by Cameron and Jon Landau. Rae Sanchini is executive producer.
0671042858|4.0|I've been a fan of Stephen King for many, many years and although I haven't had time to read much of his \\"newer\\" stuff lately (the last book I read was \\"Bag of Bones\\"), I did manage to pick up the pretty short \\"Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" and read it in two wonderful hammock visits. And in the end, I was actually crying.<br />The story is pretty basic. Nine-year-old Trisha is on a hiking jaunt with her older brother and mother, and when she steps off the main trail to relieve herself, she gets lost in the woods almost instantly. King brings Trisha alive with an uncanny maturity for a 9-year-old, and throughout the tale, he manages to keep the same setting but through Trisha's hallucinations (Tom Gordon, the Boston Red Sox closer and Trisha's favorite baseball player, who seemingly walks the woods with her), her memories of friends (Pepsi, whose banter keeps you laughing), family (Dad, whose love of baseball and beer keeps Trisha close, yet so far away), and the scary things in the woods (you'll have to read for yourself), it never gets mundane.<br />To keep it simple, \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" is a quick, wonderful book that takes a unique 9-year-old girl and thrusts her into an extremely dangerous setting. King's way of showing Trisha's maturity as she copes with the denizens of the forest is terrific, and as always, he makes you care about the fate of this little girl.<br />Again, King throws away the supernatural and pure terror (as he did in \\"Bag of Bones\\") and gives you 200+ pages of emotion. You won't put it down until it's Game Over.
0060254920|4.0|What can you say about this classic?  I loved this book as a child.  It spurred my imagination and reinforced the idea of parental discipline and love.  I hope that my daughter (now 7 months old) enjoys it as much as I did (and still do :)).

1573921394|5.0|If you want to be an economist, this is a book you should definitely read. This is hard reading and I have to admit that without good first year PhD education, you will probably close the book after a couple of pages. But if you are taking graduate studies and you want to feel even more comfortable in the field of macroeconomics, this book is a must. Both from a critical and educative point of view.
B000002NHN|5.0|Lorenna's album deviates from traditional Celtic Style and  <BR>adds an Middle Eastern Style. She has a vocal style which is similiar to Enya. I enjoyed listening to ever song on the<BR>album.  This album definitely has smooth melodic vibe to it and is one of her best albums. I recommend this album to anyone who has an appreaciation for all kinds of music.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Others have written good thorough reviews so I will try to be brief.  This DVD is simply awesome.  This is the best out of the 30 concert DVDs I own and more I've rented. The audio and video are superb.  The editing is the best I've seen, with the camera always on the musician you want to see at the right time (and how unusual THAT is)!  The orchestra is young and energetic and fun to watch, and they add a lot to the music without interfering with the rock nature of the music.  And finally, the music is incredibly powerful.  \\"Close to the Edge\\" brought tears to this old man's eyes.  Those who say the video is boring, or that Steve Howe's playing is bad (huh??), are way off base.  This is a MUST OWN DVD for any and every Yes fan.
B000067CPX|5.0|Some would say that after twenty years, a band like The Red Hot Chili Peppers would have lost some of their, well, spice. This is just not so.  Flea and the gang proved to us in 1999 that they could create an album that blended rock and some soulful, inviting ballads.  It seems as if the band has examined the rave reviews of their last classic and decided to show us a softer, more intense side.  The result is By The Way, which I would call the best album of the year.  While Eminem is off killing Moby, the Chili Peppers get back to what matters most-music that sounds like music and music that you can get in touch with.  The lyrics are on track and very personal.  The music itself is great and flatters Anthony's voice.  The album itself is a turning point for the band though.  They have become the greatest rock band in America and now have proven that they can be more low key, relaxed too.  Now, they must decide which suits them best but everyone will agree, they can blend both perfectly.
B000067CPX|5.0|Great Album.  Tracks 9,13,4,1 are my favorites.
B000002L7Y|4.0|A-ha over time have been placed in the unfortunate category of one hit wonders with the hit &quot;Take On Me&quot; back on 1985.  I hate it when organizations like VH1 and MTV do this, because they are so wrong, and yet the public doesn't know any better, so they buy into it.  The album &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot; is a really good album.  It's a pop album first at foremost, but contains very thought-proking lyrics at times, and more complicated musical orchestrations than most people will give it credit for.  Songs like &quot;Here I Stand And Face The Rain&quot; and &quot;The Sun Always Shines On TV&quot; are numbers that shine and really show A-ha's complexity.  I also like &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; and the title track.  Hacket's voice is amazing.  I don't care who you are, but no one can deny, he can belt out a song unlike most top 40 singers.  Their follow up album, &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; is just as good, if not more laid back.
B000067CPX|5.0|This RHCP album conjures up these visions better that any other of their albums.  By the Way produces a perpetual grin on my face.  It brings back memories of skipping high school and going to the beach, watching the sunset, and then sitting around the bonfire at night.  <br />Those were the days of Blood Sugar Sex Magic and that album's energy was in tune with my own teenaged exuberance.  I no longer need to be going 100mph full speed ahead all the time and By the Way provides a wider range of emotions and moods that suit me better now.<br />Have the Red Hots sold out?  No way.  Yes, some of the songs are of simple construction but the Chili Peppers, with their song writing skill and performance energy, produce songs that tell a story and create emotions.  This album is an artistic evolution that illustrates their musical and lyrical mastery.  Calaforication was a good album but it wasn't perfect, there are a few songs that I skip consistently.  By the Way has none of these songs.  The album has been a pleasant surprise for me and I'm sure that will go down as one of the greatest rock albums of all time...IMO of course.
B000068QY7|2.0|I had been a fan of Oasis and their first three albums in the 90's.  I loved the arena pop rock they created, the songwriting of Noel and the whiney and harsh vocals of Liam.  But I can't seem to enjoy &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; as much as I want to.  Their last effort &quot;On The Shoulder Of Giants&quot; (was my least favorite album til now) yet had some good moments that &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; lacks.  The songs seem boring and contrived.  &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; and &quot;Hindu Times&quot; are not great, but okay.  They stand out as the best of the album, because everything else isn't all that good.  &quot;Little By Little&quot; is really the only song that I like.  And that's a shame.  Maybe Noel needs to go back and write all of the music again.  Because &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is a mixed bag of different people with different ideas, and it dissapointingly shows.
0790729628|2.0|I had seen Blade Runner as a teenager a while back and came away from the movie thinking it didn't really go anywhere, it didn't seem to be much of a story.  I thought it was because I didn't pay much attention to the movie and I was a teenager and just didn't get it.  So I bought the DVD (because I was on a DVD kick) and watched it.  I came away feeling pretty much the same, but what is worse than not liking the movie is the DVD is such poor quality.  The sound is horrible, and there isn't any extra features that make it worth buying.  If you like the move buy the VHS version.  The only thing I liked about it was laughing at some of the 80's hairdo's in it.
B000002LB6|5.0|I love &quot;Wonderland&quot;, but consider it to be way too similiar to Yazoo (which Clarke had just came from).  So &quot;The Circus&quot; is really the album that begins to give us a good understanding of Erasure - the band.  From the hip &quot;It Doesn't Have To Be&quot; to the soft &quot;Spiralling&quot;, this album has it all.  And it is actually a concept album of all things.  There's hints in the music from &quot;Don't Dance&quot; to &quot;Spiralling&quot; that lead all back to the actual song &quot;The Circus&quot;.  What I love about Erasure, is that they often have a number of songs on each album that are just as good as their singles or better.  &quot;Hideaway&quot;, &quot;Leave Me To Bleed&quot; and &quot;Spiralling&quot; are tracks that were never heard on the radio, but they are three of my favorite tracks from the album.  There are hits as well like &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Victim Of Love&quot;.  If you are interested in Erasure and don't have this album, get it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000002N3N|5.0|Enya is in a class all by herself.  She envokes feelings and images that take you out of reality.  So many others have copied her sound (ala James Horner in TITANIC) that it's easy to see how much of an influence she has been.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a classic album.  From the emotional first track instrumental to the enchanting &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, Enya has created a pallete of wonderful pastimes and tragic metaphores here.  Yes, I would consider this pop/new age music.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  There are a number of people that don't like Enya.  There are jokes on South Park about her.  And that's good.  It shows how much of a musical force she is.  &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is a good collection of material from a very important artist, who I hope will never give up her love of music.
B000002AS3|4.0|Although I like certain songs more on their later albums, Oasis shines on their debut &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;.  Many of the songs on this album rock, and have an alternative feel to them.  There's an energy here that Oasis doesn't quite match in it's latter efforts, and songs like &quot;Rock N' Roll Star&quot;, &quot;Slide Away&quot;, &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Live Forever&quot; are just to name a few of the catchy, pop-rock anthems that you'll find on the album.  This would be my pick for the definitive Oasis album.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I had followed Moby, once I heard some of his material in the &quot;Cool World&quot; soundtrack back in 1992.  I bought some of his albums, and thought &quot;Everthing Is Wrong&quot; was somewhat over-rated.  However, &quot;Play&quot; is the album that not only put Moby on the map... it also showcases his ability to take samples and work music around them masterfully.  The feeling of &quot;Play&quot; is one of awe and enjoyment.  The electronic music set to samples of soul singers is truely a refreshing sound.  I also like that Moby contributes with his own vocals, and that he adds a few instrumentals to the mix.  A well rounded album, that should be on the list for the top ten albums of the 90's.  I like &quot;18&quot; just as much, but be warned that &quot;Play&quot; is a bit more upbeat and fun... where as &quot;18&quot; is more moody and introspective.
B000002BBY|4.0|I'm sure you've heard of \\"Wonderwall\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova\\".  Both were played to death on MTV when they came out.  However, there are other songs on this album that are equally as solid, like \\"She's Electric\\" and \\"Roll With It\\".  Not as raw and energetic as their first album, \\"What's The Story, Morning Glory?\\" is a nice follow-up which put Oasis on the map.  It's a more refined album, with Oasis beginning to use more instrumentation similar in approach to The Beatles.  Liam's signature raspy voice and Noel's strong pop sensibilities make this one of their best albums.
B000009EUM|4.0|&quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; - I'm not sure many people even knew this album existed.  I for one think it is as good as &quot;Hunting High And Low&quot;.  A-ha shows a little more maturity and innovation since their previosu release.  There's a spiritualness to &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; that was just touched upon on their first album.  My all time favorite A-ha song is &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot;.  It starts low, builds and hits you hard in the chorus as Hacket belts out some of the best lyrics from any A-ha track.  I also like &quot;I've Been Losing You&quot;, &quot;Manhatten Skyline&quot; and &quot;We're Looking For The Whales&quot;.  I can't believe you can only get the import of this album now.  That's a shame, since it is such a strong effort by a misunderstood band.
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|In all fairness, I haven't seen the DVD or VHS versions of Pearl Harbor--I paid ... to watch it on the big screen and was frankly embarrassed that I paid good money to see an overly-hyped cinema spectacular that had everything except cinematic merit going for it.<br />From the first scene where a Stearman biplane is seen crop dusting--an unlikely scenario, since the Stearman was not built until nearly a decade later, not to mention the unlikelihood anyone was cropdusting routinely that early due to the unreliability of airplane engines--to the scene where Ben Affleck takes off in a Hurricane and gets shot down in a Spitfire (the crash no doubt a result of his changing planes in midflight)--to the scene where President Roosevelt \\"stands-up\\" to show anything is possible, this movie was a disappointment to me.<br />What's wrong with getting your facts straight?<br />It isn't that hard.  After coming down from a rolling boil after seeing \\"Pearl Harbor\\" I got out my trusty VHS copy of \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" and watched a real movie on the same subject.  <br />There were chances for the directors to pull something out of their butts and resurrect this turkey, because they did do some rather nice special effects, and Cuba Gooding was a believable and very ably portrayed Dorie Miller--but they had him firing the wrong kind of machine gun--Dorie Miller fired a water-cooled deck machine gun, not an army field machine gun.  It is correctly depicted in \\"Tora, Tora, Tora.\\"<br />I may be a knit-picker and I may be a quibbler and a trivia nut, but it's not that hard to get it right.  In fairness, many good war movies have some scene inconsistencies--even such outstanding flicks as \\"12 O'Clock High,\\" which drew heavily on actual combat footage.  We forgive them because they make it up with a meaningful plot with a message.<br />These directors tried to do for Pearl Harbor what Jim Cameron did for Titanic--they need to borrow Jim's thoroughness and integrity the next time they try something this ambitious.  They need the honesty and soul-searching done by Spielberg in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"<br />This could have been a truly outstanding movie.  It wasn't.  I will not be wasting more money on it unless maybe I can find one in a pawn shop ...
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne has a really great voice, and I loved all of her songs.  I could listen to it over and over again.  Losing Grip had a great melody, and I loved the message that Complicated gave.  Avril Lavigne has a very high potential.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I'm just gonna repeat what 200 other people on this site have said before me:<BR>Norah Jones is one of those rare (1 in a million) singers who stays in your heart forever. She's got the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. All of the tracks on &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; are incredible- a mixture of basically everything (except droning metal or hip hop!). Her sultry vocals over the soothing sound of the piano (played by her) is the perfect remedy after a hard day at work. <BR> She's so talented that I'm gonna go and listen to her album now.. SUPERB DEBUT!
B00004TRD8|5.0|The Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition DVD is a must have! You get three full versions of the movie, and there are over 80 chapters for this 2.5 hour epic! The theatrical version has everything you remember from seeing in the theater and on cable. The special edition gives you the same film with deleted scenes. And the extended version gives you the alternate ending, which was thankfully rejected by preview surveys. Not to say it's bad, but the \\"open highway\\" ending fits better with the overall themes of the film.<br />If there was any movie to be fanatical about, Terminator 2 is fantastic choice. And the Ultimate DVD offers a fanatic's dream. The featurettes and documentaries are numerous and detailed. Remember, with \\"T2\\" came out, brand new special effect techniques were being developed and implemented. Some folks had the right idea by documenting EVERYTHING in the process of making this ground-breaking film, it seems, and you have the privilege of viewing the behind-the-scenes secrets that elevated movie-making standards for the 90s.<br />This film thoroughly entertains with each viewing. A solid story, themes of fate, humanity, and morality ooze from the three main characters: the T-800 (Schwarzenegger), John Connor (Ed Furlong), and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Trying to make sense of the destiny the world is hurtling toward while battling the nearly invincible T-1000 (Robert Patrick) in some amazing and stylized action sequences, the trio cannot help but understand more about themselves and each other. Even though one is a machine, his CPU is \\"a learning computer.\\" With a childlike innocence that is neither contrived or overplayed, The Terminator slowly learns what it means to be human while willfully protecting John and Sarah. He protects what he does not understand for much of the film. The unique dynamic between the three characters, a protective, empowered and courgeous mother, a young, but resourceful, streetwise child, and an unemotional learning machine, is well played.<br />There is something new to see each time, which will make the three versions with over 20 commentary tracks something worth revisiting time and time again. This is not just an action film, but the action alone could sustain someone not interested in the themes or philosophies behind it. Enjoy, you will not be diappointed.
B0000636UN|5.0|Nice. Infact it's very nice. Unlike the boring shambles that was &quot;The Globe Session&quot;, &quot;C'Mon C'Mon&quot; is a very catchy and likeable album filled with a mixed range of songs (yes this is the same Sheryl Crow whose last 3 albums all sounded like carbon copies!)<BR> The album kicks off with &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, a full on rock track  with stupid but brilliant lyrics (yes that does make sense).<BR> &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; makes a refreshing change to Sheryl's usual style of music- for once she's looking on the positive side of life.<BR> There are a lot of big stars helping Crow on &quot;C'mon C'Mon&quot;, Lenny Kravitz, Stevie Nicks and Emmylou Harris being just some of them.<BR> After going through an emotional fasinating journey into Sheryl's musical world (this time including a piano), we are greeted at the end with the most beautiful song I've ever heard by a rock star.<BR>&quot;The Weather Channel&quot; is a quiet and clever little number which is bound to please all. I know some critics found the album quite disappointing, but they all loved this track.<BR>I can safely say that Sheryl Crow's first pop influenced album has been a success through my eyes.
0812550706|5.0|Finally a book I can actually sit down, read, and enjoy.  The plot line is great and the games keep you guessing.  When your reading, you cant stop untill you find out how Ender beats this or how Ender does that.  One of the best thing Card does (that atleast I like) is that he can sum up long priods of time, were nothing happens, in only one paragraph.  So you never get tried of reading it.  I cant wait to read &quot;Speaker of the Dead&quot;.
B00005LOUS|5.0|fast shipping tape in very good shape will buy from this pesron again
B000068QY7|4.0|I would have given this CD 3.5 stars if I could have.  A sometimes lackluster effort from a band capable of more.  First, I am in disagreement with many of the reviewers....this is not as good as SOTSOG which I feel is a very underrated CD.  It is nowhere near as good as the first two Oasis albums.  The CD is short and it has two throwaway tunes in the pyschadelic mess All in the Mind and Liam's boring and repetitive Born on a Different Cloud.  The rest of the tunes have grown on me.  However, the B sides on the Stop Crying Your Heart Out are far better than some of the album trax.  Thank You for The Good Times should have made the album in place of one of the two songs above and Noel's Shout it Out Loud is far better than the mediocre Force of Nature.<br />The other problem is Liam's vocals on some songs are more garbled than ever.  This is particularly true of Born on a Different Cloud and Better Man.  Had the vocals on Better Man been better than this would have a chance to become an Oasis classic because musically the song is great.  I have been listening to the other CD's to see whether the vocals were always like this and I hadnt noticed but rest assured they are far more garbled on this album.<br />Standout songs include Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Little by Little, She is Love, and the Gem Archer written Hung in a Bad Place.<br />In summary buy this and the single than substitute out Born on a Different Cloud and Force of Nature for the B Sides and you will have a good CD.
6305897786|3.0|With \\"The Ninth Gate\\", Polanksi and his co-writers wisely do not attempt a faithful adaptation of Arturo Perez-Reverte's amazing novel which, by its nature, cannot be anything other than a book.  Instead, they choose the most exciting strand of the story and take it in a new direction.  Unfortunately, the resulting film starts much better than it ends, with the gripping eeriness of the first half disintegrating into unintentional comedy towards the end.  What saves it are its style and the performances.  Johnny Depp is typically wonderful as the unscrupulous book hunter, Dean Corso, and Frank Langella proves he can still be incredibly menacing - even when he's just a voice on the other end of the telephone.  Polanski manages to inject his tale with enough tension and style to keep you interested, Wojciech Kilar's music is a perfect match, and Darius Khondji's cinematography, as always, is simply astonishing: every shot is exquisite.  Why this man doesn't have a shelf full of Oscars is beyond me.
0440180295|5.0|This is the ultimate World War II classic but far from typical.   Slaughterhouse Five is sophisticated and eye opening.  Written in Kurt Vonnegut's unique style  it's one of his most personal novels describing the destruction of the German city of Dresden and it's lasting effect on the main character, Billy Pilgram.  Slaughterhouse Five points out the absurdity of war and destruction, the torment of mental dysfunction and raises questions about cosmic justice and human nature.   There is so much packed into this novel it can be overwhelming.  Read it more than once and you see new aspects each time.    This story makes you think!
0898705525|5.0|This book is a hilariously funny read of the rolling on the floor variety! It had me LOL uncontrollably in public when I first discovered it at a local bookstore. And I happen to be a heretic, of the early Christian variety with a little New Age thrown in, that Chesterton so apparently dislikes. <BR>Paraphrasing some of my favorite lines (about the editor of the Clarion) &quot;he's one early Christian that should have been eaten by lions&quot; or &quot;there's another word for Agnosticism, it's called Ignorance&quot; or &quot;Jesus tells you to love your neighbor, Annie Bessant says you are your neighbor&quot; and then goes on to complain that the reason you love your neighbor is the same reason you love a woman, because she's different from you. <BR>He also has lot of not so Christian things to say about George Bernard Shaw (apparently a compulsive liar, I never knew! hehehe) and Nietzche. Occasionally Chesterton makes a salient point, such as will being limiting. But most of it is the very &quot;light sophism&quot; that he complains his critics accuse him of. Students of logic would love this book because it's fun to pick apart the endless twisted reasoning. He gets away with it (and why I suspect this book has remained popular for so long) because of the unintentional humorous bon mots combined with a childish glee and naivety and, yes, charm. Chesterton doesn't like the &quot;funny&quot; adjective applied to him and complains he never says anything funny that he doesn't deeply believe in first. Poor guy. Nonetheless not a page goes by that doesn't have you chuckling.
B00004Z459|4.0|I love this CD. It has many great songs including &quot;In the End&quot;<BR>'
038533558X|2.0|Harlan Coben is one of my favorite writers.  His Myron Bolitar series is outstanding and his first non-Myron book, \\"Tell No One\\" was great.  So, what's wrong with \\"Gone for Good?\\"  First of all, it is a beautifully written and plotted thriller with many, many plot twists.  It's fast paced and has characters you care about..BUT and this is  a big BUT..THERE IS A MAJOR PLOT FLAW EARLY ON THAT NEGATES THE POWER OF THE BOOK.  So as not to spoil this for those who haven't read it yet, I won't give away the plot.  But, early on in the \\"Ghosts\\" reminiscing, there is an incredible story about how he relished his murder, and later on, we find out something quite contrary.  I've e-mailed Harlan on this all too conspicuous mistake, and am awaiting his reply.  So, read the book---it's very good...but I only gave two stars because of this big, big faux pas!  If anyone else out there noticed it, e-mail us and we can chat about it...
6304711875|5.0|Ignore the one star reviews who are from people who are not intelligent enough to know a good movie. They are whiners who didn't get their dose of mindless gore and excessive junk from stupid gore movies. Scream is for smart people who actually have a clue. Get lost people.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Live at Leeds was recorded in 1970, after TOMMY but before WHO'S NEXT. The concert was extraordinary, with the Who showing the full extent of their R&B set. <br />The band opens with the Cream influenced \\"Heaven and Hell\\", which is by far the best cut on this album.  Jon Enwhistle provides a roaring bass, Keith Moon is Keith Moon, and Pete Townsend solos like a madman; personally, I think Pete's solo goes down as one of the best of all time.  <br />Other notable songs on this album include the hard-rocker \\"Young Man's Blues\\", the hilarious mini-opera \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\", the bluesy \\"Shakin All Over\\" and \\"Summertime Blues\\" . The concert reaches it's climax with the 15 minute \\"My Generation\\", which starts with \\"My Generation\\" and veers into songs from TOMMY.<br />It should be noted that the Who also performed a live performance of TOMMY at Leeds, and it can be found on the Live at Leeds Deluxe Edition. But even without TOMMY, Live at Leeds is awesome.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Wow!  There it is.  Will you know proof when you see it?  Lynch has presented me with proof.  I'm not sure if I can accept it.  I'm a person who asks \\"why, why, why?\\" to everything in life.  I also have an \\"open mind\\".  After that movie I think I will take a break from \\"why, why, why\\".  David gave me one answer to that question and it shook my tree.  I took it past level 4 (religion) to level 5 (religion combined with science).  BTW For those who don't know, level 1 is the summery on the box. You will only get this movie if you are ready/looking for \\"it\\".  Nothing is random. Brilliant job \\"David\\"!!
B00005JKJA|5.0|It would be hardly an exaggeration to say that half the readers of this movie's reviews have seen the movie already and are seeking answers to the many questions this movie leaves them with! And this should explain to you the main feature of this movie.<br />Movies have always been about presenting a plot to its viewers. The plot pretty much is what the movie is all about. Special effects and actors' performance are just tools to help present the plot, nevertheless the plot is the soul and heart of the movie. Movies provide you the plot on a silver plate along with the silverware. Hence what viewers always expect from a movie is a plot that will entertain either through provoking laughter, fear, amazement, excitement, or a mixture of all those elements.<br />But not Mulholland Drive! This is not your traditional movie. Viewers seeking an entertaining plot will probably be disappointed because this movie will not give you a plot. What you're given instead is a riddle! If you watch this movie with the traditional mindset mentioned above your shock will grow as you go through the movie and realize that things aren't making sense! And by the end of the movie you'll be thinking \\"What... is going on!\\"<br />This movie challenges you to discover the plot! It is there. You can feel that it's there. The movie is scary to a freaky extent mostly because the plot is hidden and thus the viewers are left alone to deal with the events! You'll fear everybody! You'll fear going around every corner because you truly can't expect what might happen! This plot is not going to be fed to you like a baby. You'll have to look for it like a responsible adult!<br />The director won't leave you alone though. He'll give you hints and clues all across the movie. But don't expect it to be easy! The hints are smart and are indistinctly available to you even when you least expect them! Thus a number of viewers will feel great frustration by the end of the movie because they weren't able to crack thecode, either because they expected the plot to be solved by the director at the end of the movie (just like all the other movies) or because they simply didn't understand the clues.<br />If after this long introduction you're still expecting to read a synopsis of the plot then you're still maintaining the traditional mindset of a movie watcher. What I'm trying to tell you is that you'll have to find the plot. However, since I wouldn't have bought this movie myself without getting a glimpse of what I should expect to see, I'll give you the following synopsis of what you'll see in the beginning of the movie.<br />The movie begins with an attempt to kill an attractive lady who seems to be rich. The attempt fails though and instead of killing the woman she's left stranded with amnesia. This woman, who will call herself Rita, breaks into the house of another lady called Betty who is seeking to become a great actress in Hollywood. Betty is very nice and takes care of Rita and helps her in her endeavor to regain the lost memory. Simultaneously, the movie shows us the story of a successful Hollywood director who is resisting Hollywood executives pressuring him into casting a lady they're suggesting for the main role of his movie. And the movie takes off from there.<br />I give this movie 5 stars because the idea of a hidden plot is very smart and entertaining. The best thing about it is that the entertainment doesn't end when the movie is over. You'll be left with many questions to ponder on maybe for days and you'll want to watch it again and again to make sure that you understood the plot. Buy this movie and you're guaranteed many hours of entertainment and fun. The movie is also very scary! And the fear isn't a result of cheap shots taken at you while you're not ready just like other scary movies. Instead, the fear is present throughout the whole movie even in the supposedly bright moments! It is creepy!<br />The movie has strong sexual content as well. The actresses are hot and beautiful, and all I can tell you about the sex scenes is that they're unforgettable! Also the acting performance is superb and it delivers the exact results the director intends of the scenes.<br />In the end, if you want to work your brains hard and watch an extraordinary movie, then buy this movie. If you're expecting a movie to watch and forget about once it's done then you might want to be looking somewhere else.<br />For those who have seen the movie and still looking for answers, feel free to email me and I'll provide you links for sites that carry the answers to all the questions.
B000002HPV|5.0|Bjork is downright brilliant. Homogenic is an absolute masterpiece in that it shatters all conventional rules of what music should be. She just keeps getting better with each album, Vespertine is equally amazing, though in a different sort of way. Homogenic is harsh brilliance fully realized with good headphones. Do yourselves a favor and see Bjork delivering a brilliant acting performance in \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" by Lars Von Trier.... GROUNDBREAKING!!
B000066I6N|2.0|ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.......
B00005QXDD|3.0|The &quot;D&quot; definitely has something...  Great music, Great Vocals - many joke bands seriously lack quality chops.  But for the &quot;Over 25&quot; crowd, who crave more delicious irony and social satire - - an act such as &quot;Hollywood Superstars&quot; would better fit the bill.  No disrespect to the &quot;D&quot; - Rock On.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Masterpiece a.  Year this  seen I've movie best the arguably.
B000069AT7|5.0|How can people write bad reviews before the product is even released? I have no idea. Or even before reading the product especifications!!<BR>This wonderful collection (according to what I have read) will have both the 2002 and the 1982 versions of E.T., which I think is wonderful.<BR>As a musician, though, I had the privilige to see the premiere of the 2002 version in L.A., with maestro Williams conducting a 100-piece orchestra and synchronizing the whole soundtrack to the complete movie! Now, I think this is the first time this was done with a whole movie. It was personal the most gratifying musical experience I've ever had, even though I wasn't the one conudctin! :)<BR>In any case, I hear that this new DVD collection will have the choice of seeing the movie with the original 1982 soundtrack or with the life Williams performance from March 16th 2002. I think that only fact will make this collectiona 5-star one...<BR>Enjoy!!
B000002UB3|4.0|...but not quite as good as Sgt. Pepper or The White Album, in my opinion.  What drags this album down a star?  Two songs in particular:  Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octopus' Garden...and while I appreciate these songs, they fall solidly into the same class of filler that I would put Yellow Submarine.  I loved these songs when I was 13, but nowadays they are merely quaint and interrupt the flow of what would otherwise be a perfect CD.<br />\\"Come Together\\" is a classic Beatles tune, \\"Something\\" is among the best love songs of all time, and \\"Because\\" is utterly brilliant!!  The production is (of course) among the best you'll find from the 60's, and the level of creativity is astonishing considering that this is a recording of a band about to die.<br />None of the individual Beatles did anything close to this after breaking up, with the possible exception of Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\".<br />A very solid 4 to 4-1/2 star album by a 6-star band.<br />As I see it:<br />5-Stars:  If you love The Beatles, and don't mind the two songs mentioned above.<br />4-Stars:  If you agree with what I said above.<br />3-Stars:  If you like the \\"early period\\" Beatles better, or if you are one of those people who \\"like The Rolling Stones more\\".  You know who you are!<br />2-Stars:  If you don't like the music your parents listened to...after all, Journey was the real supergroup!<br />1-Star:  If you don't like the music your grandparents listened to...after all, The Backstreet Boys are the real supergroup!
B000068R1X|3.0|I've had it with the lies. <BR>I've loved Ozzy like all of you for a long time. But you know what: the reissues of 'BOZ' and 'DOAM' and 'BATM' have lifted the veil on lies that are simply unacceptable. Tell me - in any other form of art or music, would outright lies about the true creators of lyrics/music/art be accepted?<br />Bob Daisley is the true architect behind the topics of Ozzy's solo career. His lyrics are what gave Ozzy SUBSTANCE (the difference between him and a thousand others). Daisley needs to be recognized, admired and given his credit. Ozzy is not what he has led people to believe. Funny, I always wondered how this clown of a personality could write such great lyrics... <BR>Now we find out the truth.<br />I am so disappointed, as others will be when they find out. The worst part of this is that Ozzy and Sharon will not even pay Daisley his royalties. Christ - these songs would not exist without Bob's lyrics. THEY ARE HIS SONGS ALSO. (imagine if you can, the hypocrisy of reading in the Bark at the Moon credits that Ozzy wrote these songs alone...  Daisely or Jake E. Lee aren't even mentioned.)<br />I am throwing down the gauntlet to true OZZY fans - Spread the truth and let's get Ozzy to make things right. He is nothing if not truthful about his career. <br />Public personalites earn our love and respect with their talent, performances, accomplishments and INTEGRITY. But when they cease to show truthfullness, they lose their right to our admiration. It is imperative that people and especially Ozzy's fans learn the truth about his songs. His greatest acheivements are mainly due to Bob Daisley's fantastic lyrics. Daisley deserves the same royalties as Ozzy. <BR>And the same respect from the public. Truth must prevail.
B000000HTM|5.0|This is Van Der Graff`s crowning achievement. There is not much else to say.....my only complaint is that &quot;Theme One&quot; is omitted from the cd. Hammills vocals...Bantons keyboard wizardry...and those crazy David Jackson sax solos. What a great piece of 70s rock. You can`t go wrong with this.
0385720920|5.0|I've seen the movie version of Fight Club, but Choke was the first book of Palahniuk that I've read.  One of the major knocks on this book seems to be that Palahniuk has rehashed territory that he's covered before, but as a first-timer to Palahniuk, I was simply blown away.  Perhaps Choke was old hat for people who've read Palahniuk before, but for me at least it was an eye-opener.<br />&quot;Anarchist&quot; is a word that seems to be attached to Palaniuk, but I think insightful might be a better word.  He is able to see the world as a realist, albeit a joyfully cynical one.  Palahniuk's idea of Jamais vu-where everybody is a stranger no matter how well you think you know them-interested me in particular because of how true I believe it is.  Our parents, friends, children, co-workers ... no matter how well we may think we know each other, what do we really know?  How well do we even know ourselves for that matter?<br />Choke was as entertaining as it was thought-provoking.  I found myself laughing out loud again and again.  If Choke wasn't so hilarious it would be downright mortifying.  Palahniuk certainly pulls no punches.  The plot twist at the end- &quot;jamais vu all over again&quot;- left me amazed.<br />The general concensus seems to be that if you've read Palahniuk before, this book will be a familiar foray into chaos.  If you are like me and are only familiar with Palahniuk through the movie Fight Club (and liked it), I highly recommend Choke.  An unforgettable read.
0316666343|4.0|This was a wonderful book to read.  I couldn't put it down.  I finished it in 4 nights.  Just the way the story unfolds told in 1st person, but an already dead person.  It was just compelling to learn of the ordeals the family and friends of a loved one had to deal w/ their death.  I cried, I laughed and I panicked.  It did get confusing at times because of all the jumping around from memory to memory.
B00003CXI0|4.0|You must read the book before reading this movie especially with school-age children.  There are very scary parts but if you read the book first you should be fine.  We read all 4 books with our 8 yr daughters before seeing this movie.  They were fine because they knew what was going to happen next.<br />The best parts are the Quidditch matches.  They were nothing like we had imagined it.  They were great fun. We all enjoyed watching this movie.
B000002VCQ|5.0|When this album first came out it was slow to rise to the top of the charts but when it got there it stayed for a big 14 week stay.  I can see why The songs &quot;You Give Good Love&quot; and &quot;How Will I Know&quot; and &quot;Saving All My Love For You&quot; were and still are great to listen to.  The non-hit I like is &quot;All At Once&quot; I listen to that song everyday.  this album has sold 13 million copies to date and is Whitney's biggest studio album other than the Bodyguard Soundtrack.  I recommend this album.
B00000JH09|5.0|i think this cd is a masterpiece. Serj Tankian has to be the greatest song writer in the world. this cd also has great music. system of a down is definetly my favorite band after listening to it. the best part was that they wrote about real stuff. like a genocide, and a lot of politacal stuff.and if you like this cd you'll love their new one even more
0783117523|5.0|If you like Angelina Jolie then you will love this movie and have to see it. I just saw the movie for the first time last week and it is now one of my favorite movies! Its a true story based on the life of supermodelGia Carangi. This movie is great and I loved it!
B000002JKA|5.0|This is a definitive Dream Theater CD, as it contains much of their signature sound and songwriting, however a real edge has been added to wash away the comparisons to Styx/Kansas/Yes/etc.<br />Face it, their influences shine through on most tracks on all of their CD's, but what I really like about AWAKE is that it is not as obvious as others (e.g. SFAM, Images).  I think they really tried to break out of the bottomless pit that all prog rock bands face - just how ORIGINAL and exciting can this type of music be made into??  Wake up and check out AWAKE.<br />Mind you, I have all of DT's music, and love it all.  I have also been a big fan of prog rock since I knew about it (circa 1970).  Granted, DT can easily be called derivative, as a lot of folk I try to turn on to DT say \\"gee, they sound a lot like ...\\".  The bottom line is that Petrucci and Portnoy are the leaders, and they really are master musicians - unfortunately not always the most creative folk on the planet.  Morse is/was their best keyboard guy, Myung is unreal and totally under-rated.  LaBrie, well, he is a great vocalist that can wear on you as his range is fairly predictable (yup, time for him to 'aaaaa' now).  But, heck, glad they ditched their first lead vocal guy!!! Too much like a bad Queensryche imitator/hair band thing going...<br />Check out this lesser-known DT classic - if you had to make the choice between this and other less popular DT CD's, get this one - today!!
0446608955|5.0|This book was touching. In the beginning I couldnt get into it but it turned out to be a good heart felt book. It takes place in 1958 and Landon Carter is telling the story. It is one of those make you cry type books. I cried, laughed, said awww, said why?, etc. The book was like one of those books that make you realize how much life really means to you. If you havent read this book you have to get it. It is a must have book. Any one who loves books will love this book fa sho'!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Just when I thought that no movie could ever come close to the hilarity of The Big Lebowski, the Coen brothers release this film, and prove me dead wrong.<br />O Brother is one of those films that will have you laughing til you puke blood. I, for one, can't get enough of the gubernatorial candidates - whether it's Homer &quot;Soyvant(sic) of the Little Man&quot; Stokes or Menelaus &quot;Pass The Biscuits&quot; Pappy O'Daniel. All of the film's characters stick to memory like glue - Delmar, Wash and Pete Hogwallop, and Everett - there really is no role in this film that's insignificant.<br />If DVD's were at all like video tapes, the underside of my disc would probably be all scratched by now.<br />It's difficult to describe how funny this film truly is - you will probably understand only if you already have seen some other Coen Brothers films. But I can't commend this film enough - let me just say that every person should see it at least once - just be ready to laugh until you pass out.<br />In conclusion, I should add that the soundtrack to this film is also excellent. Chock full of classic American folk and bluegrass, it truly is one of the best soundtracks ever made.
B000002KBH|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful cd s I know of.  We have songs here like Box of Rain and Attics.. which are and were excellent tunes that this band played live.  I mean, when they did Attics, I think even they got a big kick out of it.  I like most of the dead's material, but there is some that is stale to my liking.  More power to this band, they created some great music but some of it like most things that arent perfect were somewhat stale.<br />Back to this album.  This album and Workingman's Dead were like the two albums that this band made that showed they were developing good skills at singing.  The singing here is of a very good level.<br />This cd is timeless.  I think 20 years from now they will listen to it and get something out of it.  <br />5 stars.
0684833395|5.0|Last summer, I read this book somewhat reluctantly.  I figured I should read more classic books like that for my own personal literacy level, not suspecting I would enjoy it overmuch.  However, after about 10 pages, I was delighted to find that reading it was one of the better experiences of my sedentary life.  Sure, it's long, but regretfully not long enough, for it is so glorious that I wish it would not end.  And now I make it a tradition to re-read Catch 22 every summer (along with the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, which I also highly recommend).  <br />Joseph Heller brings us over 40 characters, each with distinctive attributes.  The plot is jumpy, but for some reason, it works. Heller keeps what is usually a mundane subject exceptionally interesting, and truly proves that writing is an art.  Read this.  It's funny too.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. I simply adore it. However, the first time I watched it, I thought 'Okay, what exactly just happened?'<BR>Most people who claim that it's difficult to understand, are right. It is, the first time, because you miss a lot of the little details that glue the entire movie together. Most of the people who disliked this movie, and found it plotless, just didn't understand the movie, I think. <BR>It has a wonderful plot, but if it's your first time seeing it, you'll probably miss a lot of it. It's a fairly simple plot really, about a high-paid courtesan and a penniless poet. They fall in love, and the penniless poet must save his love from the 'Underworld'. You have to watch it. You may have to watch it twice. But I guarentee that once you understand all that's going on (not just the &quot;big picture&quot;) you'll realize how wonderful the movie truly is.<BR>BAZ IS GOD!<BR>(Not to mention the wonderful eye candy presented by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, both of which have beautiful singing voices and do some award-winning acting in this movie.)
B00005QG9J|5.0|Remember the good days of S.C.I.E.N.C.E.?  and how great that music was.  how it was hard, but it still was melodic?  well this album is much different from other incubus albums.  It's a softer core album, but it has some incredible music.  It has some nice soft songs, like are you in or 11am, and it has harder songs like have you ever, circles, or under my umbrella.  If you like incubus, or great music, this is a great buy.
6304140711|1.0|A pretty, unconscious, teen blonde falling in love with a beautiful, muscled, young guy, supposed to be filled with spirit, but who's not what he seems to be, who's actually a brute, a real psycho, treating women like sexual slaves...<br />We've already seen that kind of story a thousand times, especially in TV programs. In this film it's treated a desperately silly way, we don't believe in it for a single second. What the hell happened to the talentful director of \\"At close Range\\"? What interesting elements did he find in such a bad script? All this violence, all these dead people, all this mess, for one single girl... what do you want me to say? It's just too big to be honest. The actors, among them the too rare William L. Petersen (who, after \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\", faced Hannibal Lecter in \\"Manhunter\\", remember), here facing another psycho, well played by Mark Wahlberg, do what they can to save the movie from the complete disaster. But the final siege sequence, totally ridiculous (just for one girl??), desperately trying to imitate the one in Peckinpah's masterpiece, \\"Straw Dogs\\", ruins all their hopes and efforts.<br />This is James Foley's worst movie which doesn't deserve a DVD release. Don't trust the title: we never got fear, but pity, yes, that's for sure...
B000062YB1|5.0|No other Slayer CD, in fact, no other CD from any other band sounds as agressively tenacious as &quot;Seasons in the Abyss.&quot; It is hard to believe that such horrid, twisted sounds can cause such a musical delight.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This movie had much promise but was sadly disappointing.  I really wanted to like this film.  After all, it is a remake of a classic movie based on a classic book.  Unfortunately, the screen writers (if that's not an oxymoron) decided to re-write H. G. Wells, badly.  The hero's new motivation for attempting to change time to save his fianc was unnecessary at best and delivered poorly.  The distant future treated, so well by Wells and the original film, was not well developed or portrayed.  The idea of a super intelligent Morlock leader exercising thought control over his specially engineered \\"hunters\\" was poorly conceived and implemented.  In fact, the Morlocks have such superhuman strength and speed in this version, escaping them at all is implausible.  The Eloi in this version seem far too industrious for their situation and Weena (badly played by Omero Mumba) as a school teacher gives new meaning to absurd.  And then there's the matter or using the time machine as a poor man's thermonuclear device.  Overall, the plot was just not well thought out.  The acting was barely acceptable but uninspired (would you be with this script).  One should always be wary of pop recording star actors.  The one redeeming value was the scenery and special effects.  Too bad they were wasted on this effort.  If you like the idea of time travel, please see the 1960 version with Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux or Time After Time with Malcolm McDowell.  Save this one for when you have absolutely nothing better to watch.
B000001C6M|5.0|Heavy Metal already had a reputation for being evil. But not once had anyone ever felt  such violent and twisted music until Slayer emerged! \\"Show No Mercy\\" caused a rebirth of Metal that inspired conuntless. This CD is indeed precious and well sought after for 20 years

B00005JKNF|5.0|For anyone who likes a good old fashon who-done-it, this may be for you. The characters are delightful and surprisingly human. The whole interplay between upstairs and downstairs is wonderful to watch. The director let the actors become the characters not just actors playing a part. I feel this is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in a long time. It is orginal, entertaining and fun to watch, with just a touch of tears to give it body. I highly recomend this work to everyone.
B000067CPX|5.0|This album moved me. &quot;By the Way&quot; is simply, a grand triumph!  It vaults the Red Hot Chili Peppers up into that rarefied air, that until now, only U2 has occupied of late. It's passionately sung and played, thoughtfully poetic, and musically beautiful. An instant classic. The RHCP are serving notice that they are a band to be reckoned with in the years ahead.
B00000DGSN|5.0|Five stars are not enough to qualify this album. In a few words: it's the best ever. I've been grown up in classic music and always regarded rock'n'roll (and any modern genre, by the way) as BS. The Purple people made me change my mind (only marginally; I still think that most of modern music is absolut BS): they are simply the best thing since Wagner died and this album is beyond any category. Buy it! (or steal it); you won't regret it...
0316666343|5.0|This book is amazing.  I couldn't put it down the entire time I was reading. The author takes you on a journey that will make you laugh, cry, reflect, question and ultimately look outside of yourself and realize the importance of life and family. I could never imagine the horror a family faces when a child is lost but this book brings the reader there. Thank you Alice Sebold for the journey!
0800141660|5.0|Jane Austen is a fine writer, but her wordiness tends to drain the life from many of her characters.  Thankfully, Emma Thompson recognized the limitations of the novel and adapted her screenplay accordingly, enhancing the humor of the original story and heightening drama to make the film more captivating.  A cast was then chosen, made up of very talented thespians, including Miss Thompson herself.  Add to that splendid English landscapes, excellent directing, haunting music, and superb cinematography, and what emerges is a modern masterpiece.    This is no movie for action fans; it is far too cerebral and requires a serious attention span.  For those who enjoy a good love story well told, this film delivers.  The characters are three-dimensional and their dilemmas full of human drama, bound as they are by the morals and manners of the times.  Three sisters and their mother are left virtually penniless by the stricture against females inheriting property then in place in English law.  The half-brother to the Dashwood women receives it all, but his selfish wife talks him out of helping his stepmother and half-sisters.  It is up to the two older girls---sensible Elinor and passionate Marianne---to seek their fortunes in romance while lacking a dowry to help them.    Elinor finds her soulmate in shy, retiring Edward Ferrars, brother of the selfish sister-in-law, a man lacking in the usual Victorian ambitions.  Her budding romance is shelved when his sister makes it clear that Elinor is \\"unsuitable\\" for Edward.  The sisters and their mother then go to stay in a cottage owned by a kindly relative, Sir John, and his mother-in-law, the irrepressible Mrs. Jennings.  The old woman is a confirmed gossip and matchmaker, bound to see one of the two sisters hitched up to Colonel Brandon, the most eligible bachelor in the area.    Brandon first sees Marianne singing a melancholy song and is incurably smitten.  She in turn loses her heart to a dashing young man named Willoughby, who is her ideal of a Victorian-era gentleman, complete with a pocket book of sonnets.  Brandon, who loves her more than his own happiness, steps aside and even encourages their relationship, despite his dislike for the handsome rogue.    Things take an unexpected turn for the worse for both sisters---Willoughby abruptly drops Marianne and flees to London with no explanation and Elinor discovers that Edward is engaged to a shallow young woman named Lucy Steele.  The ensuing twists and turns in the plot make this film both agonizing and entertaining to watch.  Mercifully, everyone winds up happy at the end wedded to the right person.    The whole film is solidly done, but it is the acting that really shines.  Thompson is perfect for the role of the calmer sister, while Winslett is brilliant as the mercurial Marianne.  Grant is endearing as the gentle Edward; Rickman finally gets to display his considerable ability to act the part of a very good and unselfish man.  The rest of the cast keeps pace with the leads, and Hugh Laurie is indescribably funny as the sarcastic Mr. Palmer.  One very beautiful aspect of this movie, along with the tendency to get drawn into the story, is the evocative musical score that tugs at the heartstrings.    All in all, this is a wonderful example of a film genre that is so often overlooked in today's world---period romance.  More movies like this one desperately need to be produced.  Buy this one today because it's a gem, perfect for an afternoon of inclement weather with your own soulmate.
B000002H97|5.0|An awesome CD with simpler, slower songs.<BR>Enter Sandman: my favorite metallica song, i don't know why.  maybe it's that it has an awesome intro, riff, lyrics, finale, middle part, everythings perfect.  <BR>Sad but True: Slowy but a goody<BR>Holier than Thou: awesome<BR>Unforgiven: Awesome intro and lyrics<BR>Wherever I May Roam: awesome intro, how the riff starts out slow, then just punches into fast mode.<BR>Don't Tread on Me: a song about not messing with them<BR>Through the Never: cool song<BR>Nothing Else Matters: good slow song dedicated to Cliff Burton the greatest bassist ever.<BR>Of Wolf and Man: bad intro, but gets better<BR>The God that Failed: cool riff<BR>My Friend of Misery: seems longer than it acually is, but one of my favorite songs on the CD<BR>The Stuggle Within: pretty good, not the best song metallica's ever done.<br />Very good CD with more songs than other CD's.
B00004XONN|5.0|Well, maybe this cd changed my concept of music. Smashing Pumpkins did it before, when I gone from heavy metal to alt rock. Then, Radiohead's Kid A changed my mind to a more \\"pop\\" sound and eletronic. Don't get me wrong, I never said it's pop.<br />I don't understand it all. And I keep guessing: \\"Is this album a masterpiece because no one can understand it or no one can understand it because it is a masterpiece?\\" Well, I don't think this question is easy. And can be made for their last release, the also enigmatic Amnesiac.<br />I know that a lot of people didn't like it. It's for sure strange, not usual. But it has a deep beauty. All about arrangements and experiments. Digitalizations, keyboards and loops, all worked very fine to create a great atmosphere.<br />I know, there's not a Fake Plastic Tress, a Karma Police, or even a Let Down here. There's not a BIG hit. And I think that, despite of how much this one and Amnesiac were good, they don't reach the masterpiece that is OK Computer. But Kid A is diferent, new. Music needs new things. Needed. And Radiohead was there to bring news. And now lots of bands and (even good) artist are influenced by them. Radiohead were pretentious recording such a \\"dificult\\" album as this one? Well, if they were, congratulations. Music needs more pretentious artists to change this mess that music is turning these days.<br />Buy it. If you are not sure, listen to it before. Or listen to OK Computer first. You hardly will like this album the first time you listen to it. And maybe you'll take a long time to apreciate it. It was like this with me. But don't worry, when you realize, you'll be singing the verses of some songs everywhere.<br />Just to mention, I just give 5 stars for: REALLY good albums or albums that bring something new. This album achieve both requisites.
B000002H33|4.0|This is an awesome CD.  Not as good as Ride the Lightning, though.  Here's the songs:<BR>Battery: probably the fastest song on the CD with awesome bass and a cool middle section<BR>Master of Puppets: a true classic.  But many people don't realize that it's acually a sonata that follows ABA format with a fast start, slow section, then a finale similar to the first movement. <BR>Thing that should not be:  A very catchy song with a awesome, weird solo<BR>Sanitarium: a good song with some funny lyrics if you listen to them<BR>Disposible Heroes: awesome song about war<BR>Leper Messiah: pretty good<BR>Orion: an instrumental, not as good as call of ktulu<BR>Damage, INC.: about as fast as battery.  This is a cool song with an awesome rift<br />This is a must own for anyone who likes plain old good rock.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Clerks was Kevin Smith's first movie, and it shows. It's video and audio are terrible, the directing is less than perfect, the acting is wooden, etc.<br />It's perfect. Dante is a whiny loser, and he's great as the central character. Randal is a cynical video clerk; hates his customers; even sells children cigarrettes.<br />This is the first movie to feature Jay and Silent Bob and they are quite different from their later appearances. They are much rougher than in MALLRATS, for example. In Mallrats, they are cartoonish characters, but in this one, they are loud (Well, Jay is) and drug dealers. They're drug dealers in all the movies, but this one features it at the most prominent.<br />The film is quite funny. The \\"37\\" scene is classic. Only a few moments are not up to par with the rest... But those are so few, they won't be bothered with...<br />The DVD is quite good. It has a great commentary (In which Jay sleeps through most of it), deleted scenes, and a music video. Sure, it's a direct port from the Laserdisc, but the laserdisc was a good one.<br />The only problem is that the film is non-anamorphic. Hopefully, in the upcoming anniversary edition disc they will fix this problem...
B000002H2H|5.0|This is by far the best MetallicA CD ever.  These are the awesome songs:<BR>Fight Fire with Fire: Awesome bass and lyrics about getting revenge. also has a funny intro.<BR>Ride the Lightning: Very long, but awesome song about getting sentanced to the electric chair.<BR>For Whom the Bell Tolls: kind of slow, but overall cool.<BR>Fade to Black: one of the best MetallicA songs ever. very well written and AWESOME guitar solos.<BR>Trapped Under Ice: probably the worst song on the CD with a stupid theme.<br />Escape: cool song <BR>Creeping Death: this song is so AWESOME!  It's about the event where the pharoh killed all 1st born kids.  Sweet finale and overall awesome.<BR>Call of Ktulu: i don't know how to pronounce it, but i know it's the best instrumental metallica has done.  the longest song on the CD, and very repetative and catchy. i can't help but love it.<BR>BEST METALLICA CD! MUST BUY!
B000053VAF|5.0|Dogma is a brilliant film. Possibly Smith's best. While not as dramatic as Chasing Amy, it is a great flick. <br />Sure, if you're not religious, you may not get much of it, but I'm an Agnostic and had No real problem with it.<br />I'm not going to bother with a summary of the movie, because I want to get straight to the reviewing.<br />The writing for this movie is genius. Every character is well-rounded, even Jay and Silent Bob. The only problem I had with it was all the cussing.<br />\\"But,\\" you say, \\"this is a Kevin Smith movie! Shouldn't that be expected?\\"<br />\\"Yes, but why should there be so much when most of the characters would work so well without them?\\"<br />Aside from that, there are really no big problems with the movie. It's well-paced and has a great cast. Jason Lee, once again, proves that he is a very talented guy.<br />Linda Fiorentino seems to be in a different movie, but it's no real problem.<br />The DVD is a sight to behold. With 100 minutes of deleted scenes, there's enough to make a DOGMA TV-movie.<br />There are two commentaries on the DVD. The 1st is a cast and crew commentary featuring the same commentators as the Mallrats commentary... But it's nowhere near as funny. The second has only Smith, Pereira, and Mosier in it and is much more interesting.<br />There is a fifteen minute gagreel that is quite funny.<br />The trailer for this movie is terrible. Horrible music.<br />There are storyboards for a few scenes. Interesting, but unimportant.<br />There are three easter eggs on the DVD that are all quite funny. Two of them are acted out by Jay and Silent Bob action figures and one's a commercial for Jay and Silent Bob's Secret stash. <br />Great movie and DVD<br />[5] out of [5] for both
B000002H6C|4.0|A very good CD, with very complicated songs.  Here's the songs:<BR>Blackened: cool, but i don't like the middle part<BR>..And Justice for All: coming in at almost 10min, this song is awesome.  Awesome entry, lyrics, solo, and finale.  <BR>Eye of the Beholder: I love the riff in this song, but this song can get stuck in your head easily.<BR>One: an awesoeme song about being alone in the world.  this song always makes me happy, i don't know why.  I love this song because it starts off slow, and then puts it into drive and just goes wild. What happened to the bass in this song?? sounds like justin took a break during this song and didn't even play his bass. but still it's awesome.<BR>The Shortest Straw: pretty cool<BR>Harvester of Sorrow: i don't know how metallica came up with a song called \\"harvester of sorrow\\", but this song is awesome.<BR>Frayed ends of Sanity: Not as good as Harvester of Sorrow, but pretty close.<BR>To live is to die: an instrumental WAY better than Orion, and 4sec longer than ...And Justice for All<BR>Dyer's Eve: a very cool song<BR>Overall it's a very good CD.
B00005QW4K|5.0|ARMY OF DARKNESS: the Director's Cut is the end-all, be-all of Bruce Campbell movies. It has everything you could want: Catchy one-liners, slapstick; Bruce Campbell's chin (in two different roles!), and, of course, blood geysers!<br />How could you go wrong?<br />The Director's Cut is 15 minutes longer, and has an alternate ending. The ending in this version is much more appropriate for the movie, but the theatrical ending is cooler.<br />This DVD has everything you want: Deleted Scenes, a commentary by the Raimi brothers, Ivan and Sam, and of course Bruce. The only thing missing is the Theatrical trailer, which is nothing of importance.<br />This is perhaps my favorite movie. I watch it at least once a month, more often than not, more than that.<br />Hail to the King, Baby...<br />Oh, wait... That's only in the theatrical version...<br />Oh well, it's still the best summation for the movie...
B00003CX5P|1.0|i am a forever fan of the original starwars, but my disapointment in episode one would have been just as dramtic had i never seen star wars before. i thought that lucas was a movie maker-not just a really rich guy with tons of special effects to his desposal. for some reason he was under the impression that if he filled his movie to the brim with visual stimuli, he could get away with a flat story and flatter charactors. i'm not joking. these charactors had no chemistry between them whatsoever. good actors put to dismal waste is what it was. the dialogue was so bland that i forgot what was said while they were saying it (and no, this does not reflect on me personally-it was the movie for shore) you see, good movies are not made unforgettable by the visual effects or the costumes. those can be over done very easily. good movies grow from quality of story, personality, and depth. there was so much potential in the phantom menace that i cannot watch it without weeping and wanting to kill myself (not really) anyway, yeah.
B00005ATQ9|3.0|I watched this film expecting the unexpected, as one tends to do with Kubrick films. However, this film just did not seem to live up to the admired oddness that most Kubrick films radiate. Cinematography is brilliant, and the costumes and makeup are top notch, but the screenplay failed to meet my expecatations. This film has no Kubrickian twists, images or characters, that probably being because it was based on W.M. Thackery's novel. The character of Barry Lyndon is quite easily a deplorable one and that adds to why I didn't enjoy this film. In the begining you like Mr. Barry but in the end you can't help but despise him. Since he is the main character, it has a toll on the over-all film. The most Kubrickian scene in this film is the horse scene and the scenes worth watching are the card games. The card game scenes really give one a sense of life during the 16th Century, not to mention the impeccable cinematography and costumes showcased in the scene. On the negative side, this film is too long and needed editing. If you are a fan of costume dramas, you will adore this film much more than I. Kubrick fans: you will be disappointed. I'm somewhere in the middle bewteen those two, and that's why I gave it three stars. One thing I'll garuntee: better novel than a film.
B000059XYA|5.0|This is the best  superman sequel ever  and it had a great <BR>opening  theme showing the audiounce what happend in superman <BR>one.And I loved the reshoot of krypton's  three super villians<BR>a great movie...............................
0316666343|4.0|While Sebold's debut novel may not pack the literary punch of an Austen or a Bronte, The Lovely Bones' haunting, ethereal prose lingers long after the novel's conclusion.  Sebold's narrator, Susie Salmon, pushes the reader forward through the entire novel by grabbing an immediate interest in her life (after-life?) from the very first paragraph ... Discover this wonderful novel!
B000059XXZ|4.0|I think that Adam West should have played BATMAN instead of<br />micheal keaton it would have made the movie more  enjoyable<br />to watch...................
B00005QZWI|5.0|This soundtrack as a varity of music. You can see the movie unfold as you listen to this CD.  If you enjoyed the movie &quot;Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring&quot; you should own this CD!

B000067CPX|3.0|The first impression after listening to By the Way all in one seating is - it's less powerful than Californication, less energetic, more streched at times. <BR>I've become an RHCP fan after Californication - was hardly aware of them before. Their 1999 album was a true breakthrough and I expected to see the trend to continue. Instead, I heard a much stranger mix that reminded me of Doors, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Beatles..not that it's a bad thing, I just expected something less subtle...the title song fell out of the picture, though - it's by far my favorite from the album. <BR>When the last song finished, I replayed the title song. I regretted that RHCP certainly departed further from punk-like Californication. Now, however, that my expectations are defined, I'll listen to it the second time.
0141301120|4.0|I had never read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I am a big fan of the movie, Willy Wonka, it is also one of my pre-schooler's favorites.  We read Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator together, one chapter each night, and it was wonderful.  It picks up right where the movie (and I assume the book) leaves off.  The story was slightly inferior to The Chocolate Factory, hence the 4* rating, but nonetheless it was very enjoyable and well-written.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This movie was choppy to say the least, the story itself is intreguing however it's too choppy, not a whole lot of explanation going on there. However with a story of that magnitude and a running time of only 90 minutes, there's not a whole lot you can do. It seems like they spent their whole budget on the &quot;Time Machine&quot; prop rather then story editors. <BR>It's not bad, but it could have been WAY better!
B0000636UN|3.0|First off, how seriously is a listener supposed to take Sheryl Crow (a wealthy rock singer) when she sings &quot;I got a crummy job, it don't pay near enough&quot;? Well, the answer is &quot;not very.&quot; <br />In the wake of Crow's intimidate and painful masterwork &quot;The Globe Sessions,&quot; the public is offered a somewhat disjointed and stilted collection that pales in comparison to both her previously mentioned 1998 effort and her self-titled disc from 1995. (Even Crow's uneven debut &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; offers more depth than her current CD.) <br />A factor that contributes to the album's low respectability is that Crow opted to include a host of &quot;names&quot; in the sessions. These guest artists make rather negligible contributions, adding virtually nothing to the overall quality of the CD. In fact, the CD's title song features Stevie Nicks on vocals. Well, I certainly cannot hear her. Even with Nicks' inaudible presence, the song SOUNDS like a Stevie Nicks song, which certainly may speak to the female bonding Nicks and Crow have achieved, but it certainly doesn't do anything to improve Crow's sound.<br />There are a few bright spots on the disc, namely a nice rock opener &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and a ballad called &quot;Safe and Sound,&quot; although the latter track is overproduced and lacks the tenderness of Crow's original version of the song.<br />As overtly bad as the disc gets is &quot;Weather Channel,&quot; a self-indulgent, lethargic meditation in self-pity. Also, a duet with Don Henley weighs the CD down, especially since his and Crow's voices are so similar. (Sadly, listeners are not forewarned on the CD's outer track listing that Don Henley even appears as a dueting artist. A fair warning would have been nice.)<br />I really love Sheryl Crow's music, but this CD was shuffled away in my collection about two weeks after I bought it. (Sheryl's previous studio albums each lasted at least a year at the top of the heap.) AndI believe Sheryl Crow is a terrific singer and songwriter...this CD just shows little evidence to support that.<br />If you are just cutting your teeth on this artist's music, pick up ANY of her other CDs first.
B00005JLDW|1.0|With all of our technical advances with regards to CGI and robotics this film COULD have been great. Unfortunately for me and my wallet it was not. The build up was slow and not very explanitory then the last 20 minutes picks up a bit like it's going to start being exciting then it ends! <BR>Matthew McConaughey who I usually find to be quite a good actor is nothing but a beefed up termanator in this film, there is absolutely no depth to his character, he's just kind of there! The film is really quite pointless and a very big waste of time and money, and not just your's for watching it, the studio's for making it. <BR>Even the dragon's in the film aren't really that good, after all they are the \\"big stars\\" in this flick, and you barely get to see then except for a few mostly far away shot's and again there's really no explanation as to why they are even there. Please don't waste your money, wait til it comes out on cable.
B000001ESJ|5.0|You might remember me from such reviews as \\"2112\\" and, well, to tell you the truth, that's about all I've had me the time to listen to so far.  But hang loose, I'm a-gonna get to all them there Rush albums.  Well, sir, here we are at the '77 offering, name of \\"A Farewell to Kings.\\"  Now where \\"2112\\" had me dancing a jig right off, I was just plain disgusted with this one for what seemed a coon's age, but what turned out to be just a few days, truth be told.  Yessirree, Bob, this here's an album that ain't entirely unlike athlete's foot in how it takes some time to grow on you.<br />Know what?  Turns out the second tune that I made a mention of in that last review of mine ain't got a thing on God's green earth to do with that skating picture of Olivia Newton-John's.  Nope, it's all about some fellow scouting out some kind of supercharged milk or whatnot that ends up making him live on for a whole lot longer than he can quite stand.  You see, Neil Beard (he's the fellow what writes the poems for the band) proceeds to tell about the consequences of our somewhat thick hero's somewhat dim choice to go ahead and swallow that there juice he was looking around for in the first five minutes of the song.<br />There's another longish song what tells a story on this album, too.  It's got a whole lot to do with space and telescopes and I ain't got a whole lot of patience with stuff like that, so I'm not gonna be a whole lot of help with that one.  Let's just say Neil Beard's got some guy flying his spaceship into a black hole only to come out on the next album.<br />Music's top notch, of course.  Only two types of folks in this world: those that like \\"Closer to the Heart\\" and those that don't.  Well me, I ain't for sure.
B000066NW0|4.0|but the CD is a very enjoyable listening experience.  I give her credit for putting out such a professional CD at such a young age.  Some of the reviewers on here have trashed Avril, but I don't see any of them with record contracts!  The songs are catchy, and her voice is great.  It's not the most impressive classic CD of all time, but if you take it for what it is (fluffy female vocal pop music) then you get your money's worth.  It will be interesting to see what Avril will provide in the future as she matures and her writing skills improve.
B000001GBJ|5.0|This is the only album of its kind in existence, as later releases by the group pale in comparison.  Their minimalist approach to musical delivery was a welcome change, but they have forsaken their own archetype.<br />The effectiveness of all the musical terms you've always misunderstood such as legato and portamento has never been better demonstrated on a recording.  One listen to one passage will have you eagerly anticipating the next maneuver.<br />But words--even esoteric musical terms--fail to convey the beauty of this album.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I've just seen the movie 5 minutes ago. I usually don't like horror movies because I don't believe the scenario. (monsters and stuff... you don't get scare by such things in real life so you don't get thrown away by the movie) This one, in fact was really scarry until you realize that the ennemy is a kind of (you'll see). This helps you keep breathing but until then, the story is really scaring you. The characters threatened really seem to be in big trouble. You believe it. That's the point. It's well filmed. Well written.<br />also... errors i found... you see the contacts lenses in the bad guy at the end :), green contacts to make believe he is... (you'll see)<br />Don't read to many reviews because you'll know what it's all about which will make it less scary....<BR>SOrry for my wrtting errors btw, im french
B0000027F8|5.0|George Michael's voice is pure, clear and ethereal as it weaves with the guitar an incredible listening experience for YOU! This album is mellow musically and introspective lyrically. It's a perfect album to listen to on a sunny day on the beach and on a rainy day at home as you're reading a suspense novel. Its versatility is what makes it an incredible work of art to own. George Michael has an ear for catchy tunes, but you'll find out that his true forte is writing (as well as singing, of course) when you listen to this album.<br />I purchased this album three times: twice for myself (lent it to someone and it got lost) and once for my best friend on his birthday. I evidently think so highly of it to give it as a gift to my best friend. It's that good.<br />Whether you are a George Michael fan or not, and even if you don't know who George Michael is, this album will delight you. If we had to put it in a genre it would be Pop, but not frivolous, fluffy Pop. I like to call it Contemplative Pop. This is a mature record that reflects George's after-FAITH phase.<br />In my opinion, every single track on this album is extraordinary. The guitar, the piano and the vocals converge to create masterpieces in the history of Pop; masterpieces that are sometimes effervescent and sometimes plaintive.<br />Buy this album if you enjoy mellow, sweet and melodic tunes and strong, moving and candid lyrics. If you have a sense for aesthetics and you love acoustic guitar, do yourself a favor and get this album. You won't regret it.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|This is a good film. I liked the premise and the thought the film invokes as you watch it, but yet it lacks depth. There are many questions the film leaves unanswered, especially dealing with the scientific questions of time travel. It is only assumed that he learned the way to travel through time, but yet no evidence (even fictional) is offered as to the whys and hows of time travel. We are not made to be impressed with the machine itself and no real reason was given as to the importance of the moon being destroyed, but just that it was an event that was inevitable. If he really wanted to change the fate of the lives of the Eloi and the Morlocks, would it not have been better to go back before the explosion of the moon and stop that action from happening? As we learn in the year 800,000, the reason the Elois and Morlocks lived the way they did was because of that one singular event. It puts a lot of emphasis on one event that is brushed over rather swiftly. So I guess the more i think about it, I actually did not enjoy the film as much as I thought I did. Oh well. Good special effects though.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I think Shrek is a brilliant film, and enjoy it even more than both of Disney's Toy Story movies (which I still think are very good). I think that the humour in Shrek is a little more cutting, and therefore appeals more to the older viewer (I'm 30), and the film also doesn't quite indulge with the schmaltz factor as much as the TS ones did. Also, even though the rapport between Buzz and Woody is great, the same can also be said of that between Shrek and Donkey. I've already seen Shrek about 5 times, which says quite a bit considering that animated films aren't normally a genre I normally go for. Fantastic computer graphics, excellent script, superb chemistry between Myers &amp; Murphy, great music score, hilariously funny, and just an all-round great feel-good movie.
0316666343|5.0|I found this beautifully written book to be one of the best novels I have read in a long while.  It is only superficially about a terrible murder, what is it is really about is the experience of loss and reconciliation.  It could have been sticky and sentimental, especially given that the narrator is speaking from heaven but it isn't. The voice and tone only falter once (in the out of body scene near the end) but otherwise it is simply wonderful.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Die Hard will always be my favorite action film. Bruce Willis played John McClane perfectly. No other actor could have done better. Bonnie Bedelia did a great job acting as John's estranged wife Holly McClane. Alan Rickman and Reginald VelJohnson also give fantastic performances. Director John McTiernan did an awesome job with the film.<br />The DVD is great. The picture and sound are absolutly perfect in every way. This film is LOADED with special features. The 2 extended scenes are good. The gag reel is cool too. The film is 132 minutes long and is Rated R for: language, violence, and really brief nudity.<br />Die Hard is about John McClane(Willis) who traveled to LA to spend Christmas with his wife and childeren. John goes to vist his wife at work. She works at the Nakatomi Plaza on floor number 30 where theres a party for people who work on the floor, they are the only people left in the building besides the guard. A little later terrorists take over the building and take everybody on the 30th floor hostage. John is in Holly's office and isn't taken hostage. Instead he runs up a couple flights of stairs to hide. <br />Now the action, thrills, and enjoyment begin. Make sure you buy this film. Its one of the best. The Five Star Collection DVD is worth your money. I bought the Gift Pack of all three which is an even better deal. I hope you like the film as much as I did. Thanks
B000067CPX|5.0|I'd give it six stars if i could. A great follow up to Californication with more mellow, classic rock (chili peppers style) songs. The four really pulled through and produced a album worthy of a second consecutive &quot;Album of the year&quot;. Accoustic, yet dynamic music from song one to sixteen. Some even have a bit of a classical undertone to the untoppable Chili Peppers talent for songwriting and rocking. A great disc to put in and just push play without having to skip around avoiding the worse songs. You won't find any on here. If you liked Californication, you'll love this even more. The kind of CD i'd buy another copy of just in case i lost one or scratched it (god forbid).
0743455967|4.0|I'm one of those who thought Stephen King would never write anything other than fiction novels.  He, however, has done just that and the book is one of vast knowledge of how to write a work of literature.  The author expresses numerous ideas on how to make yourself a better writer.  I found this book to be very helpful in giving me ideas for my personal writing adventures.  I found it noble of the author to say that maybe his views are not always correct but it's what has worked for him over the years.  Repeatedly the author gives examples of literature, some of which are from well established authors, to support his views.  That within itself is deserving of respect of the author's great knowledge of his art.  <br />In typical Stephen King fashion he does not leave out some time to tell a story that appears to almost be fictional.  For the &quot;diehard&quot; Stephen King fan this book should be a must read item.  The author not only tells of his adventure through life but, as I feel tells the struggles in life that many people experience but have little courage to talk about.  For me Stephen King has done it again, another masterpiece.
0380789035|2.0|You have to be a certain type of reader to enjoy this Gaiman work. I have only read one other of his, \\"Neverwhere\\" and I recommend that one highly! But this one has soooo many twists and turns, you feel like you are a rat in a giant maze.<br />The main character, Shadow, lacks depth, and Gaiman segways into so many side stories in order to bring the plot together-you tend to feel like, \\"Gee, is this ever going to get to the point?\\" Overall, I would've rated this higher, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as \\"Neverwhere\\", the plot is very slow and runs into so many walls, you get a headache reading it! Not to discount Mr. Gaiman's writting skills, he is superb at his craft, but I just couldn't get into this one, and had to force myself to finish it. You can try this one if you want, but I would suggest getting it from a friend or the library. But, if you want to read some better work by the author, get \\"Neverwhere\\", it is a much better read that moves a lot quicker.
0312265859|5.0|Starting with her first Stephanie Plum novel, Janet Evanovich had me wanting more. Keeping with that concept, \\"Hard Eight\\" picks up where \\"Seven Up\\" left off. The story seems so real, for I live in New Jersey and am familiar with the Trenton area.<br />Anyone who likes a drama series with a hint of comedy and mystery on TV, will love this book. Only thing, if you are new to Evanovich, I suggest starting with the first book in the series and reading forward from there.
0060930187|5.0|Many don't undersatnd why the character of Esther goes crazy but I kind of do.  I have been and am still partially in the same place as Esther.  I'm not exactly depressed, or crazy, but I do have my moments when I feel useless and better off dead.  That is why I loved this book so much.  I've always felt very alone in my feelings, and this book proved to me that I am not the only one.  That I am not alone.  At the same time this book also angered me in the fact that Mrs. Plath leaves us the readers completely hanging at the end.  Does she get out?  Does she go back to college?  Does she ever get married?  And what exactly did the doctor fix after her encounter with Irvine (I'm trying not to reveal too much)?  Overall, I think everyone should read this book.  Whether you feel like the character in the book, or you may know somebody like them, I think this book can inspire more understanding with people.  I really don't like using the terms crazy, insanity, or even depression when describing what it is Esther suffers from in the book, because none of the above really describe it.  I know, because I feel it too, and none of those terms describe me. At least I don't think so.  And now I know there are others out there who feel the same as I do thanks to this book.
B00003CXTG|1.0|&quot;Titanic&quot; took a dramatic event and overlaid a stupid love story (the stupidest since, well, &quot;Love Story&quot;); &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; does the same to the Day of Infamy. For the most part, though, &quot;Titanic&quot; got its history straight. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is loaded with howlers. The ultimate is FDR standing up to get the Doolittle mission approved, but there are others. I had no idea that America had guided missile cruisers in 1941, but there they are being blasted by the Japanese. Nothing took off from Ford Island, but our heros manage to do it anyway. Doolittle didn't take on any fighter jocks for his mission (he had own own cadre of bomber hotshots), but somehow he does here. The list goes on, and that doesn't even count the mistakes on the Japanese side. What did they get right? Well, the Japanese attacked and it was on December 7, 1941. After that, they're kind of shaky.
B000002HPV|5.0|This is, quite simply, a beautiful CD. <br />When I first bought Homogenic, I didn't -really- like it. Then, I began listening to it, over and over. I tried sitting by my stereo, doing nothing else except listening to Bjork's voice and accompanying music. Only then, after several listenings, did I come to treasure and love this CD.<br />And, so, I'd advise anyone buying this CD to give it -many- listens. Only then will the beauty of Homogenic be revealed.<br />It's Bjork's best CD. Debut is a good first effort, but not up to par. Post is very good, but there were several 'filler' songs. Selmasongs was excellent, but too short -- only five 'real' songs. And I never liked Vespertine. Homogenic, in contrast, is marvelous.<br />There -are- no filler songs on this CD. None. While many songs -- such as All Neon Like and Unravel -- did not seem excellent early on, months later I came to enjoy even them. The only one I never -really- liked was Immature. Bjork, having produced all and written most of the songs on this CD, manages to surpass her previous efforts, where she had less control over her work. <br />Many of the songs rank among Bjork's best. Hunter, the 'hit', is cool and even spooky. The beautiful Joga is often considered Bjork's best. Bachelorette is good as well, and has wonderful lyrics -- even if they're not all written by Bjork. Alarm Call is probably my favorite Bjork song -- as upbeat as anything on Post or Debut, and one of those 'joyous tunes' that are spoken of in this song. All Is Full of Love is soft and ethereal -- similar to, but better than, anything on Vespertine!<br />Overall, this is a wonderful CD. Even Pluto is a good song, if you're in the right mindset. I'd heartily recommend it.
0385503954|5.0|The mere title suggests that Atonement is a book with weighty themes, and in that, novelist Ian McEwan does not fail to deliver.  Yet for all its seriousness, Atonement escapes the snares that befall so many stories of its ilk; it is unerringly told without being heavy-handed.  Throughout the work, McEwan fills the story with true soul and humanity. Atonement opens with Briony, the thirteen-year-old youngest daughter in an upper class British family.  A budding writer, the girl is preparing to put on a play for her older brother's visit home.  Yet as one misfortune after another dooms her production, the young protagonist turns her imagination to an innocent occurrence that she damningly misreads.  Her sister's plunge into a fountain to retrieve a vase reads as something sinister in the eyes of the would-be novelist, and her story telling lands her sister's lover in prison.  The second half of the story opens as that boy, Robbie, is released from jail only to land himself in the routed British Army retreating toward Dunkirk.  Robbie's terror and the desperation to return to the woman he loves is wonderfully transcribed and the sympathy the reader feels for young soldier burns true.  Meanwhile, Briony, now a nurse, has realized the true nature of her error, and she greatly wishes to reverse her actions.  Yet for all her realization, the girl can neither unsay her words in court nor manage to persuade Robbie to forgive her.  The final chapter of the book takes place in 1999 as an aging Briony reveals that the novel is her final attempt to tell the truth and atone for her actions.  The novel has all the post-modern feel of an artist commenting on the false nature of his work, but in truth, this is an older type of story---one about people attempting to live very real lives---and that is part of what makes it remarkable.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Maybe I just have a thing for slow, sad metal songs like \\"Nebel\\" (which illustrates the death of a loved one on a foggy day), or \\"Mutter\\", (which has been said to be about a child that never lives to see its mother).  Or maybe its the awesome power of \\"Sonne\\" which inspired a whole new philosophy for me.  Maybe its the synth effects in \\"Mein Herz Brennt\\", or perhaps the controversy of \\"Rein Raus\\".  Out of Rammstein's four cds, this one just seems a notch above the rest, which is not to say that Live aus Berlin, Sehnsucht and Herzeleid are not great (in which case they are excellent).  \\"Mutter\\" just has a mystique about it that seems to fly a little higher than the other three.  Needless to say that Rammstein is controversial, but that is what makes them so different, and in my world, difference rules all.  If you're a first time listener going to buy a Rammstein CD, try this one first.  It gives you a taste of slow, fast, and moderate, and a glimpse at the awesome effects of Christian \\"Flake\\"(Flak-uh) Lorenz, the wide voice range of Till Lindemann, the skillful drumming of Christoph \\"Doom\\" Schneider, the distinct bass playing of Oliver Reidel, and the great result of teamwork on guitar demonstrated by Richard Kruspe-Bernstein (Lead Guitar), and Paul Landers (Rhythm Guitar).  Besides the fact that Rammstein is one of the most clever bands I've ever listened to, in chronological order, each album gets better and better. I bought Mutter first, then Sehnsucht, Herzeleid, then Live aus Berlin, and again, of all four of Rammstein's CDs, I'd have to say that Mutter is a touch above the other three.  As a closing, a note to new Rammstein fans:<br />If everyone read and believed what the press and critics told them, music would be composed boybands and various other cleanies.  Read between the lines, and do some research on Rammstein.  Don't follow the critics' words.  They can't even get the translation of \\"Heirate Mich\\" (Marry Me, not Worship Me, thank you very much) correct.  So again, read in between the lines and enjoy Rammstein for who they really are.  One of the most clever bands in existance.
0151008116|5.0|Written by Yann Martel, this novel is about a young Indian boy who is traveling with his family to Canada.  Pi's father is a zookeeper and along for the ride are a number of animals that he is selling to various zoos in North America to provide revenue to start the new life.  The story builds when the ship goes down in a storm, and Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger named Richard Parker.  After the first three days, natural selection cuts the little boat's crew to two---the smartest (Pi) and the strongest (RP).  Pi survives the rest of his journey with the big cat, and Martel is such a brilliant writer that you do not doubt for a minute that any of this is taking place.  The literary nature of the story, combined with the tension of Pi's adventure, and one wicked twist of an ending make this novel one of my recent favorites.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I have seen Britney in concert three times.  I saw this concert live when she came to Rosemont, and let me tell you it is the most amazing concert.  The best parts of the show are when she bungee jumps and when it rains(she wears a different outfit than she does on the HBO special).  The dance moves are great(even though she could cut down on the dancing and do some more live singing).  She does sing live some though, it's not ALL lip syncing.  Buy this DVD, you will not be disapointed!
B00005JKHP|4.0|Now I am by no means a Star Trek Devotee, but I have seen many episodes of the original series and the movies as well. The first film I recently saw again and my attention was drawn to several things.<br />First, I often hear this film trashed in sci-fi circles. This movie is like a combination of the original series and 2001: A Space Oddysey. That was the intention. After the success of Kubrick's film, Star Trek wanted to recapture some of the wonder and magic that Kubrick's film stole from it. It does, at least in the special effects department, rival Kubrick's film, and there is a scene that sports space suits similar to the ones seen in Kubrick's film. Also, the similar plot device of humans put in danger from a mechanical device helps to prove this. But 2001 was a story of humanity, an epic drama that transcended sci-fi and became a purely philosophical exercise. It helped that the film left ambiguity so that viewers could find a bit of themselves in it. That is the wonder. <br />What we have here is a film about exploration. Star Trek: TMP primarily occupies its time with beautiful and elaborate special effects shots intertwined with segments onboard the Enterprise. There is much underrealized content, such as Spock's being rejected by his people, Deckard's bitterness at losing what was rightfully his command, Kirk's struggle to regain his feeling of unity with ship and crew, Bones having to leave the life he enjoyed because of his devotion to an old friend. But much is explored as well, such as loyalty, honor, devotion, friendship, and the unknown. Although it's not at all a classic film, like its sequel, it is an interesting transitionary film that kept enough to remember why we liked these people on the original series and still lays the groundwork for the epic sequel that is universally renowned as the best.<br />In spite of its underachievement, it is a watchable movie that carries a message on dehumanization and the evolution of technology, just as 2001does. Eye-candy and witty observations on society make this a recommended pick for sci-fi fans.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has obviously grown up a lot since her last album.  I'll give a review of each song:<BR>Slave 4 U: 7/10   Pretty good song, it's kinda pointless, but it's fun to dance to.  <BR>Overprotected: 8/10   Great song, I'm glad they remixed it for the video though.  The album version can get kinda old.<BR>Lonely: 10/10   Awesome lyrics, grest music.<BR>I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman: 4/10   I personally think this song is kinda corny(sorry, I gotta tell the truth). <BR>Boys: 9/10    The video remix is better, but this is a good song.<BR>Anticipating: 10/10   Awesome song; has a disco-y vibe.<BR>I Love Rock 'N Roll:   8/10  This is a good song, but I think it was kind of a pointless song to cover.  But it's really cool in concert 'cause she bungee jumps off the platform she's on when she's done.<BR>Cinderella: 10/10   Good pop song.<BR>Let Me Be:  10/10   Has kind of a R&B feel.<BR>Bombastic Love:   6/10   Get kinda boring after a few listens.<BR>That's Where You Take Me:  10/10   I didn't like this song at first, but once I listened to it a few times I loved it.  It's kinda techno-ish.<BR>What It's Like to Be Me: 10/10   One of her best songs ever!  I wish it was a little longer!<br />Overall, this is Britney's best album so far.  There is no filler and you can listen to this album straight through.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|This two disc set is worth the money. Regardless of the stock you put in the decisions of the Academy of Motion Pictures, this film is still quite good and affecting on numerous levels. It seems that almost any film-not just a best picture winner-can get the glossy treatment of a two disc release. I have often wondered who had the brilliant idea to do double disc releases or special editions of pictures that, in my perfect world, would never EVER have been made, much less released on DVD (\\"Baseketball\\" anyone? The Adam Sandler catalogue-excepting \\"The Wedding Singer\\" of course) In this case, the discs contain a lot of info, but none of it seems terribly compelling, save for Ron Howard's home video footage of Dr. Nash explaining his equilibrium theory. The section on the music of the film for example, seems short and rather dull like so many other DVD's which feature special segments on the soundtrack. James Horner talks about how he tried to harness the moods that he experienced while watching the film. Hardly mind-blowing. I think that's what ALL composers do...<br />There are other extras that seem fine-not bad, not great either. (The standard for DVD was clearly set by the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, a film and package that deserves the treatment it received.) The picture quality is quite good, I have not experienced any pixelation yet. I don't know that I would have picked this film for best picture, but I certainly don't hold the view of some who say it should not have even been a contender. What makes the film compelling is that it is loosely based on the life of some real people. There have been ample opportunities for people-including the real Dr. Nash-to bash the film. He and wife Alicia have not. It's hard to imagine how some of the excised portions of the book could be sucessfully worked into the film without it become completely unfocused and disjointed. Howard states as much in his [usually] interesting feature length commentary.  Almost all of the deleted scenes are great and-in my opinion-should have been left in the final cut. <br />If his goal was to portray a man's struggle with schizophrenia and his journey through self-discovery and the discovery of love, then he suceeded. Take the film for what it is-a good drama and an inspiring story. <br />To the reviewer who didn't appreciate Howard's treatment of the disease, go watch any number of depressing films dealing with mental illness and tell me we don't need a bit more hope in our worldview of it. Who's saying everyone with Dr. Nash's illness can be so easily 'cured'? When we see Dr. Nash with his old friend-now head of the department at Princeton-his friend asks him if 'they are still there', refering to the three characters that Nash imagines. \\"Yes\\" Nash replies. And when the man from the Nobel committee asks Dr. Nash about his delusions, Nash states \\"I still see things that are not there. I just choose not to acknowledge them. Kind of like a diet of the mind.\\" So clearly, Dr. Nash himself has NOT been cured. [On his commentary, Ron Howard goes to great pains to describe the research that went into the film, the care that was used to ensure that the disease was treated in a proper manner.]  He has, however, learned how to COPE with an illness he still struggles with-Isn't this an uplifting view of mental illness? Hello?
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|This DVD is simply incredible... The sound and the image quality are amazing.Even my children aged 10 and 5 considered it as their favorite DVD.Working on my home theatre,it's one of the best digital sound and image experiences.
0395389496|5.0|This is the best christmas book ever written.  I could simply stop there and enough would be said.<br /><br />I discovered this book in 1985 before the world told me that Santa was only for children.  I fell in love with the book the first time it was read to me.  However, I did not aquire a copy of my own until I was about 16.  By this time I no longer believed in Santa and had not read the book in years.  I was wandering through my local book store and saw the familiar cover.  I instantly smiled and something happened.  I bought the book and took it home.  I read the book and cried.  I remembered Santa.  I remembered how to believe.<br /><br />It has been 5 years since I \\"discovered\\" this book again and I read is all the time now; in the summer and winter.  I share the magic of The Polar Express with all of my friends.  I even give sleigh bells to friends at Christmas who I think need a boost in their faith.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for all ages.
0743201140|4.0|&quot;Discover Your Strengths&quot; is an easy to read review of the work the Gallup Organization has done in studying and defining talent, the natural tendency to perform with excellence in certain situations.  The book does a great job of explaining the approach and methodology used to discover individual talents and how they become strengths (with knowledge and skill) and it does a good job of defining the 34 strengths they isolated after interviewing over 2 million people whose performance was identified as excellent. <br />The authors want to offer companies the language and means to implement a management system that focuses on employee strengths instead of systems that focus, as most now do, on overcoming employee weaknesses. They also want individuals to spend more time developing their talents into strengths and to look at weaknesses as something to manage but not obsess over (great chapter on just how to do that).<br />You're given a registration code so you can take the strengths index online yourself (only one person per code).  Once you're told what your strengths are, don't expect to find out which careers you may best be suited for.  The authors admit that it is not their intent to offer career guidance to individuals, but you'll still gain some interesting insights about yourself.
0380820846|2.0|Not her best at all!!  I even re-read her 3 other Bridgerton books to prepare myself for this new one, and after laughing and crying through the other 3, I had to force myself to finish this one.  Colin was a one dimentional character who never really fell in love, and was always whining about something.  I'm not appreciated!  I'm not good enough!!  Everybody loves me but doesn't know me!  Shut up!!  And Penelope!  I thought she was one tough cookie, but everytime Colin kissed her, she's be this empty headed little girl who forgave him for everything!  I would give it one star, but I'm not that heartless.
B00004TVV1|5.0|Don't miss it,this two CD set is one of the most indispensable purchase you have to do.There is some of the most talented,incredible,outstanding music here.This is the first real encounter between these two absolute giants,Louis and Duke,and also the last one,and jazz listeners had to wait until 1961 to hear this.Even if they met frequently since the thirties,they never really recorded together,and this time will be the last one (except for the soundtrack of the movie,\\"Paris blues\\").Before,they recorded a couple  of tunes together (\\"Snafu\\"),but this is the ONLY album commited by these kings.Ellington was in a very rich period for five or six years (in fact,since Sam Woodyard took the drums chair;Sam's coming into Duke's band gave to this very somptuous orchestra the little something it needed).At the same time,Armstrong's career,after he recorded some inestimable albums in the fifties (\\"Satch plays Fats\\",\\"plays W.C.Handy\\",\\"the Good Book\\",\\"a musical autobiography\\",\\"Porgy and Bess\\"),Satch's career was going down slow,allways playing the same repertoire,and losing some of his greatest musicians.In fact,I think this is Louis Armstrong's testament,his last great record.No,this is not a great record;it's a terrific,outstanding,amazing moment of music,some of the greatest he ever blowed.My father owned this album,and I'm used to listen to it for more than 25 years.<BR>The challenge was to make Duke Ellington meet Armstrong's band (Barcelonna,Kyle,Shaw,Young and Bigard,who spend many years in Duke's band,a long time before).The result is majestuous.Armstrong has allways been addicted to Duke's music,even if he rarely played his songs;and Duke has a rare opportunity to shine as a piano player (and he surely could !!!).<BR>The first CD is made of master takes;it is almost impossible to make a choice between these 17 tunes.Louis' imperial talent shines from the first second to the last one.He plays with supreme majesty all through these tunes,and his voice may be at its highest level.\\"I got it bad\\" is an indescriptible masterpiece;Louis plays some very simple phrases,and sings like nobody did;Duke's piano counterpoints are the essence of piano playing.\\"Azalea\\" simply is one of the most magnificent tunes ever recorded,but we'll talk about it later.\\"I'm just a lucky so and so\\" has some down home blues playing by Duke,and an infectious vocal part by Satch.Etc,etc.Each and every tune is at the same highest level.17 tunes,17 masterpieces;two LPs,or one CD,one of the ten records you HAVE to own.My only regret is that Duke couldn't go to the studio with is drummer,Sam Woodyard,who simply was one of the greatest drummers in the history of jazz.<BR>The second CD includes tracks recorded during the rehearseals.And this is very interesting.It's terrific to hear how these guys could play a tune together.But the most interesting tune here is \\"Azalea\\".Just as Monk's unbelievable work on \\"'round midnight\\",issued on the CD version of \\"Thelonious himself\\":a study in progress.Duke wrote this piece in the late fourties,recorded it twice,and was never pleased with the result,because he wrote it with Armstrong in mind;now was the opportunity to have Louis playing this incredibly beautiful tune,and singing these improbable verses.And after a couple of false starts,and some vocal troubles,Louis manages to make this tune his own,and gave an immortal masterpiece.I mean,this is not a good tune,or a great one;this is one of the greatest masterpieces I ever heard in jazz.The version opf \\"black and tan fantasy\\" is magnificent,too,and here,Louis was confronted to Bubber Miley's version,recorded more than thirty years before,and which will never be surpassed.But Louis makes this tune his own,one more time,he doesn't use a plunger like Bubber did,and gives us a new conception of the tune.And what a majestic one !!!<BR>This (or these,because they originally were issued on two separate Lps) record is an absolute must in every jazz lover's discotheque.It's one of the records I listen to very often (and I have some 6000 records at home);something unreal,some magical minutes in the musical career of two of the greatest kings of jazz,Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie replaced Fight Club as my favorite movie.  Stunning visuals and very appropriate visual effects aside, the story itself should be enough to touch anyone.  Whether you concentrate on the story of Amelié herself or the stories of the cast of characters around her, you'll be touched by the sincerity of everyone involved.  <br />This movie is highly reccomended for anyone who doesn't feel the need to watch movies that only disturb and frustrate the viewer.

I have concluded that all information used in this book is second-hand information, most of them is propaganda. My great uncle was in the Japanese Army. He told me several times not tobelieve in this kind of nonsense. It is impossible to kill so many people in such a short period. Especially with soldiers who were not equipped with machine guns or other weapons for mass-destruction. Just take a minute and think. According to my uncle, it took almost 3 days to burn 6 corpses of his comrades after an attack. How long will it take to burn 300.000 corpses? If you think pictures don't lie...
6304077939|5.0|This is a rare and brilliant film. It is told through the eyes of Leo Lauzon, a young adolescent boy living in Montreal. His life and that of his family are so squalid and disconcerting that Leo lives inside his colorful head by means of a vivid imagination. He creates fantastical stories because the alternative can not be true. <BR>It is both a Drama and a Comedy, and the two go together seamlessly. It will have people laughing and feeling sad at the same time. Unlike other black comedies this one stays honest and completely believable. The film has a message that isn't simply shock, and everything is presented in it's natural duality. Everthing has it's cause and effect, and these are displayed unflinchingly. This movie goes full circle in a way that few can muster, highly recommended.
B00005JLDW|3.0|Here's a movie with great special effects and beautifully moody cinematography; some intentionally funny lines delivered by the little boy in the opening sequence. Then comes the future in a wonderfully well-constructed montage illustrating the worldwide destruction caused by the unleashing of legions of enormous fire-breathing dragons who feed on ashes. Yup. Okay.<br />The future bears so many similarities to the Road Warrier series that one can't help but take note of them: the faces of a collective of children, the good-hearted leader of this community of survivors (Christian Bale, acting his heart out as a Cockney--for reasons known only to the director. It's an odd affectation, given that his mother--who gets knocked off right at the beginning--has a middle to upper class accent.) So Christian is trying to keep his flock safe in the oddly low-tech/high-tech castle (with lots of water handy) when some of his rebellious associates decide to sneak out and reap their crops before they've reached maturity. And, kaboom, here come those flame-throwing dragons! <br />A few heartbeats later a convoy arrives bringing the American factor to the castle in the form of a completely unrecognizable Matthew McConaughey, whose performance is notable primarily for his heavy breathing, his grunting and his delivery of lines that are so silly it's a wonder he could keep a straight face. (I'd pay to see the outtakes.) I kept expecting him to declare, \\"I love the smell of dragon's breath in the morning!\\"--given that he was basically playing the Robert Duvall role from Apocalypse Now.<br />From the point of Matthew's arrival, the movie gets so camp, so riddled with cliched and predictable dialogue that the only thing to do is start laughing. And if you go in expecting to be amused, you won't be disappointed because the screenplay is just so absolutely silly it's not possible to take it seriously (unless you're very very young and haven't seen a whole lot of movies.) That doesn't meanthis is bad; it just means that the film borrows so much from so many other movies that it offers almost nothing in terms of originality. In some of the scenes the dragons look like nothing so much as flying rats with wings and such serious cases of heartburn that they keep burping fire.<br />Definitely not the worst movie ever made, but certainly one that takes itself so seriously that it winds up being one of the funniest features I've seen in ages. Go prepared to laugh and to anticipate the dialogue; you can say it along with the actors.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is an engaging and disturbing novel about death, life and after death.  This book upset me and comforted me at the same time.  I was so engrossed I could not put the book down and missed a great deal of sleep so that I could finish it.  Susie Salmon is a fourteen year old girl murdered one night on the way home from school.  The book is written from her point of view as she looks down upon earth and her family from heaven.  Susie turns out to be smarter and more perceptive than she thinks she is and she tells a story of loss, love and redemption in a way that connected me to the book and the characters.  I highly recommend this fast paced read for anyone looking for a good book they can't put down.
0060934913|2.0|While Anthony Burdain's Kitchen Confidential does offer a few helpful hints into \\"the culinary underbelly\\" it would certainly be more appropriately titled, \\"What happens to cocaine-addicted chefs\\".  The novel dwells on the author's tainted past and its influence on his struggle (and I mean struggle) into culinary mediocrity.<br />Perhaps the editor of this novel was ALSO strung out on crack when he read over the manuscript.  After explicitly telling the reader how to use squeeze bottles and metal rings to jazz up ordinary cuisine, Bourdain then goes on to compain about and rip apart chefs who use these techniques.  <br />Aside from being almost entirely contradictory, the diction of this novel is lacking.  Bourdain often repeats the same phrases over and over in different chapters as though it is brand new and fresh (Bourdain also uses the term 'moribund' about five hundred times).  He then uses culinary jargon with the expectation that EVERYONE should know these terms by heart.<br />Bourdain's introduction of new characters is incredibly poor (half way through he vaguely mentions the presence of a girlfriend, then a few chapters later a wife, FINALLY referring to her as \\"Nancy\\" on page 183).<br />Needless to say, Anthony Bourdain should NOT quit his day-job to pursue life as a novelist, but SHOULD, in fact, quit his day-job for the sake of poor 'foodies' who may cross his path in the future.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the second of only two DVD's I have ever bought without really knowing anything about the film.  I have no idea how I ran across it on Amazon, but I decided to park on it for a while and read the reviews.  Each one promised 5 stars or 4 very stong stars in imagination, cinematography, plot, and character development.  I ran out and bought the disc as soon as I saw it appear on the shelves (it happened to be on sale), brought it home yesterday and watched it this morning.  I was thoroughly impressed and entertained!  This is a romantic comedy like no other I have ever seen.  The French certainly have a refreshing sense of humor.  There are a few objectionable scenes (they were fun), but this is really a PG film, all things considered.  You can gather plenty of information about Amelie by reading other reviews so I will not waste your time with it.  I will say that you will not be disappointed at all.  If you liked The Cutting Edge, Six Days [and] Seven Nights, Sleepless in Seattle, or other such films, then this one is sure to paste a huge smile on your face and hold it there for two straight hours.  Buy Amelie on DVD and be prepared to watch it again and again and again, while renewing a child-like belief that dreams really can come true.
6305169187|4.0|Hey, I can't give this more than three stars.  The plot is predictable, laughable, and implausible.  Except for Billy Bob Thornton, the acting is negligible.  It's about 30 minutes too long, for a piece of fluff.<br />But I found it rather fun to watch.  There was some way out humor.  I enjoyed the repetition of the main song, Diane Warren's &quot;I Don't Want To Miss A Thing&quot;.  And I like the &quot;Leaving On A Jet Plane&quot; sequence.  <br />I guess that what it is, well you can watch it with absolute no mental effort at all.  It's rather loud, but you can adjust to that.<br />What can I say.  It's not really a good picture.  You're liable to think you wasted a good 150 minutes of your life on this.  But it does move, and it did have some sort of a hypnotic effect.  So if you don't expect anything deep or even sensible, and enjoy just drifting along with this, you just might like it.  But don't say that I recommended it, because I might get sued!
0609610570|3.0|This book could have been summarized in one chapter or less.  Develop a strategy, translate to concrete action, engage people to execute the actions and follow up with them to see if they have done what you agreed to with them.  Sounds simple and vague ?  Indeed, in the end the book however does not get much more specific than that most of the time.  The failures of some large businesses in complex market places, get boiled down to almost naive statements about a disconnect between the grand plan and the execution in the field.<BR>The book has merit in the fact that it draws attention onto the mundane tasks of execution, as opposed to dealing with the too much talked about topic of strategy.  That in and of itself is good in that it makes you pause and think.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love Avril Levigne! I like her style of music because its not so Pop unlike Britney Spears (which I totally despise her) And unlike Britney, Avril actually has talent! I love her song S8er Boi, It teaches a really valuble lesson in life on how not to judge a book by its cover. I also like Avril because her music is a mix of pop which is ok and punk which is good. I also recommend to those of u who like this album Jennifer Paige, Michelle Branch, and Vanessa Carlton.
0441172717|5.0|The novel Dune is one of those works that you hear of by reputation as being a classic and which you always see in the bookstore but never seem to pick up to read. I had seen the David Lynch film when I was younger and was confused and bored by it. I borrowed a copy of the Dune tv mini-series recently, and after watching one episode I found the story intriguing but the special effects lacking. So I decided to read the book in order to experience a better effects company, my imagination. <br />To me, one of the things that makes Dune unique is its glimpse of what the future holds for the human race. It isnt a future controlled by machines and dominated by technology as so many science fiction worlds are. The universe that Frank Herbert creates here is a humanistic one, almost a mideval renaissance world. Going along with that thought, this universe is filled with court intrigue. The known universe is loosely ruled by an emperor named Padashan IV who keeps his rule going with the threat of his imperial guard, elite fighting units called Sardaukar. He also keeps his noblemen in suspicion of each other and sometimes helps bring about actual wars between them if it suits his purpose. <br />As the book opens, one of his most respected noblemen, Duke Atreides, is sent to the desert planet of Arrakis (Dune) to take over spice production. Spice is the most important product in the universe and whoever controls it, controls power, and brings danger on themselves. One of the sources of conflict is that the Atreides have replaced the House Harkonnen, their bitter enemies, on Arrakis, so the whole place smells like a trap waiting to spring. The Harkonnens have sworn eternal war, called \\"kanly\\" with the Atreides and it is only a question of when and how they will strike. In addition to this, there are mysterious native inhabitants on Dune, known as Fremen, whose allegience is unknown, and the Duke also has to deal with giant sandworms who can swallow ships whole. <br />The main character of the book is Paul Atreides, son of the duke, a fifteen year old boy trained by the best fighters in the galaxy and also learned in the ways of his Bene Gesserit mother. The Bene Gesserits remind me of the Jedi in Star Wars. They are trained psychics who have strange powers feared and respected among the general populace, such as future vision, and can sometimes control weak minds and sorta steer the galaxy. Some say that Paul is destined for some terrible purpose that will lead the human race to a new destiny.<br />This is a great book. Like the Lord of the Rings, you can tell that Herbert not only wrote this book, but in the process developed and shaped his world with legends and past histories that are only hinted at in this work. There is lots of action and adventure and also religious questions and philsophy, almost a little for every kind of ruler. It does have its dull moments, especially after Paul meets his destiny, but you have to expect that anytime you have a work that is an \\"epic\\". There's so much information that not all of it can be interesting. There is a large cast of characters, so I would maybe suggest watching the first episode of the tv series like I did because it gives you a visual reference for most of the main characters. I'm going to start the next book, Dune Messiah, today.
B000068G9X|5.0|This has got to be one of the best albums of all time. Weather you are into punk, heavy metal or gothic... you needed it and will love it. This is by far the best album Danzig has put out to date. As sexy as Jim Morison, as evil as Black Sabbath and as smooth as Elvis, Danzig is as bad ... as you want it to be. If you don't like it you should buy it anyway, because all of your cooler friends will!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Here is another good film from George Lucas to help everyone figure out the Star Wars saga!  I saw it in the theater and then purchased it once it became available to the public.  <br />The typical story, evil trying to take over the world, good triumphs over evil, etc.  But who can resist look at and listening to Liam Neeson??!!!! :o)  Of course, it doesn't beat the original Star Wars film nor the rest of the trilogy but it is a good movie, enjoyable, entertaining and the special effects are awesome!  <br />I'm sure most everyone has seen the movie, and if you own the Star Wars trilogy set then you'll need to add this one to your collection!
0767849493|5.0|Thirty-something divorcee Bethany Sloane of Illinois has the unlikeliest mission thrust upon her by Metatron, an angel representing the voice of God.  Basically, she has to go to a church in New Jersey and \\"stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all existence.\\"<br />Accompanying her are two droids, a Wookiee... oops! sorry, wrong story.  Accompanying her are two prophets with the unlikely names of Jay and Silent Bob, (or is that C-JayPO and R2-SB?) Rufus, the New Testament's unnamed 13th apostle, and the muse Serendipity.  Actually, Jay does refer to himself and Bob as Han Solo and Chewie, and Bethany as Ben Kenobi.<br />The aforementioned angels are Bartleby and Loki, who discovering a loophole in Cardinal Glick's campaign to revamp Catholicism via a plenary indulgence, discover they can end their exile in Wisconsin--worse than Hell--and go back to Heaven.  Come on, Wisconsin can't be as bad as New Mexico!<br />However, Azrael the fallen angel and his helpers, a trio of evil-looking rollerblading, hockey stick-wielding imps referred to as either the triplets or by Jay under a funnier name, are out to stop Bethany.  There's a very funny scene in the movie which gives a new meaning to the phrase, \\"--it happens.\\"<br />Rufus says it best when instead of beliefs, \\"...it's better to have ideas.  You can change an idea.  Changing a belief is trickier.\\"  Trickier and more downright tragic, too.  We have the Balkans, Northern Ireland, and the Middle East as testimony for that.<br />Bethany's abortion clinic campadre Liz has a very sound line on faith: \\"...faith is like a glass of water. When you're young, the glass is small, and it's easy to fill up. But the older you get, the bigger the glass gets, and the same amount of liquid doesn't fill it anymore. Periodically, the glass has to be refilled.\\"<br />There are shades of Star Wars, but that's hardly surprising, considering how that's one of the cornerstones of Kevin Smith's formative pop culture foundation.  Another theme borrowed is that from M, where both police and underworld are hunting for the serial killer.<br />All the key performers work wonders here, with guest appearances from other View Askew alumni, such as Jeff Anderson, Brian O'Halloran, Jason Lee, Dwight Ewell and Scott Mosier, as well as stars such as George Carlin and Janeane Garofalo, added for extra flavor.  O'Halloran's character is Grant Hicks.  Hmm, did Dante have a twin brother?  Kevin Smith's masterful dialogue is at Clerks-level hilarity.<br />In closing, Dogma's purpose is not to trash organized religion, especially Christianity, but serves as an introspective look at how much of religion is taken for granted or blindly accepted.  Using brash humor can sometimes be the only calling card to get the people to look deep inside themselves and test and question their own spiritual conceptions or beliefs, and in that, Dogma is a triumph.  Rufus is right--it's better to have an idea rather than a belief.  Dogma's irreverence far exceeds that of two other religious comedies, Monty Python's Life Of Brian and the shallower but still funny Wholly Moses..

0425170349|4.0|Rainbow Six was one of the best books I have ever read. It had action, suspense, drama, and a lot more. I loved the novel and would recommend it to anyone.

0805062971|1.0|Chances are you already know the story. Ole Jack is down in the dumps because his job and life suck and he has to go to support groups for catharsis. Then he meets a fine fellow named Tyler Durden, and they become best friends by beating each other up. Then they start a fight club so other men can come and be cool just like them. If that was the extent of it, I may have actually sort of liked the book. It's kind of a clever idea. Unfortunately, that is where Palahniuk's witticism, humour, cleverness and originality end. For good. There have been genuinely insightful books that study the human inclination to violence. Octave Mirbeau's The Torture Garden is such a book. Fight Club is not such a book.<br />We have a few singularly distasteful scenes involving the manufacture of soap, the cinema, and the fighting in the fight club itself. These may seem gratuitous, but they actually served an important purpose - the purpose of establishing, once and for all, how vile the characters of this book truly are. Not that that is advertant - Palahniuk seems to think you should like them. His Tyler is generally presented as being likeable. After all, he revolted against his role, became \\"nonconformist,\\" and started ranting about materialism and philosophy. He also likes to talk about freeing oneself from society (by fighting in fight clubs). He does that last bit a lot, because Palahniuk thinks it is deep. By the time he starts attracting legions of followers who beat each other up for him, the message is clear - we are supposed to think very highly of him, because he isn't the way society wants him to be and is \\"unique.\\" Even when he has these followers go kill people and commit sundry acts of terrorism.<br />Inexplicably, the irony is lost on most people. Do fans of this book realize that Tyler's \\"philosophy\\" does not free anyone, or make anyone stronger, in the entire book? It turns men into blackshirts and stormtroopers - faceless cultists who are even denied names. It destroys their dignity more than society ever did. But Palahniuk has an intellectual rationalization to explain this away! According to him, this is _the way all men are_ deep down inside, and thus, Tyler is really cool and admirable! Well...gosh. Hey, Chuck, if it's good for men to be faceless drones with no will of their own, why rebel in the first place against this horribly oppressive society of yours?<br />Now, you could say that the book doesn't advocate Tyler's manipulative, narcissistic, destructive worldview. I deny this claim. There is no one in the book who doesn't relish it, even though Jack does stop its spread in the end (in the truly awful ending - more on that in a bit). There is nothing in the book to counteract it. There are no opposing ideas presented. You can come up with a complex thought process that concludes that this is really only an argument _against_ violence, but this conclusion will be based upon nothing that is in, you know, the actual _book_. Because let's make no bones about it - we are meant to like Tyler. I've seen keychains that quote him. All the fans of this book quote Tyler. He's meant to be quoted. He's presented as witty and charming and intelligent and strong and unique, and his megalomaniacal escapades are as well. We are meant to admire him. We even have a particularly contrived and false scene in which Jack forces a man - at gunpoint - to \\"go and follow his dreams,\\" to reinforce the message - that Tyler is good, society is bad. And the particularly ludicrous ending does nothing to dispel this. You see, thinking that it wasn't enough to write such a fine book already, Palahniuk decided to jump on the \\"hey, that reality was merely an illusion! THIS is the real reality! it's different!\\" bandwagon. The result is as gimmicky as you'd think, and more importantly - it serves to \\"reinforce\\" this poisonous hogwash about how all males are really just like Tyler (a conclusion based on the author's thorough study of psychology, no doubt).Everything in this book comes back to the coolness of Tyler - a bully who read the Cliff Notes to Nietzsche and uses them to manipulate people who want someone to tell them that their utter failure in life is not their fault so badly that they're willing to die for it. For that's what Tyler is - Palahniuk's poetization of the talentless, worthless, yet very malicious failure. Read the scene in the cinema and you should see just how shallow and worthless Tyler's \\"rebellion\\" really is. (Ah, picking on families with children because they represent your hated society, Tyler, what a brave rebel you are.) Again, I must reiterate that this, according to Palahniuk, is something we're supposed to admire.<br />I've seen a lot of intelligent, thoughtful and kind human beings talk about this book as if it were some kind of stunning intellectual achievement. This baffles me beyond belief. I would have thought that women would be the first to see through the wall of testosterone that clouds the mediocre vileness of this book, but apparently the opposite is the case. Have our standards gone so low that anyone can come along, bang out an utter hack that says \\"society is bad!\\" in the crassest way possible, and be recognized as some kind of profound thinker?
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Of course, nothing beats a great Disney movie classic!!  You can't go wrong in purchasing this classic as a DVD for your collection!  It's good versus evil and we all know that good prevails over evil.  On this DVD version, however, there are some facts, features, etc., that you do not get with the original VHS movie plus there is a great game that kids will enjoy playing.  My daughter loves the movie & enjoys the game!!<br />Nothing can really discribe this movie other than it is a classic!
0792148061|5.0|I went to see the 20th anniversary of Grease when it hit the theatres.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, love at first sight!  OK, confession time:  it was also the first time I'd seen it.  Yes, a Gen-X'er like me not seeing Grease is like a Gen-Y'er not seeing American Pie.  However, blame my parents for banning much popular culture during my formative years.<br />The opening scenes of Danny and Sandy carousing and clowning around on the beach ends appropriately, when Danny tells Sandy, \\"Of course not, it's only the beginning,\\" and then come those crazy animated credits and Frankie Valli singing the immortal title track.<br />There's Danny Zucco and the T-Birds, his inseparable best friend Kenickie, and the \\"three stooges,\\" Sonny, Doody, and Putzie.  Sandy is befriended by Frenchie, whose compatriots, the Pink Ladies, are Marty, Jan, and the sarcastic Rizzo.  Basically, we see this story from their point of view.  After all, they are the more interesting characters and make no effort to conform, remaining in their clique groups.<br />It's more than just Danny and Sandy finding each other's true selves at school, but that of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies, who discover that things aren't always cut in black and white, but have a way of working out in the end.  All the actors make their characters come alive, love or not love them so much.  And everyone has a favorite few characters that they grow up liking with each viewing.  Mine are Danny, Sandy, Coach Calhoun, and Frenchie.<br />What are the highlights and familiar scenes at high school?  Bonfire night, going to Lover's Lane, hanging out at the diner, the big dance, the drive-in, graduation carnival, it's all here, a 1950's time capsule that was made in 1978.

0312265859|3.0|First, let me say I expected to LOVE this book.<br />I accidentally stumbled upon Seven Up a few weeks ago in the grocery store, while looking for something to read to while away a summer afternoon.  It was so awesome I read the whole thing in less than a day and went out and bought all seven other books in the series.  Loved all of them but Hard Eight.  It was decent, but didn't hold a candle to the other books.  The attorney wasn't as funny or personable as Grandma and Lulu and, frankly, I hope he does marry Valerie and they move to Alaska and out of the series.  Also, like many of the other women readers of Evanovich's series, I'd been waiting for Steph and Ranger to get together.  I don't need graphic sexual details, but the sex scene should at least be more than the basic \\"yeah, they did it at her apartment.\\"  I mean, the least he could have done was take her to the bat cave with a blindfold, or Rio, or ANYWHERE but Stephanie's apartment.  Grandma Mazur did better with Eddie DeChooch and he couldn't get it up!<br />Knowing what I know, I don't regret buying the book, but it makes me less inclined to plunk down enough of my hard earned cash to buy Nine in hardback form.  I'm hoping things will get a little more exciting in the Burg in the upcoming books of this series.
B000068PNQ|5.0|So much has been said and written about this album since its release in March 1967, that a review of the material is irrelevant, and commentary pointless. Inarguably, it is one of the most influential LPs of all time. So let's look instead at what this *release* of \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\" IS.<br />Over the years, the Velvet Underground catalog has begun to get the overhaul it has always deserved, and this Deluxe Edition set is another example of that. If the \\"Peel Slowly And See\\" Box Set and the \\"Fully Loaded Edition\\" of \\"Loaded\\" appeal to you, you'll find this indispensable.<br />Why both the mono *and* stereo versions of the LP? Differences in the mixes, my friends. Some subtle, some more immediately evident. The casual listener might not spot the differences immediately, but track to track comparisons between the two will be instructive to the faithful. The mono version has been deemed collectable enough to be bootlegged in the past, so it is fitting that it be legitimately released for the completist collectors among us. For what it's worth,I found the mono versions of the singles excessive, as the stereo versions are to be found on the \\"Peel Slowly And See...\\" box set, HOWEVER, the tracks from Nico's \\"Chelsea Girl\\" were penned by Velvets Cale, Morrison & Reed, who also perform on these tracks. As such, they deserve to be included in the band's output *somewhere*, and as they chronologically follow the 1st LP, it makes sense that they be included here--they're certainly as strong musical numbers as anything else on these CDs.<br />If you're a Velvet Underground fan (as I've been for well over two decades), you've already bought this CD, perhaps, like me, several times, between the initial release, the remaster, the box set, the 24K Gold Edition. If you have that level of dedication, TRUST ME, you won't feel cheated when you get this baby home, BUT it's not ONLY for completists--more casual fans will find, I'd predict, that they'll have a greater appreciation for this LP, and the ones that follow it because of the breadth of this CD, the liner notes, and lyrics--it truly is \\"The Deluxe Edition.\\"iation for this LP, and the ones that follow it because of the breadth of this CD, the liner notes, and lyrics--it truly is \\"The Deluxe Edition.\\"

B000065U1N|3.0|I've found that after seeing &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; that I have been dissensitized to all violence.  Therefore I found nothing surprising about this movie.  However, it is still very good with some nice sequences, but it's still not as good as even &quot;We Were Soldiers.&quot;  It's a very dusty movie, and the  dirt never completely clears out.
B0000640VO|5.0|the special features on the DVD come near to doing the film justice---It's a brilliant, wonderful film, especially for those with an eye for aesthetics.  Do not let the American marketers ruin this film for you.  It is not a &quot;chick-flick&quot; or a sappy romantic comedy.  It is wonderful on many levels; smart enough to be brilliant without being depressing.  This is, in many ways, the &quot;feel good movie of the year&quot;, but it is such without being flighty or dumbing.  I can watch it over and over, and besides the film, there are the wonderful and rich special features--not just outtakes or bloopers.  They can tell you how they made this movie and you will still be amazed.
B000068QY7|4.0|. . as if we wouldn't figure it out.<br />At this late date they decided to stop using the Klaatu moniker and go straight for a new secret name.  &quot;Oasis&quot; yeah right.  Oasis is just an anagram for aso-si, the Morrocan word for 'beetle' ~ the kind of beetles that inhabit oasis's.<br />McCartney for one seems in top form here on many of the tracks, but lacking (noticeably) is production prowess in the form of George Martin. McCartney's production style meanders a bit, mostly taking cues from tracks we've heard before on &quot;McCartney&quot; or &quot;Ram&quot; or even &quot;Red Rose Speedway.&quot;<br />While the liner notes from this album are elusive and sketchy, the sound has very much a Geoff Emmerick-y ring to it.  One or two songs would not be out of place on a Pink Floyd album.<br />There is a great work from Harrison here in the form of his best guitar solos ever, with neat new sounds (new for 1973 that is). Plus Lennon and Starr offer so much in the way of atmosphere and energy this time around.<br />I'm so glad the Beatles stayed together for this Heathen Chemistry album. If only they hadn't kept it secret for all these years. One thing for sure, I hope they have more of these locked away in vaults.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The previews of this movie are very misleading. It is in fact a terrific film about early psychology. I can't say to much or I would give away the movie, but not only is it a great film about Psychology, it also shows how innovative Nash's theory has been. An incredible film from an amazing director with the ultimate cast.
0375703764|4.0|I'm not sure exactly how I feel about &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.  It's a leviathan, that's for sure.  You truly have to tackle this thing and never look back.  And when you're done, you'll feel exhausted.  Maybe a little disappointed.  I don't know.  On one hand, I'm really impressed by Danielewski's (frightening) imagination.  Few people could think up a project (it seems like more than a book) like this.  The design is very impressive, if at times overwhelming.  And I definitely stayed glued to the page.  Yet I stopped just short of being completely drawn in.  &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is pretty in love with itself, and the overall effect, for me, was one of pretension.  That leaves me a bit cold.  Still, this thing is quite an experience and I'd recommend giving it a try.  You'll never come across anything like it again.
0375707972|4.0|The Reader is a wonderful attest to the fact that love is not perfect and workable at all times. It tells of a story that is not too removed from experiences in many lives--Michael Berg develops an infatuation, a perplexing curiosity to someone that is socially deemed unavailable to him. Through his relationship, not only does he grow emotionally and sexually, but intuitively and mentally as well.  Besides sharing a sexual relationship with Hanna, he is nurtured and encouraged to excel--a hope that Hanna did not get to fulfill in her own life.<br />The book speaks to the human emotion, for although the story tells of an clandestime, socially unacceptable relationship, it proves that there are bonds and strong feelings that can link us to those outside of our own age group.
B000066NW0|5.0|I thought that Avril's CD is great. I like that it's a little bit of pop and a little bit of rock too. She has a great voice. I like most of the songs on the cd. Complicated and Losing Grip were probably my favorites. I like that she sings songs that you can actually relate to.

B00005A1PR|5.0|&quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; is one of my all-time favorite CDs, and I have over two hundred in my collection.  It's hardly left my CD player since I bought it.  India.Arie has an incredible amount of talent; she is a lovely singer, and has a steady touch on the guitar.  Her lyrics are refreshingly honest and introspective; there is nothing of the vapid music dominating radio stations on this album.  Every song is solid, with great hooks and lovely melodies.  I enjoy singing along to every one (how often can you say that?).  I listen to &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; during any mood: when I'm feeling thoughtful, it's a quiet accompaniment; when I'm angry or stressed, it's calming; during happy times, it bounces along cheerily with me.  I really can't say enough good things about this album.  India.Arie is a great addition to the music community; I look forward to her next offering.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I LOVE India Arie's CD!  I listen to it EVERYDAY!  She is truly a talented artist.
0345360338|4.0|The reason I gave FALLS THE SHADOW four stars was only because it didn't meet with my fictionous ideals carefully balanced with history as in HERE BE DRAGONS. There's no reason to skip this one, though. It's still very good. I'm not big on the long descriptions of the battles, and would rather have more of the romance found in HERE BE DRAGONS. The 'couple', the next Joanna & Llewelyn Fawr are the unlikely match Simon deMontfort -a Frenchman come to England to claim a lost earldom- and Nell, widow, and the King (Henry)'s sister.<br />One has to keep in mind that is less of a Wales story than HERE BE DRAGONS. Of course, the blood fued goes on betwixt Gruffydd ap Llewelyn and Davydd ap Llewelyn, it dies with their (SPOILER) deaths. Then the story changes hands, focusing on \\"Lleo\\", Llewelyn ap Gruffydd and his ambition to be as great as a legend as his grandfather. This story, however, is Simon deMontfort. I did not care for him much at the beginning, but had grown kind of fond of him towards the end. I'm disappointed in the lack of Welsh involvement in the story, but it still makes for a good read.<br />It is gory. Some characters do die very violent deaths. Still, it's part of the trilogy, and next is THE RECKONING.
1402521154|5.0|At at time when child abduction and rape are in the headlines almost daily, I found this book strangely healing.  It was given to me by a friend who declared \\"Read the first page and I'll bet you can't stop ...\\" and she was correct.  Completely gripping!  I feel as if I'm reading someone's diary, obtaining valuable nuggets of information on human nature, as if I'm reading something I need to know to survive.  News reports of just such occurances leave one in the early throws of shock, terror and grieving.  Lovely Bones takes the reader beyond, to stronger mourning, then to the numb beginnings of healing.  It is difficult to imagine that the author has not lived a similar story to have such insight into the way a family recovers from these tragedies.  And through all this, there is suspenseful tension keeping the pages swiftly turning.  My only regret is that the book eventually had to end.
B00000I07P|5.0|I had to write about how it's been 15 years now and this is still one of the most played jovi albums,you can still hear &quot;You give love a bad name&quot; on the radio and it sounds just as great as it did back then,How many album's in rock can do that?
6305364648|5.0|This is my favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. This is one movie that's full of non stop action yet it has time for a little commedy. In the 90's when there were action movies galore this was what seperated the men from the boys.
B000050XEI|5.0|Clocking in at just under 40 minutes, it took me awhile to be able to rank this high amongst the rest of the Enya classics. Now I'm in love with it, and would even go as far as to say it is her best. Unlike other outings like, say, Sheperd Moons (which I also love but find a tad too long), every second on this masterpiece is pure magic and a delight to the ears. There are NO wasted, idle or less-beautiful moments here. I think \\"Lazy Days\\" is one of the best closing tracks of any I've ever heard. It leaves you in ecstasy, wanting more, but there is no more....which is exactly the feeling a monumental recording should give you.<BR>...Can't wait for the next recording, even if it is in 5 years....
1573228737|5.0|Sarah Waters is trully gifted. Affinity is written in the form of the heroine's diary. But it's far from what other authors have done in their novels, this one is trully unique. It is unique because because the characteristics of the times are written with realism and attention to detail, and the characters are depicted with well thought-of depth and wit. It is unique because the intensity of the emotions make your heart race like crazy. And finally, it would take one clever writer to come up with such unexpected twists. I finished this novel shocked, disturbed, and kept thinking about it for the rest of the day. It doesn't happen everyday that a story has such a powerful impact. I can't wait to start reading Tipping the Velvet.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|The WORST movie in the world! I wouldn`t know where to begin. . I really wanted to see it when it came to theaters, but waited until the dvd release. I was in shock at how badly it was made. It would be a waste of my time and yours to write the review it deserves. Just do not see it!

B00006690H|5.0|This cd is one heck of a good one. I think you should listen to it. There are two really great songs on here. One's called \\"Business\\" and one's called \\"Without Me\\". So what are you waiting for? Go to Wal-Mart and get it. It's one heck of a good CD!
B00003CXXO|5.0|Incredible! The genius' of Spielberg and Kubrick meld in one of the \\"weirdest\\" films I've ever seen! Even though the film is fascinating, I don't believe that this film represents the end of the world (I say this as a Christian), but it is a great addition to Spielberg's line of films. Touching, dark and grim! Do not miss this one! Grade: A+

0316777722|4.0|According to almost all of the other reviews, here and elsewhere, this entire book is screaming/rolling on the floor/laughing out loud funny.  I did NOT find this to be so, and it's not like I'm one of those people who never laughs out loud; I laugh all the time.  So, expecting to be disturbing friends and strangers by laughing in public places for no apparent reason, I was a little bit disappointed when ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY turned out to be much more subtle and profound than uproariously funny.  <br />I'm still not over that disappointment, but I found myself through the book in two short afternoon sittings, thoroughly enjoying the ride and a little [angry] when it ended so abruptly.  Sedaris writes about anything and everything with consistent humor -- something few writers can really pull off -- that had me more or less constantly smiling.  (And then occasionally a real laugh -- the kind that ends with gasping and tears in your eyes -- would escape me, most memorably during the three page \\"Big Boy.\\")  He's a little bit cynical and a little bit insecure and at the same time totally unapologetic, and the mix works very well.  Disappointments aside, I'd buy another of his books any day.  <br />(Side note to those who are looking for constant, crazy laughter of the kind descibed above: read anything -- ANYTHING -- by Bill Bryson.)
B0000669JL|5.0|When I put this cd in the player, the whole world stops. Suddenly, I am relaxed. I brake out a Red Stripe and chill on my front porch. It is the greatest reggae cd ever made! Don't even consider buying it ever more. Just order it right now! It is so good. My favorite tracks are BUFFALO SOLDIER and JAMMIN. STIR IT UP is also a hot track. Basically, this cd is the most famous Bob Marley songs put together into one cd. It is essentially the BOB MARLEY GREATEST HITS cd. If you love Bob or just love reggae this is a MUST HAVE.
076790382X|5.0|This book is great and a very quick read.  It is written in brief chapters - so you can stretch it out and get some laughs before you go to bed (or work).  It reminds me very much of seinfeld-like humor.  uncommon observations about common things.  ALL of bryson's works are funny, but this one is my favorite.
0440180295|5.0|I'm reviewing a second reading of this book.  Fifteen or so years have gone by since I first picked it up with unreal expectations and a teenager's misunderstanding of many of the key ideas Vonnegut attempts to set forth.  The first time I was amused and occasionally moved by the poignancy, drama and rather offbeat satirical insight of aspects of life I couldn't yet hope to have a grasp on.  Now, this time, after a day and a half of plowing through this remarkable (and remarkably easy to read) novel I feel as though I have been touched to the very core of my being . . .<br />Now of course this praise is a bit high-faulting, based more on my mood at the time of the undertaking, but it is a powerful and educational experience nonetheless.  A story of time and key moments lived in jump-cut fragments, Slaughterhouse Five relates the key memorable moments in a man's life, a man so harrowed and scarred by irrational realization and recognition of the horrors of the world he lives in that he literally becomes 'trapped in time'.<br />Not so much a 'science-fiction' novel as a study of mental degeneration, Vonnegut tells the story of Billy Pilgram, a man who witnessed the greatest massacre in the history of warfare and lived through it to become a productive, happy and successful member of American society.  But he is haunted by the past and his witness has allowed him to not just to expect the worst from the future, but to accept it, to allow these events to crash down upon him (plane crash killing all but him, death of a wife, the increasing indifference and resentment of his children as he grows older, et cetera, ad infinitum).  The statement of 'time' as a concept lived all in the same moment, of life existing spontaneously in elliptical cycles, past merging with future and the present never truly mattering relates how desolately unhinged this victim of circumstance has become.  I do not believe that Billy has truthfully become unglued and randomly travels through time, back and forth, throughout his life, but that his life simply stopped at the bombing of Dresden and the shattered reflections and memories of his overwhelming terror and moral approbriation have haunted him throughout his life, so much so that the rest of his existence is spent waiting to die; simmering, forever experiencing the past as his life forms and decontructs in the present tense.  The addition of an alien society actually take the place of God, a once loyal concept that ceased to hold meaning for him.  These aliens have simply given him a new gospel to preach, a new understanding to base his life upon and, whether real or imaginary (like any conceptual 'higher power') they have a profound affect on his life.<br />It is a deep, very personal look (Vonnegut repeatedly refers to himself throughout the novel, opening with a very significant autobiographical chapter that outlines his own ideas on witnessing the massacre) and even goes so far as to include a fictional recreation of himself shuddering right there in the slaughterhouse beside all these products of his imagination, imagination, it seems, saving his own life.  For all its simplicity, for all its good-natured and often dark comedy, there is no laughter in this book.  There are smiles, there might be the occasional titter, but the ultimate effect, for me at least, was one of aching, heart-rending movement, stirring even my own black heart of pitilessness into a genuinely humane feeling of honest human empathy.<br />And the best part is, reading over several of the other reviews, is that it seems to affect each reader in a dicisively different manner . . .back and forth, throughout his life, but that his life simply stopped at the bombing of Dresden and the shattered reflections and memories of his overwhelming terror and moral approbriation have haunted him throughout his life, so much so that the rest of his existence is spent waiting to die; simmering, forever experiencing the past as his life forms and decontructs in the present tense.

B00005JL3A|5.0|I'm a serious fan of horror flicks and have had a dread of zombies since a child forced to watch Day of the Dead with my dad lol. Problem is I havent seen any actually scary flicks until I walked in to see RE. In a dark theatre I sat with my entire body embroiled in shivers, the slightest sound behind me sent shockwaves of icy fear through me and it took over an hour after the movie for that fight or flight response to die down. You MUST own this movie it's one of those few rare gems you stumble into, and if you have a home theatre system OMG turn all the lights out close the shades and be really ready to tremble muhahahaha
B000001E3L|5.0|I'm a huge music fan and Van Morrison is one of my top five artists of all time.  I own almost 50 Van Morrison cds and over 1000 cds in all; and I think that a Night In San Francisco may be one of my three top 3 if not my top 1 cd of all time.  Van soars in this release.  His great voice was never better.  He displays his extrodinary versatility with a pallet of blues, rock, soul, jazz and several more genres. His performances of both blues standards of Lonley Avenue and I'll Take care of You, in particular blew me away.  His live performance of Vanlose Stairway dwarfs the studio version. I particularly like the the riffs that pay homage to such artists as James Brown, Sly Stone, and the incomparable Sam Cooke, among others.  The musicians are phenominal as well.  This cd is also graced with guest performances by such artists as John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Witherspoon, Junior Wells, James &quot;Blueboy&quot; Hunter, Georgie Fame, Brian Kennedy and Shana Morrison.  In addition Candy Dufler blows the hell out of the sax.  I purchased this cd the day it came out in 1994, I still listen to it all the time.  Its as fresh to me today as the day I bought it.  If you are a Van  Morrison fan you will love this cd.  If you are'nt and you listen to this cd you will become one.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Closely following the plot of the book, this is a truly wonderful children's movie.  I don't know of any adults who have disliked it, either.<br />Harry Potter is an abused child who suddenly finds he is heir to a wondrous fortune -- not necessarily in money, but in his invitation to escape his misery by attending the most famous magic school in the world: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Hogwarts is a great relief for Harry, who had no way out of his horrible predicament before.  He makes friends of adults and peers, learns the ethics of using his incredible talent, and even learns that among persons of magic he is quite famous and respected, even at the tender age of eleven.<br />Unfortunately, Harry also has enemies.  The fame and respect came at an enormous cost: the lives of his parents and the permanent scar on Harry's forehead.  He knows none of this until he is told about it by one of his new friends.<br />Enemies are lurking all around Harry.  There is Snape, the potions teacher who appears to be the living manifestation of nastiness.  There is Drake Malfoy: snob, rich kid, powerful and known wizard in his own right, and Harry's nemesis from their first meeting.  And there is He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named: Voldemort, the great evil wizard who killed Harry's parents, tried to kill baby Harry, and who was nearly destroyed by baby Harry in the process.  His reappearance in the wizarding world coincidentally coincides with Harry's matriculation at Hogwarts.  Voldemort is an invisible enemy who is always present.  He is terrifying, vindictive, and apparently single-minded in his efforts to destroy Harry completely.<br />Harry and his best friend Ron together with Hermione Granger, the smart girl who can research and answer most of the questions the less-studious boys present, make it their goal to prevent any harm to anyone by Voldemort and his minions, while dodging the immediate threat of Malfoy and his minions.  Their efforts result in a number of broken school rules, use of their newly-acquired magical abilities in creative ways, and of course a battle for the school title against Malfoy's dorm and a battle to the death against Voldemort.<br />Yes, there are bad guys who can do nasty magic.  Before the Christian Right gets bent out of shape about it, they should know that more important are the good guys who use that magical talent for only good things: to heal injuries, to right wrongs, to defend their friends.  Children are not meant to believe HP is a true story.  Because they are better able to suspend their disbelief, they are much more able than their rigid parents to enjoy the film for what it is.  It is a made-up story full of make-believe people with make-believe abilities.  Anyone afraid that kids will attempt to \\"try this at home\\" needs to get a grip on reality and permit imaginations to explore the limits, removal of those limits, and their consequences.  While Harry's magic gets him away from an abusive home, it thrusts him into a sometimes worse situation:  his safety and life are threatened.<br />Don't worry, kids: Nobody really gets hurt in the movies.  Sometimes they get really big ouchies, though.  And HP is full of suspense, excitement, thrills, and adventure.  Never fear!  The school nurse can painlessly cure anything from multiple broken bones to major head injuries in practically no time at all.<br />The movie hit most of the important parts and the story line was very cohesive.  In my opinion, the only thing missing is the development of Harry & Ron's friend Neville.  There is a little at the beginning of the Hogwarts segment about him and his pet frog, but the interplay that causes him to try to stop the three main heroes from going after the Sorcerer's Stone is sadly missing.  Thus, even those of us who know the book well are startled that Neville suddenly reappears toward the end of the movie.  Those who haven't read the book just don't get why Neville bothers to take it upon himself totry to stop Harry and his two best friends from their last effort to protect the Sorcerer's stone from the most evil wizard of all.<br />The actors chosen to play each of the parts were perfect.  Snape is truly wicked and makes a fabulous villan.  The Defense Against Dark Arts teacher, Quirrell, is deceptively silly and nice, and brutally evil.  Dumbledore is wonderfully wise and his eyes sparkle just as they should.  Hagrid is exactly the way he should be -- fun, protective, fascinating, kind, gruff, innocent yet knowledgeable about so many things.  I cried during Harry's performance before the Mirror of Frised.  (No, fellas, this is NOT a \\"chick flick.\\")<br />Errant viewers expect every scene and conversation from the book to be in the movie.  It can't be done, guys!  At least not unless the book could have been read aloud with passion in less than 2 hours.<br />I recommend this DVD for children over seven.  The suspense may be too much for them, and some of the scary characters may be too frightening for them.  Eights and over, including teenagers and adults, will find the movie spellbinding.to try to stop Harry and his two best friends from their last effort to protect the Sorcerer's stone from the most evil wizard of all.<br />The actors chosen to play each of the parts were perfect.

B000002LRX|5.0|While &quot;The Real Thing,&quot; Patton's first album with Faith No More, was excellent, &quot;Angel Dust,&quot; in my opinion, is the band's ultimate album.  Patton's voice is deeper and more developed on this album, more so than the previous album (and Mr. Bungle's first album).  The keyboards are still a prominent feature of this album (as opposed to later FNM releases), which is a plus.  Also, this is Jim Martin's last album with the band, which probably earns it some points (for those of you who are counting).<br />Ultimatly, however, my fondness of this album cannot be broken down into little factoids.  There is just something about it that tugs on the ol' heart strings.  Beyond that, I am a fairly big Mike Patton fan, and, were I to make a top ten list, this album would be one of the three, or perhaps even four instances where something that Mike Patton was involved with would appear.  Don't take my word for it, get a copy of the album, listen to it, and buy it.  Well worth the money.<br />For those who like recommendations, best songs include:  &quot;Land of Sunshine,&quot; &quot;RV,&quot; and &quot;Jizzlober.&quot;
B000066I6N|1.0|I'm a big fan of Robert Plant's music. He has surpassed the legend of Led Zepplin.  The music he created (except Walking Into Clarksdale) has been brilliant and I was excited when I saw the announcement for this CD.  He had been playing with a folk group.  <BR>My disappointment was instantaneous.  The rock mags are making this out to be a great CD.  It [stinks].  Listen to how many times he whines mama on the CD.  Give me a break.  An artist with this much talent needs to think about what brought him to the dance.<BR>I was forced to give this 1 star.

B00003CXI1|4.0|I enjoyed this movie IMMENSELY... i thought that in the alotted time they were able to capture the essence of the book...and go through as many plot twists as they could... so if i only had to rate the movie it would be 5 stars...<br />for the dvd... it's a joke... there is nothing particularly special about it... in an ordinary dvd... if you wanted to see the deleted scenes... NO PROBLEM... here it is like you're hacking into some secret computer...  i was fairly disappointed by the dvd's extra features
1573225517|5.0|I LOVED this book as I do all Nick Hornby's books.  The man knows how to paint a picture with his words...not only do you see inside the tainted heart of the main character but you also get to see why and how he became the man he is in the book.  You begin to feel for the character and with every turn of the page get more involved in his thoughts, feelings and actions (or lack of).  Nick Hornby writes as if you have known the character for years and are just starting to read his thoughts and feelings.  A must read for anyone who considers themselves a music/movie &quot;snob&quot;..the movie was great but the book by far outdoes itself!
B00005QCYC|4.0|The original of this trilogy is the pinnacle of entertainment, allowing viewers to live out their childhood fantasies in an amazingly realistic world of fantasy and suspense.  It delivers in every category, keeping you glued to your television as you await the next twist in its amazing storyline.<BR>     The second in the series is almost equaled to the first, again creating the tension and suspense you've grown to expect.  The effects are, once again, simply amazing, and they never fail to please the eye.  The only drawback to this go-round was the weak plot line that undeniably was the movie's downfall.  Straying too far from the amazing book (\\"The Lost World\\" by Michael Crichton), and culminating in a way that was surprising and disappointing.  This film has more humor and a lighter tone to it, focusing more on the character's relationships than it did on the issue at hand.<BR>     The whole reason this review fell short of five stars was the third and (hopefully) final chapter of the series.  Based on an original screenplay, not a new book, the story of this movie was weak and completely unbelievable.  Without Michael Crichton helming the writing process, the story was far too simple and failed to impress on any level.  It simply didn't fit.  The effects were amazing, as is expected from the great Stan Winston, but the dinosaurs still looked unreal, due to a supposed \\"evolution\\".  The action is tense but all-together too quick and painless, and the movie ended in the most horrible way possible.  Far too short, and full of unbelievable moments this movie falls short of being worth the time.<BR>     The trilogy is rounded out, and raised from the dead as a result of the final chapter, by the extra DVD included in this set.  It features the extras on each of the movies that somehow disappeared when they were originally released.  It gives another in depth look at how the movies came to be, and adds another level in the excitement and wonder that is Jurassic Park.<br />     Buy this set for the extra DVD, if that's your thing.  Otherwise, just buy the first two movies, and rent the third.  It's just not worth it.
B00005IC2H|4.0|i've just started to listen to ambient music and this is unlike anything else I've hard so far. I read some of the other reviews and it seems to be a CD that you either love or hate. Either way, if it can stir up such strong emotions, it's worth listening to at least once. <br />It's moody stuff. Ethereal voices pour from a dense, dark mix like spring water out of deep rock layers, or angels singing in a mine. It's good for meditation. I found parts of it rather monotonous, but when meditating, this isn't necessarily a drawback. I like it.
B00005QB9A|5.0|Imagine a ship full of immigrants at the turn of the 20th century sailing through a fog, when suddenly one man looks up and begins shouting ecstatically when he sees the Statue of Liberty emerge from the mist...  This sets the stage for what turns out to be a story of a musical genius who lives his entire life onboard a tran-atlantic oceanliner.<br />There are scenes that I will never forget in this film.  A piano duel with the father of Jazz, a spontaneous composition when the hero sees a beautiful woman through a porthole, and many more.<br />This is beautiful cinematography, excellent stroytelling, and incredible musical scoring.<br />This is one you will watch over and over again!
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is hands down the most brilliant movie I have ever seen.  It will leave many people saying \\"huh\\"?, but it is not a hard movie.  If you force it you will not get where Lynch is going with it.  Simply put, it gives one answer to \\"Who set this all up?\\"  You can lead a horse to water, but you can not make him drink.  In fact, if you do see the water I don't recommend drinking it all at once ...
B0000640VO|1.0|There are a number of reasons for using the DVD format... They allow for all types of features to suit all types of viewers...<br />One Feature that is a MUST for foreign language films is to have a language track for the intended audience... This DVD lacks that basic feature and made initial viewing less than enjoyable... I guess, once I learn French or am able to retain the written dialog for the entire movie, I will enjoy the movie upon further viewing...<br />The makers of \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" Did their DVD the right way and I recommend that all makers follow that example...
B00005TT77|2.0|My opinion, before listening to this CD and after, is this: ninety-nine percent of the time, covers of Beatles songs are just irritating.  This album is well produced, and the arrangements well thought out  -  but in spite of this, the only positive thing I can say about it as a whole is that it shows by contrast what a class act the Beatles really were.  The people who wrote those songs were the right people to perform and record them, and most all attempts by others to reinterpret them in their own way (sometimes in a radically different way, as is true with much of this album) come up short at best.  At worst, they are the musical equivalent of spray-painted graffiti on a masterpiece.  On \\"I Am Sam\\", there are examples of both.   In terms of concept, some are interesting, albeit misguided, and some are utter [junk].  Buyer beware.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I haven't heard a CD this boring or uneventful in so long.  If I wanted to listen to Dave Matthews, I'd listen to Dave Matthews, if I wanted to hear a singer/songwriter who can actually play guitar I'd listen to Ryan Adams.  The fact of the matter is, is that this cd just isn't very good.  I'm not quite sure how you build a huge following on insipid tunes such as these.  When I saw John Mayer in Memphis, I honestly thought he had bowel problems.  His facial expressions are utterly mystifying.  When the power went off on the stage he was playing, due to technical difficulties, perhaps John should have taken it as a sign and left.
B000068FUS|5.0|I finally was able to purchase the new Drive By Truckers &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot;.  Damn, this is one of the best cds of the 2002!

B000067CPX|5.0|Like myself, the Peppers are maturing, and ain't it wonderful.  For the hardnose fans of the white funk style of music, this will not be a favourite.  The music tends more to a ballad style and probably echoes the input of J Frusciante.  Anthony Keidis's voice is just so suited to this style, it just carries you away to another place.  Unlike Californication, there are no tracks here that jump off the disc and have you humming away to yourself all day long.  The album has to be listened to in its entirety.  Late evening, the sun setting, a good cigar and a cold beer and just sit back and soak it all in.  A couple of nice ladies draped appropriately would also be a great help.  Its nice to see a band maturing (most of the members are I think, the wrong side of forty now) and their music growing with them.  Long may the Peppers continue.

0316666343|3.0|It's too bad for Alice Sebold that Oprah is not rating books anymore, because \\"The Lovely Bones\\" would certainly be touted in her now-defunct book club. The plot really doesn't need to be rehashed in any great length here: a fourteen-year-old girl is murdered, and she tracks the lives of her family, her killer, and selected schoolmates from her own heaven. There are many heartwarming, tragic, and suspensful moments in the lives of these people. There are also some dull moments where the story drags. However, the premise of the story is very imaginitive and creative, and that goes a long way in making this story gripping and hard to put down.<br />There seem to be some underlying messages here, however, that are problematic for me coming from a Christian worldview. For one thing, Susie's heaven seems to be a rather dull place, more like the Talking Heads song \\"Heaven\\" where \\"nothing ever happens\\" than heaven in any sort of Biblical or religious sense, which probably explains Susie's excessive preoccupation with the goings-on on earth. Is this heaven merely a fictional construct to move the story along, or is the author making a theological statement when she presents a heaven totally devoid of any supreme being? God is referred to only once and in a very oblique sense in describing thunder. Also, about 25 pages from the end, something very unexpected happens, and without giving too much away, seems to present a message of sex-as-salvation which I'm sure Hollywood will eat up when it comes time to buy the rights to this story but is really a false message. In addition, when justice is finally done, it happens in a rather unconvincing manner, and brings up other disturbing questions which I cannot go into without giving away too much. In conclusion, while I would give this book as a story four and a half stars, some of the underlying messages drag it down to three stars, still a good rating but far short of a classic.

B00003CXDZ|4.0|This movie is even better than its publicity.  The color, music and acting by the stars are all above average.  The writing for the secondary cast is poorly done. The widescreen version is one of the worst yet.  The horizontal black bands take up as much space as the picture, even on a very large TV.  The supplemental disc, not in the same widescreen, is superb all the way around and almost worth the price by itself.

I love the fact that Colin seems to have everything and need nothing but discovers that he needs Penelope.

B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna's first masterpiece. This, to me, is an essential Madonna recording.<br />Through the gospel-fused title track, to the heartbreaking, yet oddly upbeat \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\" (references her abusive marriage to Sean Penn), to the upbeat and poppy \\"Cherish\\" to the psychedelic \\"Dear Jessie,\\" not to exclude the classic, in it's own right, \\"Keep It Together,\\" Madonna proved that she was no longer a pop tart, or a Sire puppet, but an artist that demanded respect.<br />I recommend this to not only casual Madonna fans, but to those that have an open mind, an eclectic taste in music, and to those that appreciate music that is made from the depths of one's soul.<br />She may be the 'disputed' Queen of Pop, but she will always remain something of more importance to me. She's not another pop star. Not afraid to experiment. Not afraid to lose fans. Not afraid to say what she feels. That IS the essence of rock and roll to me.
6304595247|4.0|Having just read the book, I enjoyed this film version particularly Ralph Fienne's portrayal of Heathcliff, the fantastic cinematography and the gut-wretching music. The movie almost stays faithful to the book, but leaves out substantial components of Cathy's personality: Her capacity for destructive fury and neurotic/psychotic self-inflicted illnesses when faced with loosing Heathcliff. Her capacity for vindictiveness is equal to Heathcliff's, and leaving this out undermines the credibility of their narcisistic obsession with each other. <BR>The scenery is stunning and coupled with the passionate and mornful neo-romantic music it pulls you in, helping you envision the power of obsession, and pull towards the eternal that Bronte so hauntingly invokes in the novel.

B0000025ZF|5.0|It is apparent by reading these reviews that some of you just don't get it ... Roger Waters is a GENIUS with lyrics. With this album he managed to equal the best of his work on Animals, Dark Side, The Wall or Final Cut. The blend of his lyrics and melodies with Clapton's guitar and Sanborn's Saxaphone (Go Fishing will TEAR your heart out) are the work of true musicians. <br />There is a good a reason why Eric Clapton and David Sanborn chose to work with Waters on this album - they 'understand the music Yoko'.<BR> <BR>The only way one could find this album boring would be if they were Menudo or Back Street Boys fans.

B000002UAU|5.0|It is almost impossible to overstate the importance of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band to the development of rock music. When this dazzling LP was released in the summer of 1967, it immediately altered the way in which society viewed popular music and the way in which popular music viewed itself. ..This boldly inventive, highly profound and clearly artistically conscious album elevated popular music to the status of true art...There are essentially three elements that make Sgt. Pepper's so outstanding.<br />#1, Bold Songwriting. Since Rubber Soul, The Beatles had been slowly lessening their reliance on the typical boy-meets-girl or boy-loses girl pop-song formula. By the time they began writing material for Sgt. Pepper's, they were completely disregarding all conventions. >#2, Continuity. At the start of the recording sessions that resulted in Sgt. Pepper's, The Beatles had the notion of creating an album that, unlike any before it, would be \\"continuous,\\" like a novel or play. ...#3, Ground-breaking Production. The band's ambitious and occasionally zany ideas ... The astounding results (which still sound spectacular by today's standards) include the dazzling circus ambience of \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,\\" the twinkling gleam of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and the collage of animals, car honks and other street noises that enhances \\"Good Morning, Good Morning.\\" Just as The Beatles were proving that writing pop songs could be a true art form, their producer was demonstrating that recording them, in itself, could be also.<br />Since Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band popular music was seen countless innovations, from progrock to punk, techno to low-fi, avante-rock to grunge, but one sentiment has remained evident to its performers, fans and, for the most part, the general public: Popular music means something. The diverse, poignant and inventive songwriting, uncanny inner-album unity and three-dimensional ambience of Sgt. Pepper's formally declaration that this is so.

B000002UAI|2.0|The Beatles' catalogue is generally thought to have three low-points. One is Let It Be, a set taken from a series of 1968 jam sessions that was remastered by producer, Phil Spector, who bombarded tracks meant to be a return to basics with a glut of overbearing orchestral accompaniment and electronic treatment. Another is Yellow Submarine, the soundtrack to the band's 1968 animated feature that includes a sloppily throw-together track listing of songs recycled from previous albums, sub par unreleased tracks and a series of syrupy symphonic numbers. The last is Beatles for Sale, an album that was hastily recorded to be released in time for the 1964 Christmas season by a group of tired, tour-weary Beatles.<br />In defense of Beatles for Sale, some of the album's songs do not call for much sparkle and precision. The covers, in specific, only required the sass and energy that effortlessly poured from these young performers in heaps. \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\" and their electrifying medley of \\"Kansas City\\" and \\"Hey Hey Hey Hey,\\" soar. Most of the originals, however, sag. A little more time was obviously needed for the songwriting team of John Lennon and Paul McCartney to get comfortable and recharge their creative spirit. Compositions such as \\"No Reply,\\" \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party,\\" \\"What You're Doing,\\" \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" sound like The Beatles on autopilot, insipidly going through the motions that produced their earlier hits. The dry \\"I'm a Loser\\" and the jubilant hit, \\"Eight Days a Week\\" are the only memorable contributions to the Beatles songbook found on Beatles for Sale. For the most part, this is the sound of the fab four worn down by their hectic schedule and bereft of inspiration. Even the greatest performers can occasionally disappoint.

B000001FMX|5.0|I've never understood why this band of original glam punks never got the respect from their critics that they so richly deserved. The New York Dolls had vision, chops, and a makeup rich snear that comes out like a mascara tornado on every track from this disc. Whether performing their musical H-Bomb \\"Personality Crisis\\" or the swoon of \\"Lonely Planet Boy\\", the Dolls had a chemistry that countless bands still try to emulate nearly thirty years after this release... incredible!<br />  The common comparisons made to The Rolling Stones are unfair to The Dolls. Johanson, Thunders, Sylvain, Kane and Nolan owe more of their sound to 50's R&B frenzy than to \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" or even \\"Brown Sugar\\". Granted, Johanson at the time resembled Jagger and Thunders was his Keith Richard, but this is where the similarities end. The Dolls truly had the danger that The Stones claimed to possess but didn't. They were a quick burning fire that consumed everything in it's path including themselves. They couldn't help their self destruction because they thrived on it and were damned from the start if they tried to change their ways.<br />   This self destructive quality is the catalyst for this CD and it's companion piece the following year, \\"The New York Dolls In Too Much Too Soon\\"... it is the secret ingredient to what made The Dolls superb.  The urgency barely contained within these discs is nothing short of amazing and without a doubt addictive. <BR>Just buy them both and thank me later!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I sometimes wonder when listening to Ok Computer if Radiohead had any idea how truly great this album was.  When they listened to it when it was first finished I wonder if they congratulated each other on a work that would surely influence an entire generations music.  I highly doubt it.  <br />It's one of the great aspects of the album- it seems to always exceed expectations.  It surprised me how well the album worked together as a whole, how every listen illuminated something new I hadn't caught before, and how beautiful a rock album could be.  At the heart of it, Ok Computer is about turn-of-the-century paranoia.  It goes through the universe, darkly, discussing the safety of automobiles, plane crashes, alien abductions, the power of corporations and renegade computers.  Thom's voice seemed fairly limited on The Bends, but here his unique sound seems to have no limitations.  He snarls, howls, murmurs, croons and altogether puts the perfect spin on each track.  There is not a single questionable track, and the sequence is flawless.  My very favorite tracks (out of an entire disc of favorites) are the dazzling, escapist Subterranean Homesick Alien, the powerful dirge Exit Music (never fails to give chills), and the creepy Climbing Up the Walls.  <br />With its creative composition, and superior music, Ok Computer is one of the truly great albums of our time.
B000002J2F|5.0|1980's &quot;Duke&quot; saw Genesis parting ways at last with their progressive rock days of yor, no longer doing narrative songs about knights of the round table, the adventures of Puerto Rican kids in New York, or oddly named animals that can dissolve into tears (though I love all of that stuff). That particular Genesis train left the station with their previous album, 1978's &quot;And Then There Were Three,&quot; their first album as a trio. Now, at the dawn of the 80's, and facing a changed rock music world (thanks to Johnny Rotten and others from the punk movement), Genesis decided that they had traveled down the art-rock avenue as far as they could go, and now it was time to refine their sound into more radio-friendly, accessible fair, and &quot;Duke&quot; was the result (the odd, cartoonish album cover art alone was a clear sign that something was different this time around). &quot;Duke&quot; was the album that pointed the way to the band's future endeavors, including big hit singles &amp; concert tours, and major record sales. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, because &quot;Duke&quot; is a major achievement for Genesis, a terrific album filled with great songs (several of which remain FM radio staples today), and solid musicianship from beginning to end. I love the band's earlier stuff, including the Peter Gabriel/Steve Hackett era, but had Genesis stayed in their 70's prog-rock mode forever more, they might have been in serious danger of becoming caricatures of themselves. &quot;Duke&quot; symbolized the band's need for change, and in my opinion, the change worked beautifully.What had NOT left Genesis with &quot;Duke&quot; was the band's epic musical power, which continues marvelously with the opening track, &quot;Behind The Lines,&quot; with keyboardist Tony Banks, guitarist Mike Rutherford, &amp; singer/drummer Phil Collins roaring into your stereo with an amazing rock instrumental intro, before halving the beat into a more pop environment, leadinginto the first of Collins' fine lead vocals. &quot;Duchess&quot; is a glorious triumph for the band, a majestic song about the people's love for a much-worshipped woman. Packed with more emotion than you can shake a stick at, it's one of the band's all-time classics. Later on is the catchy &quot;Misunderstanding,&quot; a big radio hit for the band, and Collins' first solo-penned tune for the group, foreshadowing things to come from Collins' solo career. &quot;Heathaze&quot; is classic Tony Banks all the way. But wait, there's more, including the Genesis concert-closing staple, &quot;Turn It On Again,&quot; Mike Rutherford's lovely &quot;Alone Tonight,&quot; Collins' achingly heartfelt &quot;Please Don't Ask&quot; (quite possibly THE most personal song Phil has ever written), and the grand finale, the rollicking instrumental adventure, &quot;Duke's Travels.&quot; And the album *sounds* terrific, too, handsomely produced by Dave Hentschel &amp; the band.Some Gabriel-era purists will tell you that &quot;Duke&quot; marked &quot;the beginning of the end&quot; for Genesis. I say that's a crock of bull. With this album, the band simply closed one chapter in their musical history and opened another, and there's nothing wrong with that.  &quot;Duke&quot; is a highmark in the Genesis catalog, and a fine, refreshing album from one of rock's finest groups. :-)
B00004XONN|4.0|Everything in its right place?  That's a joke, right?  I mean, come on Radiohead, this album throws convention right out the window.  Heck, sometimes \\"music\\" gets thrown out the window.  Thom's voice doesn't even come out as human until the sixth track on the album, more than halfway through it.  Until then its processed, subdued, slurred, chopped, digitalized and spit back out through the speakers.  Guitars?  Don't count on 'em; they're a special guest on this record.  How bout a chorus?  a consistant form?  What IS in the right place?<br />Kid A is an example of the backdoor approach to making outstanding albums: making a rock album out of everything that isn't rock; creating beauty from elements that (up to now) have been dismissed as ugly.  However, they did it.  Kid A is one of the most interesting and challenging albums I've ever come across, and after investing hours of listening into this album I can say for sure that it's been an extremely worthwhile experience.  The first four tracks are amazing when taken together and they make up one of the finest introductions in history.  Everything in it's Right Place is so unusual, it took a couple times before I got its \\"flow\\"  but it is a stunning track.  The swirling sounds and stream-of-conscience lyrics tap into the essence of a beautiful song.  That fades into Kid A, a coldly detached song that sounds like a computer attempting to feel the loss of a loved one.  Towards the end it evokes a sunrise with no discernable emotion; however it still moves the listener.  The National Anthem comes out raging and crashes into chaos, and out of the wreckage How to Disappear Completely emerges, with Thom singing \\"I'm not here.  This isn't happening...\\"  over a painfully beautiful guitar/orchestra sound.<br />And then some of the magic begins to wear off a bit.  Treefingers is a non-linear song Thom wrote by playing on guitar, and running cuts from it through a computer, patchwork style.  Strictly filler.  And Idioteque seems to be the most love it/hate it song on the album.  Personally, I feel it's an obvious rip-off of Aphex Twin without the crazy beats to make it interesting.  <br />But on an album conceived this completely, these are minor complaints.  This album may not be for everyone; but I still think that everyone needs to give it a try.  Everyone.  It's that good.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Don't bother with the concerns some reviewers have about the expanded/revised CD content or with what they've done to the sound. This is quite possibly the best live Rock album of all time. The expanded song list for the remastered CD is fantastic, as is the sound. Obviously, the playing and singing are unbelievable. But the improved sound quality alone make this a worthwhile buy for any serious fan of Rock. And if you want even more, hop on over to the Deluxe double-CD set, which includes virtually everything from Tommy. Kudos to MCA for finally doing this album right.
B00005B4GU|4.0|It's been just over a year since Radiohead released Amnesiac, and still I'm the first among my friends to pick up a copy of it.  (I wasn't quite ready; I was still digesting Kid A...)  Seems odd that the first point they always ask about is how it compares to The Bends: &quot;Cause I heard they went back to their roots ya know.&quot;  And I thought that myth had been dispelled by critics long ago.  In case it hasn't: Amnesiac is just as diffuclt as Kid A if not more so (at least Kid A had Optimistic.)  Oh, and by the way: The music is incredible too!(why is this never the first question with Radiohead?)<br />Amnesiac starts off with Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box, a real fluid, mechanical piece- and with that we're off to a great start to on another terrific, boundary pushing album.  The entire album is more sonically varied than Kid A, with more standard guitars, orchestras and actual (not sythesized) precussion.   There are a ton of highlights on this disc.  You and Whose Army? is a fight song that sounds, ironically, completely defeated.  Its also got an awesome, swelling climax at the end, leading into the rumbling bass on I Might Be Wrong, probably the most &quot;standard&quot; rock song present.  The rant against capitalism, Dollars and Cents, is a beautiful passive-aggressive song whose symphony at times overwhelms Thom's voice with great effect, and the closer- Life in a Glasshouse- is a great ending, with the jazz band from The National Anthem (Kid A) in completely different form.  The albums gem, however, is Pyramid Song, a song that is as interesting to listen to (given a VERY complex time signature and Thom's musings on the afterlife) as it is hauntingly beautiful. <br />Unfortunately, the missteps are more obvious on this album than on their previous.  For one, several musical passages borrow from other songs they've already released.  (Do I hear Optimistic in Dollars' bridge?)  Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors is an experimental track that- in ugly contrast with Radiohead's style-is the best the first time you hear it.  Third time through the album, and I bet everyone will be tempted to skip it.  And did we really need another Morning Bell?  But the biggest problem with this album is the sequencing.  Kid A flowed incredibly; Amnesiac can't get a pace established.  The most glaring example: sandwiching Pyramid Song between Packt and Doors.<br />Well there you go friends and readers: a critical examination of a pretty outstanding album.  Please, go out and get it.  And stop asking if it sounds like &quot;The Bends.&quot;
6304712936|4.0|The bit a lot of people miss about Amadeus is not so much that it's a fiction (this really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone: it purports to be the recounted story of a person in a madhouse, after all), but that it's an adaptation of a play. Like most playwrights, Peter Shaffer (he of Equus) was not interested in historical accuracy to documentary standard - and nor is this picture. In fact, it's much cleverer than that - what we get here is a beautifully scripted essay on Envy, God and your Just Deserts (and why you don't always get them), played out between light and dark in the beautiful setting of Prague. As befits a theatrical adaptation, the symbolism is stark - Mozart's white (even manifesting itself in a dove at one point, for heaven's sake) plays the establishment's black. For the most part, you can judge the sympathies of a given character at a point in time by the colour of his or her wig. Salieri, the great tormentor (and tormentee) is finally rendered head to toe in snowy white, being wheeled down the corridors of the madhouse, himself absolved and offering absolution to his fellow in-patients. And Mozart disappears, in a hessian sack, into a cloud of quicklime of the purest white.<br />I suppose the American accents shouldn't have grated - historically they're no less accurate than English ones, or the speaking of English at all, for that matter. Still, a pity that Simon Callow traded his English accent for a silly American one.<br />Good tip (especially for those stuffy types who don't dig Tom Hulce's hyena impersonation): watch the film with the alternative music only soundtrack. Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martins in the Fields playing Mozart to the accompaniment of pretty Czech snowscapes is about as it good as it gets.
B000067JBN|1.0|When i heard this movie was out at the cinema i was eager to see<BR>it even though guy pearce was in it. for the record i think he is a terrible actor and hes just painful to watch. But because i love the story of the time machine i loved the original movie even though it was in black and white it blew me away, i thought making a new version was a way of introducing the movie to a new audience.  so i went  along with an open mind but yet again hes a dissapointment, the sfx were amazing but apart from that nothing.  If they wanted to show how good this movie could be they should of copied the 60's version and just updated the effects and would have been brill.
B000009CEM|5.0|So a few years ago the Mortal Kombat soundtrack appeared at my house. I didn't know where it came from, I just found it in a cupboard. So I listened to it and the only standout track was FF's \\"Zero Signal\\". I listened to that track a few times then I lost the CD. Then about 3 months ago, a friend lent me Obsolete. I was seriously blown away. Burton's alernating vocal styles, Dino's chunky guitar riffs, and most of all Raymond's lightning speed double kicks all work together to create some VERY intense music. Almost every song on this CD is awesome. From the opening double-bass kick attack of \\"Shock\\" to the haunting string section of \\"Timelessness\\", this album sounds like a dark, apocolyptic future. The only below average tracks are \\"Obsolete\\" and \\"Freedom or Fire\\". FF's earlier album DEMANUFACTURE is just as good as this CD. To sum it all up, BUY THIS ALBUM, and buy DEMANUFACTURE as well. You won't be disappointed.
0393317552|4.0|To the average reader -- not professionally prepared on the subject of human history -- this book is a treasure.<BR>Of course, it needs to be read without prejudice or preconceived ideas, be these on race or religious supremacy or history.<br />To me, it answered questions which I had always wanted answered, and gave me a much more realistic perspective on history. Yes, history didn't start in AD 1, nor in 1492. We all know that, although many don't seem to have actually assimilated the idea.<br />History started well before then and the present is inextricably linked with what happened tens of thousands of years ago. This book helps you to think that way.<br />Furthermore the work is a goldmine of scientific information on plants, languages, animal domestication, etc.<BR>Here I learned that horses didn't exist in the Americas before 1492, for example. And here I learned that zebras cannot be domesticated.<br />Why not 5 stars then? Because the author is not as good a writer as he is a man of science. Arguments are often repeated and --  although maybe this achieves the result of fixing them more in the readers memory -- the book at times seems longer than it could be.<BR>Apart from this minor problem, top marks to Guns Germs and Steel.
B00003CWL6|5.0|A lot has been said about this film, and I am sure you have heard it all, so I won't put you through yet another review of the film's story. What I would like to say, though, is that I enjoyed it because of how honest it is, and because the actors all do give stand-out performances. It's a great ensemble cast!!! Personally, I especially liked the scenes with Wes Bentley and Thora Birch, who win my prize for odd couple of the year ...! It really is no wonder the movie received countless awards, seeing as how perfectly it captures truth and illusion of our everyday lives.
B00004Z459|1.0|This is just plain horrible, one star is being too generous.  The songs are just horrible and shallow and two-faced.  Mellow to heavy worked for Metallica and Nirvana, but for these guys it makes all of rock look bad.  Let me tell you something people, not only does this lack talent, this lacks any originality.  This is not creative, Linkin Park brings nothing new to the musical table...  Rap/rock with a limited (very limited) few exceptions [DISAPPOINTS]!

B000066I6N|5.0|We were fortunate enough to hear Plant and his band kicking off their American tour for Dreamland.  Although many of the fans were angry that he did not do enough of the \\"classics,\\" many others, including myself, were awed by the artistry and talent of this rock icon.  His interpretations of 60s covers are soulful and cognizant of the psychidelic heritage of this period, and at the same time, manage to be thoroughly modern. Darkness, Darkness is a great cut and allows him to show off his voice, which has mellowed beautifully.  The electric guitar really carries me back to the 60s, even though I wasn't quite old enough.  Funny in My Mind is catchy and playful without being commercial.  Red Dress and Morning Dew are also excellent cuts in which Plant's voice echoes the old style while incorporating many modern touches.  <BR>So many of the old Zeppelin hits use the trope of moving on, leaving, gonna send you, going somewhere else. I am glad to see that Plant has done just that with this album.  If the song remained the same, rock and roll would die.
B0000024SD|5.0|This album marks the end of the 'folkie wonder boy' period for Dylan and the start of his legendary status. It shouldn't have been such a shock to the folk purists; he'd been moving away from them for a while before this (his first single,MIXED UP CONFUSION, was electric). Everybody was singing protest now, it was time to move on. Bob Dylan confused and delighted with these slices of electric blues married with playful,and sometimes dangerous, imagery. The idea of both an acoustic and an electric side was copied by many, including Neil Young (RUST NEVER SLEEPS,anyone?). Without BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME (ands its follow ups, HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED and BLONDE ON BLONDE) the course of rock would have been altered forever, and a great many artists and masterworks would never have existed . . .but you knew that already, didn't you?<br />SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK BLUES - It's amazing just how Bob raps out those phrases seemingly without drawing breath. I played this album the other day and was struck by the backing Dylan gets on this track; the playful bass and darting little licks on the lead guitar. it's also ironic that the lyrics to SHB went on to describe the feeling of the post '65 era.<br />SHE BELONGS TO ME - This ranks in Dylan's top five love songs <BR>for me. I've heard many covers of this classic (including a truly abysmal one by THE NICE) by nothing beats Bob's reading. Great song to play when you're totally confused by your lover.<br />MAGGIE'S FARM - Dylan at his sneering best. I've read reviews by people who claim the lyrics are Marxist, but to me it's  a hearty  fist shake at all those folkies who didn't understand ANOTHER SIDE OF BOB DYLAN and would probably curse this new electric direction. He had a good idea who would be on who's side even then.<br />LOVE MINUS ZERO/NO LIMIT - Another love song full of wonder. It doesn't matter what Bob's lover does; she will always have his love and doesn't need to prove anything to him. The guitar picking is exquisive.<br />OUTLAW BLUES - This track might seem slight when compared to the rest of the album, but the union of the cliched Blues quick shuffle and these absurdist,playful lyrics breathe fire into the genre. Being an Aussie, I love the \\"Australian mountain range\\" verse. LOL!<br />ON THE ROAD AGAIN - An funny song where Bob meets all the weird relatives. The Dylan of this era was forever dealing in jokes and asides in his lyrics and interviews.<br />BOB DYLAN'S 115TH DREAM - Worth it just to hear his royal Bobness<BR>make a goof and crack up at the start of the track. Tom Wilson(Dylan's then producer)gets in on the act as well! The song itself is a side splitting nautical yarn of Seaman Bob, ending up engaging in a conversation with Columnbus!<br />MR TAMBOURINE MAN - In my opinion, better than the Byrds' version. If you close your eyes while listening, the harp playing and lyrics can send you floating off on your own trip.<br />GATES OF EDEN - Epic acoustic song with Eden being the ultimate goal, shining and almost certainly unreachable. The imagery in Dylan's lyrics are still being copied (badly) by today's angst-ridden poets and singer/songwriters.<br />IT'S ALRIGHT MA (I'M ONLY BLEEDING) - The anger in Dylan's voice and his furious acoustic guitar strumming almost knocks you over the first time you hear this song; as he takes you on a warts and all journey through the 1965 modern world. It has only gotten worse since then. I love the fact the he ends all his stanzas of outrage with \\"It's alright ma . . .\\"<br />IT'S ALL OVER NOW,BABY BLUE - I grew up listening to Graham Bonnet's  version of this classic kiss off track. Thankfully a friend gave me this album and hearing the surperior version just opened up my eyes to Bob Dylan and his music. Dylan uses this song to great effect as he musically stomps his English competitior Donavon into the ground,in the film 'Don't Look Back'.
B000068QY7|4.0|I am probably the biggest Oasis fan out there. I listen to rotating albums everyday and I think I have a pretty good grasp of their music, but the last 2 albums have made me appreciate the first 2 even more. I realize that a 4 star rating may make you scratch your head based on the review, but I guess that's my Oasis bias forming again. Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory churned out instant classics and nothing since has approached them, but Heathen is growing on me. My first listen didn't blow me away, but the more I listen the more I like it. Songbird is the best track on the album. Liam wrote it and I think he's got a talent in writing. He actually wrote 3 tracks, but Songbird is by far the best guitar, lyric combo. Andy Bell and Gem Archer got into it a bit on this album too, but Noel and Liam are becoming mellow in their 30's. Stop Crying and Little By Little are good tunes. I heard a comparison of Wonderwall to Stop Crying and that's a crime, but it is a good tune. She is Love is good, but the rest of the album is just ok. I guess I am jaded with the brilliance of tracks like Live Forever, Supersonic, Acquiesce, Roll With It and Morning Glory, but it's a good buy, certainly not the best they've cranked out. I hope their next album reverts back to the early 90's where Noel showed his genius songwriting and Liam hated the world. That's the Oasis I fell in love with.
0385503954|5.0|Thank God people write reviews! I picked up this book on the advice of other Amazon.com customers and was completely blown away. I read it in one night, I simply could not stop reading until it was finished. McEwan's writing is captivating, and the underlying themes of existence, fate, and the transcendance of love drive the story along. I have not felt this much empathy for literary characters in a long while. A definite must read.
B00005J73X|5.0|This album is a great compilation of all phases of Bon Jovi.  From Runaway, performed by a young band with all the excitement of young men just about to make it big, to the latest tracks which show how much and how well this band has matured.  You can't go wrong with this album.  Perfect for old and new Bon Jovi fans alike.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Voice - 4 stars<br />Lyrics/Melodies - 2 stars<br />She's only 22 years old, has a great voice, however, I believe that this album was overly-hyped and the majority of the songs were too jazzy for my taste.  Don't get me wrong, she's a great singer...but I strongly believe as she continues to mature, she will continue to produce better and more genuine songs.  <br />It's a mediocre album for sure.
B000066JES|4.0|I, like many, have liked Manowar for a while now.  I realize that some of their material has been a little...over the top, in the past but that is one of the things that is great (and fun) about it.  This album, however, is literally divided in half.  On one half you have rather slow songs that, respectively, probably appeal to a certain audience - but certainly not the average/typical Manowar fan.  On the other half you have some of the best songs Manowar have ever done - fast, brutal, heavy, and with just the right amount of that over-the-top goodness we've all come to expect.  The slower, \\"American Heartland\\" type stuff and the Opera song simply do not fit into a Metal album.  I think that a lot of people who bought this album were surprised, and rather stunned, when they cranked it up on their stereos waiting anxiously for the next battle that Manowar were going to lead them into, only instead to hear \\"Oh I wish I were in the land of cotton, old times there are not forgotten, look away, look away, look away, Dixie Land.\\"  Buy this album for the good songs: Call to Arms, Warriors of the World United, Hand of Doom, House of Death, & Fight Until We Die.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I almost never heard this music, and it would have been a shame to miss it. This CD has been in my alarm clock waking me up every morning for two weeks. The tracks are rich in a way you rarely find in music these days. The blues never appealed much to me, but these are classic hobo and blues songs sung by masters. My tastes run to hard rock and Latin pop, but this will be an all time favorite genre-buster, I can already tell. The voices are varied as are the tunes, making it easy to listen to the full hour of music without getting bored. Unless you are hopelessly stuck in the Teeny bopper bubble gum pop you are guaranteed to like this. It is \\"roots\\" music that goes deep in message, meaning and sound, and no matter what you nod your head to usually, you will hear its roots on this unique and unmistakeable album.
0316666343|3.0|If Oprah were still doing her BookClub on a regular basis, this would be a shoe-in (Halo-in?) for a monthly pick. It's got the same dysfunctional family & sentimentality going on. If you liked Oprah's picks, this book's for you! Bravo, Jonathan Franzen!
B000003CMB|5.0|First off, anyone who bashes this album has just lost their privledge to criticize great music. This is one of the most enduring and praised albums of all time. For being from 1971, it is well recorded and very raw. As many people admit, the sound in the Fillmore East was something near spectacular. <BR>   The first track on this album is &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot;. Followed by &quot;Done Somebody Wrong&quot;, &quot;Stormy Monday&quot;, &quot;You Don't Love Me&quot;, &quot;Hot 'Lanta&quot;, the great &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot;, topped off with the blistering &quot;Whipping Post&quot;. The album clocking in at just under 79 miuntes. Not one disappointment. <BR>   I definately would recommend this album to anyone who is into the blues, anyone who is into great live recordings, or anyone who is into soaring guitars, lots of energy, and something that will make your speakers pulsate even after the music has ceased. <BR>For anyone who is looking to purchase a ABB album, start with one of their greatest hits collections. The &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; album would be something to purchase right after that.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Echoes is possibly one of the greatest cd's that will go on sale for years. It shows the Pink Floyd at their greatest. Although I think they should've made it a 3-cd case since many classic Floyd songs such as \\"Have a Cigar\\", \\"Brain Damage/Eclipse\\", \\"Not Now John\\", \\"The Nile Song\\" \\"Cymbaline\\" and other great ones, it still has most of their great songs like \\"Hey You\\", \\"Time\\", \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" \\"See Emily Play\\", and others which make it a must need album for any Floyd fan out there. Alot of Floyd fans though will probally notice the edits they made in \\"Echoes\\" and \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\", but the most appearent is in \\"Marooned\\" where 4/5 of the song is missing, making it almost wothless to even be on the album, though un-edited its an amazing song.
B00003W8NM|4.0|My brother-in-law loaned us the \\"Fight Club\\" DVD about 3 months ago and I kept putting off viewing it because of my preconceived notions about the film.<br />From seeing the previews, I had the idea that the film glorified fighting: I recalled a scene where Brad Pitt's character announces an 'assignment' --to go out and start a fight with a stranger.<br />My reaction at the time was extremely negative. I thought it was, at best, stupid, and at worst, completely irresponsible.<br />Damn was I wrong! When my wife asked me if we were \\"ever\\" going to watch the DVD, I reluctantly gave in. A little over two hours later I had to admit: I LOVED it!<br />Ed Norton plays the \\"Narrator.\\" When the film opens, Norton has the barrel of a gun inserted in his mouth, courtesy of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt.) Norton (as the Narrator) explains how he's arrived at this less-than-pleasant point in his life, and the film flashes back to a time shortly before Narrator meets Durden.<br />We learn that Narrator works for a \\"major\\" automobile manufacturer in a position of questionable moral standing. Though it evidently pays well, (based upon his very well-decorated, upscale apartment), it involves making judgements for the company as to whether or not to recall autos based upon a mathematical formula that calculates the cost of lawsuits vs. the cost of actually fixing the problem. In a nutshell, if the lawsuits are cheaper, people die. This disturbs Narrator, but not so much that he's willing to give up the perks of the job.<br />Returning from one of his frequent cross-country business trips, he winds up sitting next to Durden. Striking up a conversation, he learns that Durden is somewhat mysterious, even to the point of holding back what he does for a living, although he ultimately reveals that he's a manufacturer of hand-made soap, and gives Narrator a card.<br />Good thing. Because when Narrator gets home from the airport, he finds that all of his beloved possessions are scattered around the foot of his apartment building, having been blown out the windows by a terrific explosion.<br />Having no place to spend the night, he calls his new friend, they meet for a couple of beers, and upon leaving the bar, Durden eggs him on about \\"not asking\\" if he can stay at his place. While at first he denies that was the intent of his having called him, he finally gives in and asks Durden if he'd mind. He wouldn't. But before they go walking off to Durden's house, Durden asks Narrator to hit him. Hard.<br />Narrator looks at him as if he's insane, but after being asked a couple of times, Narrator finally give in and clocks him in the ear. Durden returns the punch and they end up both 'going at it.' Much to his surprise, Narrator finds that the fight was absolutely exhilarating. And thus begins a very strange, but very well-done movie.the foot of his apartment building, having been blown out the windows by a terrific explosion.<br />Having no place to spend the night, he calls his new friend, they meet for a couple of beers, and upon leaving the bar, Durden eggs him on about \\"not asking\\" if he can stay at his place.

B00005ASOI|2.0|After I finished watching this I could only wonder why &quot;Suspiria&quot; attained such a cult status. There were a few brief periods of suspense, and the mood and atmosphere make it somewhat interesting; however, you need more ingredients than this to come out with a decent movie. Not horrible, but mediocre at best.
6305165912|5.0|The Coens' Brothers have a nack for sly wit and intelligent humor that others can't touch. And the fun thing about their movies is you pick more and more of the humor up as you watch them over and over again!<BR> I can't get bored of this movie(or any Coen's Bros), its probably the funniest movie ever made in my humble opinion, and Jeff Bridges is awesome as the lead.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club the movie was, in my opinion, an excellent film.  Whether or not you like the picture itself is up to you.  If you liked the film though you should absolutely pick up the two disk dvd.<br />Many films released these days are just rushed to dvd and do so little to take advantage of everything that a dvd can do.  Not so with Fight Club.  Not only do you get a large selection of truly interesting commentaries by the stars, David Fincher, Chuck Palahniuk (the author of the novel Fight Club), and others on the first disk, you also get an entire second disk full of features.  You pay a little more for this second disk but believe me, it is worth every penny.  It contains music videos, internet and tv spots from the advertising campaign for Fight Club (nearly all of which I missed the first time around and some of which are downright hilarious), the presskit (also hilarious), a long interview with Edward Norton, deleted scenes, explanations of the subtle and efffective special effects, and more!  With the commentaries and all the other extra features there is at least another dozen fresh hours of entertainment and insight into the film.<br />The bottom line is this: If you liked the film, Fight Club, then the dvd will be a crown jewel in your collection.

B00005LOUP|2.0|Is the DVD different than the VHS?  Tell me and I'll purchase the VHS.  Every review that was negative seemed to have the Dvd version at the end of the review.  I purchased the grinch because I have always loved the Grinch and Cindy Lou Who.  I could not get through a Christmas season without my boys and myself sitting down to watch the animated version at least a dozen times!  It's short, sweet and gets the point across to even the smallest tykes.  This movie? Keep in mind that I love both Jim Carrey and Ron Howard please! It scared even me...my seven and one+ year old slept with mom and dad for a WEEK. It did not even come close to putting me in the Christmas spirit.  It would have been a better Halloween movie.  Forgive me Jim and Ron, but this movie is just not &quot;Christmasy&quot; at all......It was kinda weird, and Jim Carrey may have been a bit too weird - he does tend to go overboard on the seriously odd .......I returned my copy and now will only stick to the wonderful, magical and captivating animated Grinch......No amount of makeup or special effects could ever come close!
B00005R2M3|4.0|Hey, this is my favorite singer. She has everything, the look, and lovely face, the sexy body and a beautiful voice. It amazed me that she was not born in the U.S. I listen to her CD almost every day. <br />A good buy. I gave 4 stars because 3 songs were in Spanish which I have absolutely no knowledge of.
B000001GS0|5.0|Here is music making of exceptional caliber. Though recorded in mono, Jochum's performances offer some musical details of the kind I have never heard before in other stereo accounts of these scores. Not everyone will appreciate some of his touches, especially the occasional tendency to accelerate the pace in certain passages. Personally, I find such examples pleasantly invigorating. However, what really appeals most of all about Jochum's approach is his broad musical understanding and earnest appreciation of Brahms' music. While a fair number of others can be routine in these symphonies, he frequently clears the air and uplifts you, and his wonderfully expressive phrasing often exhibits a pleasing lyricism, especially in the woodwind and string portions of Brahms' andantes. For example, listen to the beautiful colors and songful tones he draws from the second movement of the Third Symphony. Though Jochum later produced another fine set of the Brahms Symphonies in stereo with the London Philharmonic containing exposition repeats of the first movements of the first three symphonies, these repeats are not included in the mono Berlin package. Notwithstanding, I'm still partial to some of the special interpretive qualities of the earlier Berlin set. My preferred choices among stereo sets include Otto Klemperer's with the Philharmonia Orchestra, Istvan Kertesz's with the Vienna Philharmonic and Bruno Walter's with the Columbia Symphony. I also like Eduard Van Beinum with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra, although his Brahms 2 and 3 were recorded in mono.sz's with the Vienna Philharmonic. Finally, included too is Eduard Van Beinum's Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra collection, though Symphonies 2 and 3 are in monophonic sound.
0446608955|3.0|Okay, if you like cheesy romantic fiction, you might like this. In fact, I like romance myself, but nevertheless, I found this to be an pretty mundane novel. The characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is predictable. When I was reading it, I found myself apathetic towards the sob-story aspect, because I saw it coming and wasn't interested enough in the cookie-cutter characters to care. While I'm sure it made great fodder for a teen movie, it just doesn't cut it as a good novel.
B000067CPX|5.0|I was browsing through my local record store and heard this disc playing.  I asked the sales person &quot;Who Is This?&quot;  When I found out who it was I was suprised. <br />I don't like or own any of the RHCP previous releases, but this is fantastic.  They have a more mature sound than their previous releases and the music and vocals balance each other perfectly.  If their other releases were like this, I'd buy them all.
0393316041|5.0|An outstanding anthology! This work will educate the reader about the genesis of the atomic bomb, physics, and the inimitable character that was Richard Feynman. Don't let the fact that he was a physicist scare you, Dr. Feynman presents articles that explain physics (in a common-sense, rather than intensely mathematical) way, as well as his observations on human behaviour, life, and a more human side to working on the nations most top-secret project during WWII.  Feynman was a genius, not only in his approach to physics but his approach to communicating, and observation in general. A real gem!
0790729628|5.0|I have not seen the original version of this movie, so I can't compare the two. Regardless of what the other version of this film was like, however, this version was extraordinary - I've never seen anything quite like it before! Besides providing the viewer with a mesmerizing combination of a bizarre setting, appropriate music, and action sequences, this film raised many essential questions about what it means to be human...<br />Blade Runner is, more than anything, a film noir - in many ways it is very similar to Humphrey Bogart's noir detective thrillers from the 1940s (The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep, for instance). But instead of being set in the dark city streets in the 1940s, Blade Runner is set in L.A. in 2019. By 2019, the movie asserts, L.A. has been transformed into a decaying mega-metropolis, and consists of multitudes of people fighting their way through constantly rainy streets (turning the idea of sunny California on its head) filled with strange shops. Great shots of this bizarre city combined with a perfectly fitted soundtrack create a nightmarish, haunting atmosphere in this film.<br />Essentially, the plot of this movie concerns Rick Decard (Harrison Ford, in an unusual and very, very good performance), a one time blade runner (i.e. police killer) who is forced by to track down several more replicants (androids w/a 4 year lifespan who are used as slaves but sometimes escape and are illegal on Earth). As the movie puts it, replicants \\"were designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The designers reckoned that after a few years, they might develop their own emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, anger, envy. So they built in a fail-safe device...Four year life span.\\"<br />Anyhow, as Decker hunts down the remaining replicants, he begins to learn to feel again - at the beginning of the film, he seems even less human than the replicants he is supposed to kill. Also, along the way, he meets Rachael, a beautiful replicant who has been modified (she has been given memories) to even more resemble a human. Saying any more about the plot would give too much away...but one thing is for sure - this is a fantastic film which raises many important questions about humanity and life. Watch this soon - don't let this film's moments get lost \\"in time like tears in the rain.\\" One warning: there is quite a bit of violence, but nothing too terrible by today's standards.ant who has been modified (she has been given memories) to even more resemble a human.

B00005JKJA|1.0|I, like many other people, was expecting to see something epic and amazing, full of plot.  All the &quot;strange&quot; movies of this generation end up with an amazing plot twist just when you think you understand what will happen.  Unfortunately for this movie, there was no real twist because there was no real plot.  This movie was filled to the brink with as much wierdness as possible only to be wierd.  Well, they got that down but in the process of all the strange goings on, they forgot to add in any plot twist, character development, or explanation.  Granted, I like to think about movies and what they mean, but this movie did not mean anything.  A movie is supposed to be like a book where every part has meaning to it.  I could not find 30 minutes of actual storyline in this movie, it was all pointless &quot;filler&quot; scenes.  For example, there was at least a 5 minute scene with a lady singing in spanish who never appeared in the movie prior to this scene, never appeared after, and didn't change the story in any way.  Maybe if they didn't spend so much time doing pointless scenes they could have put more time into all the idea's that were never finished.  As a side note, the acting was pretty crummy too.  And next time, leave the non-chronological plot to director Christopher Nolan (memento &amp; following).
B00005R2M3|5.0|I first heard Whenever, Wherever on the radio, then Suerte. Once I made the connection between the two, I was hooked. I got the CD mainly because of those, and after a couple times through loved every song. It's nice if you can understand at least some of the spanish. I think those are the best songs. She seems to have a unique voice that is different in english and spanish which I think makes it even more interesting.
B000059MEK|4.0|The first time I heard this album, I though that maybe Kraftwerk had got back together. The first track has the same vocoded, catchy vocals that made Kraftwerk's later albums so appealing.  I was wrong about it being Kraftwerk. It was actually Daft Punk's second album...in many ways a far cry from their debut. On this album, they seem to draw a heavy influence from those (original) robots from Germany. The synth sounds and melodies on this album will surely remind people of the synth sounds that creeped their way through Kraftwerk's \\"The Man-Machine.\\" In fact, Daft Punk could have easily been a photocopy of the infamous german popsters. Instead, Daft Punk went along with the world around them. They took the catchy synth approach and made a dance album that will hold up for quite a while (maybe not as long as their first...but it should give it a run for it's money). <br />The only real complaint that I have with this album is that a few of the tracks become a bit redundant after a while, but when this album is initiated in what it was meant for (driving, background music at a party) it doesn't really matter. This album will surely have everyone chanting \\"One More Time\\" in unison at that next big bash you have planned. Kraftwerk should be proud that they inspired such vocoded fun.
0688152023|4.0|I really like the stretches and exercises I've done so far from this book.  The thing is, if you want to do the number of repetitions and do enough exercises to get a total body workout, it will take a fair amount of time.  You have to be committed and focussed to get the most out of these.  I noticed a difference in the way I moved and felt after doing some of the workout the first time!  I just got the book and have only been doing it for about a week, so I can't tell you about the long-term benefits, but so far, I feel great.  I LOVE the pictures and all of the dancer's personal opinions at the start of the book.  It's a really high quality book and it's dedicated to helping you acheive the look of a dancer!
B00005NW02|3.0|System of a Down's first album was truly great, combining various elements from various genres into the simple guise that was to become Nu-metal.  On this album, the seem to have completely embraced the Nu-metal phenomenon on their songs entirely.  The grand, sweeping, and eclectic music that was held within their first album seems to have disappeared here.  <br />Fortunately, there are a couple of gems on this album.  &quot;Chop Suey&quot; sounds almost like an outake from the first album that the band deemed (thankfully) worthy to include on this disc.  &quot;Bounce&quot; has to be one of the most fun and weirdest songs that I have ever encountered in any genre.  It truly does make you want to bounce along with it, no matter what musical stylings you prefer.  Unfortunately, the rest of the album is rather monotonous without much diversity.<br />Besides the aforementioned two songs, the lyrics still remain true to the first album.  They delve into personal ambitions, goals, veiwpoints, and feelings on various subjects.  Hopefully, on their next album, the music will catch back up with the lyrics.  Other than that, additional disc is kind of nice.  It does give a good little glimpse of the band and their goings-on.  If you are not really a Nu-metal fan or are expecting a repeat of their first album, then a couple of good songs and a bonus disc might not be worth your while.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I loved it! Who cares if you can't figure everything out. That's the whole point, unlike 90 percent of the [JUNK] that rakes in 100s of millions of dollars with formulaic plots and mediocre overpaid actors. This movie makes you think, something that seems to be in short supply these days. If you can't figure it out, too bad - you aren't supposed to, like all good art the interpretation is in the eyes of the viewer and anyone who thinks outside the box can come up with a lot of theories on what is really going on. It's definitely not for everyone, and I wasn't even a hard-core Lynch fan when I saw it. But I love noir, and I can watch this film again and again and not get bored. Yes, yes, there are references to Bergman, Fellini, Tarantino, among others, but the end result is one heck of a mind-trip. Don't bother to watch this if you are the type of viewer who has to have everything spoon-fed to you or are looking for super-famous actors a la Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise, it will be wasted on you - stick to films with formulaic plots like Titanic or MI2.
B00005LMBK|5.0|There are quite a few people out there that dismiss this album merely because it is popular and has a hit song that gets massive airplay.  Firstly, I am surprised that it is getting so much airplay in the US simply because &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; is more of a trip-hop song with a harmonica line than an N'Synch or Brittney song.  That isn't supposed to happen.  Secondly, there is so much experimentation and &quot;dirty&quot; producing (extreme reverb, bass turned up on most parts, hardly any treble), that it doesn't really fit into the ultra-perfect production standards of today's mass market, boys-on-a-leash type albums.  <br />I guess it is time to go into a bit about the album itself.  Well, there are 3 types of songs on this album.  The first kind is catchy, radio-friendly trip-hop with what seems to be harmonicas sliding in and out of the background.  The second is the experimental music, which isn't really poppy, more like dance music with repetitive vocal echoes scattering the background.  And the third type of song is the slow, moody peices that actually seem to show a correlation between depression and aggression (just listen to &quot;Gravity&quot;...the ultra-slow and moody depression jumps straight into a scratching, militant assault by the turn tables).  Every song on this album fits into one of those categories.  It is for that reason alone that people are so divided over this album, have different favorite songs, and are so captivated by the imaginary cartoon band.<br />Again, who cares if this album is mainstream, there is enough diversity on this album to keep anyone on their toes.  It is just hard to say if a person can take this much diversity without growing an extreme hatred for the Gorillaz.  Instead of basing your purchasing desicion on &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, pick random songs from around the album to preview first.  Who knows, maybe you should just be the singles you like.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is probably my favorite right now.  Amoung my favorite songs were: Sk8er Boi, Things I'll Never Say, Complicated, Mobile, and Anything But Ordinary.  ALl of the rest were almost as good, but i thought those were the best!  You should buy this cd if you like somebody like Michelle Branch, or even Pink.  I thought it was nice that she wrote all of the lyrics unlike so many other artists like Brittany Spears and people of that ssort.  This is the best cd, and worth every penny!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Of course its been said a million times....this film will never be understood by a great deal of people. Anyone going in expecting a normal movie will be banging there heads against the wall forever. But if you can take the time to fully except this film for what it is you get a great piece of film making. No one will catch it the first time around. So expect to watch at least twice to even get a little fraction of anything. I am not going to explain the storyline, too hard. But the characters are great, and many scenes in this film can be quite creepy. Even creepier than the &quot;demon&quot; could be the cowboy. Who knows. But all in all one of the best films of the year. Personally i found it even better than &quot;Memento&quot; but Christopher Nolan's work is also very good. But this DVD....horrible. Does not even have scene selections. Its just like a VHS with better picture quality. But still, see this film, many times.
0316666343|4.0|I have read many novels during my extended life on Earth; this one is good, almost perfect.  It is written with a unique style, a personal tone, and an intelligence that is refreshing.  I devoured this engrossing literary morsel in five days.  It's a page-turner of the best sort!
B00004SCX6|1.0|Yes, I thought Britney was a bit cute when she released her first album, but still not as cute as some of the girls I went to school with. But now she wants to grow up. Unfortunately, to her, \\"growing up\\" means wearing revealing clothes. I mean, she looks like those hookers that the police arrest during episodes of \\"Cops\\". But what's really important here is the music. After all, that's why you spend [money]for a CD. Sadly, in an attempt to become edgier in her music, the quality has taken a turn for the worse. The title track was virtually drilled into my head by radio stations playing it every ten minutes. \\"Stronger\\" is apparently her way of ending the innocence- but I prefer the old innocent Britney to the new, prostitutin' Britney. \\"Lucky\\" got kinda annoying after a while. Then we get into the ballads. Not one of them is worth listening to. Britney co- wote \\"Dear Diary\\" and by the sounds of it, she should let others do it... Among the writers for \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" is that untalented ... Shania Twain... This song reeks of cheesiness. It made me want to keel over. Take it from me, just because you liked Britney's first album doesn't mean you'll like this one, too. I didn't. And judging from her \\"Slave\\" single, her third album will feature a lot of synthesized vocals. What a shame. She used to be good.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is one of those bands that just makes you want to get up and start jumping around. Their music is a bit of a cross between blink-182 and Sum-41. If you are into any ype of punk rock/alternative then this would be an adrenaline filled cd to buy.
B00005YTFG|5.0|I was a little skeptical too when I saw the commercial. A movie musical with Nicole Kidman and the Star Wars guy? And yet, it turned out great! Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman actually have talent! Who would've thought? (Really, Ewan MacGregor should have taken up singing professionally. His voice could topple skyscrapers!) Though most of the songs here are just re-used, re-done pop hits, they fit the story very well. (\\"Your Song is the best! I rewind it about ten times whenever I watch this movie) The story is very unique. It manages to go from absolutely hilarious to tear-jerkingly serious. (If you don't cry at the end, you have no heart, and if you aren't rolling with laughter during the scene in Satine's elephant, you have no sense of humor) <br />In short, great story, great songs, great actors, great show! Hurray for truth, beauty, freedom, love, and above all things, penniless sitar players!
B000063S6Z|2.0|This doesn't sound like Moby, where did he go? I guess I was expecting something better than &quot;Play&quot;, but I assume those days are over. Here it is: short but sour... to mellow and slow. Oh well, at least Crystal Method released a new album.
B00003CXXP|2.0|It's not a bad movie, but i expected better. Osment is an awesome actor in this movie. I don't know if he won anything for it, but he deserves an award. The acting is good in the movie, but the movie isn't that good. You'll understand this movie if you have a basic knowledge of computers...i did, but i found this movie to be a lil boring. Although it makes you cry and feel alot for what the characters are going through in the movie.<br />My advice is to rent it first, then decide if you want to buy it. I bought it before i rented...
B00005JKQZ|5.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is suspenseful and thought provoking. Russell Crowe is probably the most versatile actor on the screen today. As the mathematician John Nash he's convincingly humble and over confident, paranoid and brilliant.  The movie centers on Nash's accomplishments and his schizophrenia.  The surreal effects and scenes make \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" more dramatic and cohesive than historically accurate, but as a film it succeeds in both informing and entertaining.  <br />\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is nearly three hours long, but well worth the time. You'll remember the scenes long after the film is over. It's one to discuss with friends.
0783230893|5.0|this is a story mainly about idgie and ruth.. a story about their friendship, and about the whistlestop cafe. it all starts with ninny.. an elderly lady who befriends evelyn.. an overweight lady who is expeirencing menopause. ninny explains the story about ruth and idgie, and how they ran the best cafe of all time..<BR>this movie will make you laugh, cry, and wish you had friends like all these wonderful charachters!
0316666343|5.0|If you read a lot of books, you probably spend a lot of time searching for one of those rare one-of-a-kind reading experiences that not only entertains, but teaches and moves you.  If that's the type of book you long for, 'The Lovely Bones' is the book for you.<br />Author Alice Sebold has taken a bold and unusual step:  The narrator of her story is a dead girl named Susie, who narrates the book from heaven.  Susie died after being abducted and violated by a neighbor, Mr. Harvey.  She has the unique vantage point of being able to look down from heaven and see how her death has affected her family, her friends, and her murderer.  <br />Her surviving parents, sister and brother are the primary focus of the book:  How they related to Susie, how they are trying to deal with her death, and how they are attempting to get on with their lives without her.  But it's much, much more.  Sebold has wonderful insights on relationships and writes in such a compelling way that you not only hurt for those left behind to deal with the tragedy, but also examine your own feelings about life, death, and the people you love.  This is a tremendous and beautifully written book.  The book has received many honors and deserves every one of them.  Read it and you'll know why too.
0060922583|5.0|An enormously interesting and provocative book. One that requires several readings, with each reading providing food for thought. The power of the human mind can reach into what we perceive as objective reality and affect our health, or in even more abstract terms, objective reality itself. This book touches on that and more. A handbook for the human mind/universe.
0446608955|5.0|I saw a Walk to Remember in theather. Then I went and bought the book. Little did I know that BOTH the book and the movie would make me cry. I'm 13 and it takes a lot for me to cry but this author. This is the first book I have read of Nicholas Spraks's but now I have read them all and they all pluck a heart string
B000002G7G|4.0|The Velvet Underground's self-titled third album is a dramtic departure from its two predecessors.  Restrained, spare and haunting, it contains a bevy of classics from a band that continues to have a huge influence more than three decades after calling it quits.  Artsist as diverse as R.E.M., The Feelies and Sparklehorse have either covered songs from this album or taken musical and lyrical samples from it.  It also contains some of band leader Lou Reed's best-ever songwriting.  The two quiet masterpieces are &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; and &quot;Jesus,&quot; the latter of the two even managing to be surprisingly spiritual.  Other highlights include the rocking &quot;What Goes On,&quot; &quot;Candy Says,&quot; and the (somewhat) hopeful &quot;Beginning to See the Light.&quot;  The only songs that don't work a the two overly arty experiments that conclude the album.<br />Overall, an understated classic that will stick in your memory long after it has finished playing.
B00005QIPH|1.0|This is POP music.  This is not Rock & Roll ... nor are they the saviours of the american music scene -- that is a hard burden to carry by anyone.  Truth --  They are rich kids.  Truth -- their songs sound unoriginal compared let's say to the White Stripes, The Warlocks or even Vax Wallo.  I am not a music snob -- I just call them like I see them.  <br />The american music scene is alive an well living in the underbelly of your cities.  Detroit, Chicago, L.A., NY Austin, Seattle .. but please don't give mumbo jumbo about this band.  The Strokes only accolade should be is that the true Musicians/artist will shine through the fog they emitted.<br />\\"A sucker is born every minute\\"
B000005IS1|5.0|The MC5 was the greatest rock &amp; roll band I ever saw!
0316666343|4.0|I didn't know much about this book when I started reading it and once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I cried, then laughed, then cried some more. I  think all of us would like for to be able to talk to someone that died..especially when they are murdered and the killer is unknown. I love the idea that heaven is different for everyone..that's very comforting.<BR>This book spoke to me on many levels..it is great.
0385505833|3.0|For anyone wanting a quick, fun book with few plot twists, this book is for you.  The idea of a middle aged couple completely ignoring all aspects of Christmas and how their friends and neighbors view their unusual plans is quite amusing.<br />Details of how the decision to &quot;skip&quot; Christmas affects the couple's daily lives are vivid, to the point that the average reader can relate to the sometimes overwhelming pressures of the holiday season that are described.<br />However, if you are a diehard Grisham fan, you may be surprised to find absolutely nothing in this book about lawyers, judges, investigators, embezzlement, or legal drama.  While that in no way takes away from the entertainment of this book, be aware that it is written in a very different style than what Grisham is famous for.  There aren't many plot twists or mysteries involved here, just the simple tale of one family's attempts to change their usual holiday habits.<br />Overall, &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; was a quick, fun read which would make a nice gift.
B00005JKBC|4.0|This is the kind of thriller movie for matured audience.  It is shot in the form of fast-paced MTV style and if you have watched Enemy of the State, then, you would know what you are in for.  I was glued to my couch from the beginning to the end, witnessing Redford's character, Muir tried to outsmart his colleagues (of CIA) to save his ex-protege, Bishop (Brad Pitt) in the nick of time.  USA didn't want to get involved to save Bishop from his scheduled execution due to a trade negotiation to be ensued between China & the States.  There were flashbacks to their heydays at Vietnam and Beirut & how the Bishop's female interest (Catherine McCormack) tied the whole thing together.  Some commented that the movie was too busy for their liking, but to be able to squeeze so much information & having character developments within 2 hours, it is not an easy feat.  A well-made movie and highly recommended.  One glitch is that the dialect spoken by the Chinese in the Suchow prison is Cantonese & in actuality, Cantonese is only spoken along the Sourthern Coast of China.  Rather, Suchownese speak ZheJiangnese, another form of dialect.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|There's a lot to like about this movie: the characters, the music, the unusual setting.  But there's a lot of magic in the story and the way the movie is shot.  Give this movie a chance, and you won't be disappointed.
B000000IIB|5.0|I found this in a used record (I still call them records...) store and took a chance on it.  It is Moby doing what he does best: mixing.<br />He takes the songs from Everything Is Wrong loosely and tightly weaves them into a joyful adventure.  Each CD establishes a different feel but they are both fluid and fantastic.<br />Imagine, one song flowing into the next, no silence between tracks, each song woven as a tapestry.  Moby where are you taking us?<br />I think this is Moby at his apex, just before he broke really big and his stuff was sampled everywhere you turned.  But Moby initially made it not by being the sample master but by being a DJ who knew how to mix records and really move the listener.  This, in my opinion, is the epitome of such a genre.<br />I have yet to tire of it.
6305014140|5.0|For anyone who enjoys explosive action without explosions, then this movie is for you. The movie slides forward contiuously in an effortless arc of great animation and story telling. Any armchair student of sword play will thoroughly enjoy this peice of anime. The central character is only that he ties the other characters together. He is the lead but the story is not necessarily about him. Which makes the wandering samurai story so interesting here. You start to really feel for this character because he responds to the plot as a character and not just a plot device. He is reminiscent of the Jedi (or is it the other way around). <br />The story turns back and forth between fantasy and adventure. The two often go together but all too aften the one lacks the other. Here they form a brilliant symbiosis that sometimes gets my blood pumping and sometimes scares me. It is art because it excites emotions from me. I don't simply lose my self in mindless action but there is reason for every loosing of the blade. It makes me feel. And it entertains.<BR>  <BR>It is not for everyone. There is sex. There is violence. The sex is cultural I believe in that the Japanese see sex in a much different light than we seem to. It seems that sex is a part of life. And in life there is sex, so if art imitates life then there is sex in art. The violence sereves the place that in animation if it isn't gory the point is missed. I entirely enjoyed this movie because I'm a fan of the genre. But I'm a fan because I saw this movie. But don't take my word for it!
B000001ES9|1.0|Yes the band did exist without Neal Pert but they had no reason to so. Getty Lee wails, Lifeson jams, no one cares. Stick to the well known albums, there is a reason these guys needed Pert.
B00006690G|5.0|I have owned and listened to over 1000 cds of all music types...This is simply the greatest cd ever recorded.  From beginning to end, this album is great.  Eminem's lyrics are awesome and what he says is real.  Don't just blow this album off because of the image Slim Shady has created.  His lyrics go deeper than the typical style of other rap.  Eminem is so awesome because he doesn't rap about the twenty-four inch rims on his Escalade and the hoes he pimps.  He expresses his opinions about real-life topics and this album really shows off his amazing talent.
B000068PQ0|4.0|&quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots&quot; continues in the same orchestrated fashion as &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; and &quot;Zaireeka&quot;.  Fans of those Flaming Lips albums will definitely love &quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots&quot;.  If you haven't heard much of the Flaming Lips - this album is a good album to start with.  Many people think the singers voice is kind of annoying (think of a psychedelic Neil Young) however it is the music that is of key importance with the Flaming Lips.
B00004Z459|5.0|Obviously I cannot say that everyone will like LP or this album,But how could they not? Please ignore anyone who doesnt like this cd or band untill you hear it AT LEAST three times through and through. This is not like Bizkit or Korn or Stained ect, ect. These modern musical geniuses balance metal, techno, rythem, rap, rock, and reality superbly. If anyone can recomend a band, group, duo, or solo (new or old) who has recorded such a concise and interesting collection, please write about them!!  All these songs have an uptempo-style beat,and yet they all retain individuality.I have been listening to this(among other things of course) on random/repeat for weeks, and plan to for weeks to come. And now for lyrical content. Wihtout ANY swearing (I mean not even a damn) the artists relate raw emotion and melancholic, honest experiences that I believe anyone can relate to. All with  maturity, and without wallowing in the self pity or indulging in the narcissistic rage so typical of the current mainstream diet of rap, metal, hardcore, and related 'hybrids'. This one lives up to its name. The cd is short (37:51), but if you like it, WHO CARES? That is what repeat is for. I will buy Reanimation on July 30th, and I hope the next new cd is soon to follow.
B000008H1W|5.0|After \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"War Child\\" were such huge successes, I was worried that Jethro Tull had, as Frank Zappa phrased it, gone commercial.  \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" corrected that notion.  \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" returns Tull to their original self-defined genre.<br />I always get a kick out of people trying to fit Jethro Tull into any particular type of music, because they are just plain not anything.  While they have elements of hard rock/metal, elements of pop, elements of progressive, elements of folk, elements of rennaisance, and even a bit of classical here and there, they are all of the above and none of the above.  They just are.<br />The opening track, \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\", begins with hammering and noises that make it sound as though the group is on a stage that is being prepared for a play.  The song then transitions into a bard-like minstrel song, and then takes off into a hard rock song.  An excellent opening song that sets you up for the things to come.<br />\\"Cold Wind to Valhalla\\" won't fool you.  There are some violins and flavor of folk/rennaisance, but at around 1 minute and 45 seconds into the song it switches into overdrive and you realize you are listening to a solidly rock song.  Excellent use of violins in this song to help the orchestration.  Hard to believe that violins can be a hard-rock instrument.<br />You hear classic Jethro Tull in the beginning of \\"Black Satin Dancer\\", then some hard rock riffs, and you suspect what will come next in this song.  And you would be right and wrong.  This song is a sensual song with allusions of sexual foreplay and intense longing, perhaps even lust.  Sometimes I felt some occasional elements of King Crimson, and then not.  The hard rock elements intertwine with classic Tull and some occasional progressive flashes.  A most excellent song.<br />Then you are lulled by the melancholy strains of \\"Requiem\\", as Ian Anderson and company sound more like Kansas or Simon and Garfunkel, and yet, the sound is still Tull.  This song is meant to be listened to for the feel, and not for the words.<br />Then, as you move into \\"One White Duck/0^10 = Nothing at All\\" you realize that \\"Requiem\\" was a perfect transition between \\"Black Satin Dancer\\" and this song.  I love this song, because it seems to have meaning, and seems to have no meaning, and you hover on the edge of understanding without understanding, though you think you should, and could, if you could listen a little longer and read the lyrics just one more time.  But this song is, of course, classic Tull, and the lyrics do mean something, but they are art, and art is for the interpretation of the listener.  Don't make too much of this song, and don't make too little.  Just listen and love it.<br />Then, off to signature Tull, the extended, intertwined story-song, \\"Baker St. Muse\\".  Here you have an intro about a muse, a very down-to-earth fellow crying out that Jethro Tull wasn't the commercial group that \\"War Child\\" seemed to make them out to be.  We are in the gutter like we always were, singing about the things that haven't changed, and so on to the next part of our story...<br />The other songs are stories of the street, likely stories of the Baker St. Muse (aka Jethro Tull).  These songs are very sexual.  Today they might even get a warning label, even though there is no use of the crude words which seem so popular.  There is no need, the point is well made without resorting to a limited, non-descriptive vocabulary.  This group of songs finish with \\"Mother England Reverie\\", which is a protestation that the singer is just a street player, a muse, and he'll never be anything but.<br />The CD finishes with a wrap-up song, \\"Grace\\", which is a marvelous little epilogue that not only finishes the CD, but also asks a simple, but layered question, \\"Hello breakfast.  May I buy you again tomorrow?\\"  In the context of the CD the question more likely means, can we be here tomorrow, can we still do what we are doing?  And perhaps, in consideration of the other songs, will anyone care.<br />Sometimes I think of the songs, coming after the nearly-pop success of \\"Warchild\\", as being an apology for straying from the princples of Jethro Tull's music and style.  Perhaps I'm wrong.  Perhaps not.  Regardless, listening to the seven albums before Warchild, and then \\"Warchild\\", and then \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\", you realize that \\"Warchild\\" was not Tull's usual music, and \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" put them squarely back where they once were.<br />Jethro Tull has never been everyman's group.  Never will.  They occupy a unique place in modern music that will likely never be defined.  This CD is solidly at the heart of the kind of music Jethro Tull is known for making.  It is among the best of Jethro Tull.aps, in consideration of the other songs, will anyone care.<br />Sometimes I think of the songs, coming after the nearly-pop success of \\"Warchild\\", as being an apology for straying from the princples of Jethro Tull's music and style.

B00005QDW1|2.0|Their lastest effort &quot;Rock Steady&quot; by No Doubt is terrible.  I bought this Cd thinking it would be great because it was by No Doubt but it turned out to be the worst CD I have heard in years. &quot;Hey Baby&quot; has to be the most annoying song, every time I hear it on the radio I cringe.  The next song &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is irritating.  I didn't think No Doubt would ever do an album like this, well I guess I was wrong.  I don't recommend this bad album.
B00000IQC8|1.0|This &quot;movie&quot; is hailed as a great low budget film and Kevin smith had a nice budget.  Technically it is horrible and there is no story.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is back and he is better than ever.  Most of the songs are better than his previous album and what I like best about him is that he can make fun of himself and not take himself to seriously.  After the hugely successful album The Marshall Mathers LP selling 8 million copies, this album released debuts at number 1 because people were waiting for another release from him.  This album is recommended but not for children.
B000002504|3.0|To me, Octopus is to Gentle Giant's catalog what Ummagumma is to Pink Floyd's catalog...a wonderfully strange recording that only occasionally makes its way to my player.<br />Now this is not to say that Octopus is bad, on the contrary it is a very good record which features astoundingly complex arrangements and supurb musicianship.  GG is well known in progressive circles as being one of the more difficult bands to get into, as opposed to  Yes, Genesis, or Camel.  I won't go into details of the band or songs as other reviewers have...however, I cannot agree with reviewers that say this is GG's masterpiece (I think Freehand takes that spot).  <br />For the new Gentle Giant listener, this is definately the wrong place to start because of the complexity of the music--unless you are used to listening to complex music...start first with Freehand or Three Friends.  Also, Octopus is not a casual listen, hence the comparison to Ummagumma.  When I go to my collection to pull out a GG disk to stick in the car stereo, most of the time it is something other than Octopus (or Ummagumma).  If I have the time and inclination to listen to something more complex, I pull out Octopus.<br />In a nutshell, a great recording from a legendary band, but not their best.  3-1/2 stars: a five star performance, but knocked down because it is less accessable (and not as listener friendly) as other GG releases.<br />As I see it:<BR>5-Stars: If you love the complexities of Gentle Giant, or complex music as a whole...i.e., Univers Zero, Amazing Blondel, King Crimson, et al.<br />4-Stars:  If you like complex music, progressive music, and have heard other GG releases.<br />3-Stars:  If you like progressive music, but are unfamiliar with Gentle Giant...start first with Freehand or Three Friends.<br />2-Stars:  If you are new to progressive rock (listen to the other giants first: Genesis, Yes, Camel.<br />1-Star:  If you avoid progressive rock.
B000066I6N|5.0|Well, Ladies and Gentlemen - It has finally arrived. A Plant post-Zeppelin recording that truly shines. Every song on this disk is good, folks! Although Plant wrote (or assisted with writing) only four of the ten songs, it is a worthy musical performance. The remake of Hey Joe is a total surprise, but very well done. If you are a fan of Robert Plant, this is the one you have been waiting for. Trust me.
B000000993|4.0|Wow.  From the bizarre album art, to the polished studio mixing, to the awesome vocals, to a little mind-fricking at the end, Undertow is the first truly great Tool album.  All three instruments (Carey's drums, D'Amour's bass, and Jones' underrated guitar) more than hold up their parts of the music, working together while remaining individuals.  Listening to the basslines on this album, it's hard to believe how well Justin Chancellor was able to integrate himself into the band.  Maynard also undoubtedly adds of fourth instrument with his voice.  <br />Every song tells a story, and while they may not be as connected lyrically as they are on Lateralus, you can definitely find a running theme or two if you look and listen.<br />I would second what Lord Chimp said about reading along with the lyrics, however I would recommend doing so after listening through the album once or twice.  Hear how the band members interact, hear the nuances in the music, then find out what the hell Maynard's singing.
B00000J7A2|5.0|What an unbelievable talent the Captain is. His musical and<BR>vocal ranges give me chills every time I pop in the CD; from<BR>the weird acid soaked blues ditty &quot;Electricity&quot; to the <BR>raucous R&amp;B of &quot;Zig Zag Wanderor,&quot; &quot;Call on Me&quot; and<BR>&quot;Plastic Factory&quot; to the heartfelt soul of &quot;Where There's <BR>Woman&quot; and &quot;Autumn Child&quot; to the psychedelic boogie of<BR>&quot;Drop Out Boogie&quot; to the straight delta blues of &quot;Grown<BR>so Ugly.&quot; His eccentricity and eclecticism would result<BR>in the imfamous &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; only two years <BR>later.
B00000099Y|5.0|I have trouble classifying Tool as a &quot;metal&quot; band, especially after this album.  From the vocals (Maynard's voice is fragile, strong, imploring, and beautiful all at once, and alone is worth the price of the album), to the guitar (a less is more philosophy that works amazingly well), to the lyrics (oh yes, the lyrics), it's both Floydian and &quot;Radioheadian&quot; in complexity and beauty.  All the songs are great, although I can see how the &quot;slow build, fever pitch, stop in the middle, start up again, fervent finish&quot; formula can grate on some people because it makes the songs so long, but, to me, it only adds to the music and allows the band to build to a clear destination.<br />If you don't know anything about the &quot;interludes&quot; before hearing the album they will either disturb you, confuse you, annoy you, or do some combination of the three.  If you listen to vinyl, know German, or look for the answers, eventually you will understand the jokes.
0393320928|5.0|Here is another book of wonderful biographical anecdotes of one of the most intriguing scientists who has ever lived.  However, those who are looking for merely a continuing edition of the tremendously popular (not to mention hilarious!) SURELY YOU'RE JOKING MR. FEYNMAN should take note:  this present work does not qualify as that.<br />To be sure, there are a handful of chapters which would fit right into SYJMF.  However, 2 major sections cover some exceptionally serious topics which are hardly material for Feynman's typical humor.  One section details his love for his first wife as well as her untimely terminal illness.  The other covers his work on the commission to disinter the technical problems that led to the explosion of the Space Shuttle CHALLENGER in 1986.  These major sections encompass roughly 3/4 of the book.<br />The chapter on his wife's suffering is especially poignant and touched me very deeply.  Feynman was a man whose love and compassion matched his intellect.  I could not but feel empathy and admiration for the way he took care of his bride, knowing all along that she would not live long.  His decision to be straight with her about her condition, instead of feeding her some fairy-tale story about how she had a good chance of recovery, was both painful and edifying to read.<br />The section on the CHALLENGER goes into great detail on everything that went wrong that fateful day in '86 as the nation watched the disaster on TV.  To this day, I have not seen a television documentary cover this story as I think it should be covered.<br />I recently saw a special on the CHALLENGER on the DISCOVERY channel.  It did an excellent job of focusing on how the engineers at THIOKOL were screaming at NASA not to launch, well into the wee hours of the morning of the catastrophe.  However, what the special omitted was the cover-up and closing-of-ranks that NASA did AFTER the accident.  To me, NASA's behavior after the fact was even more reprehensible than its carelessness before the launch.<br />It was for the reason of politics that then-president Ronald Reagan personally requested that Feynman be on-board the investigation committee [a committee that also included the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride, among others].  Reagan knew that Feynman would get to the bottom of the matter (which he did) and that Feynman did not care for the politics of making NASA \\"look good\\" (which he didn't).<br />With this in mind, even people who are not interested in Richard Feynman, but are curious about what happened to the CHALLENGER would gain much by reading this book.  Feynman explains his thorough, logical methodology and how it rubbed many people the wrong way.  His straight-forward and honest disclosures of NASA's gerrymandering created much animosity between himself and NASA exec William Rogers (who, it seems, was more interested in NASA's image than getting to the heart of the matter).  For those who are interested in further reading on the CHALLENGER topic, I would recommend NO ORDINARY GENIUS:  THE ILLUSTRATED FEYNMAN ...<br />For Feynman enthusiasts, this book is vintage Feynman - a can't miss.  As a bonus, the center of the book has photographs from his life, as well as some of his sketches.  The book is equally recommended for people who wonder about what \\"really\\" happened to the CHALLENGER, and why it happened.  NASA aficionados may be disappointed in the work as it exposes (truthfully) all of the fudge-factors, apathy for safety issues and faulty reasoning NASA used with the efficacy of launching CHALLENGER on time and preserving its positive image after the fact.carelessness before the launch.<br />It was for the reason of politics that then-president Ronald Reagan personally requested that Feynman be on-board the investigation committee [a committee that also included the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride, among others].

B000002MIB|5.0|It's lacking the amazing quility that only David Lee Roth could bring to band, and although sammy is fairly good, i'd like to see a live album with DLR on it.  It would bring back the classics like hot for teacher, panama ( although it is on this cd sammy's version isn't as good),runnin with the devil, you really got me, jamie's cryin', unchained, and the forgetable (yet fairly entertaning) happy trails and many, many more. Even though it's a better cd then most new bands will ever release in there 15 minute career, i suggest buying the first six Van Halen albums, and crank them up LOUD!
B00003CXXP|1.0|Once I start watching a movie, I cannot stop, no matter how much I hate it. I wish this was not so because I really wanted to stop watching this movie after a half hour.  Now I'm a pretty big Kubrick and Spielburg fan. But this movie made me feel like I was dying slowly.  <br />The story has an interesting premise to it.  But the cinematography and acting is so disturbing that after awhile the movie just becomes painful to watch.  The movie really feels like two movies in one and the point in which the directing duties changed from Kubrick to Spielburg are so obvious.  The camera angles and special effects change as if someone had just snapped their fingers. <br />I major complaint is that the movie is just sooooo long. I don't know why Spielburg kept running with the plot but it just keeps going. The entire end of the movie is completely unnecessary and really contrasts with the main body of the story.  Just drags on with no end in sight.<br />If you want a very different movie to watch or something that gives you the creeps, then by all means, give AI a shot. But if you're like me, and I consider myself to have wide variety of tastes, you're going to kick yourself for spending the time to watch the movie, unless you're not like me and you just turn it off.  Good luck in any case.
B00000HZFH|5.0|This band is awsome!...  Almost all of their songs have meaning.  Its worth listening to.  Also, if you see the Strokes or White Stripes as a similiar artist when ever looking for a cd, it is wrong.  Those bands have nothing to do with these good bands, like Modest Mouse or Built to Spill!...
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down is no kids movie.  I would even hesitate to call it an action movie because it really is more of a historical drama.  The scariest thing that goes through my mind when I watch this movie is that these events really happened in all their gruesome, vivid imagery, and the director does not try to spare you from the horrors of the events in Somalia.  Much like Saving Private Ryan, you are along for the ride into the Hell which those Army Rangers found themselves engulfed in.<br />The acting is for the most part pretty good. The action is brutal and there is one scene in particular that can really gross you out.  But the movie needs scenes like that to really help you understand what the fighting in Somalia was all about.  The movie is tragic and uplifting at the same time.  I actually liked the movie a little better than the book (though the book was very good) just because the movie imparts a little more emotion than the book.  Just be careful when you watch this movie. You'll need a steady stomach for violence and gore.
B0000026DJ|5.0|It is hard for me to contain my enthusiasm about this album, and like many of my favorites, this one both pleases and irks me. The music is strong stuff - potent, passionate rock with insistent, driving hooks and rhythms that you cannot keep still to. Then there are the lyrical hooks - left hooks, and since this is a political album, I'll do the Oils justice by commenting on that aspect first. <br />Most of the political content is local to Australia (\\"Beds Are Burning\\", \\"The Dead Heart\\"), so it is hard for an American to comment intelligently, except to note the familiar whiff of \\"white guilt\\". There was a time in our own history when it was useful to air such feelings, and the 80s may have been such a time in Australia, but no matter how serious the issues are, there is something quaint-sounding about it. I doubt Australia could give the continent \\"back\\" to the Aborigines, as \\"Beds Are Burning\\" seems to suggest, any more than America could to the Native Americans. The other political theme is paranoia concerning the cold war that, even at the time this album was released, was entering its end-game in our favor. The pervasive fears voiced in \\"Put Down That Weapon\\" were more appropriate to the early 80s, and reflect the helplessness that Australia and Europe shared during those extremely dangerous times, as it was America's war to fight and win, not theirs. Still, the message of \\"Put Down That Weapon\\" is relevant today, as we may face new and more monstrous purveyors of weapons of mass destruction. \\"If the sea goes boiling black, can you tell me what you'll do about that?\\" I may come from a different part of the political spectrum, but that song still gives me cold chills. <br />Musically, there are five songs of such overwhelming power it is astounding to find them on a single album, and each is worth some detailed description. (The famed \\"Beds Are Burning\\" is not one of them.) \\"Put Down That Weapon\\", in addition to its chilling message, is a tightly wound slow-rocker that builds in the end to a climax so gorgeous it can almost make you cry as Peter Garrett sings \\"You must be CRAZY, if you think you're strong\\". \\"Dream World\\" is so pumped-up rocking, it will plaster a smile on your face - this is the kind of energy rock 'n roll is supposed to produce, and rarely does anymore. \\"The Dead Heart\\" is brilliant. Set to a theme of \\"Do-do-do-do, do-do-do\\" it starts like it could be a Beach Boys spoof, then morphs into Peter's tantrum against \\"mining companies and uranium companies\\", then morphs again into a sweet horn and string arrangement at the conclusion, all without missing a beat. \\"Bullroarer\\" uses the slowed-down sound of a helicopter propeller as percussion - fantastic! - and what a rocker this one is, with great outback imagery that is worth quoting: \\"In the desert in the dry - sun sits so high - long day's mile and the radio crackles and the bones bleached white. It's a knock 'em down storm - see the tin roof shake - wild dog howls and the long grass whistles and the tall trees break.\\" - It's better than a movie. The last of my five favorites is \\"Sell My Soul\\" - just try not to tap your foot to this one. The musical credits list only guitars, but what kind of guitar is that on the superb solo - some kind of baritone banjo? This song rocks its socks off.<br />Don't be dissuaded by the less than ideal selection of these songs that you may sample here on Amazon.com. This is one of the very best rock albums of the 1980s.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|What can I say about this movie? Shrek is highly original while spoofing several fairy tales and intermixing a lot of modern day jokes into the fairy tale background.  The story line is very fluid and almost seems to fly by too quickly.  Each of the main characters is extremely funny and they all interact well with each other.  I loved this movie from the start and never grow tired of watching it.  <br />My favorite special feature to the dvd is the Shrek Karoake Dance Party. It's very very funny and kids and adults would both love it.  The character interviews however are very contrived and boring. After watching them once, you probably won't want to see them again.
B00000IL1K|1.0|This CD struck me as a bizzare and pretentious mishmash. It moves so slowly and in so many different directions that you will probably be disappointed no matter what sort of music you enjoy. Sorry. Just one person's opinion, but a sincere one.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I found the movie breath taking and I was on the edge of my seat all the way through. I wouldn't recomend it for children 12 and under because of the blood and Gore.
B000002B7M|5.0|This album is awsome! The best songs are I Don't Know, Crazy Train, Goodbye To Romance, Suicide Solution, Mr. Crowley, No Bone Movies. I recomend this cd to anybody. It'll be worth your money!
B000063V8R|4.0|In my opinion, Star Trek: The Next Generation during its third season, was at its very best.  Episode after episode of this season are absolutely superb, the stories, the acting, and the visual effects, which really plays only a small part in the sucess of the third season as a method of helping to tell some incredibly good stories.<br />My favorite episodes of this third season DVD set are The Enemy, Booby Trap, The Hunted, The High Ground, Yesterday's Enterprise, Transfigurations, and the season end cliffhanger, The Best Of Both Worlds.  The other episodes that I didn't mention, are episodes of superior quality, and are well worth watching.<br />There are some behind the scenes documentaries on the last disc for this set, but I feel that more could have been done by having a behind the scenes commentary track for at least some of the episodes.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth is a classic. A very memorable movie from back in the day. I remember watching it when I was younger ... and feeling like I was looking into another dimension. Lots of imagination involved with this movie. Still, when I watch it today it seems even better than ever. The DVD is great, and it brings back so many memories. It's interesting to watch it again after so many years. It is very fantasy-like, which I loved, it's almost like a dream. Kind of reminds me of 'Return to Oz.' Sarah (Jennifer Connely: Requiem for a Dream, A Beautiful Mind) is a spoiled, selfish girl at the start of the movie, but by the end of it she becomes much more mature. It's a funny, suspenseful, interesting movie, but most of all it's ... timeless. This is a great movie for anyone, anytime, anywhere. *You have no power over me.* It's definitely an adventure you'll never soon forget!
0553288105|5.0|Asimov is great because he combines science and stories in a perfect mix. His characters are memorable and human. His science, right. <br />The three parts of the book are really enjoyable. The second part was my favorite, set in another universe with a different kind of intelligent life. The first and the last were full of human nature.<br />This book reminded me a little about Asimov's \\"Nemesis\\", because of character development. Something I like in both these books is that there is not really an evil one: There are people, with weaknesses and strengths, and so the scenarios looks very pausible.<br />That's what makes Asimov a SF master.
0440178002|5.0|This is quite possibly the best book I've ever read.  You follow Blackthorne into Japan where you not only learn about Japanese culture and tradition, but you are witness to adventure, romance, war strategy, honor, and loyalty.  I read The Godfather right before I read Shogun, and I found that there are many similarities as far as power, control, fear are concerned.  One might think of the hierarchy in Japan as a mafia of sorts, in that they both have a &quot;Godfather&quot; or a &quot;Shogun&quot; that people fear and respect.  Many interesting parrallels between the books.  Shogun is far better though.  The first 300 pages may be a little difficult for some people to read because Clavell is just setting up the characters and the setting, but once you get past that, you will not want to put the book down.
B00005KB9X|5.0|\\"Natty Dread\\" was the first album of the revamped Bob Marley and the Wailers following the departure of foundation Wailers Peter Tosh and Bunny \\"Wailer\\" Livingston. It is also to my mind the best of the Wailers albums (although to be fair I haven't heard all of \\"Exodus\\") but while Marley would go on to write classic songs like \\"Jammin'\\", \\"Waiting in Vain\\" and \\"Redemption Song\\", I don't think any of his subsequent albums equal this- they're good but just a bit too polished and slick. This reggae, on the other hand, rocks hard, especially on \\"Them Belly Full (But We Hungry); \\"Talking Blues\\", \\"Rebel Music\\", \\"So Jah Seh\\", \\"Revolution\\", and the cover tune. The album kicks off in style with a glorious remake of the 1971 Wailers hit (in Jamaica) \\"Lively Up Yourself\\", and also includes a fine remake of their 1966 song \\"Bend Down Low\\". And, of course, this album also has the touching \\"No Woman No Cry\\", although I prefer the live version that appears on \\"Legend\\".
0790738074|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST MUSICALS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. ROBERT PRESTON IS GREAT AS HAROLD HILL. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B000002AGN|5.0|In 1960, the Dave Brubeck Quartet (Dave Brubeck on piano, Paul Desmond on alto sax, Eugene Wright on bass, and Joe Morello on drums) released the classic &quot;Time Out&quot; album.  This album consists of experimentations with odd time signatures, and it results in one of the best and most unique jazz albums ever made.  The whole album is amazing, but I think the first three tracks are the best.<BR>&quot;Blue Rondo A La Turk&quot; kicks off the album with a pulsating 9/8 melody.  It builds in intensity and then all of a sudden explodes into a 4/4 F blues as Paul Desmond solos with his cool alto tone.  Following Desmond, Brubeck adds his own highly memorable solo.  It's bluesy and cool at first, then he adds his trademark block chords to end the solo.<BR>&quot;Strange Meadow Lark&quot; is a beautiful track.  Brubeck plays the melody solo on piano, and his playing of this song is like a dream.  The rest of the band kicks in for Desmond's solo which seems to breeze by; it compliments the beauty of this song well.  Brubeck follows and adds his own memorable solo as the song returns to Brubeck playing solo piano.<BR>&quot;Take Five&quot;, the third track, is the Quartet's most famous song, as it was the first jazz instrumental to reach number one.  It is in 5/4 time, and Brubeck strictly plays a constant vamp so the rest of the band doesn't lose their place while soloing.  Desmond plays the cool, soothing melody and solos well, but the standout solo here is drummer Joe Morello's.  I believe Morello is one of the best jazz drummers of all time, and while he does better solos than the one on &quot;Take Five&quot;, his &quot;Take Five&quot; solo is awesome, as he manages to keep in 5/4 time and still deliver a superb drum solo.<BR>The rest of the album seems to go downhill from these three tracks, but still remains a superb album.  &quot;Three To Get Ready&quot; is one of the most interesting songs Brubeck ever made.  Its metric pattern is:  2 meters of 3/4, 2 meters of 4/4.  Brubeck and Desmond alternate playing the melody while the other one solos, and it is very interesting to see the two interact with each other. <BR>Both &quot;Kathy's Waltz&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Jumpin'&quot; feature impressive solos and catchy melodies, but &quot;Pick Up Sticks&quot; is an awesome melody and a Hell of a way to finish off one of the best jazz albums I have heard.  Brubeck plays a rivetting solo after Desmond's cool floating alto sax solo. <BR>This album is an experimentation with odd time signatures, and the results were superb.  And the amazing thing is that the Dave Brubeck Quartet swingings just as naturally with 3/4 or 5/4 or 9/8 as jazz musicians do with 4/4 or 6/8.  The experimentation and originality of this album make it essential for all jazz fans.  It seal Brubeck's place in jazz history and laid the groundwork that the Quartet would use to develop even more amazing solos.  Indeed, the Quartet was just beginning to entertain.
B00005A0N5|5.0|I'm a lot more into alt rock than into metal. Actually, I couldn't stand power metal a few days ago. Just industrial metal or anything strange enough would make me pay atention to metal, after I finished my &quot;Iron Maiden Period&quot;. But I love female singers/vocalists. Well, Nightwish, my friends said, has the best female vocalist EVER! So,, I decided to give it a try<br />Well, I tried some other power metal bands before. Hellowen, Stratovarius, Gamma ray, all that sounded silly and repetitive to me. BORING! I thought Nightwish, with or without a great vocalist, was sentenced to have the same sound of that bands. I was wrong. Hopefully wrong.<br />Try to understand, I listen to other genres of music. I love bands like Tool, Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails. &quot;So, what is this guy doing here, writing a review about a Nightwith's album?&quot; This guy is telling here that Nightwish is so diferent and good that made him, someone out of the metal style, enjoy it a lot. Wow! I think it's a great thing.<br />I have this one, Oceanborn, Wishmaster and their latest, Century Child. I bought these three together and Oceanborn is the one I listened first. It's wonderfull. Well, the power metal parts are the worst for me, but the album has a nice change of pace and intruments. Diferent melodies, a flute, well, some interesting things. And Tarja is really amazing.<br />Best Tracks: Sacrament Of Wilderness, Swanheart, The Ridller. But the whole album is amazing.<BR>The cover is cool, the value is all right. I give this album 5 stars because I see that they made something diferent in power metal style. I don't think it's one of the best albums I own, but for sure I'll listen to it a lot. I just think they deserve 5 stars because this album was able to make me like something in the power metal scene
0316666343|4.0|When I finished &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; I sat back and admitted that I loved the idea of the book, not only the book itself.  If it's a unique experience, this is the book for you.  However, I also had to admit that I expected a little bit more and I expected a little bit more of an ending.  The story travels along perfectly and then suddenly, everything comes together in the end too nicely.  Some people love endings like those.  If you're that person, this is your book.  However, it loses some reality.  Granted, a murdered girl telling this story is not all that realistic.  But still, this book implants ideas in your mind about not only your own mortality, but also the afterlife.  Is Susie telling us what to expect or just telling us about her Heaven?  It's just something to think about I suppose.  So basically, it's only fault is an unrealistic too happy ending.  Other than that, this is a fascinating read especially for summer.
0609610570|5.0|Many make the crucial mistake of thinking that creative thinking ends once a decision is made. As this book makes convincingly clear, creativity must continue unabated during the execution phase of any management process. When problems occur, as inevitably they do, and we must ask ourselves \\"Why Didn't I Think of That?\\" -- solutions must be found, and often those solutions must be far more creative than the original thinking that got you into the predicament where you now find yourself. Reading Larry Bossidy's new book, along with books such as \\"Why Didn't I Think of That? - Think the Unthinkable and Achieve Creative Greatness\\" will give you both the tools and inspiration needed to master the toughest problems you may encounter when executing your most important decisions.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill's debut album is just full of indescribable talent. I love this CD. It is one of my favorite purchases, with beautiful melodies, touching lyrics, and is just so heartfelt. I could listen to this CD from start to finish every day. A lot of these songs have had significant radio airplay, but in fact my favorite ones aren't those which necessarily broke into the top 40. Ex-Factor (track 3) is one of the best songs on this CD, it's about relationships, and you can just feel what Lauryn Hill is talking about. I Used to Love Him, a great duet with Mary J. Blige brings a sense of strong feminine self-empowerment. This album is just pure Lauryn. You see the depth of her, her feelings, and it's not pretentious in any way. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (track 14) just says it all....Then of course there are the hidden tracks, Can't Take My Eyes off of You, and Untitled. I can't go on enough about this CD.
B00000JPHF|4.0|Although it does not pack the punch today that it did back in 1931, Frankenstein is a true horror classic that any real horror fan will appreciate.  It is one of the rare films in this genre to cross the border seamlessly into popular mainstream culture.  Of course, much of the credit must go to Mary Shelley, and it is rather unfortunate that the movie that defines Frankenstein to the masses possesses little of the essence of the original story.  In the movie, the story is that of the monster first and foremost, and his creator is portrayed as a genius who conducted his experiments in some sort of lunatic phase.  The depth of both man and monster and their complex interrelationship is much deeper in the original tale, which revolves around Dr. Frankenstein, for whom the book was named (the monster, as everyone should know already, is never given a name).  One can't blame the movie makers for ignoring the human drama of the original story because what sells is Boris Karloff as the grotesque fiend bent on revenge and murder.  I am so glad to see the scene with the girl at the lake included here, although it almost seems out of place--it is here (and no where else in the movie) that the monster betrays his humanity, which makes the death of the innocent young girl doubly tragic--had the humanity theme been developed more fully (and there was time for it since the movie only runs 71 minutes), this could have been a much more powerful, even more memorable film.  Early audiences did not get to see the lake scene, and I can't imagine the movie without it because it is still a pivotal moment with important repercussions in the movie's concluding moments.<br />The movie actually begins with a dapper fellow warning audience members that what they are about to see may shock and horrify them; I love that introduction, even though it seems quaint by today's standards.  Colin Clive is terrific as young Dr. Frankenstein, particularly in the scene in which the monster is brought to life before the horrified eyes of the doctor's fianc&eacute;e, mentor, and friend.  Who hasn't seen clips of the \\"It's alive!  It's alive!\\" scene at some point in their lives?  Boris Karloff is fantastic as well, even though all he has to do is stumble around and make growling noises every so often; truth be told, it is costume designer Jack Pierce even more so than Karloff who really brings the archetypal Frankenstein's monster to life .  It is Frederick Kerr as Baron Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein's father, however, who steals the show in my eyes.  I found him to be delightful and hilarious, complaining much of the time about his son's behavior and the bother of being the most important man in the village.  His trip to his son's laboratory, particularly his climb up the staircase, is extremely funny.<br />Along with Dracula, this movie is one of the most famous horror movies ever made, but I would not call it one of the genre's greatest.  Had Boris Karloff not played the monster (and thank heavens Bela Lugosi declined the role originally), it may not have been nearly as successful.  Those unfamiliar with Shelley's novel probably enjoy Frankenstein more than I do.  The whole \\"playing God\\" theme is minimized in the movie, as is the treatment of the monster as a victim rather than a mere brute.  One can't argue too much with success, however.  Nor can Frankenstein's seminal influence be doubted; from the early grave-robbing scene to the later shots of torch-bearing villagers pursuing the monster, Frankenstein has served as a veritable horror movie template for countless films through the years.life before the horrified eyes of the doctor's fiancée, mentor, and friend.

B00005B36H|4.0|I love Lateralus, I find it very enjoyable to listen to. I like almost every song. But as far as it being &quot;a work of art&quot;, or a &quot;masterpiece&quot;... that is a pretty ballsy statement. &quot;Masterpiece&quot; is a strong word, and this is definently no masterpiece. Just because almost every song is incredibly long doesn't make this a masterpiece. In fact, most of the songs are very repetitive and they just keep going and going and going. However, this is still a great album and I like it alot. It's relaxing to the ears (in a rock way). But the songs really DO NOT need to be that long, but [most] are quite good nonetheless.<br />Lateralus is not for everyone. It's very different from Tool's past albums. This cd is NOT for the impatient. But if your willing to give it a chance, I recommend listening to these songs first: &quot;Schism&quot;, &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;Parabola&quot;. and &quot;Ticks and leeches&quot;.<br />My personal favorite songs are &quot;Schism&quot; and &quot;Disposition&quot;, which are very beautiful, consistent and relaxing songs. <br />The verdict? Lateralus gets a 4/5, it would get a 5 if many of the songs were not so over-done. But if you can give this cd a chance, then sit down and start listening... I guarantee you will love this album some way or another.
B00004Z459|5.0|Ok...we all heard everyone's review for Hybrid Theory from it being pitiful to being widely acclaimed, but all in all, it's an impressive cd! The name \\"Hybrid Theory\\" pretty much sums up LP's genre and style of music.With an influx of different styles and influences of music varying from the Deftones, Stone-Temple Pilots,Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, and NiN, the end result is a well-crafted and wonderful album filled with sounds of electronic, rock, rap, alterantive, nu-metal, and some emo here and there. Basically sounds to please everyone's taste. Then of course there is The Incredible Mr.Hahn, the DJ of LP. His masterful blend of beats, sampling, and scratching intertwine perfectly with Chester's astonishing voice, which can go from screaming to singing melancholy in a split-second, has made him one of the most well-respected artists of this century. As well as, Mike Shinoda's Emceeing, whom has a in-your-face, fast-paced, throwing lyrics in a heartbeat, rapping just keep making the band better. I didn't like Linkin Park when I first heard their first single \\"One Step Closer\\"... i felt, in my taste in music at the time, was a bit unwavering. But then, a song known as \\"Crawling\\" was released, this totally changed my perspective of the band. Showing me that they are not just a hard-core rock band, but a band that is not afraid to show a softer, more deeper side of emotion. The lyrics to that song are extremely powerful and you can feel the emotion that Chester sings in that song. Thusly, this lead me into temptation to buy the cd. When I finished the entire cd for the first time, I was not impressed, of course I didn't have the appreciation of the rock sound of rock just yet. But after constantly listening to the 12-track album, I came to a conclusion that it was an album and a band destined for stardom. The lyrics, the sound, the meaning of it all totally changed my respect towards the band. Hybrid Theory shows the true dedication and how hard-working the band is towards their music. Therefore, Linkin Park is a band that revolutionized the rock/rap genre because of it's own unique sound. They're rookie cd is collaboration of great songs that will go down as one of the best and must-have albums of all time and their second cd will be much-anticipated. Unfortunately, their second album (not the remix album), will most likely not live up to the expectations of the critics and fans, for Hybrid Theory gained fame too fast in too little time. I just wanna say thank you very much to main-stream radio and MTV for totally demolishing LP's chances for a true fan-ship base. But the true Linkin Park fans, like me, will appreciate any thing LP does with music, for we are the only ones of truely understand them.<BR>HYBRID THEORY:<BR>1.Papercut: 7/10- fisrt song i wasnt crazy about, but afterwards it gets better, song about a complexed insanity that i can't make out<BR>2.One Step Closer-8/10- basically their first single and i wasnt very fond of it but after constant listening it catches on. Song about needing to be left alone every once in a while.<BR>3.With You-10/10 One My favorite songs- about the hoping of keeping a stable relationship with their loved one, and wishing that they will never let go, and that they will always keep the memories that they left behind with them<BR>4.Points of Authority-6/10-least favorite track on the cd but a catchy chorus. the meaning is unclear to me, i believe is something to do with being able to control somebody or somebody controling him, or someone about to take advantage of a him because he is weaker.(hence) \\"Forfeit the game b4 somebody takes u out of the frame\\"<BR>5.Crawling-9/10- song hardest to ignore, catchiest chorus on the album- about  suffering Chester had thru his life and how it affects him.\\"these wounds they will not heal\\"<BR>6.Runaway-8/10- another good song- Chester's voice is very melancholy in this track... song about some self-doubt, and problems that conflict with his life. How people made choices for him and how he needs to RUNAWAY from them in order to understand his true self, and come up with his own answers.\\"wanna runaway,and never say goodbye, wanna know the truth instead of wondering why\\"<BR>7.By Myself-10/10- about being alone in this world and not being able to trust, or rely on anybody, yet still recieves poor advice and help from the outside world.<BR>8.In the End-10/10- LP at it's best!....perfect blend of the rock/rap, electronics, and electronic beats genre band that they are. Very obvious, the song is about love and the worries of love, and keeping together  in the beginning but IN THE END, it didnt matter to him anymore<BR>9.Place for MY Head-8/10- Mike Shinoda's Emceeing is vastly revealed in this song....he throws strong words in a rapid and short amount of time....not very sure on te meaning of the song...i believe its about being used as a person, and not wanting to be part of that person's life<BR>10.Forgotten-10/10- Lyrics are most symbolic and very difficult to understand. Could be about how the extremities and oddness of his own world and memeories that affect other people.<BR>11.Cure for the Itch-7/10- Happiest song on the album...yet no lyrics whatsoever...basically DJ Hahn mixing up his stuff at you.<br />12.Pushing Me Away-10/10-gr8 song to end the album...similar lyrics to With You but instead of him losing someone, he leaves the other person
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I just got through watching this movie with my husband and 10 year old son so the movie is fresh in my mind. My husband and I felt the 1960's version was better but our son thoroughly enjoyed this newer adaptation. Plus, he had plenty of questions afterwards - mostly about time travel and space.<br /> Adults should be forewarned that this movie definitely is designed to engage younger viewers but even with that in mind, we still enjoyed it. Updated computer and digital techniques make ensure that the special effects are truly awesome.<br /> With so much junk fare out there in theatres and on television, this is a great choice for family viewing. I'm surprised this one didn't get better reviews.
B000021YQV|5.0|This, like their first album, is gonna be one of those CD's you end up liking alot but you really don't know why. For someone who doesn't listen to alot of different kinds of music, or for someone who is expecting 14 tracks of &quot;Chop Suey&quot; are going to be in for a surprise. System of a Down are definately not your average metal band. With songs about horses, pogo sticks, and tapeworms, you may be left to wonder if they even have any musical direction. The music clearly shows that they do. And there are some songs with intelligent lyrics such as &quot;Forest&quot; and &quot;Prison Song&quot; (which has an awesome message). The singer can sing well when he wants to, but he doesn't really want to much so you'll have to deal with that. &quot;Aerials&quot; is another great song and &quot;Toxicity&quot; has lots of different cool beats to it. If you like metal that isn't TOO heavy but is really different in it's own way, don't pass this up. Get their first CD too. In fact, get it first.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Cash breaks the &quot;rules&quot; here with the help of Bob Johnston, the only person that didn't refuse to listen to Johnny's advice that a prison concert would make a great live album. Kudos to Mr Johnston for taking the Man in Black's advice. This is a hit!<br />I grew up listening to my Mother's copy of Folsom Prison Blues (the studio album) on a 33-1/3 record. So this live show really brings back memories for me, but I could see how it could also introduce a person to Johnny's music. It has it all. The whole &quot;outlaw&quot; attitude, the great vocals, the clever comments between songs, etc.<br />Bear in mind, this is the uncensored show. No beeps included. This is the real thing. The liner notes include Johnny's essay dealing with being locked up in jail along with some great photos. I highly recommend this CD. As far as I know, Cash is the original outlaw of country music. Of course, he can only be loosely defined as &quot;country&quot; music anyways. He basically has his very own genre. <br />Cash is Cash. Period.
0553573403|5.0|First of all, I have read many fantasy books over the years. I almost stopped reading fantasy when book 8 of Jordan's series came out. But then a friend showed me this book by an author i've never heard of. As it turns out it was Martin, and boy was it good! I dunno how many times ive reread this masterpiece... I couldnt just leave it in the book shelf. When i saw it there I had the urge to pick it up again, and again, and again... It was that good. This is the only fantasy novel ive read that focuses not only on one character but almost everyone in the book. This way i was able to understand the different points of view of everyone instead of just a single character. The plot was vivid and kept me captivated the whole time. I couldnt seem to put it down! Also, this book doesnt focus too much on magic and sorcery, and for that i am very thankful. I've had enough of Jordan's One Power and Goodkind's Han... it gets too tedious to read. Magic is boring to me. Finally, I recommend you buy this book. Not for the kids, but superb nonetheless. Good work Martin.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Initially I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this film, particularly since it was a kids film.<br />In an age where special effects compensate for poor dialogue and lousy acting, this film manages to not only depict adequate acting talent, but utilizes the special effects to mesmerizing detail.<br />Overall, it is an enjoyable film to be viewed for years to come and is worthy of a purchase.
630469654X|4.0|I love this film, it presents a wonderful story with great performances and I would give it 5 stars but for one thing, the main action score [is] terribl[e]! Andrew Powell put in the lamest, dated, synthesizer glop possible behind some wonderful visuals. The music is so terrible is destroys those scenes, the music was even lame for the decade it was composed in. It sounds like all the music that CHIPS rejected because they thought it would make their show less dramatic! If someone was to get in there and rescore this film it would be one of the best ever. Elmer Bernstein would have been perfect but James Horner would also be a great choice. Still a wonderful movie but I always skip past the opening credits so I don't have to hear that dribble.
B000003S0F|5.0|I strongly recommend this album to King Crimson fans, although I believe that many of them will not appreciate it at first. This album is unique in their collection, and it takes a while to recognize its beauty if you are used to albums like Red. This album  is wonderful for its novelty, and its extraordinary ability to become part of your consiousness. If you are looking for a moment of intense emotion, listen carefully to the first two pieces.

0425170349|4.0|I feel as though I cheated.  I bought the game (PC Version) first and then read the book.  I must say that the game pales to the mastery that Clancy exercises over the written word.  <br />In the game, you have a lot of characters who weren't in the book which is sad because I would have loved to see what Covington and Tomlinson were like on the game.  <br />The book is top notch in every way.  It starts with a hi-jacking that is un-related to the crust of the book and builds from there believe it or not!!!  <br />If you had to narrow down this review to one word, it would be WOW.

B0000039QA|5.0|WOW this album is perfect. This album is everything you want a Rap album to have. Great songs about what Biggie was feeling at the time. This album makes you think. Thats something that todays mainstream rap music cant do. I remember when i first heard Biggie in 1993 before he hit it big in 1994 with &quot;Big Poppa&quot; i was BLOWN away with his flow and lyrical mastery. I was only 11 when i heard it and i had to find more about this guy. His First album is a masterpiece. This sophomore LP can be called his 2nd masterpiece. With songs like &quot;Notorious Thugs&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot; they will leave you hungry for more. Unfortunately Biggie was killed for NO REASON AT ALL in 1997. His music will live on forever!! <br />Looking back to the mid-90's in Rap music i can honestly say that todays rap makes me cringe. I mean Big Tymers, Nelly, Eminem, Jay-Z, are just too concerned with image and making money instead of making music with emotion and meaning. If you really love rap music listen to Underground rappers like Mos Def and Talib Kweli. They are actually keeping the REAL art form alive.
B00003CXI1|2.0|Why O Why cant hollywood just leave a good book alone. Finally kids were starting to read again. Old and young alike love the Harry Potter series. Many fans are awaiting the 5th book. But no it has been delaying pending the 2nd Harry Potter movie. Not only did this movie leave out characters (peeves) and changed the ending of the movie completely (i wont go into details) it also took a book and turned it into another movie for youngsters to watch instead of reading the book. The book is definately better. Tolken goes into such good detail it could never be made as good in Hollywood and i was dissappoined they even tried. However if you never read the book and never will (a very bad choice in my opinion) is this movie is fine it has a good plot and characters and some of the special effects are cool (I like the candles floating). BUT READ THE BOOK INSTEAD ITS MUCH BETTER.

And, yes there may be some areas in the film that aren't the greatest thing that could have been done to match our opinions of what we personally want. But as far as a remake of a less than desirable original this is leaps and bounds above that . The original \\" Time Machine \\" Sucked ... Go watch it then make up your own mind .. For people who like movies at least see it once, you'll be entertained ... 8>)

And as for the effects hey just think that this is a ninteen eightys movie c'mon what do u expect the technology wasnt as great as now. And their house was the only one that was put over the grave yard. So do a little reaserch before you try to knock a classic down

B00003CXE7|5.0|I didn't want to like Gladiator in the worst way. I hate Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe but almost immediately after the first battle sequence, I knew that Gladiator was something special. The action sequences are top-notch and rival Braveheart. The best fighting sequence is the first in the Roman Coliseum where Crowe and his horde of slaves turn the tables on their opponents. The only other time I've ever been so pumped up after a movie was Die Hard. The adrenaline rush is great in Gladiator and eventhough I hate to admit it, Russell Crowe does an outstanding job as Maximus. The film is long (over 2 hrs) but it flies by (the sure sign of a great movie) and it leaves you wanting more. This is one of the only commercial films that I can truly say deserved the Oscar for best picture. This is a definate must own for your DVD library. Highly Recommended.
0684857820|4.0|\\"Lucky\\" should not be thought of as a \\"book about rape.\\"  It is instead the memoirs -- the life story -- of a woman, which just happens to have rape at its center.  This is just as much about growing up, discovering who you are -- seeking love, acceptance, approval -- gaining friendship and confidence -- understanding those around you.  Sebold had to deal with a distant father, a neurotic, panic-attack-prone mother, and a sister she could never really connect with.  This is, however, an astounding book about dealing with rape, and how the people around you deal with it.  In this case Sebold had to unfortunately hear her father's incomprehension at how she was raped if the man didn't have a weapon (he seems to be implying she didn't fight enough), and a therapist who (quite unbelievably) says \\"I guess you won't be so hung up on sex anymore, eh?\\"  In lucid, lean prose, Sebold bravely lays out the details of her experience, letting you into her wounded mind -- a wound that never fully healed till years later (if ever).  Ultimately, what this book tells you is how, when you're raped, it steals who you are.  Everything you do -- every move you make -- has a connection to rape.  You are not yourself; you are \\"the girl who was raped.\\"  You can't simply date a guy.  If you becomes serious with him, he needs to get \\"the talk.\\"  As Sebold points out, her rapist stole her life from her.  The book takes you from the rape, her \\"recovery,\\" and into the trial of the man who committed the crime.  I found the book fascinating and I applaud Sebold for writing it.  If it has any \\"flaw\\" I would point out the section -- the last fifty pages -- taking place after the trial.  It's not that I don't want to hear what became of Sebold and how she continued to deal, but somehow things take a slightly TV-movie-of-the-week turn.  I know it all happened and she can't change reality, but it felt a little odd and didn't quite fit the simple honesty of the book.  When you read it, you'll understand.  You can't accuse someone of a cliche when they're writing their life story, but it still feels that way.  But, besides this, \\"Lucky\\" is a bold, honest, insightful work about an event that changed the author's life forever.  I highly recommend it -- for those that have survived, are trying to, or those that want to understand..

0345350472|3.0|*SPOILER*<br />The year is 2021 and Rick Deckard, android &quot;killer&quot; for the military is continuously searching for new androids to &quot;retire.&quot;  <BR>The android's started being hunted and many escaped to earth from Mars. The androids have to be retired because they got out of hand, started killing people, and look so much like real humans that the only way to differentiate is to use a worded test and a bone marrow test. <BR>In this book almost every animal on Earth has been wiped out by a previous war.  Now almost every animal is either electronic or governmentally owned to be preserved and possibly repopulated. Because of the animal shortage, the price of a horse can be hundreds of thousands of dollars. Even so, Deckard wants one. He says that his mechanical sheep can't appreciate him or love him for his care.<BR>Right from the start this book keeps you from getting interested. In the beginning I thought it introduced too many machines that you did not understand or care about.  Because we're close to 2021, some of them are so remotely realistic that I could not picture anything like them.  <br />As for the characters, though. Rick Deckard and his wife are pretty interesting in many parts of the book, as were some of the other characters. Like the female android he is chasing, who turns out to have many humanoid emotions. Deckard's wife doesn't like Deckard's job because, to her, he is a murderer hired by the government. The symbolism that the author uses in this story is the consequences of war, along with the animals representing life. <BR>I do think, however, that this book would be worth reading if you really like science fiction.
0316666343|5.0|Not every author can transend generations and write about one thing that all humans fear. Murder and life after death. Alice Sebold manages to do just that in this book. Susie Salmon is the ideal child. The person adults admire and other children can identify with, and she is brutally raped and murdered. Her story is not of being murdered or even of her life before, it is about her family, how her death brought them together and pushed them apart. She watches as like a humans, her parents grapple with the news that their oldest daughter is missing and is presummed to be dead. Her sister typically a  pilar of strength begins to crumble from the inside and her youngest brother begins to understand what \\"gone\\" means. <br />Its a great book and extremely well written. I highly recomend it.
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell was the first movie that piqued my interest in adult anime. It also seems to be the benchmark by which other such movies are judged. Just look around and see how many people compare lesser movies to it.<br />This movie is full of action. The graphical detail is incredible, and every time you watch this movie, you will probably see something new. The only downside is that the character development is slightly weak. If you haven't read the manga, you initially might need help figuring out who is doing what, and why. <br />Motoko Kusanagi is a great heroine. She is motivated, introspective, and fearless. <br />Batou's character does a great job in the supporting role. Clearly he is not as philosophical as Motoko, but he knows where his heart is. <br />If you want to see a futuristic sci-fi thriller which is not afraid to confront the philosophical origin of human existence, then Ghost in the Shell is for you. It is directed towards the more sophisticated audience--not people who are satisfied with mutated exploding teddy bears or gundam mechs.
0380789035|5.0|&quot;American Gods&quot; is one of the most intriguing fantasy novels I've read in years.  Its the story of a man named Shadow who is released from prison only to find his wife and best friend had been killed and a strange man offering him a job.  From this point, the book takes the path of a fantasy and horror novel introducing you to a wide variety of gods, old and new.  This is just the beginning and for such a large book, it never bores.<br />This book takes you through idyllic small towns, interesting characters, a walking dead woman, little out of the way tourist traps which are made very interesting through Gaiman's wonderful writing and a world in which nothing is as it seems.  I won't give away too much of the plot, but I will say that the gods were presented in very interesting, sinister and humorous ways.  After reading this, I found myself looking around at the people wishing there were gods around me.<br />All in all, this book is a magical journey into a strange and perilous world.  It took me three days to read it and it left me thinking about it long after I finished.  Its funny, its frightening, sad and phenomenal.  A great read.
B00006690H|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of Eminem's first two albums except for a few songs. When this came out, I heard two songs off it and they were awesome to me. So then I ordered this CD right here off Amazon.com. I just got it in today and the raps immediately blew me away and I had to take several breaks to recuperate. I must admit now that I think Em is truly talented. He literally wears his heart on his sleeve and spews out all the thoughts on his mind and mixes his words together to form clever rhythms. Here is my song-by-song review now:<br />Curtains Up - This isn't a song really. It's just an opening skit with sounds of Em making his way to the microphone. It was cool how he ended this skit by taking a deep breath and then my player immediately went to Track 2 when he screamed \\"America!\\"<br />White America - Slow rapping is included in this song so the fans of Eminem can clearly understand the message he is delivering here. Very catchy<br />Business - Not one of my favorites but I like the chorus<br />Cleanin Out My Closet - The title actually means that Em is cleaning out his mind of all the thoughts that need to be expressed in the form of words<br />Square Dance - Em's hillbilly voice in the chorus is a little annoying but the music is very cool and so is the rapping<br />The Kiss - This is a skit that actually has background music in it that leads up to \\"Soldier.\\"<br />Soldier - The rapping is quicker than most of his other songs and there is a lot of cussing so protect your kids from this one. Better yet, protect your kids from the whole album. :) LOL<br />Say Goodbye Hollywood - If you exclude all the skits on this album, this is probably my least favorite song. It's pretty average and the chorus isn't catchy enough but it doesn't decrease the final score at all<br />Drips - Never got a chance to hear this one because it was removed from the album when they were editing it. Actually it's still on here but it's just three seconds of no audio and then Track 10 comes on<br />Without Me - This is the famous single you've heard so much about. I've heard it a million times but it's still pretty good. Unfortunately, it gets overplayed on the radio and it can get on your nerves after hearing it too much so, once you've had your fair share of listens, try not to listen to it more because you might dislike it then.<br />Paul Rosenberg - I feel some of these skits are unnecessary. Paul just leaves Marshall a message, telling him not to carry his gun away from his home.<br />Sing For The Moment - Eminem borrowed this music from Aerosmith's classic song \\"Dream On.\\" He even had them featured in the song and they sang the chorus while he included his rap verses.<br />Superman - A pretty good song but it gets on your nerves as the conversation between Em and Dina Rea gets played too much.<br />Hailie's Song - Em shows how much love he has for his daughter and how much he hates his mother.<br />Steve Berman - Another dumb skit that's just on the CD to take up space<br />When The Music Stops - The music in the background really gets you moving. There is no chorus. Just nonstop rapping with five rappers featured, excluding Em.<br />Say What You Say - Good song. Nuff said.<br />Till I Collapse - Nate Dogg makes the chorus catchy and the rapping is normal and still good<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy - Hailie's voice gets very annoying in this song, but Em's rapping takes your mind off of her<br />Curtains Close - A skit that makes you cry because it's all over until the next album
B0000640VO|5.0|I was vaguely interested in viewing Amelie mostly due to the picture of the charming Audrey Tautou on the film poster. I had viewed two of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films before - 'City of Lost Children' and 'Alien: Resurrection', the former being a dark and cynical fairy tale and the latter being the most forgettable of the Alien films. So the bright, cheerful and optimistic feel of the film came as a complete and total surprise - and the storyline hit a little bit too close to home.<br />Ever remember what it was like being a teenager? If you're good looking, you've got nothing to worry about, but if you're slightly overweight and have an acne problem, then you can pretty much forget hanging out with the in-crowd. I spent most of my teenage years alone, with no friends to spend time with. Fortunately, my adult life has been a lot more fun. So I could very easily empathise with what Amelie was going through - she uses her good deeds as a way of connecting with the rest of humanity - a way of not feeling alone. So for me, the ending of the film has a huge resonance, and that final romantic image will stay with me for a very long time.<br />I'm glad that I didn't see this film in the theatre with an audience. The themes in this film are way too personal - the concept of being lonely, separated from the rest of society and trying (and succeeding) in forming a connection with the people around you. I'm glad that I could watch this film on DVD, in the privacy of my own home. That way, no one can see the tears streaming down my cheeks every single time I watch this film.
B000002BHE|5.0|Amazing, Superb and Awesome! are just a few of the adjectives I would use to describe the women with the GREATEST voice on planet Earth.  Perhaps the greatest voice EVER.  Yes! you read it right... &quot;The greatest voice EVER.&quot;  I've been listening to music for over 50 years and I've never heard anyone that even comes close to being her equal.  I'm just a little bit upset because you can only give 5 STARS.  I wanted to give her 5 Stars to the 10th power.  Would that be considered HYPERBOLE.  Your damn right it would, but I don't care...  Because I LOVE!! her music.

0066620996|5.0|With an overall keen focus on discipline and accountability, Jim Collins was assisted by a large team of gifted, discerning graduate students. Hence, \\"Good to Great\\" is a most welcome piece of major solid research in our current time when \\"business spin\\" has contributed to the failure of corporations, market values, employee careers, etc. Unfortunately, similar books over the past few decades have relied more on \\"impressionism\\" from the author(s), including the now famous \\"In Search of Excellence\\" which has since been exposed as not fully grounded in the true facts of the time. While Warren Buffet is not identified as a \\"Level 5\\" leader in \\"Good to Great,\\" this is a volume which could surely bear the imprimatur from that \\"Sage of Omaha.\\" This book could even assist GE's Jack Welch \\"grow\\" into a more effective individual. [Prepare yourself for a surprise-jolt: based on Jim Collins' penetrating analyses across 11 major organizations, Mr. Welch would probably be considered as a \\"Level 4\\" leader.]<br />This book is of significant value to anyone wanting to move from \\"good to great\\" no matter if it is within a profit, not-for-profit, or even in a home-family setting. Great, easy reading and, most importantly, an excellent, life-long reference manual to help you remain \\"tuned-up.\\" Notably, this book should be a required supplemental text for all general management courses (undergraduate or graduate).

0451191153|4.0|Ayn Rand's writings have been enormously influential, and to argue otherwise is an exercise in futility. Her reach in the field of politics counts Alan Greenspan as one her apostles. She's probably better known for \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" a massive novel written in the 1950's. Before \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" came \\"The Fountainhead,\\" written in the 1940's. Rand was a screenwriter and a playwright as well. Ayn Rand died in 1982.<br />This edition of the book is divided into three parts: an introduction with some explanatory notes written by Rand in the 1960's, the actual novel, and an afterword by Rand acolyte Leonard Peikoff, who is also Rand's legal executor.<br />On the surface, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a deceptively simple tale about an architect struggling to make buildings on his own terms. There is much more here than this, however.<br />Rand uses the novelistic style as a vehicle for her personal philosophy. This philosophy, known now as Objectivism, places man squarely at the center of the universe. It is man who creates, but only certain men. The man who creates is an egotist, a man who creates solely for his own sake and for the sake of the work, without any influence from others. He does not share his work or collaborate. The rest of humanity is \\"second-handers,\\" or parasites that feed off the misery of others. They do not create, but merely take from those who do to give to those who don't. These second-handers are usually found promoting a socialistic, or collective, society.<br />In \\"The Fountainhead,\\" it is Howard Roark who is the creator. Roark is a genius that is guided by an inner force to build. His whole life is dedicated to creating monuments to man's greatness. While others resort to imitation, Roark creates and expresses new ideas. He refuses to change his plans to please others. He only respects others who share his worldview.<br />Arrayed against Roark is Peter Keating, a fawning, inept architect who turns to Roark to bail him out of tough spots when he needs help, only to turn against Roark at the first opportunity. Keating accepts awards and positions he doesn't deserve, is vain beyond belief, and is also a momma's boy (Peter wants to become a painter, but his mother talks him into becoming an architect). He does what he thinks others want him to do. He is not his own man, but a man of the collective mentality.<br />Ellsworth Toohey is the archenemy of the novel. Toohey is a pseudo-intellectual who works behind the scenes to create a \\"brotherhood of man\\" society. Toohey creates councils to debase literature, architecture, and theater. He writes a column in a newspaper and magazine promoting socialist values. His goal is the domination of the world with himself as a sort of \\"first citizen.\\"<br />These are not the only main characters of the book, but they are the most important ones. There is Dominique Francon, a woman who shares Roark's outlook on life. She is so loyal to Roark that she works against him because she knows that if Roark succeeds, he'll be destroyed by society. Gail Wynand, a newspaper publisher with Roark's worldview, also emerges later in the novel. He too shares Roark's ideas, with an important exception revealed at the end of the story.<br />For the most part, I liked the book. Rand systematizes some beliefs I've held for awhile, especially on socialism and communism. She's dead wrong about second-handers not creating anything, however. These people have made much progress in the fields of political murder, torture, and penal institutions. Just look at the Soviet gulag system!<br />Her use of the novel format to express her ideas is good, and you can certainly tell Rand was a screenwriter. She creates believable social settings and atmosphere. My problems here are with the Dominique character; I just didn't like her. All too often, Dominique's presence led to over long dialogue and annoying situations. Be sure to pay attention to the first encounter between Roark and Dominique. It's an unusual takeon sexual relations that I don't agree with.<br />I'll probably read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" at some point, although I would rather read one of Rand's purely philosophical books. I'd like to see Objectivism fleshed out a little bit more than is done in this book. I do recommend reading this book because Rand is considered an important figure, and you should have an opinion about her work and her philosophy.on sexual relations that I don't agree with.<br />I'll probably read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" at some point, although I would rather read one of Rand's purely philosophical books.

B00004RF8J|5.0|Little Shop of Horrors is the funniest musical/black comedy ever made. It's so funny! Rick Moranis is great as Seymour Krelborn. Ellen Greene plays Audrey perfectly because she was also in the stage version.  There are several guest apperances by: Steve Martin(the histarical dentist), James Belushi, John Candy, Christoper Guest, and Bill Murray. The film was directed by Frank Oz who did a fantastic job also. The music in the film is great. <br />The DVD has a lot of features which include: Commentary by director Frank Oz, outtakes, gags, behind the scenes footage, Making of feature, theatrical trailers, cast bios, and more. The picture isn't the best but the sound is really good. Overall the DVD is A work.<br />Little Shop of Horrors is about a guy named Seymour, who works at a plant shop that doesn't get a lot of customers. He likes his coworker, Audrey, a lot but shes dating a lunatic of a dentist(Steve Martin) who beats on Audrey, but since he's a &quot;professional&quot; she won't leave him. The boss of the shop is about to close the shop when Seymour shows him the strange plant that he got from the market. He puts it in the window and the boss doesn't think it's going to work. Then a man comes in asking about the plant. Seymour tells him and then the man asks if they can spilt a hundred so he can get 50 roses. The boss says no and the man decides to buy 100 roses. Finally some money for Mushnik's Flower Shop.<br />The film goes on to show what happens to the plant, Seymour, Audrey, and Mushnik's. Be sure to check this film out becuase it shows people dont have to act stupid in a movie to get laughs. The film is 94 minutes long on a widescreen DVD. Also its PG-13 for some violence. I hope you like this film as much as I and many other people did. Thanks

1563896656|5.0|Alan Moore first toyed with the idea of doing crossovers of 19th Century literature characters in his introduction to Saga of the Swamp Thing back in 1987. Now he has finalized that vision in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.<BR>Simply put, this is history´s first superhero team, composed of characters taken out of several Victorian age works of literature and the result is amazing.<br />Mina Murray (Dracula), Alan Quartermain (Mines of King Salomon), Hawley Griffin (The invisible Man), Captain Nemo (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde; all of these singular characters are forced to join together and stop a common foe. They are united under the service of the Queen and for the greater glory of England and the Empire.<br />The artwork by Kevin O´Neal is amazingly good and it portrays the English in a most amusing way. <BR>The dialog is sharp and Mr. Moore has pulled all the stops regarding the references to Victorian literature. There are allusions to Edgar Allan Poe, as well as Gulliver´s Travels.<br />Very enjoyable and entertaining. <BR>You´ll marvel at the sheer scope of Mr. O´Neal´s artwork. You´ll laugh at the interactions between the characters.<BR>You´ll go &quot;oooh&quot; at every reference you recognize.<br />Buy it. Read it. Love it.
B00005CDNK|5.0|Radio wasn't ready for this back in the early 80's: infectious pop music with adult subject matter.  I can remember reading so many negative reviews when &quot;The Visitors&quot; was first released.  Many critics cited the lack of obvious hit singles that made the &quot;Voulez Vous&quot; and &quot;Super Trouper&quot; albums such fun.  What we have here is not only the perfectly structured songs that we had come to expect from Anderson and Ulvaeus but a testament to the end of a great band.<br />If you're an avid Abba fan, consider the group's beginnings with the optimistic singles &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; and &quot;Ring Ring&quot; and mentally fast forward to this album's (original) last track &quot;Like An Angel Passing Through My Room&quot;.  Heartbreaking.
B00005JL3A|5.0|This was one the few movies in a long while that I enjoyed more than a *little* bit.  I think the people who went into the movie with a &quot;Oh, brother&quot; expectation got what they were expecting.  But I personally thought it created a great spooky mood with mesmerizing shots early in the movie that could've come straight from a Stanley Kubrik flick (The Shining, 2001 A Space Odyssey).    <br />The production value is a bit odd at times.  Some parts look like they spent a ton of money but then others look like they were seriously rushed.  Did you guys keep seeing the Microphone Boon about 20 times in this movie too?<BR>The earlier posts about wanting more gore are a bit disturbing.  WTH?  There's *Plenty* of gore in this movie.  If you didn't think so, I suggest a seriously overdue reality check.  I do admit the Zombie crowd scenes didn't quite work but overall, the storyline is good (yeah some of the smaller details seem overlooked / left out).  <br />Milla Jovovich of course looks fine (though kinda grungy) and is a surprisingly good actress.  Although how many people are going to admit that when it's in the context of a movie based on a video game?  She's already shown what she could do in the fifth Element so it really shouldn't come as a surprise but she's definitely proven here that she's more than just a pretty face.  <br />The movie definitely evokes the same mood that the Original Night of the Living Dead did.  &quot;It's us versus them and we gotta get outta here.&quot;  A Definite recommend.
B00004R99L|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid and I also remember enjoying it very much. Now that I am older, I can properly analyse it and I gotta say, this is probably one of the most creative and imaginative stories of all time. What can I say? It's an beautiful story where the imagination is set loose and runs rampant, and while you're watching it you feel like you're actually in that world meeting the interesting characters that you eventually imbed into the back of your mind. All in all Alice in wonderland is just one of those cartoons you'll never forget.<br />On another note those who like this movie will certainly love a new Japanese animation called \\"Spirited Away\\" which has been licsensed by Disney and will hit the theatres supposedly on September 20th. Spirited away is like a more \\"industrial\\" alice in wonderland and the animation is just spectacular. It might be a little to intense for kids but it's really up to the parents discretion. You might also like to check out kiki's delivery service also licsened by Disney. There's a wealth of foriegn animated cartoons out there to further your collection of \\"alice in wonderland\\" type stories and these two are just the stepping stones. .
0380789019|5.0|Okay, repeat after me: Neil Gaiman is God.<br />That's right. Mr. Gaiman is a great observer. He has a talent for pointing out great truths about human behavior and feelings and you just can't help but agree with him. Once you start, you won't be able to put him down.<br />And that's just in general.<br />This book in particular is awesome.<br />There are two Londons: the one you and I know, London Above, and the one where the forgotten people go, London Below. The difference between them is huge, even if they are alike. To fall to London Below means you can never go back. Denizens of London Above can never see people from London Below. It's as if they are invisible, or worse, non-existant.<br />One fine day, Richard Mayhew comes into contact with a girl from London Below. Strangely, he can see her. Even more strangely, he helps her. Thus he falls Below and his adventure begins.<br />A modern fairy tale, full of grit and darkness, Neverwhere is a must read.
B000068QY7|4.0|From the &quot;Street Fighting Man-esque&quot; crunch of &quot;The Hindu Times,&quot; the album's meaty opener and lead-off single, Oasis returns triumphant with their most cohesive and memorable effort since MORNING GLORY.  From the lilting beauty of &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out,&quot; and bitter bleakness of &quot;Little By Little&quot; through to the engaging whimsy of &quot;Songbird&quot; and &quot;She Is Love,&quot; the Brothers Gallagher have delivered an impassioned album that's inviting to new listeners and pleasing to fans. A trippy spin with hooks galore, repeat listenings guaranteed.
B00003Q438|3.0|James Cameron is a true visionary when it comes to film-making. I have to give the man credit for creating some of the most amazing images in the history of film; however, his hand at dialogue and storyline falls just short of being truly believable. <br />For the heavy, desolate, and terrifying place that is the abyss, Cameron meticulously creates the essence of the unknown that lies far below the ocean's surface. His attention to detail is what enables him to generate such grand places for us to see, hear, and (almost) touch. \\"The Abyss\\" takes us to such a region we probably will never experience in our lifetime. <br />The casting is perfect. Ed Harris and Mary E. Mastrantonio, though given quite an unoriginal love story, take a wild character journey through walls of steel to human fragility. The swim back from the submersible was heart-wrenching, and what follows truly shows Cameron's potential as a great writer. However, most of the dialogue does run into (unfortunately) \\"corny\\" territory, as does the \\"We Are the World\\" ending. <br />The DVD Special Edition comes full of extras: commentary, bios, featurettes, and 28 minutes of extra footage. I, personally, watched the extended version prior to viewing the theatrical. I found that there is much more exposition and emotion in the extended version, which helps Cameron's character development.<br />In the end, I do have to give Cameron credit for making us care about the characters through the trite script bumps. <br />He did it in \\"Titanic,\\" and he does it here.
B00005A0N5|4.0|This album is amazing, especially when compared to Nightwish's previous offering, Angels Fall First. Among the best songs are Passion and the Opera, Walking in the Air, and the intrumental Moondance. The lyrics are actually deep and thought provoking in most cases, which is a great leap foward from their debut. The musicianship has also improved immensely. Finally, Tarja's voice seems to have hit its stride in Oceanborn, allowing all her energy and emotion to flow through it unhindered.<br />The only downside are the songs Devil and the Deep Blue Sea and Pharoah Sails to Orion. Namely, they have someone else trying to sing with Tarja, and it sounds like he's got a hamster stuck in his throat. Nightwish should formally take out a restraining order on any male in this genre to keep them away from the microphone at all costs. A grating, false bass compared to Tarja's precision and beauty is an almost unforgivable sin. Granted, it's better than Tuomas's singing in AAF, but that's not saying a whole lot. The primary reason it's better is because it's confined to two songs, rather than being spread over most of the CD.<br />That lapse of vocal judgement is the only thing keeping this CD from getting the full five stars. It's amazing, beautiful, and at times incredibly powerful, and in all ways an amazing jump from their first attempt at studio recording.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I can't add anything new to this, I'd just like to say that it bothers me that so many of you are giving this movie a one star rating, even though you feel it deserves five stars, just for the sake of getting attention.

B00005JL5S|5.0|In the summer of 2001, this hilarious comedy-action film was released in Hong Kong, and it immediately became the biggest hit there, even beating the previous box-office record of Jackie Chan's \\"First Strike.\\"  The craze went on, and when it was released in Japan in May, 2002, it again became an instant smash hit even though Stephen Chow's name, before that release, had been known only among the small number of devoted Hong Kong film fans.  How the movie is received in US and other regions, I don't know, but as those facts testify, \\"Kung-Fu Soccer\\" is an incredibly funny movie.<br />[STORY}] You need one?  OK, it is about a young man Sing (Chow) who wants to promote the usefulness of kung-fu he learned at Shaolin Temple, and an ex-star soccer player \\"Golden Leg\\" Fung (good supporting actor Ng Man Tat), who is now down and out, living in misery.  However, when Fung meets Sing on the street of Hong Kong, and sees how he kicks an empty can miles away (literally), Fung realises that here is a golden opportunity for him to regain the dignity and pride he lost long time ago.  Combination of Kung-fu and soccer!  Invincible!!<br />So, Sing recruits the old pupils he knew when he was training at the temple to make a soccer team.  They are no longer what they were; one is a businessman busy with a cell ohone, another totally unemployed, and so on....  And they seem to have lost the skills they had once until, of course, one day, suddenly, they come back in good shape, ready for fight, game for more.  Meanwhile, Sing meets a girl named Mui (Vicki Zhao), and a romance (but very unusual one) starts to bloom.  My overall impression is, in short, Austin Powers with sports and martial arts. <br />[WHO IS STEPHEN CHOW?]  Chow has been very popular in Hong Kong since the year 1990, about two years he made his film debut, and he is 40 years old at the time of writing this, but looks much younger and very agile.  His comedies are always filled with incredibly stupid and ridiculous things, often under the very unique situations.  Some of his movies include \\"With Love from Beijin\\" (1994) \\"The God of Cookery\\" (1996), and many others, and I hope those titles would tell you what you see in those funny films.  Always stupid and powerful, often with extraordinary  parodies, his films give you dynamic gags with improvised atomosphere.  Though the film often lacks a coherent story, and his character is not always amiable, finally you come to like him.<br />[ABOUT THIS FILM] As I said, \\"Kung-Fu Soccer\\" is a funny comedy, and it also uses first-rate wire-actions and CG images to create its original world.  The soccer players jump (to the height of more than 10 meters), kick a ball (to make a hole in a concrete wall, or sometimes catches fire, becoming a roaring puma-like shape!), and ... well, about the rest you should see for yourself.  Some of the CGIs are intentionally (and aptly) cheesy (see how villains fly in a browl), but some are surprisingly effective, especailly in the final game scene.  Not \\"Titanic\\" class, but its use is well-regulated and most importantly, makes lots of funny scenes.<br />[AND ... TRIVIA]  1) As Stephen Chow is a great fan of Bruce Lee, he makes a reference to this legendary hero in the character of the goal keeper whose orange-colored uniform is that of Lee in his last film \\"Game of Death.\\"  2) Vicki Chao is a famous, very popular idol singer/actress in mainland China, but she never shows her real face.  Three time she appears, but each time she is wearing some make-ups.  This is an in-joke for those who know her, but to some audience Chow's joke may seem to have gone too far.  3) If you're a Hong-Kong film fan, check out the special appearances of Karen Mok with a strange make-up (regular of Chow's films like \\"The God of Cookery\\" and also seen in Jet Li's  \\"Black Mask\\") and Vincent Kok (also seen in \\"With Love\\" and director of Jackie Chan's \\"Gorgeous\\").<br />[AND FINALLY...]  The film has first made with the running time of 102 minutes, and then two additional sequences are made to make it 109 minutes (I saw the latter one in Japan).  However, it has been reported that for the US release Miramax decided to cut extensively the Asian version, so you may keep that in mind.  But, though I hate those changes done to the films, I think, as far as this case goes, the cuts would not affect the total effect of the film very much (I admit some parts of the original version was, to me, a little unnecessary or ineffective) because the film itself is way too funny.  Well, anyway, that's for the record.              <br />I love the film.  Hope you enjoy it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|WOW! I thought Nora Jones was going to be boring, but I was sure wrong! When I first heard her CD, I thought it all sort of sounded the same, but after listening to it more, I found it surprisingly relaxing. Very refreshing in a world filled with annoying, teenybopper pop. Her songs are simple, have great lyrics and sound kind of old-timey. <BR>The first song \\"Don't Know Why\\" is remarkable and sets the tone for the rest of the CD. The second, \\"Seven Years\\" has cute lyrics and it so low-key and soothing. \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" is also a beautiful song. \\"Feeling the Same Way\\" has a catchy melody, and I often find myself singing along. \\"Come Away with Me\\", the title track was written by Norah Jones, and I absolutely love it, especially the lyrics. \\"Shoot the Moon\\" and \\"Turn Me On\\" are also two of my favorites, where she takes her voice to another level. The rest of the songs on the CD are also magnificent. This is worth your money!
B00003CXPJ|3.0|\\"Zoolander\\" is one of those movies that cause people to respond in one of two ways:  \\"Dude, that was really funny!\\" or \\"Dude, that was so stupid!\\"  I was actually on the in-between.  I really found some parts of the movie hilarious (the gasoline fiasco set to Wham's \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\\"), but other bits I found annoying and far-fetched.  Even though the character of Derek Zoolander is good-hearted enough, is he really that dumb?  Does he really not know how to spell \\"day?\\"  Many of the laugh-free moments come from his stupidity being pounded into the heads of the viewer.  We get it, okay?<BR>It's strange for a movie to pair an assassination plot with the world of modeling.  Usually when a TV character appears in a sketch or a cartoon, the only thing that writers can think to do when bringing them to the big screen is to involve them in a plot in which they help save the world.  Does this make Zoolander unoriginal?  Some would say no.  After all, it is the first time we see a male model try to save the world, right?  <BR>But this movie did offer some good comedy in the form of a rivalry between Ben Stiller's Zoolander and Owen Wilson as fellow model Hansel (he's so hot right now!).  Their run-in at the Vogue Fashion Awards and their runway walk competition are hysterical.  One would expect Stiller to be the star of this film, but Wilson tends to outshine him in many instances.  <BR>Will Ferrell is wacky, and just plain strange, as the evil Mugatu. Beware: he may start to get on your nerves after a while.  Christine Taylor lends some sanity to the bunch as Matilda, but is underplayed by the less intelligent characters.  How can one take her seriously amidst such goofballs?  Expect many cameos by \\"good-looking\\" celebrities.  This idea has become a staple for comedies like Zoolander (i.e. Austin Powers in Goldmember).  <BR>The DVD offers a HILARIOUS menu and some other good stuff (deleted scenes, commentary).  The best part is the two original skits from the VH1 Fashion Awards.  They are good parodies, and they were extra funny when they debuted in 1996/1997 when the world was more focused on fashion and modeling.  One of the reasons this movie may not work for some is that now, people don't concentrate on either of those aforementioned subjects too often.  They have more important things to worry about.  Maybe this movie was just made a few years too late.
0783110871|3.0|First of all, this movie is not as bad as many people said and not as dumb as you would appreciate from the storyline (which I'm sure you know). I saw it for the first time yesterday on TV and that's what it's good for - Friday night chill-out, when you don't want to think of anything, just sit before the TV, nearly falling asleep and concentrating on something that doesn't make you wonder what's going to happen next.<br />There's only one point where the movie fails. After watching it I wondered that it could have been done much better with this cast. We all know Ray Liotta and he's the perfect psycho - though this time a bit overplayed - anyway not annoyingly. Lauren Holly is cute and from the shy stewardess she becomes the 'captain' and an Amazon - she made her part absolutely believable. The rest is OK, too.<br />This movie could have been a perfect shocker - two people on a plane in a turbulence (a killer and a possible victim) - and only one can survive or both die. The director didn't take advantage of the claustrophobic setting and thrilled the audience only with the usual clichés - which are absolutely boring as we all know them. Would he have had a little fantasy, with this cast he could have directed a much better movie.<br />Anyway, it's not that bad and for a lazy Friday evening this is a good movie, if you don't expect too much and switch off the IQ switch in your brain - that's what Fridays are for :)).
B000067CPX|2.0|In the past the Peppers actually understood how to play music. Now i think a monkey with a screwdriver and a hacksaw could produce sounds that would rivil with this alBUM.  I also thought it lacked the hardness that the past albums had which was great.  Now i am dissapointed though because i bought this CD on [amazon.com}....  I coulda bought a beattles CD or a new baseball Hat or something.  In conclusion i would vote this a 2 out of 5 stars and the only reason i give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because the ... thing does make a pretty good frissbe.
0066620996|5.0|I subscribe to what James Collins tells us in &quot;Good To Great&quot;. All businesses in America should aim to be &quot;great&quot;. This book lays out how some of the leading companies have achieved that status. But, they should never cease to be &quot;Good&quot;, meaning honest and ethical. Because, like America itself and Americans themselves, if they cease to be &quot;Good&quot; they will cease to be great. We have been seeing that lately in corporate America, havn't we. After reading James Collins' &quot;Good To Great&quot;, I suggest that anyone interested in the subject of morals, ethics, honesty, and character in America should read Norman Thomas Remick's book which sets out West Point as a metaphor for America titled, &quot;West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From The Readings And Writings Of Thomas Jefferson&quot;.
6305428352|5.0|This movie really digs into your heart because it's about what is really important in life.  The plot revolves around Mr. Holland, who must relinquish his composing and begin a teaching career in order to earn more money.  At first, his teaching style bores the students, until he finds that he needs to make music &quot;fun&quot; for the kids.  What he really wants to do is share his appreciation and true passion of music with the students.  The movie follows some truly inspirational moments that Mr. Holland spends with his students.  A sub-plot of the movie is Mr. Holland's relationship (or lack of) with his son, who is ironically deaf.  Throughout the movie, Mr. Holland's experiences result in his spiritual maturation, which lead the viewers to realize that Mr. Holland's &quot;Opus&quot; is not only his compositions, but actually each one of the people he has touched.<BR>The only bad thing in this movie is that it is very drawn out, other than that, it is a great movie that has depth and meaning.

B000066C8G|4.0|This film is a zany, funny, irreverent look at the materialistic, superficial, and shallow fashion world. Seen through the eyes of the dense and singleminded male model, Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), it slyly pokes fun at all that the fashion world holds dear.<br />Zoolander, a three time winner of the male model of the year award, goes up against the new kid in town, Hansel (Owen Wilson), and much to his amazement has his crown taken from him. No longer the toast of the town and already yesterday's news, Zoolander falls prey to the dastardly machinations of acclaimed fashion designer, Mugatu (Will Ferrell), and his evil sidekick, Katinka (Milla Jovovich).<br />It seems that Mugatu and Katinka want to turn Zoolander into an unwitting assassin whose killing frenzy will be triggered by hearing certain words of a song. In order to keep Mugatu's sweatshops running at full throttle, they hope to rid themselves of the prime minister of Malaysia, who is planning on abolishing child labor. An intelligent and intrepid reporter, Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor), who is also Zoolander's love interest, realizes, however, that something amiss is afoot. Before you know it, bitter rivals Zoolander and Hansel are joined in battle against the forces of evil.<br />This is a hilarious and silly spoof that is sure to make the viewer rock and roll with laughter. Ben Stiller is hysterical as the dumber than dumb Zoolander, who struggles to find meaning in his life after his modeling career tanks. Owen Wilson is absolutely endearing as Zoolander's equally dense rival, Hansel. David Duchovny has a small,  but memorable, role as J.P. Prewitt, a former hand model. Jon Voight is funny as Larry Zoolander, Derek's macho, coal miner father, who is mortified by his effeminate looking son and his chosen occupation.<br />Jerry Stiller, Ben's real life father, has a pivotal role as Maury Ballstein, head of the Balls Modeling Agency, who claims to love Zoolander as a son but sells him down river anyway, when the chips are down. Ben's real life mom, Anna Meara, has a very small part in the film, as does his real life sister, Amy. Cameos by celebrities who play themselves abound in this film. Look for Donatella Versace, Winona Ryder, Billy Zane, Claudia Schiffer. Gary Shandling, \\"Lil Kim. Sandra Bernhard, David Bowie, Fabio, Lenny Kravitz, and Donald Trump, just to name a few.<br />If you are a fan of the Saturday Night Live show, Mad TV, and Comedy Central, then you will, undoubtedly, enjoy this original, silly, satiric, and thoroughly funny and irreverent spoof of the New York fashion scene.anyway, when the chips are down.

B000002HMH|2.0|In my book, this is not the best Metallica album, probably one of their worst. The best are Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning. There are some good, memorable songs on this album, but the rest are dead ends. The bluesy thing would be ok if they kept it like the Black album, but in here it sounds almost like country music. The album gets boring if you listen through and this is where Metallica loses its reputation of being a heavy and fast thrash metal band. Lyrically, it's horrible. On some songs it's like James isn't even trying, like on Bleeding Me. The guitar work is good, but the riffs and solos aren't too exciting. The drumming is the least of what Lars can do and Jason, as always, is practically shunned out. It just amazes me how they could make the greatest metal album of all time (Puppets) and then turn into this nonsense. This isn't real Metallica music. This isn't even metal.
B00004XPQM|4.0|This teen scare flick is a cut above most others. Here, it is not some crazed killer which does away with most of the cast but, rather, the fickle finger of fate that selects the next denizen of the great beyond.     The movie starts off happily enough with a class of high school seniors about to depart for Paris. Once they board the plane, our main man, Alex, cannot quite overcome his fear of flying, as he has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up upon takeoff.     His hysteria is such that he, as well as four other students, is escorted off the plane, accompanied by faculty members, one of whom returns to re-board the plane. No sooner does the plane take off, it blows up in mid air. It seems that fate has snatched these lucky individuals out of death's clutches...or has it?     Their relief, at having escaped being blown up on the plane, turns to terror, as it appears that fate will not have them cheat death. The lengths that these young people go to evade fate, and the steps that fate takes to hunt them down one by one, makes for a crafty and clever thriller. Teens and adults alike will enjoy this flick.
B000060P79|5.0|great music.. the lyrics rock.. these guys are gonna hit the big time! i would definetly reccomend it!!
B0000683DH|5.0|FINALLY, THIS FILM GETS THE DVD TREATMENT IS DESERVES!!!!!!!!!!As an avid lover of sci-fi classic films, I give this one of my all-time highest ratings. I saw this film on HBO when I was about 6 years old, and although I had no idea what \\"Star Trek\\" was, I instanly was drawn into the complex and emotional world that is the \\"Wrath of Khan.\\" For those of you who don't follow \\"Star Trek,\\" this is the perfect starting point. I would not recommend the first film for those unaware of the genre. This film packs it all: scf-fi, action, humor, drama and horrendous tragedy. The plot centers around the not-so-nice villian Khan Noonan Sing(SP?) who wants nothing more than to blow James T. Kirk into space dust. To do so, Khan initiates one of the greatest cat & mouse games ever caught on film. A science vessel, the U.S.S. Relient comes across the barren planet City Alpha 6 to begin research on the testing of a new Starfleet device that can make planets out of space rock. Unfortunately, they stumble across Khan, and are subjected to one of the coolest forms of torture that I have ever seen in a sci-fi film. Khan then steals the Relient and the Genesis device bent on being naughty.  The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, which is on a training voyage, is dispatched to investigate, only to run into Khan and his new armed-to-the-teeth starship. And so begins the fantastic space battles and witty one-up manship that is the relationship of Kirk & Khan. The entire Mutara Nebulla sequence ranks second, only to the incredible Battle of Hoth in \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" among my all-time favorite sci-fi movie moments. \\"Star Trek\\" or not, this film is one of Hollywood's best space operas and ranks with such films as \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" \\"Blade Runner,\\" and \\"Tron\\" as being one of the 1980's best sci-fi films.<br />Interesting side note: This film is actually just act one of a great 3 part sci-fi saga that continues the same story line in \\"Star Trek III,\\" and \\"Star Trek IV.\\" These three films can be viewed back to back much like the original \\"Star Wars\\" films. Here's hoping that \\"Search For Spock\\" and \\"Voayge Home\\" get the ole 'Director's Cut' treatment as well!!!!!<br />To those of you who hate Trekkies, don't miss out on a great opportunity to see one of the finest sci-fi films ever produced.films can be viewed back to back much like the original \\"Star Wars\\" films.

0767804201|4.0|This is a delightful romantic comedy. Matthew Perry is a charming, self-effacing leading man. Salma Hayek is a most fetching and winsome leading lady. Strong performances by the supporting cast help make this a most enjoyable movie.<br />Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) lives in New York and has a high powered job as a field agent for a builder that specializes in the construction of night clubs. He is sent to Las Vegas to supervise new construction. While there, he meets a fiery, latin beaty, Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek), with whom he has a very memorable one night stand. This is totally out of character for both of them. In fact, she is so embarrassed by what happened, that she sneaks out of his house first thing in the morning. Before he even knows it, she is gone, never to be heard from again, until she shows up on his door step three months later to announce that she is pregnant with his baby.<br />Alex tells her that he supports her right to choose. Isabel chooses to have the baby. She asks nothing from him other than he meet her family, so that it is not such a shock when she announces that she is pregnant. He agrees to do so. He meets her traditional, Mexican-American family and is taken by their warmth, a quality that is sorely lacking in his family. He rarely sees his own family, except for the obligatory holidays, while Isabel meets hers once a week for dinner.<br />Alex and Isabel fall in love and have a quickie marriage ceremony performed in Las Vegas. Naturally, as they are now husband and wife. they move in together. Then reality sets in. They contend with cultural difference, with pain in the you know what in-laws, and with the every day adjustments necessary, when living with someone one does not, as yet, know. Then, the trust that had developed is violated, and they each go their own separate ways.<br />What happens with the baby? Does the marriage survive? Watch the movie and find out. The experience will be an enjoyable one

B000002B1M|5.0|First off this album is 5 stars without a doubt. It cannot even be compared to Illmatic because that in my oppinion is the single greatest hip hop cd ever made.<br />Now, It Was Written, is one of the best cds ive heard regardless if its not better than the Illmatic, it has great guests (Mobb Deep, The Firm) great beats (The Message) creativity (I Gave you Power). All the things that make up a great cd are found on It Was Written and is a must have for any Nas fan.<BR>If you think &quot;I Am&quot; or &quot;Stillmatic&quot; are better than this album you should not be listening to Nas in the first place, and need to go bop your head to some Ludacris or Nelly. Payce yall.
B00005ASHM|3.0|I must admit, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a GOOD album, but it's nowhere near being the \\"greatest of all time\\" or anything like that. It's definitely way below \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" the one everyone compares it with. The first three or four tracks are awesome, but after that, it gets kind of weird. I mean, everyone hails this album as being \\"the best album ever made\\" and that it's better than \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and all that.It's still one of The Beach Boys' better albums, but not exactly on the same level as \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or the \\"White Album.\\" <BR>And the new \\"Stereo remixes\\" are cheap, too. They take one, maybe two instruments, and isolate them on only one channel, so, technically, it's in stereo, but there's not a whole lot of difference. <BR>It's a good album, but definitely not worth all the praise it's gotten over the years.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This CD is just as great as Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn.  Those reviewers who think this is too pop must not understand what pop is.  Anyone who confuses No Doubt and Britney Spears is brain dead.
B000003TAW|5.0|The first album from Weezer is the one that captured so many fans. Songs like Undone, Buddy Holly, and Say it Ain't So led Weezer to greatness...this classic album even inspired me and some friends to start a band...by far the best of all of their CDs, It's a classic that all nerd rock fans should have.
6305718903|5.0|Maybe it's just me, but I loved this movie.  I've been a big fan of Patricia Arquette's work for some time now, and actually have 2 copies of this film, on VHS and DVD.  I think that the idea that a person could be overtaken by the spirit of a stigmatic priest in order to finish translating the Gospel of Jesus Christ is amazing.  Certain aspects of this film touched on my ideas of my own faith, including the quote from the Gospel of St. Thomas.  &quot;Split a piece of wood and I am there.  Lift a stone, and you will find Me.&quot;
B00004RFCM|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is not because of the content of the show.  It was the format of every 30 minutes stopping and starting over again...<br />One set of credits would have been plenty..but 8 times..I started humming the theme song in my sleep.  Maybe in the future they could edit it better for DVD viewing.
6304698526|2.0|This movie was probably a good one in it's time, but it was a very slow movie. The only good thing was the old cars. Not very many speaking parts. From all of the reviews I read I thought it was going to be a lot better, but like I said it probably was good in it's time. If you like old cars (mustangs) you should get it, or maybe rent it first.
B00000JPH5|4.0|Labyrinth was made in 1986, yet the passage of time hasn't dimmed the spectacular demesne that unfolds before the viewer's eyes. The real world is quickly left behind as we follow Sarah - a petulant teenager with a lively imagination - on a quest to save her baby brother from the clutches of the Goblin King. With the help and hindrance of sundry fantastical dwarves, goblins, beasts, and the ilk (brought to life through the puppetry genius of Jim Henson) she has 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth.<br />Given the talent of Henson, the human actors were always going to face stiff competition. Jennifer Connelly plays the lovely but perpetually startled-looking heroine (although perhaps she is surprised at the clunky and unlikely dialogue she occasionally spouts). However the casting agents were spot on in their choice of the deliciously androgynous and mocking David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King. <br />But the real stars of the show are the denizens of the labyrinth. These range from the simple yet visually effective 'helping hands', to huge hirsute beasts, to a goblin army, and some funky fire-dancers. Similarly impressive is the interior of the Goblin King's castle, which is a replica of the famous optical illusion involving staircases that appear to float in mid-air and connect to each other at impossible angles.<br />Although there is some bad dubbing and a seemingly endless number of what must be the fakest polystyrene rocks ever to have graced the silver screen, this only minimally dilutes the viewing pleasure. Labyrinth will reward the spectator (even those who would not class a fantasy film as their normal fare) by transporting them to a captivating world where things are not always as they seem.
B0000508U6|5.0|Music sales are slumping because too many people download MP3's, according to industry executives. However, new music like Coldplay isn't advertised in Pepsi and Burger King commercials like some other groups. And these executives say they promote good music?

6305603847|2.0|Ever since his departure from Pink Floyd, Roger Waters (bassist and principle songwriter for the album and much of the band's '70's material) has used every source of media to reignite the fortunes he made from the 1979 blockbuster \\"The Wall.\\" From books to live stage adaptions, Waters has yet to let go. Few of these \\"revivals\\" have been as successful, and 1982's film adaption of the hit record may be why.<br />Combine Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\"--a smash hit--with an acclaimed two year tour and add a somewhat relentless visionary--Roger Waters, and a silver screen adaption is guaranteed. But \\"The Wall\\" movie was not to be well received with the critics. Director Alan Parker describes it as \\"one of the most miserable experiences\\" of his directing career...a fine director being wasted on an ego-trip like this is definitely one of the elements of the film's lack of luster. For anyone who is familiar with the album, the movie is undeniably predictable, with each scene following the songs to a T, and adding nothing new or redeeming, except Gerald Scarfe's stark animation, one of the few highlights. Bob Geldof portrays the depressed rock star that the story follows, and gives the viewer nothing to appreciate, doing little but staring into space, throwing an occasional tantrum, and a bit of singing and screaming. The sequences for the songs 'Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)' and 'When the Tigers Broke Free' are nice enough but would have done better has promos.<br />Had this movie been...well, an actual movie instead of a somewhat uninspired two hour promo for the album, it would have fared slightly better. There is a limit of dialogue in the film. Though a few scenes do contain spoken parts, they're usually taken straight from the album (for example, the scene with the American groupie who finds herself in the middle of yet another one of \\"Pink\\"'s unprovoked, pointless tantrums), except for the scene with the wicked schoolteacher (though even that sequence takes a line from Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" album). This is definitely one of the things that limits the depth of \\"The Wall\\" film. One other major mistake is the dimension of the main character, Pink--at least the album had music to create a surrounding atmosphere and explanation for his severe isolation, but the film only tells us this is a man whose father died, had an overprotective mother, married a harlot, and became a big rich famous rock star...and shows us such a severe dementia that the viewer will wind up concluding that Pink is just a crybaby whose anger is unfounded. Yet the biggest mistake overall is that Roger Waters forgets that he's a songwriter, not a screenwriter. Perhaps Alan Parker should have hired a professional who was unfamiliar with the album, and only given a copy of the lyrics. Surely they would have refrained from delving into their own ego, as does Waters. Long story short, \\"The Wall\\" film is one long music video, adding no dimension or depth to the characters or story.ink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" album).

If you are old enough to remember when it first came out, buy it, hook up the headphones and step into the time machine. If you are too young to have been steeped in every track of this magnificent work of art, buy it, hook up the headphones and suddenly see the foundation on which most popular music was built. It is as fresh and meaningful today as it was nearly 40 years ago. No one who cares about modern music can be without this album. It's that simple.
B000066NW0|4.0|When I first heard Complicated on the radio, I didn't like it. I thought it sounded exactly like everything else on the radio. Eventually, due to the vast amount of praise she recieved from everyone (and due to the fact that she was compared to Michelle Branch), I decided to look at the REST of her music. I thought that it wouldn't be any good. Instead, I found that I liked it WAY better than Complicated! Well, well...the girl actually has talent. And I have a few new tunes to listen to.

6300185249|5.0|I don't understand why anyone would not like this movie! This movie is one of only a couple of movies that still makes me laugh hysterically every time I see it. One of the funniest parts is when Tom Hanks goes out to the trees and decides to carve his &amp; Shelley Long's initials into one of them, only to have the entire area collapse around him. Then, when he comes in to tell her that they &quot;have very weak trees,&quot; the funniest sound effect of the burnt-out doorbell is heard. I am laughing very hard just writing this review thinking about it. This movie is fabulous, and I wouldrecommend it to anyone who likes a good belly laugh every now &amp; then.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I have read all the Well's stories and I have seen the original Time Machine. The book was wonderful and the Rod Taylor film was, for its time, a decent film, made during a time when not many serious science-fiction films were produced. I bought the DVD in spite of several negative reviews because I thought it would be a good film to watch with the kids. Aged five to ten. They didn't have enough patience to wait for the trip to the future, the Eloi, and the Morlocks. I, on the other hand, was totally pleased. <br />It was as if I were seeing a SF film from the sixties made with today's technology. The machine itself was just as I imagined it when reading the book, the bamboo houses on the cliff side were great, and I liked the soundtrack. Guy Pierce did not seem to stay in character through the film but I suppose if I were being chased by a morlock I would change, too. The plot had some holes - notibly &quot;I can't change the past after one try so I will go into the future to find the answer&quot; - but nothing I couldn't live with. I liked it, the wife liked it, and the kids came back to see the rest of the movie when the time machine set out for the future. To properly enjoy this movie you have to imagine you are twelve again going to the Saturday Matinee. And have some popcorn.
0380977788|4.0|Neil Gaiman's Coraline is on par with Neverwhere, some of the same imagery appeares in both stories, w/Coraline being the more creepy version.    Written in sparse language but not losing any of Gaiman's descriptive prowesse, the story reads like a dark Alice in Wonderland.  I thoroughly enjoyed this first foray into children's lit by Mr. Gaiman and look forward to future endevors.
B000066NW0|5.0|When I burned this CD from my friend, I wasn't sure how I'd like it. I really had only heard the songs \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Sk8er Boi\\", both of which I loved. After listening to it, I have decided that she is such a heroine. After several years of Britney, Christina, Jessica, Willa, ect..., I had begun to think that trying to be part of the \\"in\\" crowd was the only way to go. But since the beginning of this summer, I've noticed a change in me. I listen to much different music (Michelle Branch, Relient K, Vanessa Carlton, etc...) and I have lately begun to find a change in my clothing style. Really, I can't place myself into a category (Punk rocker, prep, Girly, Sporty, Funky, Trendy) because I have a mix of many of those styles. My mother seems to think I am a \\"hippie chick\\" because of my pale skin, thin build, and long, curly brown hair. She says I have a \\"Romantic\\" look. And I can accept that. But I don't think anyone should have a \\"look\\" unless they want to. I love many styles of clothing. Anyway, to get back to Avril, she believes the same I do about herself. She is a skater chick, but isn't afraid to show it. She's definitely Anti-Britney, which is TOTALLY a good thing. Rockers like Avril, Michelle, Vanessa, and even Alicia Keys (who all play an instrument and write/co-write their own songs)help our pop-princess infested world. Everyone knew that sooner or later, chicks like Britney and Christina would die out. Which is perfect, cause they need to make room for the talented ones! After, like, 4 years of bare stomachs and belly-dancing, these fully-clothed girls are ready to take over. Good luck Avril, Michelle, and all you other great musicians!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is great, I find that I don't notice how long it is because it is interesting all the way through.  But, on repeat viewing that Ceasar character's wimpering in every scene for everybody to love him gets annoying.  Pick a scene: Daddy love me, General love me (or else), sister love me, people love me, senate love me, little boy love me.....
B00003CXDV|5.0|I just watched GALAXY QUEST for the first time, and must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. A very funny script, pretty good special effects, and perfect casting (led by the great Sigourney Weaver, who somehow manages to transform herself into a hilarously 'bad' actress) are highlighted here. Special mention goes out to Thermian leader Enrico Colantoni for his wonderful performance.<br />This movie lampoons with the best of them - in fact, I found myself often laughing out loud, to a bemused reaction from my family. Good stuff...
B000065VA1|5.0|1986's &quot;So&quot; was Peter Gabriel's big commercial breakthrough, and it's not difficult to see (or hear) why: &quot;So&quot; has all of the power &amp; passion of Gabriel's previous efforts, but it also has a great warmth to it's songs, as Gabriel's past albums may have sounded a little too dark and serious for the masses of record buyers. &quot;So,&quot; however, with it's lighter mood, was welcomed by the public with open arms, and finally catapulted Gabriel out of cult status &amp; into superstardom.Quite simply, every single song on &quot;So&quot; is a masterpiece. Gabriel's singing has never been better, his songwriting here is phenomenal, as is the production, and the marvelous playing of Gabriel and his supreme team of session players, including the reliable Tony Levin on bass and David Rhodes on guitar. Many of these songs are FM radio staples, and have been widely covered by other artists: the thunderous &quot;Red Rain,&quot; the smash hit &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; (with Gabriel cutting loose with a big, brassy R&amp;B throwdown), the gorgeous duet &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; (w/ Kate Bush), and the outstanding &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; &amp; &quot;Mercy Street.&quot; There's also the great pop-rockers &quot;Big Time&quot; (another big hit), and &quot;That Voice Again,&quot; with Gabriel hitting a long high note that is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine. &quot;This Is The Picture&quot; is a terrific, light-groove collaboration with Laurie Anderson, combining singing with spoken word, and the funky guitar of Nile Rodgers. And finally, there's &quot;We Do What Were Told,&quot; the song that sounds most like Gabriel's earlier, darker material. It's brief, lyrically simple, but very, very haunting.This new remastered version of &quot;So&quot; sounds sensational, bringing out new sonic textures to the album that I had never heard before, beautiful notes that were previously undetected. However, I am a bit puzzled by the decision to re-shuffle the song&quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; so it's now the last song on the album, instead of &quot;We Do What We're Told&quot; (the old vinyl version) or &quot;This Is The Picture&quot; (the old CD &amp; cassette versions). Personally, I think &quot;We Do What We're Told&quot; works better as an album closer, but no matter. &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; is an all-time favorite Gabriel tune, and I'm sure in time I'll get used to it as the new finale for &quot;So.&quot;Peter Gabriel's &quot;So&quot; was rightfully nominated for the Grammy for Album Of The Year,&quot; but it lost to Paul Simon's &quot;Graceland&quot;---a very good album, granted, but it's not musically stronger than &quot;So,&quot; nor has it's impact been as longlasting as &quot;So.&quot; The Grammy commitee also goofed big time (excuse the pun) when they passed over Gabriel for Robert Palmer in the Best Male Pop Vocal category. Go figure. But these shocking Grammy injustices take nothing away from Gabriel's monumental achievement with this album. &quot;So&quot; is a classic, sparkling album from the first note to the last, and an important testament to the power of gifted, intelligent songwriting &amp; performing, and as only Peter Gabriel can do it. &quot;So&quot; is so perfect. :-)
B00005YUNY|5.0|I saw this tour in Atlanta, Georgia and was extremely dissapointed in the performance due to the sound quality, timing, etc. Well, I'm happy to report that this DVD has restored my faith in this tour and in the whole symphonic concept. The sound is simply incredible, the camera work is superb, and the animated extras are extremely well-done. And, unlike previous animated sequences on Yes videos, these actually add to the experience of the music by following the emotion of each song. I can bring up several examples, but I do not want to give anything away. I recommend watching the DVD once with the animation turned off, and then once again with it turned on (Yes, this is selectable - adding yet another feather in the cap of this DVD). You will not be dissapointed.<br />We Yes fans have been lucky enough to be exposed to a LOT of new material in recent years. I have been somewhat concerned, in fact, that some of it would start to become diluted. But, with the release of Symphonic Live, there is no signs of this happening in any way.<br />Buy this DVD and enjoy every minute of it.
B000002U82|5.0|My goodness, dear reader, do you really NEED convincing by us, the Amazon.com reviewers, on why you should buy Pink Floyd's immortal classic, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\"? I mean, really...(*laughs*)...relax, I'm just playing with you. Well, what can be said about this legendary rock album that hasn't already been said a zillion times before? This album is Pink Floyd's \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" an undisputed every-home-should-have-one masterpiece. To make a long review short, you should buy \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" because: a) it's music, combining the band's sharp songwriting, outstanding musical chemistry, and impressive in-the-studio skills, is fantastic, b) it's timeless theme about all the things in life that can drive us mad---money, mortality, time (or lack of), war, etc., is pure genius, c) the clever lyrics by Roger Waters REALLY hit home, d) it's unsurpassed production & sound effects make it without question THE album to test your new stereo equipment with, and e) although I've never tried it myself, it's widely reputed to be a GREAT soundtrack album for....er, intimate encounters (especially while playing \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\"---it's supposed to be really cool, man). And yes, you can also have fun with it while watching \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" (start the album on the *third* lion roar, kids!).So, now you know why you have to buy Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon.\\" :-)
0451196716|5.0|This is the first Stephen King book I have ever read. I have always been leary of reading anything by him because I had heard that he was very descriptive and lengthy. From what I have read on these postings, I must have picked his best book yet to start with. I was very impressed with him and didn't find it ever to drag. The first night I had this book, I had sat down to just start it and had read through half the book before I noticed it.<br />I do have to say that the last few paragraphs kind of threw me for a loop at first. I did have to go back and reread it just to make sure I wasn't missing anything.<br />It did make me tired reading about all that these young boys endured throughout this long walk. I kept thinking how unfair things were for them. Anyway, I thought it was great, and I will read many more by him.
0812550706|4.0|Ok, I'm not a huge sci-fi fan. I've never enjoyed reading about things that I just couldn't believe. But that's why this book was so wonderful. Yes, it did take place in outer space, it did have aliens and all those other sci-fi essentials. But that's just the beginnning of this book. Unlike most science fiction that I've read, however, there was real character development, I understood and felt for Ender, I liked his friends, I laughed with him, got worried about him, and cried for him. The story was full of twists, turns, and other cool things. Everything about this book was great- the plot, the characters, the writing style, the suspense... Everything! Especially the character Ender is so real. After reading this book you feel like you've lived with him at Battle School and been with him through all the major events of his young life. This is the kind of book that I would reccomend to anyone who wants a good read. It's not just for guys or just for girls, not just for kids, or just teens, or just adults, and it's definitly not just for sci-fi or fantasy fans because I'm not one and I loved it!
B0000640VO|5.0|'Amelie' is one magical movie. It doesn't just present likable characters and an endearing story, but is gorgeous to look and listen at. The story revolves around Amelie, a lonely woman from France who one day takes it upon herself to make other people happy. Whether it's returning a childhood treasure to it's elderly owner to bringing two people together, Amelie goes about bringing just a bit of happiness to those around her. But will she find it herself?<br />For those who have seen the 'Delicatessan' and 'City of Lost Children' before, director Jeunet brings the same aesthitics to 'Amelie' as he did to those films. Each scene is beautifully filmed, with CG effects thrown in here and there to spice up some of the scenes. There are only a few primary colours used in each shot, but it works well giving the film a look of it's own. <br />The actors are great as well, each one performing the individually appealing characters perfectly. <br />The 2 disc set also comes with an extra's laden disc filled with trailers, featurettes and interviews that definately make this a worthwhile film to get.
0812550757|4.0|I've always found most sequals to have little or nothing to do with the original. I've always read the first book, then gone right on to read the second only to be gravely dissapointed. This was not lite that at all, though. You do not need to read the first book in this series (Ender's Game) to know what's going on in this book (though I would- it gives you a bit more background and it's an amazing book).  This book is so cool in that it's science fiction (not my favorite) but it has great mystery elements, some romance, and cool anthropology and biology stuff in it. Unlike the first book, Ender's Game, this book does require a more sci-fi mind. You have to be willing to put the limitations we have in our world today on hold and let your imagination go with this book. At times, it was a stretch for me because I do not tend to like science fiction and things that don't seem possible. But this book, like Ender's Game, didn't feel so out there that I wasn't thinking of it as something that could happen. This was a great book. I read it like it was possible, because it felt possible, but yet the things that were happening obviously have not happened and could not happen with the technology we have now. The characters feel real and everything that happens to them you feel and can totally empathize. The story is a great one, and the little twists in the story make it all the more exciting. This is not only a great sequal, but it is a great book by itself. Speaker for the Dead does a wonderful job of creating two very different species and developing their differences and simmilarities. Another great book in the series. The Ender Series is terrific!

B000002GY9|4.0|While much hoopla has been made of Tom Waits' early 80's \\"Frank's Wild Years\\" trilogy,let's not forget the brilliant work of \\"Small Change,\\"Foreign Affair\\" and \\"Blue Valentine\\" from the mid to late 70's.I've long maintained that Waits'career could be divided into three categories:The early,folksy troubadorism of \\"Closing Time\\" and \\"The Heart of Saturday Night\\",<BR>the \\"street poet at the piano\\" of the aforementioned trilogy,and the sonic,avante-gard expressionist of the 80's and 90's.<BR>\\"Small Change\\" is a brilliant,essential work that both documents and celebrates the late night barfly lifestyle our hero had come to lovingly embrace at the time.From the first sung lyrics of the impossibly beautiful \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\"- \\"Wasted and wounded,it ain't what the moon did,got what I paid for now\\" the mood is set for a joyride in a broken down jalopy through trash-strewn streets at 4am,past the hookers,transients,all-night diner's and strip joints that<br />haunt Waits' work from this era.His voice,ravaged by alcohol,cigarettes,and God know what else (remember this a guy who lived in a 9 dollar a night motel writing songs for the better part of a decade)maintains a beautiful quality and annotates these tales confidently.There's \\"Jitterbug Boy\\",the story of a drunk \\"holding up a lamp post\\",bragging of how he's done it all,from sleeping with Marilyn Monroe to having breakfast in the eye of a hurricane,all the while burning hundred dollar bills.On the classic \\"Invitation to the Blues\\",<BR>we get the best song Springsteen never wrote.A business man just about to leave town falls for a waitress at a greasy spoon,<BR>gives up his seat on the next bus out of town,and accepts her \\"invitation\\".Waits makes fun of corporate America's sale tactics on \\"Step right up\\",with a hilarious impression of a frenzied pitchman selling you \\"the only product you will ever need\\".Ironically Waits sued corporate America and won when Frito-Lay tried using the song to sell their chips without permission.<BR>The title track is a jarring narrative half spoken,half sung<BR>about a gangster named \\"Small Change\\" that gets \\"rained on with his own .38\\".If you've come to know Waits' work through<BR>his 80's/90's offerings,keep in mind that work was a complete departure from his original motif,and I'd reccomend starting with \\"Heartattack and Vine\\" and working your way back.<BR>But if you're a fan of America's best songwriters like Dylan,Springsteen,Robertson,et al,step right up to the<BR>real deal.Those guys at one time or another had hit singles aplenty,but not Tom Waits.His stuff isn't just an observance of streetlife,booze,guns,fast women,loneliness and isolation,<BR>it's a chronicled,first hand account of someone who truly LIVED it.And that don't make the top 40.<BR>My advice would be to grab a bottle of anything on a rainy night<BR>and play \\"Small Change\\",Foreign Affair\\" and \\"Blue Valentine\\" in a row and watch as the unlikeliest of musical heroes rises from your speakers and talks to your heart and soul as if he was sittin' right there with ya,sharin' that bottle.

6304806434|2.0|I love action films, but as I was watching Con Air, I kept asking myself, \\"where's all the action?\\"  Apparently, director Simon West decided he'd hold off the typical gun fights, car chases, and big explosions until the last half-hour.  Big mistake.  This is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and I don't expect to have to wait 90 minutes to get to the action, which even then, is extremely disappointing in how routine all of it turns out to be.  <br />So, instead, it might be more applicable to view this as a comedy about a relatively simple situation that goes awry.  After all, this whole mess begins when an army ranger named Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) defended his pregnant wife and killed a man.  Even though he was just defending himself and his wife and pleads guilty, he still gets the maximum sentence because he's seen as a \\"deadly weapon\\" in the judge's eye.  It's too bad Cage, normally a pretty good actor, plays his role like a mix between Elvis and Forrest Gump, and as if to make the latter more obvious, Poe's best friend is none other than Mykelti Williamson, AKA Bubba!  <br />This Poe Fella and his buddy manage to get on board a plane full of the most dangerous criminals alive, who come up with an escape plan despite them having never even set foot on the plane before.  Poe has to try and thwart them, and this goes on for pretty much the entire movie.  So what we have here is a film with a lame protagonist, even lamer villains, and average action scenes that don't get the pulse pounding.  Oh, yeah, and there's constant bickering between John Cusack and Colm Meaney over whether or not to shoot the plane down.  The answer should be a no-brainer, but since that description fits the movie itself, you can guess what they decide to do with the plane.<br />I get a lot of amusement over the family reunion in the movie's final scenes, where Poe meets his wife and his daughter, who he's never seen before.  This was definitely the film's funniest bit, and I'm not sure whether or not it was meant to be.<br />(Spoiler) Take a look at the scene where Malkovich's villain is killed.  It's pretty obvious he falls in such a position so that his feet, and not his head, would be facing that crushing machine.  This is the kind of haphazard editing that's displayed throughout the whole film, so it's of no surprise Simon West would go on to direct Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, the worst film of 2001.  Hey, I actually see that as a good thing, since it kept West from directing Black Hawk Down, which was, ironically enough, the best film of 2001.

B00003CXXS|3.0|I think I can say with ease the Jurassic Park series is turning out better than the Jaws series.  That might not sound like  much praise, but this third go-round thriller is an enjoyable, albeit extremely brief, adventure set on Isla Sorna, AKA &quot;That second dino island.&quot;  Brought back into the fold is Sam Neill's Alan Grant, who's now leading a small team on the island in search of a missing teen.  <br />Yeah, the plot's thinner than ever, but what can I say?  I'd be lying if I said I watched this movie for its story. All I really ask for is that a lot of puny humans get chased around by dinosaurs and for the most part, this film delivers.  Sure, most of the characters are unlikeable (the only exceptions being Neill and his assistant, played by Alessandro Nivola) and annoying and the body count is too low, but the action sequences are well-choreographed and occasionally exciting.  As can be expected, the visual effects are first-rate, though the dinos appear a bit too CGI at times, even moreso than its predecessors.  The indoor settings offer more thrill potential (as witnessed in the original film), but director Joe Johnston seems to favor the jungle terrain, a bit of a disappointment.   <br />At a 91-minute running time, the film never wears out its welcome, but then again, it doesn't properly build momentum, either.  Oh, well, at least it gets off to a quick start and never looks back.  Recommended for those looking for a quick-paced jungle adventure, but don't expect the suspense, thrills, or pure magic of the original.
B000000H57|5.0|i started listening to type o negative about 3 or 4 years ago. the first album i ever purchased was &quot;bloody kisses.&quot; my interest in &quot;gothic&quot; types of music led me to check out type o. when i first heard the cd, i knew there was something very special about it. then, eventually, i bought &quot;october rust&quot;. hoping that this album would be even half as cool as bloody kisses, i was engrossed in this wonderful new material. <BR>type o did not disappoint me in any way.<BR>october rust is my favorite in personal type o taste.<BR>although bloody kisses and world coming down are both great in every way imaginable, october rust still holds first place.<BR>there is just something about the album that ensues a feeling of melancholy and sadness, and also feeling of spirituality. <BR>yes, perhaps i do like type o just a little &quot;too&quot; much.<BR>but if you want a great album to listen to, in any mood, at any time, in any given situation, this is the one for you.<BR>and as others have said, this album stands the test of time.<BR>to this day, i still listen to october rust at least once a day.<BR>if you are angry, sad, or depressed, october rust has a song to fit each mood. <BR>buy this album, and i don't think you will find disappoinment.<BR>type o rules!
B000059TPN|4.0|The words \\"Jerry Bruckhemier production\\" make me cringe, since that typically equates to unexciting action movies that follow a \\"race against the clock\\" formula and lots and lots of comic relief humor that doesn't work. Even though The Rock follows the formula to a T, yep, it works, and I'm not even sure how. All I know is that I was too enthralled to give a damn about things like plot holes, character development (which the film actually has a decent amount of), and predictability.<br />The plot goes like this: General Hummel (Ed Harris) is a highly decorated military man upset that the men that died under his command received no medals, their families given no compensation, and not even proper burials. So, he and nineteen highly trained soldiers steal several rounds worth of deadly VX gas, hole up in Alcatraz, complete with rockets to launch the poisonous substance into the general vicinity in San Francisco. Once informed of Hummel's demands (83 million dollars in one day), the FBI brings in top chemical expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) and former Alcatraz prisoner and British Spy, John Mason (Sean Connery) to help the Navy Seals break in and defuse the situation. Things don't go according to plan, and Goodspeed and Mason are left alone to battle Hummel's men and keep the rockets from launching. <br />Infamous director Michael Bay, known for his hyperkinetic editing, displays his speedy style prominently, which is definitely a problem, but for the most part, the action sequences are very tense and exciting (bolstered by Hans Zimmer's blistering score). Cage and Connery are both likeable, enough that we certainly want them to get out of the situation alive and unharmed, which adds some good suspense to the proceedings. Ed Harris brings a bit of depth into his \\"villain\\" role, making him more sympathetic than hissable (that should be saved for the men under his command). Place in some big laughs, and we've got a jolly good crowdpleaser that, despite a hell ofa lot of silly and stupid moments, comes across as first-rate entertainment.<BR>**** 1/2 out of *****
B000002UAC|5.0|In the US, these songs were on \\"Meet the Beatles\\" and \\"The Beatles Second Album.\\"  Meet the Beatles, for us, added \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"This Boy.\\"  Otherwise, the rest of the songs on that landmark album are here, largely in order.  If you buy \\"Past Masters Volume One\\" you get the early singles not included on original release albums in the U.K.  Most of us (back in the day) couldn't find the Vee-Jay album \\"Introducing the Beatles\\".  When they broke out on Ed Sullivan, \\"Meet the Beatles\\" was the hot, available, album in stores.  I played mine till the grooves wore through. <br />This is probably the \\"rockin-est\\" album of the period with lots of pure rock n roll songs like: \\"It Won't Be Long\\", \\"Please Mister Postman\\", \\"Hold me Tight\\", (would have been a hit single for any other band of the time), \\"Money\\", \\"Little Child\\", and George's guitar showpiece, (often performed on stage) \\"Roll Over Beethoven.\\"  Chuck Berry, watch out!  Crank up the volume on this one!  It also has George's first song writing credit on album with \\"Don't Bother Me.\\"  <br />Soulful tracks are \\"All I've Got To Do\\", \\"You Really Got a Hold On Me\\", and \\"Devil in her Heart.\\"  Paul's best is the hit classic \\"All My Loving\\" (first song performed on Ed Sullivan by the fabs).  \\"Till there was You\\" is a nice showtune, a little lame, but has an excellent Spanish guitar solo by George.  They also did this one on the Sullivan show.<br />I would rank this second of the early period.  Behind AHDN, but ahead of Please Please Me (3rd) and Beatles for Sale.  Buy Past Masters Volume One as well, which has 5 #1 hits that are featured on Beatles \\"One\\".
B000001EC1|5.0|Let me just say that BON JOVI is the only band whose music is so amazing that I can't just pick one cd to recommend to people.  Having said that, I CAN say that CROSS ROAD is a perfect selection of BON JOVI songs for the first time JOVI listener or for veteran fanatics.  Usually you have cds you love, but there are a few songs you can skip ocassionally, but I find it hard to do with CROSS ROAD. BUT, if for nothing else I have said, buy it just for ALWAYS and LIVIN ON A PRAYER '94!! A DEFINITE MUST HAVE!

I wish people would shut up cuz they are just dissin her cuz they don't like they way she dresses or whatever. They don't even listen 2 the actual cd. Well this review comes from someone who actually heard and loved the cd. All I have 2 say is \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" is by far an absolute dance classic. It's very hot!Other stand out tracks are boys(also very hot!)lonley(shows an edgier Britney)and that's where you take me(great dance/ballad!!)So if you want a truly great cd that's full of memorable/catchy songs you CAN'T go wrong with Britney!!!!

Having never gotten the chance to experience a LIVE BON JOVI concert, their newest cd ONE WILD NIGHT is a fantastic way to substitute the energy.  Songs like LIVIN ON A PRAYER and RUNAWAY still hold up twenty years later!!  The guys are still going strong.  I highly recommend this cd and cant wait until BOUNCE is released in October!!
0792835050|2.0|I have read the book twice and it is just about the greatest ever, but the movie did it no justice.  If you have only seen the movie, you probably have no idea who Godliman or Bloggs is because they were basically cut out of the movie.  You can't just cut out 2 main characters.  Plus, the movie spent way...WAY...to much time with the love triangle and not enough on the badass spy that is sneaking his way across the country.  I wouldn't waste my time with the movie, just read the book.<br />In the movie's defense though, I watched it with someone that had never read the book and she seemed to enjoy it.
B000067CPX|4.0|I bought this album the other day expecting it too be good.  But at about song 5 or 6 I just screamed &quot;HOLY S*@t, this is amazing!&quot;  I never thought the Chili Peppers had it in them.  Granted, their other albums are all good, but they have finally reached the potential that &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot; and &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, and their other really great songs hinted at.  The songs on this record could have ended up extremely cheesy, but they even pull of the freakin doo-wop singing! That should be enough reason to give them the Album of the Year.
B000005DQR|5.0|I bought this album, back in 1999, and to this day I still listen to it at least once a week. I think this is genious music, and Dj Shadow is one of the greatest producers ever to hit the music scene. This album is highly recomended for anyone who enjoys intellegent, mentaly stimulating music. One of many, I would recomend all of Dj Shadow's masterworks.
079073804X|5.0|I grew up in the 1970's and was a complete monster movie fan (I lived for Double Chiller Theatre on late-night TV every Friday!)--but I knew to wait until I got older to see THE EXORCIST. Listening to how the adults reacted to it, that creepy music, the ominous poster--I just knew to keep clear.<br />When I eventually saw it, I realized that this was the best horror film ever made.<br />That THE EXORCIST was left off the American Film Institute's \\"100 Greatest Films of All-Time\\" is an omission that casts doubt on the entire list.<br />This is one of those classic films where EVERYTHING works: the writing, the directing, the acting, etc. The extras on the DVD are extensive and fascinating (you can tell both William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty cared about every second of this film).<br />Most great horror films will have you turning on lights and peeking around corners, but THE EXORCIST will make you afraid to close your eyes.
B000002JKA|3.0|If you want to find out about Dream Theater, this is not the album to start with !.<BR>I think its a little bit too &quot;Heavy&quot; for me. The song are just not as progressive as on the other albums. Highlights: Erotomania, Lifting shadows of a dream, Scarred
B00005O5JV|5.0|this was a highly enjoyable film I think that Reese Witherspoon did a great job as Elle Woods, if you haven't seen this film go out and rent it you wont be disappointed.
B000002HPT|5.0|I think this is Dream Theaters second best record. After the brilliant \\"A change of seasons\\". The songs are very \\"atmospheric and there is more keyboard than it is on Awake or Image and words.<BR>Cool guitar and drum-parts. <BR>But i think the \\"keyboardwork\\" is the very best !!. Derek Sherinian is the man !!. Highlights: New Millenium, Hells kitchen, Lines in the sand, Trial of tears.

B00004RFCM|5.0|The series that answers the question &quot;Why in a city of 1 million single men are there only 400 that deserve serious attention?&quot;
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie is about the operation to capture and overthrow of Somalian militia leader, at least that's what the initiative was. Aidid (the leader), and his men were taking the international food supply for themselves by arms which lead to hundreds of thousands of civilians dead from starvation. <BR>   Although, this movie depicted the whole ordeal, it was obviously exaggerated for entertaining purposes. The special effects were great but I have to say that they stole the ideas from the movie \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". The acting could be better at some points where you can see that the soldiers knew where the explosions going to be and dive for cover. <BR>   Overall, I give this movie and 4.5 star. Buy the DVD as it has the extras on it. You might have to watch it a few times to understand everything and turn on the close-captioned decoder/subtitled feature. This movie is a high paced fast action feature with many casts and dialogues so you won't be able to catch them all the first time.<BR>   I've seen people on here writing reviews when they probably only watch it 1 time. They say the movie left out this and that but in fact they're depicted in the movie or at the end with the credits. I watched it about 5 times so far and I haven't been bored by it. Buy a copy on DVD, and you'll thank me that you did.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This cd is awesome.. Pink has a voice that could never be imitated...
B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leppard was one of the most successful bands out of the '80s and one of my very favorite from the decade.  They scored 15 top 40 singles from 1983-1993 and had quite a few radio and MTV favorites that missed the top 40; most of them are represented here.  There has been some complaints about certain songs not being hits, but I've found the chart stats and will show how high they charted.    \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" (video edit)--the most popular Lep song leads off this collection.  A great singalong, heart-pounding rocker  This is also an alternate version to the one on HYSTERIA: it is the video edit which is longer and, IMHO, superior. (peaked at #2)    \\"Photograph\\"--one of their breakthrough PYROMANIA hits: another great rocker with an unforgettable riff written \\"all about Marilyn Monroe\\" as Joe would say. (peaked at #12)    \\"Love Bites\\"--the collection's first ballad is a great one from HYSTERIA. (the band's only #1 single)    \\"Let's Get Rocked\\"--first of two ADRENALIZE tracks is a fun little rocker inspired by THE SIMPSONS (or so Joe says). (peaked at #15)    \\"Two Steps Behind\\"--a standout ballad from THE LAST ACTION HERO soundtrack is an acoustic based track that originally appeared on a B-side! (peaked at #12)    \\"Animal\\"--mid-tempo HYSTERIA rocker that is a rock radio staple even today. (peaked at #19)    \\"Foolin'\\"--second PYROMANIA track is a mysterious ballad/rocker with lots of atmosphere and a great guitar solo (peaked at #28)    \\"Rocket\\" (video edit)--tounge-in-cheek rocker from HYSTERIA which basically lists off titles of great classic rock songs.  Unfortunately it is presented in a shorter edit than the album version.  (peaked at #12)    \\"When Love and Hate Collide\\"--new song for the album is a pretty good ballad that could've used an electric solo, but it's fine as it is. (sadly, peaked only at #58)    \\"Armageddon It\\"--rip-roaring rocker from HYSTERIA and a good one at that. (peaked at #3)    \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\"--the other ADRENALIZE track, this one an average ballad. (peaked at #12)    \\"Rock of Ages\\"--last PYROMANIA track is a memorable bombastic rocker which actually steals it's chorus from the Bible! (peaked at #16)    \\"Hysteria\\"--last song from the album of the same name.  A sort-of ballad performed well. (peaked at #10)    \\"Miss You In a Heartbeat\\"--an okay ballad from RETROACTIVE was a bigger hit in Canada (#4) than America (#39) and that is why it is included.    \\"Bringing on the Heartbreak\\"--only track from HIGH 'N' DRY surprising only peaked at #61, but became a classic rock radio staple due to heavy exposure on early MTV.  There is no \\"Switch 625\\" because it's not played on the radio with it.  Great song anyway.    Well that's it, all the hits.  There are problems: HYSTERIA is over-emphasized (though all were chart hits and it still misses one of those!), nothing from ON THROUGH THE NIGHT (though no songs were chart hits), and misses the other two top 40 tracks from ADRENALIZE (\\"Make Love Like a Man,\\" #36; \\"Stand Up,\\" #34).  But overall, this is a great collection for newcomers and casual fans (and the only place to get the PSSOM video edit on CD).
B00005JKLZ|3.0|\\"The Time Machine\\" is loosely based on H.G. Wells' sci-fi masterpiece, written in 1897. The book was also made into a movie forty years ago [available on DVD at Amazon.com]. Back then, the major studios had decided to cash in on the craze created by independent, low-budget sci-fi and horror films. MGM, for example, produced \\"The Time Machine\\" as well as \\"Forbidden Planet\\". These pictures - sleeker and glossier than anything the independents could make - used what were, at the time, state-of-the-art special effects. Today's version of the Wells classic utilizes the same tools. While the results are at times spectacular, it lacks a key ingredient - a dash of intelligence - that made the earlier version more memorable.<br />The time is the very end of the 19th Century. The place is New York. Alexander Hartegen [Guy Pearce] is a brilliant, absent-minded professor of science who is madly in love. When his fiancée dies tragically, he feels somehow responsible. Sequestering himself in his laboratory for four years, he builds a time machine. His plan is to go back, change the past and prevent his lover's death. When this fails, he realizes that any answer lies in the future. He travels to the New York of the mid-21st Century where he finds the planet in the midst of a catastrophe. The moon is breaking apart, and chunks of it are plummeting to Earth. In this melee he is knocked unconscious and awakens 800,000 years in the future. There he finds that the moon's destruction has caused mankind to split into two different species - one beautiful, innocent and benign, the other hideous and very dangerous. <br />As a fast-paced, mindless adventure, \\"The Time Machine\\" frequently succeeds. To truly enjoy it, you simply have to leave your sense of logic behind. The time travel sequences are beautifully rendered, although the fact that the machine always manages to wind up in the same spot is beyond ludicrous. The creatures who prey upon the pretty people of the future are deliciously gross and mean, but the way they move is not only obviously computer-generated but also in defiance of all know laws of gravity and of physics. Some of the people still speak English, which has not changed one bit in all those years. Think about how it's changed in just the last few hundred years. Archeological remnants of the past, which have apparently sat outside for 8,000 centuries, seem perfectly preserved. And, as to what would REALLY happen to the planet if the moon fell apart, let's not even go there. <br />Maybe it's just me, but sometimes it seems as though the smarter computers get, the dumber action/adventure and sci-fi movies become. It's as though the filmmakers are so infatuated with the gadgets and electronic wizardry that they forget all about the script. Much like the recent remake of \\"Planet of the Apes\\", \\"The Time Machine\\" winds up being fun but entirely forgettable.
B00005JKQX|4.0|Inspite of Russell Crowe, I reluctantly watched this DVD, mostly because of Ron Howard's involvement in the film.  Crowe has a tendency to produce a lack of depth in his characters, especially in his abysmal effort in the lackluster \\"Gladiator\\" film.  In this film, however, he was able to capture the essence of his character, most likely due to the assistance of Ron Howard.  He was also beautifully supported by the extremely attractive and talented Jennifer Connelly.  Howard weaved a tale that left me guessing through more than half of the film what was real and what was imagined.  I was so impressed with the script and the acting, I watched it one night and again the next morning.  Maybe a little sappy at the end but this is a feel good film about a real person overcoming his personal hell to realize greatness. Makes me feel that even with all of our short comings we all have an opportunity if we just look for it.  Not one of those awful action flicks without substance but one that develops not only the look of the characters but their very soul as well.  Some good extra features on the DVD, including deleted scenes with Ron Howard commentary and a second DVD full of extras, makes this a must have DVD.
B000002J20|5.0|Double cd and only 4 songs. Well, the first cd is the best of the two The revealing science of god and the remembering. I remember getting this album from the library and listening to it one time. It's really good..long songs with brillant parts in all of them..like the keyboards in acient giants after the begginng sequence..kind of cosmic.. or the guitar solo in it.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Listen, you have to see this movie. In my opinion, it's the best movie ever made! \\"Stand By Me\\" stars Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, and Kiefer Sutherland. These guys put on the performance of a lifetime. This movie deals with one of the most important things in life... friendship. This movie was directed by Rob Reiner, and was based on the novella \\"The Body\\" by Stephen King. Everytime I watch this movie I get a lump in my thoat. This movie will make you laugh, but it could very well make you cry. If you love drama, get \\"Stand By Me\\"...
B00005JLF5|5.0|What can I say about this gem in the Star Trek franchise that hasn't already been said before? Ira Steven Behr (executive producer/head writer), Ronald D. Moore (co-executive producer) and the rest of the truly fabulous writers on DS9's staff took the most original concept in the franchise since the classic Star Trek and wove a vivid tapestry of intricate story arcs the likes of which will probably never be seen again in a Star Trek series. <br />Unlike other series in the franchise, DS9 didn't revolve around big space battles and ground-breaking visual effects, though the series certainly had its fair share of both. No, DS9 was always about the characters and the stories. Classic Star Trek social themes like racism, euthanasia and the horror of war were explored in great detail. The writers even commented on the state of religion in our world today by using the alien world of Bajor and its peoples relationship with their Prophets. As a Christian man this didn't offend me in any way. On the contrary, it made me happy to finally see Star Trek's writers acknowledge religious themes, and treat them in a fair way.<br />Avery Brooks, as Captain Benjamin Lafayette Sisko, led what is arguably Star Trek's greatest ensemble of actors (though a case can be made for Voyager's excellent cast) through seven seasons of intelligent drama, mixed with the kind of humor we haven't seen since Captain Kirk and his crew visited planet Sigma Lotia II. Yes, their comedy episodes were that good. And like all of the Star Trek series try to do, this series went where no series has gone before when Captain Sisko ascended to become a Prophet himself. I believe Mr. Gene Roddenberry would be proud.<br />When I watch or read Science Fiction I want to not only be entertained, I also want to think and feel. This masterpiece did everything I expect an SF/Fantasy series to do. I would like to thank Rick Berman and Michael Piller for creating DS9, and for having the foresight to bring Ira Steven Behrinto the mix early on. Yes, Deep Space Nine was great Star Trek (probably the most human of the lot), but it was also great SF/Fantasy. And that is the highest compliment I can pay to those who were involved.<br />Every season of this wonderful Star Trek series is definitely worth purchasing on DVD.<br />Season 1: ****<BR>Season 2: ****<BR>Season 3: ****<BR>Season 4: *****<BR>Season 5: *****<BR>Season 6: *****<BR>Season 7: *****
0783114893|5.0|I rented this movie and I was very pleased with it. I thought C. Thomas Howell was great. I think this movie had a great story as well as a great lesson. I definetly recommend this movie if you want a good thiller. I may very well want to buy the DVD edition.
B00005JLDW|4.0|Lots of hateful dragons versus a few stalwart Brits and sassy Yanks on a post-apocalyptic burnt earth battlefield. That's the premise for Reign of Fire. It's better than I'd feared, but it doesn't transcend anything. Note to fantasy writers and film-makers, there seems to be a market for dragons; it appears a great many young'uns were expecting this to be the definitive dragon movie of all time, and it wasn't, and they were disgruntled.   <br />Matthew McConaughey chewed more scenery than the dragons did, but that was okay because it was perversely soporific in places and he did wake me up. There wasn't enough chewing to keep me from cynically noting whopping huge plot holes. Still, this is a story about dragons, for heaven's sakes, not military logistics, and I tried to keep the critical part of my brain stifled, which may explain the tranquilizing effect. The dialects were hard to understand so I gave up worrying about the dialogue and let the pictures tell the story. And while I'm complaining here, I may as well admit that I found the score intrusive rather than supportive.  <br />Okay. Done complaining. I think. On the positive side it's, well, not bad. I enjoyed it. It doesn't pretend to be an epic. It had a nice, consistent feel to it and it didn't feel orphaned the way that movies do when everyone loses interest in them midway through. And of course it had dragons, which are always good for getting the old reptilian brain fired up. I'd wondered if I'd be sympathetic towards the dragons. I wasn't. I wanted them dead.
0783114893|5.0|This was a great movie. It had a great story and a great cast. I thought C. Thomas Howell was great! If your looking for a good thriller, you should definetly pick up &quot;The Hitcher&quot;. It has a great lesson. I rented this movie, but I think it's totally worth the money to buy the DVD. If you like thrillers, you can't miss &quot;The Hitcher&quot;.
0694003611|5.0|There are relatively few words per page, but lots to look at \\"In the great, green room...\\".

I'm glad they haven't updated it a bit.

0679731725|5.0|What does it mean when he denies himself to strangers and tries to pretend to be better than he is?  Stevens is quite spineless, preferring external appearances (Giffen wax, being at the hub) to actual substance (being honest and honorable).  He doesn't protest his employer's dismissal of the Jewish servants.  He pretends that he is of the upper class at the Taylor's.  The father stood up for the General, whom he didn't even like; while his son, Stevens (who liked his employer) denied that he had ever worked for Lord Darlington.<br />What does it mean when he forsakes all emotionality?  His reaction to the death of his father, to the tears of Miss Kenton, and the inability \\"to banter\\" betray an inner misanthropic self devoid of compassion.  He prefers ideas of perfection (honor, dignity and greatness) to gentleness and compassion.  He prefers serving a great man (in outward appearances), rather than being a great man (in his own small way - he could be more compassionate and forgiving, thus becoming a great man himself).  This is reflected in the metaphor of the fake pillar.  A pillar supports (like a butler supports a great man), but this pillar was fake, created for outward appearance only to imitate a way of life that is no more.  He has chosen to live vicariously through his employer and has contented himself with the fantasy that he has actually had a positive impact on the course of human events.<br />How many times in our lives do we act like Stevens?  How many times do we try to act better than we are?  What kind of illusions do we carry around with ourselves about honor, dignity and greatness?  How many times on our jobs do we rationalize behaviors that \\"may be trivial in themselves\\" and turn a blind eye to \\"their larger significance\\"?  How many times do we discount the feelings of other people?  This is a heartbreaking story about making your own mistakes in life (and learning from them), rather than leaving the responsibility for your life to someone else.  As Mr. Stevens learns, trying to correct the mistakes of the past or trying to make up for lost time is impossible.  So many regrets, I cried too.
0060506989|3.0|I have yet to see the movie so I am unable to compare the two. However I know that this book, in the years to come, will serve better as a historical document than a weekend read. The authors take care to mention as many of those who participated in Ia Drang as possible. This slows down the read, but as i said makes it historically significant. The book takes you through the two main parts of the battle, and describes in detail the harsh realities of war. In my opinion this book should be read by history and military buffs, although it would make a great source if you were writing a paper on the Vietnam War.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I Saw Resident Evil the movie in Mexico on the Omni screen with THX sound at 6 floors high and wide its was amazing. now the DVD is here and the movie is a perfect transfer from Cine to DVD. the game to movie transfer was delt with good enough new carictors, new house on the other side of the forist, the train sequence wasdelt with good too as in the second game you see the train leave and there was an endless tunnel behined it so there is where the train comes from the new house. The Hive is the same from the seconed but in the game you could only make it a serten size due to computer memory and time and probably more reasons but on film you can show the full size. The house is an Emergancy Escape house to recive high class personel and to evacuate them. The house also functions as Emergency Entrance to the Hive in cases where fast entrance is needed. In all it was good to see the movie after a 6-7 year weight from one director to an other etc... . The FX were top class, The Sound was done well, The Music was done well, and the Actores were good. The next thing to weight for is the Directors Cut in witch i will sertenly get as well. A definet 5 Stars Movie as is and with the next version the Directors Cut in 4-5 months that would probably be a 10 stars film.

079284632X|1.0|People warned me that this film was graphic.  They told me that it was disturbing.  They explained that the scenes of torture and rape were brutal.  But they never warned me how hideously STUPID this movie is.  Come on, people!  Give me a break.<br />First, I appreciate what Wes Craven was trying to do.  With the obviously 10-20 dollar budget he had, he was trying to show the sadistic madmen intruding upon idyllic small town life and the effect that this can have on \\"ordinary\\" small town people.  I appreciate how he was trying to show the young gir'l parents taking revenge for this brutal crime.  I'm not a horror-phobe, graphic scenes don't intimidate me, I applaud what he was trying to do.  I think the reason that this movie offends me so much is that it so thrououghly ruins its excellant premise.<br />Someone mentioned the scenes of the \\"bumbling cops\\" that are interspersed with the scenes of the young girls being tortured.  What no one mentions is that these scenes totally RUIN any chance the torture scenes had to be disturbing.  And this film has the single WORST score I have EVER heard for any movie.  I have never pushed the mute button on my TV before while watching a movie, but in this case I had developed a migraine from the music, and by the fifth or sixth time I heard those horrible, campy lyrics (you heard me, lyrics--some apparently written specially to go along with the film) I couldn't take it any more.  This is how you know I am a true horror fan willing to give this film a chance--instead of turning the movie off, I muted it.  Besides, I knew that I wasn't going to miss any insightful dialogue by pushing the mute button.  The actors in this movie are so horribly inept that it's difficult to suspend disbelief for any length of time (don't worry, you won't EVER have to remind yourself that it's only a movie, the filmmakers kindly do this for you).<br />Yes, some of the scenes are brutal and disturbing, but every time you start to connect with any of the characters, the film immediately cuts to a scene of \\"comic relief\\" or begins to play that horrible, grating music again.  Come on, Wes Craven!  Even on a first film, you should have known better than this!  These scenes and music are supposed to relieve the tension, but not if they interfere before tension can even be built.<br />And the revenge of the parents.  It almost redeems the rest of the film, because it is graphic and shocking (except that everyone has told me what happens, so I wasn't surprised).  And for once, the male character (the father) is weak and the female character (the mother) is strong, and she gets the job done.  These scenes are effective.  The only things that runied this for me were the major plot holes that occured at about this time in the story.<br />In short, I know people will hate this review for degrading what many consider to be a classic.  I really do appreciate what Wes Craven was trying to do with this film, and I only want to warn people who may want to waste an hour and a half of their lives watching this film.  If you think you have to see it, you should.  But don't say I didn't warn you.  Oh yes, and bring earplugs--that might prevent your mute button from being worn out.e characters, the film immediately cuts to a scene of \\"comic relief\\" or begins to play that horrible, grating music again.

B00004XQP4|5.0|I got this cd having never actually heard a Green Day song before. What I expected was something sounding like Blink 182 or Sum 41, but this kicked ass. This is a great album with clever lyrics (strange in punk) and good music. The key songs in this album have got to be Minority, which is brilliant, castaway and Deadbeat Holiday, which I just can't get out of my head. All the songs on this cd are fantastic and I recommend it to any body regardless of what kind of music you are usually into.

B00005JKJA|2.0|'Mulholland Drive' will not satisfy moviegoers looking for a conventional drama and storyline -- which is to say, among other things, a storyline that reaches any form of logical conclusion.<br />There is nothing ordinary about this film.  It has been described as a cinematic nightmare.  The ambiguity of that description should be inferred.  It has surreal echoes of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and 'Paris Texas'.  It has high standards of cinematography.  The cast does fine work.  Some sub-plots, and the characterisation in them, are exquisite, but they are much more satisfying in isolation than in entirety.<br />'Mulholland Drive' has 'made for Cannes' all over it.  The art house audience might enjoy it.  The wider audience probably emerges feeling that this is what a promising film looks like if the investors lose their nerve before the script doctors finish their job -- or that it fits in a genre of film-maker self-indulgence.  To add to challenges to the sensibilities of most moviegoers, the 'medium level sex scenes' turn out to be lesbian -- a reminder of shortcomings of the current film classification system in providing adequate consumer information.<br />Picture and sound quality on the DVD are excellent, but the disk lacks chapter selection.  Overall, this film deserves just two stars: one for good cinematography and the other for good acting.
0553277472|1.0|Another reviewer said that people who don't like this book would be people who want a lot of action in their novels.  Booo!  Low blow.  I enjoy reading philosophy, but this book was awful. The author is just plain illogical.  He draws ridiculous conclusions. If you are going on a journey of the mind, you should not have a guide who is incapable of thinking straight.  If you love this book, then you will be very comfortable with illogical statements and I recommend you read a book on logical thinking.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion is a much quieter movie than either Pride &amp; Prejudice or Sense &amp; Sensibility.  It begins slowly and requires careful attention initially to understand what is happening.  It opens with the falling financial situation of the Elliots of Kellynch Hall and displays the great vanity of the Baronet and his eldest daughter.  But it is the quiet middle daughter, Anne Elliot, that we are here to watch.  Through early dialog we learn that she is scorned by her elder sister and forgotten by her father.  Only their neighbor Lady Russell sees her value.  But 10 years earlier it was Lady Russell who counseled her to give up an attachment to young sailor &quot;who had only himself to recommend him&quot;.  Now the young sailor is Captain Wentworth, wealthy from the Napoleonic war, and his sister and brother-in-law, an Admiral Croft, are to rent Kellynch Hall.  <br />Amanda Root plays Anne quietly and it is in the small gestures that we come to see her depths: a hand to her face when Wentworth's name is first mentioned, holding a old paper boat with great care as she cleans out Kellynch Hall; gripping a chair to hold herself steady the first time she unexpectedly sees Wentworth; and her expression when her sister cruelly repeats that Wentworth &quot;hardly knew her, she was so changed.&quot;  But we also see her quiet strength when she cares for her constantly complaining sister Mary Musgrove and then nurses her nephew after a fall.  Anne is the quiet one that everyone depends upon.<br />Ciarán Hinds (recently seen as the Russian president in Sum of All Fears) is likewise excellent as the man once scorned by the wealthy Elliots.  He is determined in his coldness toward Anne and likable in his warmth toward the Musgroves.<br />The dinner party scene when the Crofts and Wentworth dine with the Musgroves shines as it exposes each character in turn.  When Mrs. Croft describes her adventures sailing with her husband, you can see in Anne's eyes how she yearns for thislife that she gave up 10 years earlier.  (I finally figured out where I had seen Fiona Shaw, the actress who places Sophie Croft - she also plays Harry Potter's aunt Petunia Dursley.  What a great range this actress has!)<br />The period costumes, location filming, and wonderful music give this movie an authentic feel like other recent Austen films.  Unlike the magnificent 6-hour adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, much of the novel's details are missing from this 2-hour film.  Nor does Persuasion have the spectacle of Sense &amp; Sensibility.  What makes Persuasion wonderful is the quiet drama of this film, the great Austen dialog, and the care given to develop each character from this wonderful novel.

B00006879E|5.0|I first heard Maroon 5 last winter when they opened for Nikka Costa in St. Louis.  My friends and I could not believe how amazing their sound was!  Adam Levine, the lead singer, has a voice so full of soul and emotion that allows him to take any song he performs to a whole new level.  The music is rich and full of soul and energy, the lyrics are personal and gripping and the band members are totally relatable.  These guys are my new favorite boy band and their album is a complete hit!  Look out for them soon because they are going to blow everyone away!
B000002TWN|5.0|D'Angelo created a classic album with his debut that brought new life into soul music and started a new revolution of neo-soul/R&B albums. From the first time I heard this album to today I continue to be amazed at how exceptional this album is and it is definitely my favorite musical album. At 10 songs and approximately 53 minutes long it is a showcase of how beautiful music can be when constructed perfectly. <BR>The album starts off with the clever \\"Brown Sugar\\" a song D'Angelo cleverly creates using love metaphors about his \\"smoking habits\\". Up next is the beautifully constructed \\"Alright\\", a great song about how misunderstandings happen but it is not a big deal because if you truly love each other than you can work through it. On \\"Jonz In My Bonz\\" D'Angelo shows off his vocal talents as he vocally wails many different notes. \\"Me And Those Dreamin' Eyes Of Mine\\" is sure to gains all of the women's respect as he tells the story of a woman who is so beautiful to him that he cannot believe he is not dreaming. \\"Sh--, Damn, MotherF------\\" is a very powerful song as D'Angelo winds a dark tail of a cheating girlfriend over a thumping bass line. \\"Smooth\\" is an unbelievable song as outstanding piano and guitar playing make for intoxicating production, while D'Angelo tells his story of the perfect woman. \\"Cruisin'\\" has a very light feeling to it due to the wonderful orchestra of strings on the song as D'Angelo sings in a very smooth style. \\"When We Get By\\" uses nice rhythmic strings and a piano in the background and is followed by a pleasingly placed trumpet on the hook. On \\"Lady\\" D'Angelo gets some production help from the talented Raphael Saadiq and they create another solid contribution to the album. \\"Higher\\" is a nice slow, relaxed song that again makes use of a mixture of instruments placed within the production. <BR>One of the many strengths of this album is the length of the songs as they average five minutes each and are filled with outstanding singing and a wonderful array of instruments that create songs that are extremely pleasing to listen to. Another extremely impressive aspect of the album is that on the back cover it says \\"composed, written, arranged, produced, and performed by D'Angelo\\". He does virtually every single thing on this album and it makes for an extremely personalized and cohesive album. This is a must for all soul/R&B fans and fans of other genre's of music should really give this album a try as it simply is unbelievable.
6305428425|5.0|ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION is a hilarious comedy favorite starring the fabulous Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow.<br />Romy White (Mira Sorvino - MIGHTY APHRODITE) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow - LUCKY NUMBERS, TV's \\"Friends) are the self-proclaimed outsiders at Sagebrush High in Tucson.<br />When 10 years pass and Romy and Michele receive invites for the 10-year reunion in Tucson, the girls realise that they have done almost zilch with their lives since moving to LA shortly after graduation.  They resort to dressing up like businesswomen and coming up with the \\"foolproof\\" story of having invented the Post-It.  The ruse almost comes off, but not before the girls come face-to-face with their old demons....the \\"A-Group\\"!<br />Full of snappy lines and dead-on performances by Janeane Garofalo, Alan Cumming, and a wonderful supporting cast.<br />I could watch this classic every day.
B000060K4P|5.0|I like this DVD set a lot. Having both ghostbusters 1 and 2 together is covenient and it saves money. The DVD's have a lot of special features including the original featurette and the 1999 featurette. I enjoyed seeing the trailers for the movies and I like the DVD-ROM feature. Ghostbusters 1 and 2 are my all time favorite movies and I enjoyed seeing them on my DVD player.Ghostbusters is funny on a lot of different levels and everyone in my family found something they thought was funny.  The DVD 2-pack is the way to go.
6305095442|5.0|Evil Dead 2 was a good movie especially since this is the first one I have ever seen.  I thought it was a strange movie some parts seemed funny then other parts seemed to be very serious or very scary.  So it is in a way a very confusing movie.  However just like Beetlejuice it uses the infamous claymation.  I love claymation I wished they would still use it in some movies.  Evil Dead 2 was released in 1987 and did well at the box office.  At the end of the movie it lead us into the third movie Army of Darkness.  I recommend this movie.
B00004Z459|1.0|It's a crying shame that \\"rap-metal\\" and \\"nu-metal\\" such as this have so severely tarnished both Heavy Metal and Hip-hop. I'm not like other haters in that I believe it IS DEFINITELY possible to meld both true metal and true hip-hop successfully without degrading or dumbing down either. But Linkin Park and bands like them make that prospect difficult to achieve. The songwriting is good, but it's way overproduced (like everything on top 40 radio these days), repetative, and SOFT... .
B00001ODHJ|4.0|I like this movie a lot but I liked the other two better because the third Evil Dead doesn't follow the storyline of the other two.  The comedy was good and the acting just as good as always.  The other thing I don't like was the cover on certain editions of Bruce Cambell with muscles, I think this is sending the wrong message to teeenage boys because I have a brother who is 15 and he says he works out to be like these muscle men.  Anyways the movie is good and I recommend it.

6305531374|1.0|The Halloween series is a well respected one in the world of horror films.  Its the series we run to when we wish to escape the flat boring teenie bopper horror we are now faced with like Scream and I know what you did last summer... Well not this time.  This new Halloween installment ignores all that has happened past Halloween II but this is not the problem.  It has a flat script that is lacking in its ability to scare, thanks to Scream scribe, Kevin Williamson.  Hasn't he proven to us enough that he cannot write anything scary? The worst abomination is Chris Durand.  This stuntman clearly didnt do his homework, his rendition of Michael Myers is laughable He moves wrong he's much to fast and not at all methodical or creepy.. all in all avoid this entry unless you really enjoy seeing teenie bopper films.
B00003CXN4|3.0|Ok first of all I thought this was an interesting movie that touches on aspects of the U.S. war on drugs that most probably don't think about.  It deals with the effects it can have on families, friends, parents, cops, etc etc but frankly 911 has rendered certain elements of this outdated.  The connection of international terror to drug trafficking particularly heroin makes it very import that we continue to fight it.  Where I'm critical of this movie is that I think it gives a somewhat skewed vision of reality and it's important that folks remember this is Hollywood and Michael Douglas is not portraying a real life drug czar. <br />The movie ends on a note that fighting drugs is not worth the trouble despite all the damage that has been depicted throughout the movie.  I'm not sure what exactly the people who made this are suggesting, that we decriminalize hard drugs like cocaine and heroin?  They seem to suggest that white people who sell drugs should go to jail but don't and that people who buy and use drugs shouldn't be dealt with in the legal system because they are a hapless lot.  While this may in fact be a valid point in some respects the movie really does fail to deal with the societal situation in a bigger sense.  Basically it's a movie, if you want to know more about the drug problem in America I suggest you read a book or two because they miss a lot here and the view is a bit simplistic.<br />The movie is also notable for the lack of \\"dark complexions\\" in the cast.  The only major African American in the movie is a good guy and cop granted but other than that blacks get portrayed as being only marginal players in the drug trade and as shiftless gun toting violent thugs for the most part.  In the movie the major bad guys are either white drug dealers or Hispanics and maybe this is true somewhere but to my eyes it seems a bit strange.  I'm sure that drugs are tearing up white peoples lives too but this movie does nothing to address the social issues surrounding drug addiction in the black community.  It is of course good to note the movie addresses the fact that lots of white people frequent poorer black neighborhoods because they know the drugs can be had there and thereby perpetuate and exacerbate the issue.<br />Benicio Del Toro on the other had gives a very good performance and the \\"Mexican\\" segments in general are the highlights of the movie in my opinion.  Bencicio plays a Mexican cop who is drawn into the corruption the drug trade has created south of the border.  He plays a willing participant but also a man with a conscience that is not totally at ease with what he's seeing.  Is he a good guy or a bad guy(I'm not saying)?  <br />What they are saying overall is that U.S. drug policy is largely ineffectual, corruption is rampant in the police and army in Mexico, and meanwhile addiction is tearing up peoples lives.  It does not suggest any firm alternatives except perhaps where they touch on AA and drug treatment options and that is of course a better option than prison in many cases.  <br />It's a serious movie on a political subject that raises important issues but doesn't really address them with any kind of solid alternative vision.
B00005JL3A|5.0|The subject of this review says it all. This is the first actual SCARY movie I have seen in a long time. This is the first movie to actually make me jump more than once and not at some lame effect. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire movie viewing history and I would have to rate it 6 stars if I could. Buy this movie, you wont regret it. The special effects and the plot behind it was just f'in awesome. Again, i dont know why people put this movie down for not being more like the game, it wasnt supposed to be, it was supposed to be a Prequel to the game and it is a very nice one. The movie left alot of room for a sequel which I surely hope comes out soon as I cant wait for it. Welp, there's my two cents :) Hope it helps :D
B00003CXTG|4.0|When you read about the Pearl Harbor attack in history books you see the figures on how many died and what ships where hit but when you see the reenactment of the battle in this movie it will give you a further sense of why it was such an outrage.  Keep in mind that as bad as it looks on screen it's nothing compared to what the reality was when war came to Hawaii and to an unprepared U.S. Navy.<br />Writing as someone who is a graduate student in the field of history I like to see movies like this come out because it raises awareness that these things are not boring and that people had lives just as they do today that were torn apart for years in the war.<br />That being said much of the movie does not revolve around the actual battle but rather introducing you too and getting you to like the group of soldiers and nurses who eventually witness and bear the brunt of the Japanese attack.  There is a certain amount of the standard Hollywood mechanisms of romance, heroism, and special effects wizardry that probably does go astray from what the reality was but I think it works well in this film.  The story line has humor, romance, and sadness because of the characters some of whom are killed in the course of the film are not the ones you expect.<br />It's also cool to see that the people who made this decided to feature and acknowledge the contributions of US armed forces female personnel in the war.  True they were not front line combatants as such but in war the front line can shift and does not distinguish between combatant forces and support forces so they were very brave as well.  It's also worth noting that some of the scenes were in fact filmed at the very location of the attacks.  I believe it was Ben Affleck that commented you could still see the pockmarks from the bullets fired by the Japanese in the concrete as they strafed U.S. personnel on the ground.  They also touch on the role of blacks in the film, on the battleships they were primarily galley workers but as with the nurses became front line combatants in the battle and shed their blood just like everyone else aboard.<br />This is a movie that is rated PG-13 and I would say it probably does push the envelop on R rated because of the graphic battle and hospital scenes although they are a relatively small part of the film overall.  Younger children might possibly be disturbed by what is depicted and probably either should not see it or should watch it with a parent who can explain things and reassure them.  I say this partly because of the uncertainty facing the country at the time I write this following less than a year after the September 11 attacks.  <br />As the other great attack on America in modern times this story is particularly poignant.<br />Although the movie is principally about the Pearl Harbor attack it also covers the Doolittle raid on Tokyo.  There was talk about the Japanese actually invading the west coast in those days and yet FDR ordered a symbolic attack that resulted in the bombing of Tokyo by a handful of U.S. bombers.  <br />Bottom line I like the movie and while it is long on story and short on historical accuracy in some respects it is still a terrific vehicle to introduce audiences to a significant historical event.  \\"December 7, 1941, a day which will live in infamy\\" (Franklin Delano Roosevelt) just as September 11, 2001 will.<br />I recommend this movie at least as a rental especially if you don't know a lot about the battle that brought the U.S. into World War II and changed the world and would like to hear and see a little more.
0316666343|5.0|Less than 2 years ago, our 13-year-old son Daniel died - very unexpectedly, of a massive asthma attack while on a school retreat.  I purchased \\"The Lovely Bones\\", knowing the book's premise, for our 17-year old daughter to read.  Not sure if the content of the book would be too close to our actual experience for Julia to handle, I decided to read it first (this is the first time I have done any pre-reading, as Julia is perfectly able to decide on her own whether or not to read a book, but still. . . ).  I was very surprised to find myself riveted to the book, and unable to stop reading it until finished.  While I, like many earlier reviewers, found the end a little too contrived, I certainly feel that the book's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.  <BR>   About 6 months after Daniel's death, I had a dream that portrayed a visit by my husband, daughter, and myself to Daniel in what was clearly \\"his heaven\\" - also containing a school in a residential neighborhood, a \\"foster family\\" which apparently served as his \\"home away from home\\", and - most positively - a large number of new friends. This was the best aspect of his Heaven, as far as I was concerned, as Daniel had been troubled for his entire life by an inability to make many friends, and here he was almost too busy to visit with his family because of wanting to get on with his activities with his buddies!<BR>   I have often offered the circumstances of Daniel's death - fast and probably painless (as a friend remarked, \\"Daniel doesn't know he's dead yet\\"), and that he was able to donate many of his organs - as probable explanations to those who find me so \\"upbeat\\" since he died.  I contrast this situation with other, well-publicized child kidnappings, murders, and (worst, in my opinion) those events which are never resolved.<BR>   Nonetheless - some aspects of the narrative hit home, and I found myself tearing up more over this fictional account than our own all-too-real loss!  I was forced to wonder what wouldDaniel think if he is able to follow our lives, as Susie followed those of her family and friends.  Does he still pine for the girl he had a crush on?  Is he sorry that he can't see the sequal to his beloved MIB movie?  Is he able to eat his fill of cheese pizzas, now that he doesn't have to take at least one bite of his mother's sometimes too-exotic vegetarian experiments? Does he find it annoying that, after years of refusing to allow pets, we now have 3 crazy cats, as a result of Julia \\"needing\\" them? Is he bemused by the grief-stricken responses to his death by those same classmates he had sought as friends for so many years?  <BR>   I am awaiting Julia's response to the book.  In particular, I want to know how \\"genuine\\" the characterizations of Susie and Lindsay appear to her.  I will suggest that she submit a review herself, so we will all know the answer.
B000063TNH|2.0|This movie is interesting in the way that it portrays the cross section of real life as opposed to what the government has been putting forth.  While it is a timely subject given our ongoing efforts in the area I'm afraid the whole feel of it and the acting just did not work for me.<br />Douglas does his usual good work and there are good performances by others but perhaps it's more just the way it was directed.  It did not strike me as having a feel of authenticity, it was too obviously contrived.  It strikes me as not being one of those movies that makes you want to get inside it and believe, it does not create the sort of empathy feeling one might have for a Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan (admittedly a tough comparison of course).<br />Possibly worth a rental but with all the tens of thousands of titles out there I have to say I would not rate it terribly high.  No serious political commentary, no memorable or outstanding theatrical element.
B0000683WG|5.0|Quoth Marc Bolan from &quot;Spaceball Ricochet&quot; from this album.<BR>Indeed, one of the reasons I gladly purchased a rare lefty<BR>Les Paul guitar recently is that I knew Marc favored his cherry<BR>sunburst Les Paul for the years he recorded unbelievable classics<BR>like The Slider and Electric Warrior, which is more than reason<BR>enough to get one.  As for this new deluxe reissue of The Slider,<BR>I purchased it in nyc recently after considering getting a more<BR>streamlined UK pressing, but this &quot;boxed&quot; edition is the one to get--if you're a Bolan/Rex fan there is no other edition now,<BR>because this one contains an entire bonus disc of the &quot;alternate&quot; Slider, containing alternate takes of the songs and<BR>also an abundance of b-sides and demos such as &quot;Sunken Rags&quot;<BR>and &quot;Thunderwing,&quot; which could have been on the original album<BR>given the strengths of those tracks.  The sound on this reissue<BR>of TREX's classic 1972 follow-up to the equally massive Electric<BR>Warrior is wondrous in its remastered state, I'm sure the drums<BR>and crunchy bass and guitars on &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; never sounded better.  I can't recommend this album more highly--if you're a true rock and roll fan you need this album and now you definitely<BR>need this glorious edition of it--it also comes with great artwork and a nice booklet with Marc's intriguing period comments on the album tracks.  When Marc Bolan died, rock and roll tragically lost a true wizard, a true star.  He continues<BR>to teach us how to boogie and he teaches me how to play guitar<BR>better everytime I play his albums.  What more can one ask?<BR>Go Slide....
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I loved the movie! I first rented it with my mom thinking it would be boring, but i watched it over and over. It is completly and amazingly brilliant, all of the actors/actresses played their parts wonderfully. I recomend it to anyone, but make sure you have plenty of time because you will want to watch it over and over. I talked about it for days!
B00001SIES|5.0|I have to admit that I was drawn to Muse at first because I thought they sounded like Radiohead, but after buying this cd and listening to it many many many times, I'm finding new reasons to name Muse as one of my top-five favorite bands.  The music is fantastic and all the songs have something a little different to offer than the one before, so playing the album isn't like listening to the same song over and over.  I like Matthew Bellamy's voice, and his range is amazing.  Definitely a good cd worth your time and money.
6305428042|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, although it would probablly not be on my top ten list if I had seen it now, as I teenager, I loved it when I first saw it. I rented this movie for my one of my birthday parties, probablly a two or three years after it came out (my 7th or 8th birthday), and about 5 birthdays after that one. It soon became a classic, me, along with all myr friends, came to know it by heart. It also fit perfectlly with the time of year (my birthday is October 25th). I think that &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; is the best non-horrific films of all time, and I would deffinately recommend it to anyone.
B00005OAA6|4.0|Victoria Beckham is the last of the Spice Girls to release her solo album offering several multi-genre tracks. After being the voice that no one ever heard in the worlds best selling group, Victoria finally unleashes an album that is superb, showing that she has probably one of the best voices out of all of the members from the Spice Girls. It's a sad lose that Virgin Records dropped her before letting her music reach the US. With this album, Victoria offers great ballads and an abundant load of great danceable, R&B influenced pop songs. <br />Track Highlights<br />1.) Not Such An Innocent Girl - The beat to this song sounds like it came out of the Destiny's Child vault of beats, but yet it still has it own original sound. This song is dance friendly with its beat and sexual lyrics. This was the first single from Victoria's album and the video for is fantastic.<br />2.) A Mind Of Its Own - The lyrics to this power ballad are a bit generic and mediocre. However, this song is extremely catchy and the lyrics will grow on you. Victoria's vocals could have been a bit better but this is still a pretty fun track to listen to. This track was good enough to make the cut for Victoria's second single. <br />3.) That Kind Of Girl - This track is drenched with a mid-tempo R&B beat. This track is somewhat of a ballad but it's a bit faster. The lyrics could be better but they aren't too shabby. Victoria's voice sounds beautiful in this track, I guess she's just \\"That Kind Of Girl\\"<br />4.) Like That - This is an up-tempo track featuring an R&B/Pop beat. This track sounds somewhat reminiscent of the Spice Girl's track \\"Holler\\", however, I think this track is more creative. Victoria's vocals have that transformed, robotic like sound when it comes to the chorus but when it's back to the rest of the song her vocals simply sound beautiful. <br />5.) Girlfriend - This song also features an R&B sound but I think it leans more to the sound of pop. This song is pretty up-tempo and fun to listen to being that it has a great chorus and sexy lyrics. Victoria's vocals are extremely aggressive and confident in this song.<br />6.) Midnight Fantasy - This track is one of those ballads over a dance beat and with this song it simply works. Victoria's vocals make the lyrics of this song sound so sexual and surreal. <br />7.) I.O.U. - This song is a beautiful ballad and it's kept pretty simple. I think this is by far the best ballad on this album, not because it has a great beat or that she sounds great but because the lyrics are so true and beautiful. All that you do, Victoria owes it to you.<br />8.) No Trix, No Games - This track is like that of track four, they sound somewhat similar and the meaning is somewhat the same. I think the chorus to this song could be just a bit more creative but it still sounds pretty good.<br />9.) I Wish - This song was rumored to be the third single from Victoria's album before Virgin Record's dropped her. This song is definitely worthy of being a single and the chorus sounds so beautiful and catchy. The beat to the song is very Destiny's Child like and the lyrics even sound like them. Victoria's voice sounds fantastic and passionate in this track.<br />10.) Watcha Talkin' Bout - This track has an R&B sound and the song is a bit mid-tempo. The lyrics to this song are pretty creative and the chorus is pretty catchy as well. <BR> <BR>11.) Unconditional Love - This is yet another ballad and both the lyrics and beat sounds pretty generic. The only thing good about this track is that Victoria's voice sounds beautiful.<br />12.) Every Part Of Me - This ballad has a baby giggling at the beginning of it giving away the fact of this song obviously being dedicated to her child. The lyrics to this track are pretty good but I think this track could have had more of a ballad sound to it.<br />This album shows that Victoria hasn't forgotten her roots from the Spice Girls but yet she is moving forward with her talent. If you want to see Victoria on a different level other than that of the Spice Girls than I suggest you check this album out.
B0000640VO|5.0|What can I say about this movie? It's brilliant. Perfect. Flawless. Rather without blemish. Am I overselling it a bit?<br />Perhaps, but it IS a remarkable movie, an incredibly sweet, touching little story about a woman who takes it upon herself to go about changing people's lives for the better, but finds herself afraid to take bold steps in her own life.<br />In an interview on the DVD Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet said this film came about out of a desire he had to bring something positive into the world. He succeeded beautifully. In addition to a tender story about love and courage, this is a strikingly visual film. Jeunet's use of color and angles leaps off the screen the way very few American movies do. It's a bizarre film, but it is wonderfully comprehensible and something any film afficionado or believer in true love really should see right away.
B00005OAIE|5.0|With his supremely melodic music and luscious lyrics, John Mayer's delicious major-label debut \\"Room For Squares\\" provides spiritual solace to anyone who empathizes with the Mayer-defined \\"quarter-life crisis\\" time of life.  His refreshing alt-rock with a twist of jazz provides a musical outlet for those of us who desperately need relief from the well packaged but content-empty drivel currently prevalent in pop music.<br />On \\"No Such Thing,\\" the most invigorating opener since U2's \\"Zoo Station,\\" Mayer goes through the emotions of a man in his early twenties who \\"never lived the dreams of the prom kings / And the drama queens\\" and \\"just found out there's no such thing as the real world / Just a lie you've got to rise above.\\"  Gorgeous lyrics aside, the emotions that the music itself evokes makes me want to \\"scream at the top of my lungs\\" just like he wants to do.<br />\\"Why Georgia\\" goes through the questioning that an individual experiences when truly moving away from home for the first time.  I asked myself the same question that Mayer asks when I first moved away from home (although I didn't articulate it quite so beautifully):  \\"Am I living it right?\\"<br />\\"My Stupid Mouth\\" talks about the feelings we all must have when we say something stupid, which causes a \\"social casualty.\\"  Will any of us ever always remember to \\"think before speaking\\"?<br />The emotionally and sexually sensual \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\" describes what Mayer wants to do with his yet unexplored lover:  \\"Discover me / Discovering you.\\"  Here his poetry demonstrates that he understands how to be the lover that women desperately want (surely I'm not alone!):  \\"I'll never let your head hit the bed / Without my hand behind it.\\"  This song should be required listening for all men who are truly pursuing a woman.<br />Each of the 13 tracks on this work evokes emotions that are all different but still similar -- they all have something to do with discovery in some form.  As I have listened to John Mayer for the last few months, I have discovered a few things of my own:  (1) There *is* room for squares (count me in, as I have always been there!), and (2) we can expect nothing but more rare brilliance from John Mayer in the years to follow.n Mayer for the last few months, I have discovered a few things of my own:  (1) There *is* room for squares (count me in, as I have always been there!), and (2) we can expect nothing but more rare brilliance from John Mayer in the years to follow.

B000068OCS|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi seems to be the first and absolutely best of the whole genre of movies based on imagery and music (no dialogue). <BR>This is probably due to the substandard music, poor match to scenes in the movies and less interesting or outright depressing subjects in movies that followed Koyaanisqatsi (Powaqatsi, Baraka, etc.) <BR>This movie stands out by doing everything the right way. Captivating images in synergy with powerful compositions by Glass. No cliches. <br />I must have watched it 5 times over the years, and finally bought a tape on ebay. Still I'm thinking of dvd, only I wish the release was made in two formats: widescreen and normal.
B000023X9W|4.0|Although this is not Neil Young's best record, and does not contain his strongest writing, it is quite the enjoyable record for a fan. This album is often compared to After The Gold Rush - allegedly by Neil himself - and, while it does contain a vague similarity to some of the songs on that album (say, Tell Me Why, I Believe In You, and Cripple Creek Fairy), it is much more of a minimalist album (it was originally intended to be a true solo album, featuring only Neil and Neil alone), without the pounding piano work that dominated that album, and without any long, electric jams such as Southern Man. The sound is actually closer to Harvest or Harvest Moon (particularly the latter), with a bit of the country-ish touches of Old Ways. The songs are generally straight-forward (Daddy Went Walkin' having almost the feel of a nursery rhyme, perhaps akin to something from Bob Dylan's Under The Red Sky album; and Buffalo Springfield again has a vanity and nostalgic bent to it that most people would've probably thought was below Neil), and do not contain his most complex lyrics. However, the songs are all pleasant, easy listens, and quite enjoyable to the fan of Neil's mellower tunes. Standouts include the title track (written way back in 1982), Razor Love, The Great Divide, and Without Rings.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|It's about TIME this movie was made. It's the SECOND version of the book to be filmed, and having to wait so long TICKED me off. We WATCH it all the time. The DIGITAL effects are very cool. It's become HOUR favorite movie!<BR>I put MORLOCKS on my video cabinet, so nobody would take my copy of this awesome movie!
B00003CXBK|4.0|It's somewhat ironic that a few reviewers have said this movie looks like a Disney movie when Hayao Miyazaki is widely known as a person who passionatly hates Disney.<br />The movie itself is what you would expect from someone like Hayao Miyazaki--however, this movie is pretty much forgoten here in Japan.<br />My only complaint would have to be the English translation, the movie loses a lot of meaning when it is seen in English. I strongly suggest it be seen in Japanese. There is so much in the language that cannot be reproduced in any translation.
B00005JKZT|5.0|As with all of the previous reviews, I'm chomping at the bit for The Two Towers to be released.  After seeing Fellowship of the Ring, I enjoyed the movie, but I think that so much can be lost if the book is not read, since they in general are better than the movie.  Lo and behold how accurately Jackson stuck with the book, which is, after all, one of the greatest works of fiction of the century.  Only Tom Bambadil stands as left in out among major characters.  The Two Towers, if a comparison may be drawn, seems a lot like Empire Strikes Back (I love Star Wars too) in that it's grittier, darker, and moodier than the first installment.  The Battle at Helms' Deep looks to be a highlight, and I look forward to meeting Eomer and Theoden.  I will not spoil the ending, even though I much anticipate the emotion that the actors will use in that scence.  It's truly one of the most heart-rending in the whole story.  Most of all, Gollum, who was rarely seen in Fellowship, plays a MAJOR role in the second tale.  I really want to see if the develop him as much as I'd like...he'll be an interesting character to watch.  From the trailer itself, and not just the books, the Battle at Helms' Deep looks awesome.  A veritable sea of orcs, 10,000 strong against thousands of men.  A best of all, in the middle of this turbulent battle, Legolas and Gimli have a contest going on, lol!  Watch the previews, buy your tickets way ahead of time, arrive way ahead of time, and feast your eyes on what's sure to be one of the year's best movies!
B0000640VO|5.0|This was the best movie that I've seen in years...usually subtitling bothers me, but it didn't seem to be an issue at all because the camerawork, the effects, the story, and the acting were so flawless. Buy it!
1558216847|4.0|I want to belive Slavomir Rawicz's story, but the complete lack of substantiating facts makes me highly doubt it.  A very good discussion group has emerged where we discuss his story and compare notes.  As of July, 2002, Slavomir Rawicz is still alive and corresponds with us...  The group welcomes believers and sketics alike ...
B000002L68|5.0|The incredibly successful soundtrack to the equally successful movie, Purple Rain is also notable as the album that got Tipper Gore to start her PMRC. Apparently the lyrics of \\"Darling Nikki\\" were too much for her. Anyway, Prince worked closely with a backing band (The Revolution), and it works in every way. There are distorted guitars, arena-rock anthems, funky calls for sexual abandon, angry love songs, and spiritual redemption. It's divided among rock, dance, and slow ballads, and sometimes even combines the genres (\\"The Beautiful Ones\\"). A terrific dance track with no bass line (!), \\"When Doves Cry,\\" and the rocking \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" both hit #1, and the title track, a lovely guitar ballad, peaked at #2.
B0000560XI|5.0|I appreciate latin music, but normally wouldn't buy it (no hable espanol!).  Buena Vista is my first, and I haven't been dissapointed.  Great music, especially if you pick it up on DVD-audio.  Feels like you're sitting in the middle of the street in Havana listening to these guys.  After listening to this disc, along with some other DVD-Audio's, I can't understand why the format hasn't taken off more!
B0000508U6|5.0|I almost bought the &quot;Yellow&quot; single, but since I had some extra cash, I went ahead and bought the entire CD on a whim. I'm glad I did. I never got into Parachutes until about a week ago, though. I had made the stupid mistake of not listening to the entire album straight through; instead, I'd put it on track 5 and listen to &quot;Yellow&quot; a few times, not bothering to hear anything else. Then one rainy Saturday afternoon, when I was bored as hell and playing Solitaire, I began listening to Parachutes on my headphones. I was amazed at how consistently beautiful and melancholy it was. There isn't even one bad song. I can't distinguish favorite tracks, as the album works as a cohesive unit, but I can definitely say they're all excellent. The opener &quot;Don't Panic&quot; is lovely and melodic with an oddly catchy chorus (&quot;We live in a beautiful world, yeah we do yeah we do&quot;). &quot;Shiver,&quot; &quot;Spies&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot; boast wonderful dynamics changes, and even the mournful 46-second ditty of a title track is beautiful and a great intro into the ethereal &quot;High Speed.&quot; &quot;Trouble,&quot; &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;We Never Change&quot; are probably the album's saddest songs, but I don't really consider Parachutes all that depressing. It certainly has some downcast themes on it, like unrequited love, but it has a few somewhat uplifting songs, such as &quot;Everything's Not Lost.&quot; Parachutes is highly recommended. Can't wait to see what Coldplay's next album is going to be like...

B00005JKLZ|4.0|This movie is very complicated to explain. The first time I saw it, I hated it. HATED it. But, after I was thinking about for a while, I couldn't figure WHY I hated it. There wasn't really any reason to hate it. The story couldn't be bashed, since it's the same story that H.G. Wells wrote so long ago, it had great special effects, GOOD acting, good music, no tid-bit to pick out honestly, that's terrible. But, then I realized that it was the ending which threw me off. So, I just recently rented it, and it was much better. I think it's one of those rare films where the first time you see it, you think it's terrible, but the second time it gets better, the third time it gets better yet, and so on. But, really, it is a good movie. But, for those of you who hated it, and only saw it once, I think you should give it another chance, with an open mind. Unless you hate Guy Pearce. Then, there's no hope. But, if you like Guy Pearce, like the story, saw it and went &quot;bla&quot;, try it again....You might find your opinion of it alters...So, in conclusion, I gave the movie four stars, because it is an overall good movie. If it hadn't been for the fact that it's one of those 'aquired tastes' movies, I'd have given it five.

B000060P79|5.0|Wow, what a wonderful Album. no wonder they're getting huge attention. scooby doo soundtrack, the new guy soundtrack, WB, six flags...man tehse guys are EVERYWHERE, and i love it. i HIGHLY recommend this album, and going to their website [...] check it out, they're DEFINITLEY worth it!!
B00005QG9J|5.0|Morning View is an excellent CD.  It is, however, rather disheartening for me to witness how mainstream Incubus is becoming.  To see this album show up on listmania lists along with the likes of Britney Spears and to know that other girls like Incubus just because Brandon is \\"hott\\" is just sickening.  Still, I don't let that unfortunate reality lessen my enjoyment of Morning View.<br />The tracks are uniformly wonderful, and it's truly impossible for me to single out favorites.  <br />It opens with 'Nice to Know You,' which is a great, although often mis-interperated, song with some really neat lyrics.  <br />Then comes 'Circles,' which has an awesome guitar riff that to me recalls some of those on Make Yourself.  <br />'Wish You Were Here' is of course the song that many casual listeners have heard.  Some devoted Incufans dislike this piece somewhat, largely because of its mass appeal (allusion to 'Drive' not intended :P ) but I think it's a beautifully done song with perfect lyrics.  <br />'Just a Phase' is a slowly-building song 'about the blessing in disguise that is temporaryism.'  <br />'11am' is a very well written and well performed song about longing to be able to go back and re-do things.  <br />Initially I was put off by the distorted guitar on 'Blood on The Ground' but now I really love it.  Very clever lyrics, a little on the angry side for Incubus, but great nonetheless.  <br />Next up... ah, 'Mexico.' :-)  Beautiful song, meaninful lyrics, my favorite to play on my acoustic guitar.  <br />'Warning' is another single that's doing well.  Advises you to be aware what's going on around you and not let your life pass you by.  <br />'Echo' is an extremely sweet and melodic song.  \\"Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you...\\" simply inspirational.  <br />'Have You Ever' is a nice harder song.  I love the variety with which they place tracks. :P  <br />'Are You In' baffles me.  Really.  I never in my life imagined that an Incubus song would say \\"It's so much better when everyone is in, are you in?\\"  That's just strange.  Entirely uncharacteristic lyrics aside, I love the vocals and it's a really fun song to listen to.  <br />'Under My Umbrella' contains my favorite individual lines on this album: \\"If this is right, I'd rather be wrong.  If this is sight, I'd rather be blind.\\"  Right on!!!  This song seems like a thematic counterpart to S.C.I.E.N.C.E.'s 'Favorite Things.'  <br />Last but certainly not least is 'Aqueous Transmission.'  What can I say... absolutely gorgeous song.  Beautiful, perfectly-suited lyrics, awesome experimentation with neat instruments.   I listen to it at night as I fall asleep.  It's such a relaxing song.  To me it exemplifies Incubus' range... they can excel at fantastic louder masterpieces like 'Certain Shade of Green,' 'Make Yourself,' 'Glass,' 'Idiot Box,' 'Out From Under,' etc, and then turn around and pull off beautiful calmer works like 'Aqueous Transmission,' 'Echo,' 'I Miss You,' 'Wish You Were Here' and the like.  They're so diverse and still good at all of it.  From the early loud, funny, jazzy, silly Enjoy Incubus, to the lyrically *astounding,* genius, and motivating S.C.I.E.N.C.E., to the flawless, profound, and inspiring Make Yourself, to the musically mature and melodic Morning View, I love it all.<br />The supremely talented individuals of Incubus are without a doubt my favorite musicians.  My life wouldn't be the same without their music, and I'm so glad they've been able to share their gifts with the world.  ;-)
B000059R8Y|4.0|especially his version of &quot; Ain't Gonna Stand for It&quot;. Far superior to Stevie Wonder's original.
2067002627|5.0|This is a great map of the Normandy area with locations, dates, routes, sectors, etc. of the invastion marked on it. It even has a short timeline. Some of the overprinting can be hard on the eyes and the amount of detail can be overwhelming but it is still very well done. Very useful if you are visitng the area or just want to hang it on your wall for show or for use as a reference while you read.
B000066I6N|5.0|I have loved Robert Plant since the first time I heard him on the first Led Zep album.  There is no one who does it better   interpreting a song whether or not it is rock or a ballad.  On this CD the magic is even deeper and more nuanced - if that is possible - and his premier voice and stylings yield even more potent magic.  His new band is flawless.   <br />Songs that I will play over and over on this CD include the exquisite &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;; &quot;Win my train fare home&quot; which is so poignant that it brings a lump to the throat; and the very best performance of Jesse Colin Young's &quot;Darkness, Darkness&quot; that has ever been recorded without exception.  Robert can be as intimate with the mike as a whisper and make you ache with a longing that is hard to describe. Robert is a true master of nuance and mood.  <br />Plant is just so amazing when he rocks your socks off with his powerful voice especially when he kicks up the amplitude and stuns the listener with his immense range.  He is absolutely the best when he rolls into rock mode as he demonstrates how real rock music should sound. On the ballads he reveals that he is a passionate man through his passionate delivery and he takes you on a real trip into memory land. I absolutely adore him.
B00003CWTI|1.0|And yes, I did \\"get it\\", all of the artsy, symbolistic nuances to appease our pretensions to erudition, but I think movies are a form of entertainment, and should be that first.  If they can also manage to be artsy and carry a message, so much the better, but the message should never come at the expense of entertainment.<br />What this movie lacked most was an editor.  An editor for the script, an editor for the film.  There were entire scenes and subplots that served no purpose to the film, and were left unresolved at the end.  And one of the most cardinal rules of writing is broken here - \\"never cheat the reader\\".  What is meant by this is, don't just throw in something at the climax or denoument of a story that comes out of nowhere, and is incongruous to the rest of the story.  That invariably infuriates people, and is no different here.  Even if the ludicrousness of the amphibian-laden ending does sometimes happen in nature, I found it more than just a little troubling that none of the characters seemed to question it.  Maybe it was just a catalyst to spur resolution, and if the characters don't question it, then neither should I?  Fine, then next time, please insert a flashing sign that says \\"suspend disbelief here\\" for us non-arthouse crowd types.
B00005ATQD|1.0|I'm sad this was Kubrick's last movie.  He was one of the greatest directors of all time.  It's sad that his last movie was worse than both Ishtar and Battlefield Earth!  I would give it negative five stars if I could!  The piano keys alone repeating over and over again make this stinker one of the worst movie experiences any human has ever had!  No wonder Tom and Nicole got divorced after appearing in this travesty!
B00005RVRL|5.0|Having stumbled across DMB a few years ago, I have since become their biggest fan in Scotland, however as the band have yet to make their Scottish debut it isn't often that I get the opportunity to listen to live performances.<BR>The second CD on this album is a must for all DMB fans who enjoy the different jam sounds of the band playing live - especially Satelite - an unbelievable version which I have been playing over and over again for the past nine months.  <BR>If you don't already have this album  BUY IT NOW!

B000000WA4|5.0|Let me just say that this is the Smashing Pumpkins best album; regardless of what anyone else tells you. Yes! It's even better than Siames Dream. The entire album clocks around 2 hours and it never gets dull. Billy Corgan is by far one the best songwriters, and the rest of the band is brillant as well. The smashing pumpkins are easily the best band of the 90's. Here is my take on the album.<br />Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness - 5/5 - Great soft piano song. It is very sad as well. <br />Tonight, Tonight - 5/5 - A little louder than mellon collie but still a great song.<br />Jellybelly - 4/5 - Probubly the weakest song on the cd. It has a great chorus though.<br />Zero - 5/5 - A pumpkins classic. Great beat.<br />Here Is No Why - 5/5 - Awsome lyrics and music \\"May the king of gloom be forever doomed\\".<br />Bullet With Butterfly Wings - 5/5- The music is better than the lyrics but it still rocks.<br />To Forgive - 5/5 - Another soft song like Mellon Collie.<br />An Ode To No One - 5/5 - It has a great drive and rebellious lyrics. <br />Love - 4/5 - Not too bad. The second weakest but its still good.<br />Galapogs - 5/5 - This is one of the best songs on the cd. Great lyrics. You can just feel the pain in Corgans voice.<br />Muzzle - 5/5 - Another great song on CD 1. Probubly the best. <br />Pocelina Of Vast Oceans - 5/5 - Great chorus!<br />Take Me Down - 5/5 - This is a song you won't like the first time you hear it but once you hear it a few times you will realizes its a classic!<br />Where Boys Fear To Tread - 5/5 - Good Song! Its a loud one!<br />Bodies - 5/5 - Probubly my favorite song on CD 2 besides 1979. Another great loud song!<br />Thirty - Three - 5/5 - I love this song but I have no clue what it means.<br />In The Arms Of Sleep - 5/5 - A sad song but it is probubly Corgans best songwriting.<br />1979 - Ah! At Last the best song on CD 2. A True Rock Classic.<br />Tales Of A Scorched Earth - 2/5 - I don't really like this song that much. This is probubly there worst song.<br />Thru The Eyes Of Ruby - 5/5 - One of my all time favorite songs not just Pumpkins songs.<br />Stumbline - 4/5 - Its the calm before the storm!!!<br />X.Y.U. - 5/5 - Sense this is the loudest song besides Tales of a scorched earth. I think Marilyn Manson did this in concert with them???<br />We Only Come Out At Night - 5/5 - One of the best on CD 2. <br />Beautiful - 5/5 - Good Song!<br />Lily (My One And Only) - 5/5 - A cool intro on the drums. I like the lyrics too.<br />By Starlight - 5/5 - This is one of my favoirte Pumpkins songs.<br />Farwell and Goodnight - 5/5 - A great soft closing song.<br />Well there you have it. If you don't own this cd you really need to get it. It blows Siamese Dream right out of the water.
B00003CY6M|2.0|This movie spreads all the wrong ideas about love.  When the Kate Beckindale character won't give the John Cusack character her phone number or name, unless they have a sign from \\"fate\\", I was hoping he would throw up his hands in digust and decide to go be in a better movie.  Alas.  The idea the the female lead's behavior is forgivable or even acceptable is just plain wrong.  This sort of belief in \\"fate\\" is what leads some people to disregard real happiness right in front of them for some distant ideal which may never materialize.  This movie has plenty of other problams as well, including the presence of Molly Shannon, who while funny, just doesn't fit in to the movie's tone. This movie is a sad excuse for a romantic comedy.
B000067CPX|5.0|I never really liked the Chili Peppers.  However, after hearing their single &quot;By the Way&quot; on the radio, I decided that i would buy the cd.  The album starts off with a bang with by the way and only gets better after that.  All of their songs are powerful and positive and truley have a meaning in the world today.<BR>Another standout part of this album is the bassist Flea.  I always knew he had talent, but after hearing this cd, I realize he is quite possibly hte most talented bassist in the music world today.  That is a hard title to earn, considering he has to contend with the bassist of System of a Down and the bassist of Linkin Park, Phoenix.  Flea plays his bass as a true emotional instrument than a jackhammer that makes loud noise.  His riffs are matched by no one in the industry today and are the best part of this album.  Buy it now, even if just for the sick riffs of Flea!!
B000001EUL|4.0|This is the first of four Scorpions releases from the early 80s (Animal Magnetism, Blackout, and Love at First Sting being the others) and, in my opinion, the best of the group.  New lead guitarist Mattias Jabs (replacing Uli Jon Roth) joins the band along with Michael Schenker to really create some great music.  Klaus Meine's vocals truly distinctive and Rudy Schenker really knows how to write a guitar riff.  There are no really weak tracks but Loving You Sunday Morning, the reggae inspired Is There Anybody There? (no really, it works!) and the classic ballad Holiday (in which the band just start to rip towards the end) are some of the Scorpions best.  Of all the above mentioned records I think this is the most complete.  They are all good but this is the one to start with.
B00004U30D|1.0|This [junk] beat out The Cider House Rules,The Sixth Sense, Snow Falling On Cedars and The Green Mile?   American Beauty is the pointless tale of a man going through a midlife crisis who gets killed at the end.  Everyone in the movie is boring and unhappy and this movie has ABSOLUTELY NO POINT AT ALL.
B00004YA66|5.0|Even if you aren't a huge Dennis Quaid fan as I am, almost everyone will find a spot in their heart for this movie! <br />Taking place over two time zones, and two generations, this film occurs during the 1969 and 1999 Aurora Borealis. In 1969 Frank Sullivan, a NYC firefighter, is killed on the job, leaving a son, John, and wife. 30 years later, in 1999, John now a grown man working for the NYPD, stumbles across his fathers old CB Radio, which John is able to contact his father on in 1969 because of the Aurora Borealis.<br />John essentially saves his father from his not-yet-occured death, and in turn sets forth a string of murders by a supposedly long dead, nurse murdering, cerial killer. In turn father and son must work together through time to save John's mother as well catch the cerial killer before he continues on his vicious murders.<br />Unfortunatly this movie recieved little attention due to it's low profile, and I almost didn't see it myself. This is one of the greatest movies of its time and almost anyone will enjoy it, especially people who like movies with great mystry, and lots of heart.
0393317552|5.0|Needless to say, no rational person who's read the book would even consider the validity of our sadly cranky and naive reviewer (Bill Roberts) above.  Books that receive Pulitzer Prizes, as this one did, do so for a reason.  Finally here is a wonderful interdisciplinary synthesis that puts it all together nicely.  I am going to use this book as a text for my college Historical Geography course.
0446310786|5.0|Oddly, I'd never read To Kill a Mockingbird as a high school student. Nor had I ever seen the famous film with Gregory Peck. Fortunately, I also avoided learning the entire plot through cultural osmosis. Sure, I knew who Boo Radley was-- didn't I? Atticus Finch... yeah, I know who that is... right?<br />Boy, was I wrong. Last week I finally decided it'd been long enough, and I sank into Harper Lee's only novel with high expectations. And I was certainly not disappointed. With its slow, warm and evocative opening chapters, Mockingbird starts off like a sulty summer day in the South. Lee depicts a South of \\"whistling bob white,\\" biscuits and warm milk, and ladies who on the hottest days bathe twice by noon and then douse themselves in lavender-smelling powder.<br />Jean-Louise Finch, better known as Scout, narrates the story with the keen eye of an adult looking back on a childhood rich with incidents that shaped who she has become. Scout reminded me of some of Carson McCullers's heroines (Member of the Wedding, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter), but without the morbid loneliness and heartbreak. Scout might be described as a tomboy, but that would be doing her a disservice. Her adventures with her older brother Jem, and their dimunitive friend Dill (real name: Charles Baker Harris. \\"Your name's longer'n you are,\\" Jem points out) evoke the timeless place of childhood.<br />As for Atticus Finch, what can one say about a father who seems to embody the greatest of virtues? He is tolerant, patient, kind, and understanding. He does not meddle with his children's affairs, he speaks to them as fellow adults (he allows them to call him \\"Atticus\\"), and his skill as a lawyer is legendary. Lee presents Atticus in a tough and sensitive manner, so that his believability is paramount.<br />The other characters in the book are also depicted with great skill: Aunt Alexandra, bane of Scout's existence; Miss Maudie, who gives as good as she gets when harassed by intolerant neighbors; Calpurnia, the ever-present black maid who has as much a hand in Jem and Scout's well-being as Atticus; and of course the Ewells, whose poverty and ignorance help set the plot in motion.<br />Harper Lee has written a wonderful book that pulses with life, with compassion, and easy good humor. Watching Atticus face down an angry mob set on lynching a black man, or racing with Jem as he escapes gunshots from the Radley house, or sitting with Scout as she forced to join her aunt's church lady reception, or taking that long midnight walk with Jem and Scout, is pure joy; these are scenes that reverberate in the reader's mind and surely in the minds of several generations of readers. I'm glad I can now say I'm one of them.rnia, the ever-present black maid who has as much a hand in Jem and Scout's well-being as Atticus; and of course the Ewells, whose poverty and ignorance help set the plot in motion.<br />Harper Lee has written a wonderful book that pulses with life, with compassion, and easy good humor.

0792153189|1.0|Watching this movie was one of the most unpleasant, unenjoyable experiences of my life.  There is a scene in it involving drawing straws which makes me want to vomit with rage.  This movie should be drug out in the street and shot.
B00005NRN9|3.0|I received this as a surprise, just in time for my birthday. How excited I was as I plopped the disk into my DVD player and sat back in joyous expectation of an hour or maybe 90 minutes of the sort of pure entertainment found in other Cirque du Soleil titles. We put a pizza in the oven. By the time the pizza was done, so was the damn film!<br />Journey of man is a visual feast for the eye but a famine for content. It is beautifully filmed in natural settings that appeal to my Pagan little heart. Moving from the sea, to a forest, to a rocky desert, it is visually entertaining. We move on to what appears almost like a Roman villa with classical  statuary, which turn out to be performers who deliver an impressive strength demonstration. Then we move on to a stylish set that might conjure in the mind a more modern estate for the closing performance.<br />The problem is, that closing performance comes surprisingly soon. I was taken aback at how quickly the whole thing was over and done with. I thought I must be mistaken. I grabbed the shuck and checked the table of contents. Nope. There were no lurking &quot;additional&quot; scenes. No expanded version. I checked the running time, and it claimed the whole thing should run appx 39 minutes.<br />39 minutes! That's a grand total, folks. 39 whole, complete, total minutes! That includes the credits.<br />As I sat, feasting on pizza, I was disappointed right out of my skull with the famine of content found (or should I say 'not found') in Journey of Man. It was like a bad case of &quot;visualis interruptus!&quot;<br />Meanwhile, the basic premise that everything would be simply peachy if the world would break down and embrace &quot;dreams, faith and love&quot; struck me as horribly naive.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this I said... awww nonsense....kiddies stuff. Now I stand corrected since my sister rented it for her kids watched it with them. Of course all the charactors are funny but that talkative donkey stole the show. This is a modern day fairytale with a difference. The entire family will enjoy it from start to finish. That said I'm now the proud owner of the dvd and the soundtrack which is packed with catchy and even touching tunes. Get your copies now!!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Yes I have to tell all THE GOONieS fans that they will be bringing back THE GOONieS in the theaters in 2005. It will be a 20th year anniversary! I can say that I was 14yrs old in 1985 when I saw this movie in the NY theater and became one of my favorite movies till this day! I want viewers to be aware of the cut prints of THE GOONieS out on DVD/VHS. I just saw the uncut movie on cable believe it or not! I would love to see the uncut movie hit DVD. Maybe WB will release it in 2005? Yes I am a GOONie! They finally are releasing Clash of the Titans on DVD. Check it out!
B00005OAIE|1.0|John mayer is best known for his work in the famous \\"Famous Ray's All American Rock and/or Roll.\\"However, his solo career isn't nearly as good. Just listen to one of his songs. He plays so slow and low that any rightthinking music fan must hate it. Hes like Dave Matthew's and Hootie and the Blowfish's evil love child. He must be stopped. If you like this though, i highly recommend the Cash Money Millionaire's \\"Thug Money Gs\\" and PPP Death Squad's \\"Death's Head.\\"
B000002H72|5.0|I will admit that I am a late Pixie bloomer.  I first found out about them at a Radiohead concert last year.  I was asking around for other Radiohead fan's favorite albums.  I probably ended up buying 15 CD's (most of which being junk) and fell in love with the Pixies sound.  Over the past year, I've bought all thier albums and this one is my favorite.  If you don't have this album, buy it, you won't regret it.
B000066C1N|5.0|Pop star Bryan Adams teams up with Oscar winning composer Hans Zimmer(The Lion King, The Prince of Egypt, The Road To El Dorado, ect...) to create one of the best soundtracks to an animated movie ever! This MAY even be a little better than the Lion King or the Prince of Egypt.(Which all 3 were scored by Zimmer, so if he's got the #1,2,& 3 positions all tied up, I think you can tell weve got a genius here.) So, here is Bryan Adams' side.<BR>Personaly, I believe that Bryan Adams is a fine artist. He's got ALLOT going for him, but really, on this album, he's just singing on Zimmer's tunes. About... 5 out of 8 of Bryan's songs.(one of them, \\"Brothers Under the Sun\\", has one of Zimmer's themes in there, but they didn't credit Hans for some reason)<BR>1. Here I am- Music by Hans Zimmer, melody by Bryan Adams, lyrics by Grethen Peters. This is the main song for the movie, and it's a good one. This shows Bryan Adams' pop music expertise.<BR>2. I Will Always Return- Another tune of Zimmer's. This is a little more emotionaly charged than \\"Here I am\\" was.<BR>The rest of the songs are just good Adams tunes( w/Zimmer) and have good effects for the movie. Zimmer wrote the music for Tracks #1,2,5,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,& 15. The rest Bryan and his buddies handled the music.Tracks 1&2 were basically Bryan's songs with Zimmer's theme stuck in the chorus or the verse. Tracks, 5,7,8,&14 were songs that basically was Zimmer's theme over and over with lyrics and singing. All of the songs are good, they've got really a really nice fresh, pop sound to them. This is a must for any Bryan Adams fan.<BR>Now for Hans Zimmer. This is one of his best scores. And definitely continuing the excellent streak of animated movie scores he's composed, like \\"The Lion King,\\" \\"The Prince of Egypt\\",& The Road To El Dorado\\". Track 8 is the film version of Bryan Adams' song \\"Here I am,\\" with an extra 2:30 of Zimmer's score on there. It's a great mix! Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer sound AWESOME together! \\"Run Free\\"is the big action scene. Excellent orchestration, and very adrenaline pumping power. \\"Homeland\\" is the main theme for the movie and it's very nice. \\"Rain\\" is the theme for spirit's girlfriend. And \\"The Long Road Back\\" is definitely one of Zimmer's best orchestrations. It has very nice thems and there are several little nice transitions. I think just about every theme that was in those Bryan Adams songs was on this track. Excellent score! <BR>This is a must for any Zimmer fan. This is a prominent addition to anybody's soundtrack collection. I personally think that Bryan Adams will win best song for \\"Here I am\\" this year in the Oscars, and Hans Zimmer will win best original musical or comedy score. Get this album, see what you think!
B00005B36H|5.0|I have reviewed this particular album once already, but I feel my 50-odd words did not do the album the justice it truly deserves. In short, &quot;Lateralus&quot; is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. It never ceases to entrance me with its dark progressive style of metal. Tool have once again evolved greatly as a band from their preceding album, but I don't think anyone could have imagined a transformation such as this.<br />The songs, with the exception of the &quot;connector&quot; songs, are more - I don't want to say mellow, but chugging will do nicely. The songs this time around chug and chug until they reach a raging, brooding climax, bringing the listener to his/her knees with the force of the music. A prime example of this would be the opening track, &quot;The Grudge.&quot;<br />From that point on, the listener will hear things he or she has probably never heard before - the beautiful ambience of &quot;Eon Bue Apocalypse,&quot; the gloriously tedious &quot;Reflection&quot; (with its tribal &quot;chugging&quot; until reaching a brilliant climax), the plodding &quot;Parabol,&quot; - which unexpectedly twists itself miraculously into its hideous nemesis &quot;Parabola&quot; - all the way to the final track, the haunting &quot;Faaip De Oiad,&quot; which features a Danny Carey drum solo as the backdrop behind frightening, alien-related dialogue (what else would you expect from Tool?).<br />&quot;Lateralus&quot; also features brilliant production (it was given the label HDCD - high definition CD) and downright awesome packaging. All in all, &quot;Lateralus&quot; is an enlightening experience, and will continue to impress and influence for decades to follow.
B00005KHJR|4.0|ZING PoW Pizazz! This is an interesting instructional video on how to assemble wicker furniture. But its boring. I need some stimulation, if you know what I mean. ;)<br />This is really good to pull out and hit it in rear.
B000031XCR|5.0|When I bought this cd, it was because I loved the song &quot;Because You Loved Me.&quot; But when I listened the cd then I realized that all the songs were good. So if you are Celine`s fan, buy it!!
B000002WNP|4.0|the 60s ELVIS! How so many songs went by unheard and underappreciated is a crime.<br />-20 something Elvis fan.
B0000640VO|5.0|What can I possibly add to all the accolades already given for this movie? 360 reviews!!!!<br />An incredible viewing experience, a lovely and charming story, and the amazing face of Audrey Tautou who speaks volumes with her eyes and facial expressions. Some of her experiences are almost surreal and definitely magical. I smile whenever I think of this movie, which is smart, enormously likable, and visually interesting.<br />Amelie's desire to do good and make others happy creates a touching story of the triumph of good. She accomplishes her goals via complex strategies, and always anonymously. There is no preaching, just a fast-paced story enhanced by a fantastic star and numerous interesting sub-plots.<br />The one thing Amelie has the most trouble with is mustering enough courage to let a young man, Nino, know how she feels about him. Both of them are too shy to approach each other directly, which leads to some funny scenes.<br />Sit back and enjoy this feel-good movie, which I intend to watch again ASAP.
6304509154|5.0|This movie was one of the first movies I have ever watched. My dad loves horror movies and ever since I was a baby I have watched them and believe me even after 16 years of watching every scary/horror/thriller there is I have concluded that this one still scares me. I have to admit that the third one is better more chilling. Even after watching this movie over and over again since I was really little I still get scared. This is the only movie that has ever done this to me. The only other movie that actually REALLY scared me was the first time i watched the exorcist and then it never scared me after that. And I watch my horror films alone in the dark. So if you want a bone chillin movie get this one. It'll scare you
6305014140|4.0|This movie was great.  If you like great anime, you'll like this movie.  The fight scenes are great, some brief sexual situations, and violence.  Jubei, a ninja is pulled into a battle he did not ask for. He must fight 8 villains.  His final villain is of course his long time archrival.  Great animation!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|First let me start off by saying that I am not a big metal fan. and that rage is the only &quot;rock-rap&quot; group i listen to. <BR>Rage againt the machine is seriously the best band I have ever heard. And this Cd is awesome. The songs talk about things that we dont learn in 5th period social studies, or on channel 7 news. It forces you to think about things that are going on in the world, and even if only for about an hour makes you forget about your consumer driven lives.  <BR>With the first five songs packed with enough tension and anger to blow the house up this cd is a must have for ANYONE. just dont think that rage against the machine is just another limp bizket or korn...
B00005ATQD|4.0|To the extent one looks at this film as a surreal \\"dreamscape,\\" it works.<br /> Tom Cruise at first seems miscast in the role of Dr. Harford. Cruise doesn't strike me as a Manhattan physician-type, and he is noticeably shorter than Nicole Kidman, who plays the doctor's wife. But Cruise pulls off the most mature performance of his career, and, after a short while, he seems to fit the role.<br /> Disturbed by his wife's confession of her sexual fantasies about another man, Dr. Harford ends up with a prostitute in the West Village. (Given the neighborhood, I guess that I should specify the prostitute as female.) Later, at the invitation of an old college buddy (who wasn't authorized to make the invite), robed and masked, he unwittingly ends up at a Satanic ceremony in a suburban mansion. Unmasked and exposed as an interloper, Dr. Harford seems to face great danger, possibly death. What happens next, is up to the viewer to decide. Is a woman murdered in Dr. Harford's place? Is he really in danger? You decide.<br /> Don't expect to be titillated by the \\"orgy\\" scene. The scene is censored enough in this North American version for the film's \\"R\\" rating to be inexplicable.
B000002H6C|5.0|For those of you who don't know,this is the album where Metallica cut off thier hair and played really mellow radio rock.Phsyc.Never!Fast sideways drumming,heavy and technical,both. Ripping guitar.Dave Mustaine makes a cameo appearance as their limo driver(b.s.)One of the best speed metal albums ever(not b.s.)
B00005QIPH|5.0|This cd is really good. Unfortuatley the media has hyped them to high heaven, but the strokes are still an awesome band. This is a cd that you can listen to from begining to end without having to skip tracks. If you like rock and roll, get this cd and dont listen to the media or critics.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is a great recording. Some of the songs hit you the first time. Others need to be heard several times before their beauty becomes apparrent. <BR>Is it jazz, easy listening, pop rock? I'm not going to get into that argument. I like all kinds of music and don't feel a need to categorize everything. <BR>All I can say is her voice is strong and beautiful and that the melodies have substance.<BR>Sometimes her phrasing echoes memories of Billy Holiday; sometimes her twangy voice is reminiscent of Bonnie Raitt. And on at least one song, -- &quot;One Flight Down,&quot; -- she sounds like Carol King. That song is destined to be a classic.<br />But ultimately, Norah Jones has her own sound and one I look forward to hearing for many more years to come.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I laughed, I cried, then I laughed and cried again.
B000002B7M|5.0|I have heard people dissing some of these songs. i just want to say every song is a classic! i have heard a lot of people say dee shouldnt be on there. well they are wrong. dee is a song that Randy used to tell the world he could do more than just play metal, you cant play metal forever youve got to branch out a little bit. randy and ozzy expressed these emotions in songs like dee, revelation(mother Earth) and mr. crowley. they did these with amazing lyrics, exotic guitar scales and different things you wouldnt expect from the prince of darkness. i think this is a great album to buy, every song is great to listen to. i love every song on this album. i would also reccomend tribute which is a live album where randy tried some crazy licks and pulled them off and ozzy's singing was fantastic.
B00005JL3A|5.0|what could i say bout this movie?!?!? well lets see ITS GREAT!!! omg it scared the crap out of me!!! and the zombies look GREAT i was worried that they would look extremly dumb but they didnt!! and the licker! wow he really did scare me !! the average sespense in this movie is farley good if it would have been more like the game it would have been better but still this movie is GREAT everyone and anyone should see this movie you wont be disapointed!!
B00005N9CV|4.0|I can't honestly say I dislike Diana Krall. And with all honestly I can't say I'm her number 1 fan either. I've always thought of her singing as pleasant but nothing special and concerning her piano playing, well, it never really interested me. But, the one thing that would keep me coming back to listen to her was the fact that she sings the kind of music I like. I love the music from the 20's, 30's & 40's. I don't personally know many artist whom do that anymore, so when I do hear someone that does it, I like to sort of keep up with them.<br /> \\"The Look of Love\\" is a very enjoyable album. As I say, I'm not one of her avid followers, so I really don't understand why people dislike this album. They claim she has done better. I'm vaguely familiar with her other albums, but, I think some of her singing on here is her best. I truly enjoy listening to her sing Johnny Mercer's \\"I Remember You\\" and Gershwin's \\"S'Wonderful\\". These are two of my favorites off the album. \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" is sung beautifully as well. My only two complaints with this album are, number one, I wish she would of sang \\"Besame Mucho\\" in English instead of Spanish. Secondly, I'm not particularly fond of her arrangment of \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\\".<br /> Over-all, while I've never heard this whole album, see I downloaded some of the songs; \\"I Remember You\\",\\"S'Wonderful\\", \\"Dancing In The Dark\\", \\"The Night We Called It A Day\\", \\"The Look Of Love\\", \\"Besame Mucho\\", & \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\\". So, I have no clue how the other three songs sound but from what I've heard this is an album that I'll be playing for a while. For those unfamiliar with Krall I feel this is a good place to start.<br /> Bottom-line: A good song selection and arrangments make up for the albums wonderful mood of classic love songs. Very enjoyable and romantic at the same time.
B00005NB0H|4.0|I'll give this latest incarnation of Live At Leeds 4 stars for content, the reason being that literally everything is on it.  Full concert, full stop.  Not even edits on the between song banter (which happens to be some of my favorite stuff).  The one fault, however, which sticks out in my mind is that somewhere in the most recent mastering something has gone missing.  Granted, I'm not an expert on audio restoration (which I do find fascinating all the same), but I do have a decent stereo setup and to my carefully trained ears I would have to say that, sound-wise, the 1995 remaster sounds the best.  Don't get me wrong though... this version is certainly an essential one for so-called 'die-hard' Who fans.  Oh hell... what do I know?  I still enjoy the original LP version complete with Entwistle's bass flub in his 'My Generation' solo (in case you missed it, compare the original with the '95 version).  Of course, I realize that makes me sound old, but I'm not... I promise... There's my two cents...<BR>-peace
B00005RFAI|3.0|Pink writes some great lyrics on this album. I love some songs, however Pink has taken a giant step away from the way she used to express herself, and I loved her R&amp;B style. Pink gets personal, and it seems almost as if she contradicts her views from the last album. &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot;, &quot;18 Wheeler&quot;, &quot;Respect&quot;, and &quot;Misery&quot; are great tracks on this album, however, once I listened to them once or twice, I never really again had the itch to play them. Also, Pink denies the power of her own voice and doesn't always sound as good as she usually does. Probably with time, she will begin to have the talent to combine storytelling and vocal power, but for now, it seems it's one or the other.
B000025RAU|5.0|About an hour into \\"Chinatown\\", Noah Cross (John Huston) says to Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), \\"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.\\"  Gittes, whose heard this rap before, just smiles.  \\"Why is that funny?\\" asks Cross.  \\"It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.\\"  If any exchange defines \\"Chinatown\\" the movie then this is it.  It's a film where the cliched metaphor of the onion is quite apt: the more layers you peel away, the more layers you find.  And the less you're likely to understand.  It begins life as a simple detective story, but eventually spins out of control into a web of intrigue (another cliched metaphor) that not only includes the murder of water commissioner Hollis Mulwray, but the entirety of 1930's Los Angeles.<br />Into this web is sprung Jake Gittes, a man who seems to be a typical film noir detective, but upon closer inspection is much more.  Or, as we shall see, much less.  I'd argue that Jake is an existential anti-hero, seemingly in control of every situation he enters in to, but ultimately just a pawn on an unfathomable chessboard.  Minor notes in the movie confirm this hypothesis.  A former client calls Jake on the phone, looking for his discretion.  \\"Are you alone, Mr. Gittes?\\" she asks.  \\"Isn't everybody?\\" Jake replies, clowning for his operatives, but saying more than he really intends to.  It's not the last time he inadvertently comments on the futility of his existence.  \\"That must really smart,\\" says Yelburton, the deputy water commissioner, regarding Jake's newly bandaged nose.  \\"Only when I breathe,\\" he replies, pointing out the paradox.  The bandaged nose also acts like a mask.  Whereas Jake starts the movie as a handsome man in a slick suit (this is primetime Nicholson), he is slowly physically destroyed.  The bandage is just the icing on the cake; it serves as a mask during the movie's middle third, hiding Jake's face and, at the same time, suppressing his identity.  Identity, as anissue, is clouded by the fact that no one he meets can seem to get his name right.  Cross, in what may be intentional, keeps calling him \\"Mr. Gitz\\" (correctly pronounced, 'Gittes' rhymes with 'kitties').  So not only is he a man with no face, he is a man with no name.  Jake Gittes, as he gets deeper and deeper into the mysteries surrounding him, is ceasing to exist.<br />But that's not to say that he is a cipher of a character.  How could he be when played by such a vibrant actor?  Nicholson is subdued and cool here, in just the right amounts.  He captures Jake's slow decent into near madness perfectly, while always allowing the man some sense of control.  Nicholson is always watchable in whatever he does, but this may be his best performance because it asks him to tone down his manic energy, allowing it to bubble over in moments, while alluding to it as subtext in others.<br />Behind him, the acting is mostly superb.  John Huston, in his few brief scenes, makes an indelible mark as the pure face of evil.  Huston's deep, gravelly voice and imposing -- even at age 68 -- frame do a lot at conveying the man's power, while his twinkling eyes draw you to him, even though you know better.  Although best known as a legendary director, Huston nearly steals the show here.  Not faring as well is Faye Dunaway.  She plays her femme fatale role with a bit too much iciness, and, in moments, melodrama.  Although she holds her own, and portrays great anguish, in the film's climactic confessional scene, for the most part Dunaway isn't up to snuff.<br />Roman Polanski, who takes a brief but memorable role as the Man With Knife (that's how he's quite functionally billed), directs with his usual visual flare.  Shots are composed as reflections in camera lenses or in a car's side mirror.  The opening scene begins with a series of photographs detailing one wife's infidelity.  Without saying anything, and without showing the audience the room around them, the scene is set perfectly.  It's archetypal of how he shoots the rest of the film: with style and subtlety.<br />Maybe I put too much stock in what William Goldman has to say, but \\"Chinatown\\" has to be a frontrunner when tallying up the best screenplays of all time.  A good screenplay will have two things going for it: a strong structure (of vital importance always), and interesting dialogue (useful in supporting the structure and in adding colour to the proceedings).  Towne gets full marks on both counts.  Structurally, it's a dream, a marvelous example of the micro turning into the macro as the web of intrigue broadens exponentially, while maintaining its power on the smaller scale all along.  Add to this the crisp, precise dialogue, and you've got a screenplay that's as much fun to listen to as it is to follow.  Jake is full of wisecracks and homespun wisdom.  When asked about Mulwray's character, Yelburton denies ever hearing him talk about infidelity: \\"He never even kids about it.\\"  \\"Maybe he takes it very seriously,\\" says Jake.  When Cross asks if Lou Escobar, the investigating officer who's handling the Mulwray murder case, is an honest man, Jakes replies, \\"Far as it goes... of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.\\"  On its own this would be a great line, but in \\"Chinatown\\", where the water of L.A. plays a major role in the plot, its damn well genius.<br />\\"Chinatown\\" is much more than your average detective story.  It's a narrative dripping in character, intrigue, and history.  I'd sure like to see just what it was that happened in Chinatown, back in Jake's days on the police force, which made him the cynical sleuth he's become.  It'd make a great prequel.  As it stands, the movie we've got is a crackerjack yarn, rich enough to demand multiple viewings.
B0000636UN|4.0|C'mon, C'mon is a great album that has some very good songs in it. Sheryl Crow continues to be one of the innovative pop/rock and roll music stars. I liked a bulk of the songs from this album. Songs like &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot;, &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot;, and &quot;It's So Easy&quot; are just some of the songs I enjoyed listening to. &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; really is a great summer time song. It just gives the summer atmosphere. <br />I've been a fan of Sheryl Crow's since her debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club. She has been one singer I never seem disapointed with, at least so far. A great album to get.
B000063WDH|5.0|For me, the 5 star review means that the CD is not only great, but beyond anything I expected when I purchased it. I thought the Black Keys seemed like two 20somethings trying to catch the wake of the White Stripes -- I was wrong. This is a serious CD worth both your time and your money. To highlight a specific track would risk me sounding as if the others are not equal. There is absolutely no filler on this album, eliminating any of the &quot;gimmicky&quot; taglines that inevitably follow such an endeavor.
0451191153|4.0|While Ayn Rand has written a rather predicatble storyline, it is remarkable how she shifts the readers feelings towards the characters from one extremity to the other, and how the main characters in her book always seem to &quot;play both sides against the middle&quot; with respect to their views on the hero.<br />It is a fascinating book, and well worth the 9 bucks. I enjoyed it a great deal.
B00005RY7X|1.0|To compare this cd to anything other than pop is an outright lie. I bought this cd after reading so many great reviews of how hard this guy rocks. Get real! I am mostly a metal fan who will listen to any hard rock or metal genre as long as it's good. This is none of the above. The mixture of synthesizer and guitars just doesn't cut it. This is top 40 bubblegum music to me. This guy made music fun again? I doubt that. And when did music cease from being fun? If I would have played this junk at a party I would have been thrown out. Party till you puke? No need to, just listen to this garbage and you'll get the same outcome.
B000063UR2|5.0|Legend is a Film Classic - sort of.  I wholly disagree with the Ridley Scott that the Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack is the better of the two.  The Tangerine Dream soundtrack is so much more in-tune with the events on the screen that it makes one wonder if Goldsmith had even seen the movie when he wrote his version.  Goldsmith's music is very fine music, no doubt, but the Tangerine Dream music is eerie and otherworldly which is exactly what this movie needs.<BR>The longer director's cut is sometimes painful to watch, but again, I think it goes back to the soundtrack.  If they had re-edited the Tangerine Dream soundtrack to match the original edit of the film it may have worked perfectly.  As it is, the shorter version, the U.S. release, is the film classic and the longer version is the curiosity.  I'm glad I had the chance to see the original version, but after one viewing, it's the Tangerine Dream version that I'll be watching over and over.<BR>The extra's in this DVD are interesting, but not special.  I found it interesting that although Tom Cruise is the `star' of this movie, he wasn't even mentioned once in the making-of documentary.<BR>Tim Curry gives the best, most powerful, and most memorable performance in this movie.  This DVD is worth it if only for Mia Sara's dance and transformation and Tim Curry as Darkness stepping through the mirror with the ethereal Tangerine Dream masterwork weaving it all together making us all gasp with beauty and terror of it all.  A true classic movie moment in a classic movie.
B000002MFN|5.0|I'm sat here listening to Erotica, trying to think why this stunning album was so critically attacked. Before I bought this album, I was worried the critics may have been correct. I thought if I bought it, all I'd think of every time I listened to it is that harsh crack of the critical whip. With a little help from the positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to give it a go. The sheer superiority and excellent early 90's dance shines through. The critics said this album was full of sex, sex, sex. What the hell are they all on about?! There are three sex songs on here! (Erotica, Secret Garden and Where Life Begins). Here's my review of Erotica...<br /><br />Track 1 is Erotica (10/10). The first song from this album released in October 1992. It made UK No.3. The video and orgasms shocked the world. The deep. voice is almost scary as the sight of dominatrix Madonna in the video pops into my head evertime I hear this. Track 2 is Fever (10/10). A cover of Peggy Lee's classic from 1956. This made UK No.6 in April 1993. The taking of a really soulful 1950s song and updating it with racy, dance beats of the 1990s works really well. Track 3 is Bye Bye Baby (10/10). A very good dance/pop track. I like the lyrics, \\"I know I loved you, because I hate you\\". Classic, up-front Madonna! Although her voice is a little strange, even nausiating. Track 4 is Deeper And Deeper (10/10). A very good dance track for the clubs. This made No.6 in the UK in December 1992. The chorus is really up-beat and happy. The Spanish bit half-way through is really good and gives it that foreign holiday feel. Track 5 is Where Life Begins (9/10). A VERY saucy track from kinky Madonna! The whole song is mainly about how to have sex. Be sure to listen to this song on your headphones if your mum or dad are in the house when you're listening to this song! Track 6 is Bad Girl (10/10). A very good, laid-back ballad and my personal favourite Madonna ballad ever. This made UK No.10 in March 1993. This was the theme-tune to her erotic, 18+, critic-bashed film, Body of Evidence.<br /><br />Track 7 is Waiting (10/10). A good mid-tempo track. Madonna's deep speaking vocals crop up quite frequently on Erotica. This track has a great bass-line and the piano makes this great track sound like a 1940's romance ballad. Track 8 is Thief of Hearts (10/10). A fantastic up-tempo track. Madonna goes a little over the top saying, \\"[...]\\" all the time. The \\"you do it, you take it, you screw it, you fake it. Come to it, you'll break it, you're over, you can't take it!\\" is the funkiest bit! Track 9 is Words (9/10). Another very good dance/pop gem. It sounds a lot like Fever. It's about another person Madonna hates because they think they're better than her and the persons' words \\"cut like a knife - cut into her life\\". Track 10 is Rain (10/10). A really good ballad - one of her best ever. The lyrics are very good and emotional. This made UK No.7 in July 1993. The speaky-bit is very relaxing and well, just brilliant! Track 11 is Why's It So Hard (9/10). I'd say this was different track to many others on Erotica. It's more of a rock/dance track. The song is about racism/sexism etc...Track 12 is In This Life (9/10). A sad ballad about one of Madonna's best friends who was only 23 when he died of AIDS. Memories of Madonna's mother who died in 1963 of breast cancer (when Madonna was only 5) may have re-surfaced when she wrote this. This results in an emotional, expressive tone in her voice. Track 13 is Secret Garden (9/10). A mid/up-tempo song. I think this is about sex because of the lyrics, \\"you plant the seed and I'll watch it grow\\" and \\"I'm looking for the perfect flower\\". The deep, spoken verses are also an indicator of a raunchy track about sex.<br /><br />The result of Erotica is a stunning album. It's hard to believe this has only sold 5 million worldwide compared to some other Madonna albums which have sold 19/22 million. And the critics? Well they can just...her erotic, 18+, critic-bashed film, Body of Evidence.    Track 7 is Waiting (10/10). A good mid-tempo track. Madonna's deep speaking vocals crop up quite frequently on Erotica. This track has a great bass-line and the piano makes this great track sound like a 1940's romance ballad. Track 8 is Thief of Hearts (10/10). A fantastic up-tempo track.

B00004XQP4|5.0|...and how it's done with style, Warning offers great music with the catchy pop-punk style that has always been their way, but this time in it's brand new package filled with greatly conceived melodies and as usual great lyrics served by Billy Joe, that should be recognized now as the excellent songwriter he has always been, anyway you shouldn't need any more excuses to buy this CD...It's Green Day and it's perfect.
B000002NJS|5.0|... Released in March of 1998, the album was an instant hit and sold 15 million copies worldwide, won 4 Grammys, produced five Top 10 UK hit singles and was praised as one of the greatest albums of all-time. Madonna was back on top and no one was about to knock her off the top - a reputation which she has managed to retain for five years, and is sure to continue with the release of her highly-anticipated new album in April 2003...<br />Ray Of Light begins with the fabulous Drowned World/Substitute For Love (10/10). The song is a brilliant opener to Ray Of Light and gives us a glimpse of what Madonna's new life is like - with her very own \\"ray of light\\", her daughter. The song peaked at No.10 in the UK in September 1998 and was the third single to be taken from the Ray Of Light album. Swim (10/10) is up next and is another excellent mid-tempo ballad with some haunting and spooky beats. Madonna's voice is on top form and the lyrics are incredibly deep. Ray Of Light (10/10) is the next song. Released in May 1998, the song peaked at No.2 in the UK. The song is just downright superb, and definitely a career highlight for Madonna. The song is so up-tempo and was Madonna's way of celebrating the upcoming Millennium - it may have been more than a year away, but it's a certain fact that millions will have danced their way into the new millennium to this song. Candy Perfume Girl (10/10) is a brilliant song, perfectly executed with superb lyrics of teenage angst and fresh and modern techo beats. The song is definitely the most \\"rocky\\" on Ray Of Light. Skin (10/10) is up next and is definitely the album's best unreleased song for me. At over 6 minutes long, you really get a chance to get into the song. The beats are very techno and the way Madonna's voice is altered is perfect. \\"Do I know you from somewhere? Why do you leave me wanting more? Why do all the things I say sound like the stupid things I said before?\\" asks Madonna at the beginning of Skin. These lyrics are just pure class - definitely some of the most thought-provoking I've ever heard. Nothing Really Matters (10/10) is another superb single release from Ray Of Light. It peaked at No.7 in the UK in March 1999, and was the fifth and final single to be taken from Ray Of Light. The video is nothing short of perfect and shows more of Madonna's spiritual phase. Sky Fits Heaven (10/10) is track 7, and is my second favourite unreleased song from Ray Of Light. There's something about this song that reminds me a lot of my early childhood (OK, I'm only 15 so I can remember it quite clearly). A time when I was very happy and didn't have to worry about petty things in life - knowing my parents were always there for me. Look up at the sky when listening to the song and you'll see what I mean...<br />Shanti/Ashtangi (9/10) continues Ray Of Light in spectacular fashion. The song is from Madonna's Kabbalah interest. The lyrics are translated in English as, \\"I worship the gurus' lotus feet/Awakening the happiness of the self revealed/Beyond comparison, working like the jungle physician/To pacify loss of consciousness from the point of existence/In the form of a man up to the shoulders/Holding a conch, discus and sword/Thousand headed, white/I bow respectfully/Peace.\\" Frozen (10/10) is up next. The first single to be taken from Ray Of Light in February 1998, it stormed straight to No.1 in the UK and all over the world. The song is over 6 minutes long, and Madonna really does sell herself to the listener. This was the song that put Madonna back on top of the world, and we should never forget that fact. The Power Of Goodbye (10/10) is another superb song. Released in December 1998, it peaked at No.6 in the UK. The song is such a haunting and moody ballad with some superb lyrics, as always. To Have And Not To Hold (10/10) is up next and is another superb mid-tempo ballad. The beat is haunting and Madonna's lyrics, \\"Ba ba da ba ba ba,\\" are pure class. Little Star (10/10) is another brilliant song about Madonna's daughter. The beat is drippy and floating, and Madonna's voice is very sweet and full of love for her daughter. Mer Girl (10/10) is the final song on Ray Of Light. The song is just over five and a half minutes long and is about Madonna's mother - and how her death affects her almost on a daily basis. The song is incredibly slow - it takes Madge about 10 seconds to speak each line...not sing, but speak! Overall, another excellent song - and an exceptional one to close this truly unique album.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />Madonna worked with legendary dance wizard William Orbit on Ray Of Light, and the effects certainly show. The genius co-wrote and produced every song with Madonna, except Little Star. Orbit's star soon rose too, with a platinum-selling album to his name and practically every artist clambering to work with him. Madonna and Orbit really did create a work of art here. Every Madonna album represents a stroke of a brush on a painting of her career - Ray Of Light was definitely the biggest and most striking...out Madonna's daughter.

079073382X|5.0|Yea, like a lot of other people, I caught this movie on T.V. on accident, and I love how it shows the akward silences and pureness of new love...I like how it sounded like they were just talking, and as if there wasn't a director, and they were acting like if they were really meeting for the first time.<BR>I suggest you see this movie, it'll change your aspect on life and love forever.
B000001IPL|5.0|If you want to listen to hardcore punk with awesome guitar playing, this is the CD for you. I remember someone saying that lists are boring in their review, and I agree. So instead, I'll tell you the songs which make up the reason you should buy this CD.<BR> Every reviewier here liked \\"Self-Esteem\\", but I didn't really think it was THAT great. It's a slow song with a lot of ooooos, but it's got great, coherent lyrics.<BR>   \\"bad habit\\" starts out slow and lame, but it gets fast paced. This is definitely one of the better songs. If you are downloading mp3s, consider downloading this.<BR>    I love the intro \\"time to relax\\". It is by far the best intro I have ever heard. It has no music in it, but follow it's instructions.<BR>    If you like ska, you'll like \\"What Happened to You?\\". This song's really catchy. I think this should be one of the top 3 songs in the CD.<BR>    \\"Gotta get away\\" is another really cool song. It's got great guitars and great vocals, a good combonation.<BR>    The best song, IMO, is \\"Genocide\\". The guitar music in this is stunning. This song is very fast and very catchy and always get's me pumped.<br />     Soooo, get this CD. As always, Offspring's work is top notch. This is no exception. This is the pinnacle of punk rock. GET IT!!!!!
0553213105|1.0|it's boring. Piece of advice for everybody who's forced to read this: buy CliffsNotes. This book is not worth wasting your time on. Believe me, I was open minded and wanted to like it but I could not read more than 10 pages. My mind started thinking of something else every third sentence. So again, save your time and sanity and buy the CliffsNotes version.
B00000J7SO|5.0|Dylan fans were so wrong about this album for years.  The negative reviews kept me away from it until I first heard &quot;Changing of the Guards.&quot;  Then I began to look into it.  I must say, this album shows the mind-frame that Dylan was in at the time.  Broken at the loss of his wife, this album has more songs dealing with a broken relationship than any other song.  This has become my favorite CD, especially when I'm having a hard time because of songs like &quot;Senor&quot; and &quot;Baby Stop Crying.&quot; <BR>Here's a full review of this 9-song set:<br />1.Changing of the Guards- 5/5.  This has got to be one of the best songs Bob Dylan ever wrote.  At seven minutes, it is a thumping, pounding number with incredibly good lyrics and a good singing voice.<BR>2.New Pony- 4.5/5.  Something of a novelty.  Nasty blues at its finest from the man.<BR>3.No Time To Think- 5/5.  A wonderful song with a very neat little rhyme scheme.  The lyrics combined with the music and voice make this a gut-wrenching and emotional listen with a running time of 8:23.<BR>4.Baby, Stop Crying- 5/5.  The perfect song to listen to if you're depressed.  It's so comforting when he sings &quot;Stop crying.&quot;<BR>5.Is Your Love in Vain?- 4/5.  Probably the only song that is less than great, but not bad in any way.<BR>6.Senor-5/5.  Another emotional song. Starts slowly, then builds up into a gripping narrative<BR>7.True Love Tends To Forget- 5/5.  Absolutely beautiful.  A great song to hear at anytime.<BR>8.We Better Talk This Over- 5/5.  A good, upbeat song that seems to be more optimistic than most of the others.<BR>9.Where Are You Tonight?- 10/5!!  This is the most emotional, beautiful, confessing song Dylan ever wrote.  The music, the lyrics, the rhyming, the singing-this song is perfect.  When I first heard this song, I fell in love.  <br />With that said, i suggest getting this CD, if only for the opener and closer themselves.  Bob Dylan has crafted a hauntingly personal and emotionalalbum that'll make you appreciate his work and his life.
0679437223|5.0|Despite a bit of sluggishness in the fourth fifth of this book, Heller managed to create a truly great book in a manner nobody had ever successfully pulled off before.  <br />Like the equally great SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE--really the only significant novel thematically similar to CATCH-22 written in anything like Heller's style--CATCH-22 is usually labeled an anti-war novel.  I disagree.  I think both are pro-humanity books.  Heller and Vonnegut, like Voltaire centuries earlier, both seem to have reached a place when writing these classics where they could no longer stomach the absurdities of their day.  It wasn't just war that nauseated them; it was the ease--the eagerness--in which they saw men become animals.<br />They are, unfortunately, depressing books.  Great books, but depressing nonetheless.
0684847248|5.0|often when things go wrong, i pick these type of books up and read them. this one confronted me with some issues i will reexamine now and deal with. thats tough to swallow when you're down but its helpful on 'this journey in life.' i recommend this book to anyone who wants to move a step further along the path
0553277472|1.0|Maybe I was expecting too much. What would it focus more on: Zen or motorcycles? I'm interested in both topics, yet this book came nowhere near to satisfying me on either of them.<br />Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance was a huge disappointment for me. I totally concur with the sentiments in the review by the guy from Seattle. <br />I finished this book feeling depressed and disheartened, and all the way through it I wondered why there was hardly any love shown to the author's son.<br />If you want to find out about Zen, buy a copy of Zen made Easy by Timothy Freke. If you're new to bikes, buy magazines or visit your local two-wheeler store and get advice from the experts. <br />I could have gone for a hike, played a round of golf, painted the house or, better still, gone for a ride on a motorcycle - pastimes far more worthy of my time than reading this depressing, prolix book.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album is the greatest collection of songs ever.  From start to finish.  This is the only disc a person needs I think.  I still think the glam/alien(?) look that followed was a mistake though, for me personally.
B0000683DH|5.0|Just in time for the films 20th anniversary, Paramount Pictures has released the Directors Edition of \\"Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan\\" in a two-disc set. The film picks up the story of the legendary crew of the Enterprise as they begin to prepare a new crew to crew the ship for its continued mission of exploration.<br />Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), is overseeing his good friend, Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy), training of the new crew, while secretly pining over becoming an administrator who is stuck flying a desk rather than exploring the cosmos. As Kirk, Spock, and the veteran crew of the Enterprise prepare for what may be their last mission with one another, the veteran crew views the pending training cruise as a nostalgic but bittersweet event that will culminate their historic careers with one another before they head off to other assignments in Starfleet.<br />Fate however has different plans, as the training mission soon becomes a life and death struggle that will test the mettle of the new crew, and drive Kirk to the depths of personal turmoil and pain. Unbeknownst to Kirk and his crew, the genetically enhanced Khan, (Ricardo Montalban), has escaped from the exile Kirk assigned him, and is determined to seek revenge on Kirk at all costs. As if this is not problem enough, Kirks ex-lover Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), comes back into his life as she believes Kirk is taking away her life's work; a project named Genesis that reanimates life in dead planets and allows for desolate planets to be terraformed in less than a day. The truth is that Khan has learned of the plan and uses the project as a chance to lure Kirk to the research station so that he may steal the project and exact his deadly vengeance on Kirk. What follows is a deadly game of cat and mouse as Kirk and Khan square off in a series of battles that force Kirk to use every ounce of his experience to save his ship and crew. The supporting cast is great and fans will note Kirstie Alley in an early role as Lt Saavik and the late Merritt Butrick is solid as Kirk's estranged son David. The directing of then second time director Nicholas Myers is solid and his commentaries on the films soundtrack are very informative and insightful. The effects from ILM are first rate and the pacing of the film is easily the best of any Trek outing as the skillful mix of action, humor, and emotion makes this not only the most diverse of the Trek films but also the most in-depth and human. This is a thinking mans Trek as you do not have to be a fan of the series to appreciate this film. The mature themes presented of aging, love, loss, and revenge lead to elements of good drama and Myers gets easily the best performance of Shatner's tenure as Kirk from the role, as Kirk is still the strong leader that fans have known, but we see a frail side to him, and learn of the sadness and sacrifices that eat at him, as well as his struggle to balance the ramifications of decisions he made years ago. The second disc is stuffed with features and interviews including Deforest Kelley (McCoy), Shatner, Nimoy, and Montalban as well as Director Myers, Producer Harve Bennett, and the writers all make this a collection well worth owning.<br />Star Trek II is widely regarded by fans as the best film in the series and with this fantastic collection, the best just got better.<br />5 stars out of 5<br />Gareth Von Kallenbach...an early role as Lt Saavik and the late Merritt Butrick is solid as Kirk's estranged son David.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Unfortunately my copy's mono. I say unfortunately, but i have given it 5 stars, and its in my top 5 albums i own so it can't sound too bad. In fact it doesn't sound bad at all, it sounds glorious and beautiful. However, the first time i listened to it, i didn't really feel it. I wasn't a beach boys fan, the only songs i'd heard were from the surfin USA era, and i didn't really like them. But i had heard about pet sounds from all the hype I heard and reviews i had read, so i was a little dissapointed the first time i listened to it. It didn't take too many listens though before I realilsed how good this album is and how much i love it. It's one of those rare albums that, truly, does not require any skipping at all. When i taped it to listen to on my walkman i didnt need to use the memory button on my cd player coz i just pressed record and let it tape the way it is (usually i put the best songs to the front of the tape) the only other cd i have done that with is the Stone Roses debut. I don't really know what it is about this album that makes me love it so much, its been pointed out that the lyrics are a bit crap sometimes, and the theme of the songs is sometimes a bit repetative, probably valid comments, but when the songs are this good it doesnt matter what their about. It's the music as much as anythin, the emotion expressed in the tone of Wilson's voice with the beautiful arrangements of his prodcution more than make up for any lyrical short comings, not that I, personally, think there are many. It annoys me to hear people sayin this album is overrated, before singing the praises of another vastly over rated album 'sgt. pepper', this album is better than sgt pepper in my opinion, but it probably is a bit overrated, its not the best album of all time, but that shouldn't even be a debate. What it is is a soft, delicate, heartfelt record which just sounds excellent probably more so today than ever. I've never heard anythin like it, one striking thing is the relativelack of percussion which adds to the gentleness of the album and also compliments Wilsons vocals. Hearing of its lack of success upon release, it sounds to me as if the world wasn't ready for pet sounds when it was released in 1966, and given the state of the commercial music at the moment i wonder if it will ever be ready for it
0345350499|1.0|People who consider this a feminist book are mistaken. Bradley's depiction of women in &quot;Mists&quot; is insulting to say the least. Women in &quot;Mists&quot; are either manipulative harpies or whining fools. All are small-minded, all are insecure, and all are incredibly self-centered. <br />I am so tired of this idea that to be a feminist means that you dislike men. Since when is a &quot;strong woman&quot; a woman who puts down and manipulates men at every turn? I have better words for women like that.
B0000640VO|2.0|I rented this movie with high hopes.  And in many ways it did deliver.  The cinematography is fantastic.  The storyline is certainly fanciful and charming.  Audrey Tautou is gorgeous and well cast for this film.  It had everything I look for in a movie.  For all of these I give 5 stars.  <BR>     The disappointment for me is the fact that this is not a movie I can share with my kids, (ages 17,15,12).  This is the type of film I would like to foster an appreciation for in my kids, but I can't own it.  Why?...  The sexual content is extreme by even liberal accounts.  Over the top... the most sexual R rated movie I have ever seen.  There seems to be no need for such extreme sexuality in this storyline.  I would love for film makers to understand the importance of making artful presentations for everyone. I think our society could benefit greatly by such imagination, and good hearted humor. Give me the PG version of Amelie any day.
B000002B30|2.0|In the days before the rarity packed \\"Tracks\\" box set (which contained over SIXTY B-sides, rarities, and out-takes), Bruce Springsteen's \\"Greatest Hits\\" was the official awaited compilation...unfortunately, its track selection is obviously less than complete, and in many ways, goes against what Springsteen stands for--giving in to the notion of celebrating only the \\"hits\\" and not what truly holds merit seems to be a bit of a sell-out. And of course, the usual defense for compilation albums is that it \\"introduces new fans,\\" but it's far more worthwhile to buy the complete albums. Nonetheless, there are many classic chart toppers, but again, it is obvious that the Boss's truly best work is being ignored--the absence of any material from the overlooked \\"Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ\\" and \\"The Wild, The Innocent, & the E Street Shuffle\\" is a downer, and the very limited selection of songs from the albums \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" \\"The River,\\" and \\"Nebraska\\" is an injustice. Even the seldom-noted \\"Human Touch\\" and \\"Lucky Town\\" albums could have been represented much better. A two disc set would have been more appropriate. Including the soundtrack single \\"Streets of Philedelphia\\" was a good move, and \\"Secret Garden\\" and \\"Murder, Incorporated\\" are two fine, unreleased tracks. But the other two new songs, \\"Blood Brothers\\" and especially \\"This Hard Land\\" are extremely predictable, uninspired and generic Springsteen rockers. An overall poor compilation from a magnificent artist.
B000065VB9|5.0|If you are interested in exploring Peter Gabriel's solo career, here is where to start. This is my favourite Gabriel album, although I have liked everything I heard from him.<BR>Almost all the songs on this album are excellent and all so different. It begins with the excellent song Intruder, with its pounding beat and creepy lyrics. No Self Control, which is about addiction, as the title suggests, is also pretty good, but the next track Start, is just filler material. It gets better however with I Don't Remember, which is a song about an amnesiac. Family Snapshot is the best song on the album and is also more on the progressive side. Similar to his work with Genesis, this is a story. Based on the JFK assisination, its about a neglected child who grows up to kill an important person just to get attention.<BR>And Through the Wire and Games Without Frontiers are probably the most commercial tracks on the album. The later, which also features Kate Bush, is paradoy of war. Not One of Us is about prejudice while Lead a Normal Life is an eary song about someone stuck in an institution where he is being taught to be \\"normal\\", whatever that it is. Biko is one of the most famous songs on the album. It pays tribute to one of the heros of black South Africans' struggle against apartheid. Its also interesting because it is one of Gabriel's first forays into world music, if not the first. As any Gabriel fan knows, he went on to become one of the greatest supporters of international artists.
B00000ILBK|3.0|I have been a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation for many years, and I always get a fuzzy, excited feeling when they release a film from this series.  Since I missed it at the theatre with much regret, I put a VHS copy of \\"Insurrection\\" into my VCR.  By the end of the film, I must admit that I was thoroughly disappointed. <BR>I think that while Jonathan Frakes did an excellent job bringing some characters out of their shells in \\"First Contact,\\" he (and the writers) focus way too much on humor and not enough on character development and plot.  Some of the lines and gags are bordering on ridiculous.<BR>Speaking of plot, this one was silly and pretty pointless.  A race that cannot age?  A conspiracy within the Federation?  Okay, sure.  I know it's difficult after almost fifteen years to come up with original ideas, but put your heads together guys and bring us something with more depth, more action, and more emotion so we don't get bored.  \\"First Contact\\" was so good because it got dark and gritty, two qualities we rarely see in anything Star Trek.  <BR>So why three stars, you ask?  Well, because it's TNG.  I love the cast and I still think they are fine actors.  The special effects are always awesome.  And while it's not a great film in and of itself, it fulfills the job of at least continuing the series.  <BR>Another reason I'm not completely bashing it is because of one scene.  Lt. Cmdr. Geordi La Forge, like many crew members, starts to experience the \\"fountain of youth\\" effects from the planet's atmosphere.  His blindness begins to fade and he is seeing the sky for the first time in his life.  This is one of the most defining emotional moments in the entire Trek series.  As he describes everything, the most die-hard Trek fan might be compelled to tear up.  Great stuff.<BR>Overall, it's not terrible, but it's not very good either.  But fear not, fans.  \\"Nemesis\\" looks to be the most promising venture of the TNG crew.  Looks even spookier than \\"First Contact.\\"  Here's hoping, right?
B00005RFAI|5.0|P!NK and this album, I believe, will be getting a whole lot of nominations for the Grammy Awards in February. Whether or not she will go home with an arm full of trophies has yet to be determined, as the competition will be stiff (Norah Jones, Avril Lavigne, Vanessa Carlton, and Kylie Minogue just to name a few). That's how good this album is! When I think of this disc (which happens to be one of my faves), I sort of have a hard time trying to describe it (but I'll try). After an R&B drenched debut effort, Pink is now a Pop/Rock goddess! While 'Get the Party Started' is very cool and funky, my favourite track is 'Just like a Pill.' It's funky, fast-paced pop with a healthy dose of rock! Pink also adds a very personal touch to this album with 'Family Portrait.' The lyrics, which speak of a family in turmoil, is somewhat biographical. Pink, aka Alesia Moore, does come from a broken home. Her parents divorced when she was very young, and Pink is using this song as a way of reflecting and healing. While the lyrics are heart breaking, the music is funky and simply awesome! With Pink, you just can't go wrong! When I first brought this album, I was not at all prepared - Like a lot of people. I was expecting another \\"Can't Take Me Home.\\" I was caught off guard to say the least! While Pink still has R&B incorporated into her lastest music, it really comes across as R&B based pop. As much as I like R&B, I listen to this album a lot more than I do Pink's debut. Indeed, not everyone will be pleased this work. Overall, though, it's just a lot of fun! There isn't a whole lot of soul searching going on here, just a cd that could be declared an official party album! I hope Pink will continue to make more albums like this. Keep up the good work Miss Moore (I mean, P!NK)!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I did not want to see this movie to begin with. I was not inspired by the story, the setting, the concept, the message, and Nicole Kidman. But my brother rebuked me, saying that I was being to uptight about it, and that a friend of his had recommended it to him. So we watched it. After an hour, we looked at each other and agreed that the movie was really bad, boring, and meaningless; so, we stopped the vcr and that was the end of it. <br />   The movie was even worse than I expected. Let me put it this way. I hate the Bohemian Paris of those times. I hate the immoral and decadent way of life celebrated in this movie. I hate the very idea of a place like the Moulin Rouge. I hate that mixture of Epicurean, Materialist, Humanistic, and Existentialist approach to life that the European devotees of Bacchus and Eros had and still have. So, this flick already started on the wrong foot. Then, the plot was super clichéd. I know, I'm the first one who says that all movies are clichéd, but that does not bother me at all if the plot is well constructed and the actors make their characters believable and interesting. In this movie, I could not care less of the fate of the characters. Ewan McGregor would chew out the same old trite concept of love being this ecstatic feeling that consumes you and bla bla... and Nicole Kidman was supposed to fall for this guy based on the aforementioned bright discovery of the meaning and nature of love. Please, spare me. I mean, talk about a plot drowning in total idiocy and misunderstanding of the concept of love. <br />   Also, the soundtrack was a patchwork of mainstream pop and rock songs that would appeal to my deaf father and few other people with auditory disabilities. And don't even get me started on the direction. The way Lurhmann edited the whole thing wanted to appear sophisticated; well, it did not impress me at all. It was kind of like the direction of \\"Strictly Ballroom,\\" which, in fact,, was the only aspect in that movie that bothered me.<br />   In conclusion, some said this is a Love It or Hate It movie. I respect everybody's taste, but, as for me, I hated this movie with a passion.
0064407667|5.0|A Bad Beginning was a really good beginning to what seems will be a fun, though miserable, series.<br />This is the story of the Baudelaire's. To say that nothing goes right for them is an understatement. They face death, attempted murder, abuse, hunger, etc., etc. As each new trial, here meaning bad thing that happens to them, comes up, though, the three Baudelaire's lean on each other to come through the difficulty. <br />That's the great thing about the book. The children go through so many horrible things, mainly caused by Count Olaf, and yet they learn ways to trudge ahead using their intelligence, their humor, and their love for one another. The lessons taught are important for anyone to learn. Bad things do happen, but it is possible to survive and to be happy - especially since there is someone in the world who will love you and help you. The great lessons here are taught in a really interesting, humorous, and exciting story. I really recommend A Bad Beginning to everyone, and I am really looking forward to reading the rest of this series.
0316666343|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone.  I really was caught up in the the characters and story and loved the way it was written.  Please try this book you will most definitely be glad you did.
6303481272|5.0|This is the best anime movie out there yes even better than Akira...
0385335482|5.0|I'm 17 years old, and I really hadn't had time to read any books in awhile. My mom actually recommended \\"Confessions\\" to me (well she kind of forced me to read it, and I'm glad she did!) I got it, and I couldnt put it down. It was amazing how I saw so many of my own traits in Becky. We both procrastinate, we both are constantly saying the things we SHOULD do, instead of actually doing them. But it was really funny how while i was reading the book, i was getting angry with Becky. She knew she didn't have any money to spend and that she was in debt, then she'd go to the store and buy just one more little thing. I found myself yelling at the pages \\"WHAT are you DOING?!!\\" And i think at first we all hated Luke Brandon so much, and empathized with Becky after her great day with him, picking out suitcases, turned into a really embarrassing night for her. Becky's buying habits were alittle irritating sometimes, but she was overall a really likeable character. The way Kinsella wrote, I felt like Becky was talking to me. I felt like she was real, and ending the book felt like I was leaving her life, when I really wanted to stay longer! Oh and Sophie Kinsella's picture on the back cover is exactly how i imagined Becky to look like. I loved this book, it was a great read and I can't wait to read the sequel!
B00003CXXP|1.0|Absolutely the worst movie Spielberg's ever done. An overused story line with a sappy moral and absolutely no humor or action. It's \\"Water World\\" meets \\"Bicentennial Man\\", so if you loved both of those movies, this movie might be for you. Personally, I would have found it more exciting and thought-provoking if Spielberg had simply filmed the two-thousand years \\"David\\" spends submerged staring at the statue of the Blue Fairy in real time.
B00005RFAI|1.0|It's hard to believe that 21-year-old Pink, who turns 22 in September, co-writes her songs. Her songwriting is comparable to poems that 5th graders write. In the somber, cry-for-me hip-hop cut \\"Family Portrait\\", Pink sings \\"I promise I won't spill the milk at dinner.\\" Please. And she's got so many songs on here that make her sound like a whiney high schooler who just wants to party all day: in \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" she basically sends the messege that you should never respect adults and be selfish. In \\"My Vietnam\\" she whines, \\"I never liked school that much, they tried to teach me better.\\" Ridiculous. She has a voice that will get her far, if only she can find good material and lyrics to use it on.

B0000027RL|5.0|An awful lot has been said about this album, so I'll try to say something a little different.  File this away in the annals of \\"things you might not have known.\\"<br />Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" contains two-thirds of Eddie Vedder's little known \\"Mamasan Trilogy.\\"  In the spirit of rock opera Vedder lays out a tale of a twisted life in the songs Alive and Once.  The third song of the trilogy, \\"Footsteps/Times of Trouble\\" is on the Temple of Dog record combining members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam in tribute to fallen band member Andrew Woods of Pearl Jam precursor Mother Love Bone.  So here's how the story goes...the trilogy starts with \\"Alive\\" in which a young man's Father has died and allows himself to be seduced by a older woman Mrs. Robinson type who also happens to be...err...umm...how to say this, well let's just say maternally-related of the first order.  This traumatic experience eventually caused said seduced kid to go on a rampage falling down the ill-fated path of taking up serial homicide as a profession as told about in the song \\"Once\\"  Vedder growls, \\"Once upon a time I could control myself\\"  And it all ends as our forlorn character is caught and lands on death row.  \\"Footsteps,\\" finishes the trilogy off with reminisces of a doomed delinquent dallying his last days and lost in deep thought, regret, and denial from behind the bars of a jail cell.<br />So, \\"Ten\\" is Pearl Jam's most popular and accessible album but I don't think their best.  It is the least Pearl Jam of Pearl Jam albums not capturing what the band is all about.  In places it is overproduced with some unneeded echo effects in \\"Evenflow.\\"  But if you are new to Pearl Jam, get this album.  The detractors only show through to serious and seriously demented Pearl Jam-heads.  The songs only get better live and hearing them on albums like Spodek Poland or Philadelphia only makes you appreciate the studio versions that much more.  Enjoy.
B0000024TQ|5.0|From the driving rock of \\"Faking It\\" and \\"Hazy Shade of Winter\\" to the feel-good ease of \\"Punky's Dilema\\" and \\"59th Street Bridge Song\\" this is an album that runs an impressive gamut of musical styles. But the section that bears the closest listening (if your heart can take it) appears near the middle of the album. \\"Voices of Old People, Old Friends, Bookends Theme\\" will bring tears to the eyes of all but the hard-hearted or just plain obtuse. A brilliant example of production values enhancing composition.
0151008116|5.0|I work at a bookstore and have been waiting to read this since I saw it first come in.  This weekend I finally got the time.<br />Although I just finished it hours ago, it is still on my mind, making me ponder and try understand the final meaning.  I'm not saying the ending is confusing, it just has multiple levels of meaning and I am not sure what everything means.<br />The story itself is a great tale of survival on open sea for 227 days in a 26 foot lifeboat.  Pi along with a large Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker (due to clerical errors) must develop a undrstanding with each other in order to survive.  Along the way they help each other survive (Pi provides the food, Richard Parker provides the companionship).<br />But it is the ending that makes this book.  Read it and you'll know what I mean.<br />Highly Recommended!
6303314015|5.0|This movie is the BEST family film! The story, the characters, just everything is awesome. This is a Disney film that has numerous of memorable songs. The first time I watched this was when I was 7 years old and now that I'm 13, I still find myself picking this video off the shelf and singing along to the songs like, &quot;I Just Can't Wait to Be King&quot;, &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot;, and &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot;. This is probably the best animated family film to watch on a Saturday night. I can't wait 'till this Disney MASTERPIECE comes out on DVD! Hakuna Matata everybody!
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD was a lot better then I thought it would be. I was a little skeptical to buy it because I had only heard 3 of the songs and 30 second clips of the other 10. So I decided to buy it anyway. I like it a lot. This is finally a CD that I can listen to all the songs without skipping one song. She's not pop as other people say. She's rock/pop. I think personally she's more on the rock side because she plays her own guitar and writes her own songs and sings them too herself. Unlike other pop artists I know of. All the songs are different so that's also a good thing. So if you don't care what other people think and are looking for some great music to listen try Avril Lavigne she may be just what you're looking for.

B00003CX5P|1.0|I have seen thousands and thousands of movies and this is the worst. Even bad movies have something redeemable about them: perhaps a plot line, or a character, or a performance by an actor. But not in this one. There is NOTHING of any value in this flick. <br />Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker gives probably the worst performance of any actor in the history of motion pictures. It's unbelievable how he was cast. <br />The Phantom Menace does not have any recognizable plot. The special effects are laughable. The computer-generated characters are terrible. The Phantom Menace just drags on and on and on . . . <br />...This movie better than the previous Star Wars films? Please, see the originals. Then throw the Phantom Menace away.
0767827902|5.0|Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show is a landmark film in the history of motion picture.  At the time of it's release it was declared the most important American film since Citizen Kane.  The film is easily the best picture of the 1970's and features strong performances from Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepard (screen debut), and ellen Burstyn.  The film focuses on the sexual and social of a small Texas town, and is a stark examination of human nature and society.  Many people claimed American Beauty exposed such an element in society....I agree American Beauty was a great film- but American Beauty dosen't come close to the grace and delicacy at which Peter Bogdanovich examines similiar issues in this timeless classic.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is at the top of his game.<BR>Now that he's focusing more on making music than shocking people, he is much better.<br />His first song, \\"White America\\", is a sort-of Hard Rock rapfest.<br />Em lays it down thick on, \\"Buisness\\", but for some reason I find my self getting bored with it.<br />\\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\", is a sad little song you will probally like, if you don't mind violins.<br />\\"Square Dance\\", is OK, but I find it a bit dull and repettive.<br />\\"Solider\\", isn't too great,but worth a listen<br />\\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\", quite good.<br />Uh-oh here comes the awful, \\"Drips\\", Please, kill me now!<br />\\"Without Me\\", is EXCELLENT!<br />\\"Sing For The Moment\\" has a pretty good Chourus going for it, but thats it.<br />Ah, The Amazing, \\"Superman\\", I am not worthy!<br />\\"Hallie's Song\\", is sheer brilliance<br />Then there's 3 OK songs that you ought to give a chance.<br />And Lastly, \\"I Think My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" Is very good and a little funny.<br />So you see, while some songs are not too good, The good ones are THE BEST EVER!!
B000002WYT|5.0|I am a fan of REM, Eels and Dave Matthews Band. There are others though, but these 3 are the ones I remember at first. There is a reason for this, and in favor of the Dave Matthews Band (DMB), Crash speaks for itself.<br />Although Before These Crowded Streets is slightly better (due to it's more jazzy songs and better melodies, but that's my opinion), Crash is wonderfully great. A lot of songs have that quality that will have you listen to them again and again. And the band's original mix of instruments and Matthews' great voice and lyrics are definitely worthwile. Songs like \\"Two Step\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\" are so beautiful, while songs like \\"Drive In Drive Out\\" have such powerfull rifs in them, i could go on and on and on... The DMB are just one of those bands in the 90's which you can't forget.<br />Are you in a sad mood? Are you happy? Are you melancholic? Do you want to hear something that will you make you happy again? Do you want to hear something that emotionally touches you?? DMB will provide it, also with this effort. Whatever you think, you can't deny this : this is a band which stands for QUALITY!!!
B00005JLDW|3.0|I went to this movie with extremely low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Despite a cliche-ridden plot and characters who are basically stereotypes, the film manages to keep our attention and even generate some suspense. One of the movie's secrets is to combine several genres. We have here a monster movie, a post-apocalypse scenario AND a war movie all rolled into one. It also helps that the flying, fire-breathing dragons that have wiped out most of the human race are quite realistic and frightening to behold. The performances are also good, especially considering the limited script. I think it would have been even better if it had been a bit campier rather than so grim and straightforward. Christian Bale is the protaganist, the only survivor of the first dragon attack (which killed his mother along with countless others). He leads an outpost of survivors who are holed up in an old English fort. Their already precarious existence is disrupted when an American military unit shows up. They are led by Matthew McConaughey, who is almost a parody of the macho action hero. He shouts his lines like a drill sergeant, stares everyone down with unblinking eyes and, of course, never smiles. Yet, McConaughey does a good job of making him seem real, and adds some deadpan humor to the mix. The major conflict comes when the gung-ho McConaughey wants to lead an invasion against the all-powerful male dragon (his speech about not compromising with these killers can easily be heard as a thinly disguised pro-military agenda in the real world). The more cautious Bale character, haunted by early memories of the dragons, wants to stay put in his stronghold. Will this courageous but foolhardy attack ever take place? Anyone who's seen more than a dozen movies knows the answer, but Reign of Fire still makes it all interesting.
0446677450|5.0|I REally feel sorry for people who criticize the flawless ideas presented in this book! INstead of focusing on \\"how\\" the book was written or the story about his two dads, they should focus on \\"WHAT\\" he is actually saying about poor people and their industrial age thinking! QUICK QUESTION. WHats more important a college degree or a high financial IQ? People stuck with the same stupid, dumb, idiotic belief that college=success will say that a college degree is all you need. Poor souls i feel for them! College is a resume builder no more no less! It has nothing to do with being rich! WHy dont people see that? Oh i forgot, it probably has something to do with what their parents taught them, and what their parents parents taught them. Wake up FOLKS! MONEY CAN BE YOURS but only if your ready to LEarn the \\"RIGHT things\\" and not what school teaches you.
B000002G7E|1.0|The Velvets made a lot of great albums. VU and Nico, Squeeze, self titled, Loaded. This...is too terrible for words.
B00003CWMI|4.0|Bicentennial Man\\" was advertised as a childrens' movie when it first came out in the theaters, but it is so much more than that. The movie tells about a robot, played by Robin Williams, and his quest (which takes over 200 years) to become human.<br />I knew the movie would be more than giggles and special effects.  The movie was, in my opinion, quite well done. What looks like a comedy at first ends up being a layered look at the human race. Robin Williams is surprisingly sedate and his romance between him and the daughter of his first love is touchingly sweet.<br />\\"Bicentennial Man\\" is at both times uplifting and saddening. It is a great family movie, although some of the deeper meanings in the movie might be over the heads of younger children, they will still be entertained by the movie (and the token \\"booger\\" jokes thrown in for that purpose). And if you really want to enjoy the movie with your family, watch it and then read the novella and compare!
B00005J73X|5.0|This is a great album for those that may have never heard Bon Jovi live throughout the years! The band is definitely the best one I've ever seen live. The quality of their performances matches the quality of their studio albums which very rarely do you get a band that can do that. I recommend this album for anyone that wants to listen to a CD and feel like their at a concert too! Be sure to check out his other albums, they're all awesome - he's never released a bad song, and his new album is set to be released in early Oct. of this year!
0767849493|5.0|Kevin Smith, the king of quirky, teenage stoner movies, is back with what is, in my not-so-humble opinion, the best of the &quot;View Askew&quot; series. The movie was preceded by &quot;Clerks,&quot; &quot;Mallrats,&quot; and &quot;Chasing Amy,&quot; and is the second to the last in the series. The movies are actually excellent stand-alones; the &quot;series&quot; is very loosely connected, but having watched all of the previous movies in the ViewAskewniverse, I caught quite a few of Kevin Smith's &quot;in&quot; jokes. Silent Bob and Jay are, of course, the best characters in the movie, once again upstaging the stars.<br />This movie will most likely offend anyone sensitive about the topic of religion. And if you think movies today have too much violence and bad language... welllll... perhaps you should rent a Disney movie instead! But for anyone looking for sarcastic humor and religious satire, you're guaranteed good entertainment with &quot;Dogma.&quot;<br />While seeing Ben Affleck and Matt Damon together again is a highlight of the movie, the best part about it are the smaller parts. Chris Rock as Rufus is hilarious - and I don't even like Chris Rock! Alan Rickman as the voice of God is perfect... there's nothing that improves a movie more than sarcastic British wit. Janeane Garofalo, in a bit part, is wonderful - as usual - and Alanis Morissette makes the perfect God (I'll worship her any day).<br />If you're looking for something to liven up your weekend, go out and rent &quot;Dogma.&quot; And better yet, rent &quot;Clerks,&quot; &quot;Mallrats,&quot; &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,&quot; and &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; with it and get your fill of Jay, Silent Bob, snootchie bootchies, the Jedi Mind Trick, and comic book fun.
B00004Z459|3.0|This album contains very little depth in terms of musicianship or quality lyrics.  What it does contain is some loud music with some decent rap and surprisingly good melodies.  This is good music, say, to listen to before you play a basketball game or a football game, but not much else.  You'll find yourself enjoying it while you listen but then putting it away and not having it in your CD player for a long time to come.  Points of Authority is my favorite song on here, and the singles are probably my least favorite.  I don't know who chose to release the ones they did, but they could have probably done better.<br />  Track 1:Papercut-1/5  I can't stand this song.....<BR>  Track 2:One Step Closer-3/5 <BR>  Track 3:With You-4/5<BR>  Track 4:Points of Authority-5/5  I love this song!!<BR>  Track 5:Crawling-2/5  Sounds good at first but it gets repetitive VERY quickly.....<BR>  Track 6:Runaway-2/5<BR>  Track 7:By Myself-4/5<BR>  Track 8:In the End-3/5<BR>  Track 9:A Place For My Head-2/5<BR>  Track 10:Forgotten-3/5<BR>  Track 11:Cure For the Itch-2/5<BR>  Track 12:Pushing Me Away-2/5  Sounds too much like a boy band.....<br />  Well, there you have my opinion along with the long list of others.

0316666343|5.0|Susie Salmon (like the fish) narrates this well-written, suspenseful novel from Heaven. Susie begins her story by telling of her death at the hands of a deceptively mild-mannered neighbor. From there, she travels back through moments of her past, interspersed with glimpses of her family and friends while they are coping with her death.<br />Susie's Heaven resembles her hometown high school, where she only has to attend art class and there are swings outside with the \\"good seats.\\" Anything she wants in Heaven, she just has to imagine. But the one thing she truly wants - to be alive and together with her family once again - she can never have. Instead, she observes her family over a period of ten years as they grow older and continue living without her.<br />The Lovely Bones grabs your interest from the very first page, and holds it throughout with a story that is both charming and melancholy. The characters become well-loved as the novel proceeds and you will be sorry to see them go when you turn the last page. Alice Sebold is truly a new author to watch.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Calling this movie a \\"mindblowing masterpiece\\" would be a little bit of an understatement... As has already been stated, this movie is a no-holds barred view of the hellish world of drug addiction, staggeringly portrayed by the 4 main actors, and provocatively and innovatively executed by Arronofsky. After seeing Pi and having my faith in the cinema completely renewed, I couldn't wait to see this film. Suffice it to say, it left me perfectly breathless, touched in that very deep, special way that only certain films can do. . . Yadda yadda yadda. And yet, it's so one-sided, and it's nothing if not propaganda. Any movie is somewhat fictitious, even those that have grounds in true events, but conceptually, this movie only succeeds in further espousing the DARE scare tactics that we've all come to know and love (or loathe, if yr like me), which is basically that all drugs are bad, and anyone who uses them, for whatever reason, is eventually doomed to a life of pain beyond comprehension. *That's* dissapointing, and what's more, it's not real. While on the one hand, I do think this is a must see for anyone considering using hardcore drugs, (because they are dangerous, duh), I also think that it is important to view it within the framework of all the other information that's been written about them, and not get all mushy over this movie's tragedy. Because it is really an awesome film, one just wishes the message were as up to date as it purports to be.
B00005N53P|4.0|Great album full of catchy tunes, it's good to see an NYC band back in the limelight (the West Coast-driven music scene gets old after a while for East Coast guys like me). Maybe it's derivative, but it's incredibly well-done rock music - with no extra genre tags or adjectives i.e. &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;emo&quot; or &quot;post-punk or any of that garbage - just rock!.<BR>They almost live up to all the hype that's been heaped on them.

B00004RF83|5.0|Read other reviews for the plot.   This is an excellent DVD&gt; The commentary by director Frankenheimer never fails to interest.   He describes in detail is reasons for staging a scene, his choice of lens, etc, even gives the F stop.  He points out that this pic is set in the future and notes which items didn't exist at the time and how he made things such as picture phones. He goes into detail tooon locations, JFKs cooperation with the company and so on.  As he doe in the Train he notes lttle details you might miss.  Have not seen it since it came out and have no interest in politics but found myself caught up in  it again.                             I think those with an interest in movies will find this a treasure and the story is still suspensful with excellent acting.

6305603847|5.0|Pink Floyd The Wall is one of the greatest musical videos to ever be made, and definitly the most creative. If you are a die-hard Floyd fan or even just someone who just likes The Wall cd, it is a must to see this movie since it really gets through to you what The Wall is really about. The movie itself is a mix of real-life and some animation. Although, i think the movie is cut short a little since some of the songs are not their whole length and some like \\"Hey You\\" and \\"The show must go on\\" are not even part of the actuall movie,(although the video to Hey You is on the DVD and is one of the best) it still comes in as one of the best, as it tells the story of The Wall through the movies.
B000069HK2|5.0|What can I say  but &quot;wow&quot; this cd was well above any of my somewhat lukewarm expectations.  With all these new bands starting with the preposition &quot;the&quot; I was a little hesitant of The Used being a sound-a-like.  But man was I wrong in that presupposition.  From the opening roar of Maybe Memories to the ending thunder of the hidden track, this cd absolutely blew me away.  Now do not get me wrong this album is not full of thrashing, screaming rips of sonic power, though it does contain them, but it also moves into the area of pop-punk and ballads.   This constant movement from grinding guitars to soothing melodies keeps the Used original and very interesting.  I honestly cannot pick out a song that is a highlight because everyone one of them are so astonishing.  <br />Another area that stands to me on this album is the diversity of the singer's vocals.  He can scream viciously or rend the air with a hauntingly beautiful singing voice.  The Used's McCraken may be one of the best new vocalist and lyricist in rock music.  What more can I say an excellent all-round entertaining absorbing album. Buy this album soon...buy into the hype....
B000068PQ0|3.0|Why is it that so many bands now treat electric guitars like they're lepers? Think about it: the great untold phenomenon of the last four years is the mass exodus many bands have taken to mellower and electric guitar-free music. The Flaming Lips are but one example; R.E.M., Bob Mould, Midnoght Oil, Grant Lee Phillips, and more. Then there's those who are simply mellowing out, like the Simple Minds, U2, Tom Petty, among many others. <br />Why do I mention all of these bands? Because it is within the context of the current music climate that one can understand this album. There are very, very few bands whose last album, whatever it may be, has been better than the one before. Many of the better bands in fact have spent the last few years in a creative funk, and not just because of the quieter material. In the past, the Flaming Lips have beat this phenomenon, and with this album, they continue to beat it - to a degree.<br />What this album exhibits is a great example of musical professionalism. It is enjoyable, dense, and clearly the creative fire is still there. But the trade off for consistently good material is that the quality of each song fails to register on a level near their best stuff. In other words, there are no duds, but then there are no real gems. Just a bunch of very good tunes that you won't be ever find yourself becoming emotionally attached to.    <br />The soundscapes are very fascinating; in some ways, I wish they'd gone the Pink Floyd route and added even more background effects and off-hand noise. What really hurts the songs is the computerized percussion. I mean, it's really, really annoying. I can understand Wayne's desire to explore new possibilities, but the computerized drums smack of laziness rather than innovation.<br />(I also have to wonder why it is that for this album and the previous one, Wayne deliberately left off the best song. If you happen upon the songs \\"Funeral In My Head\\" or \\"The Captain Is A Cold Heater\\", you'll see what I mean.)  <br />That said, this is one of the best albums of the year, simply because the number of good albums has been so few. Anything approaching moderate enjoyablity is bound to get your attention nowadays, and the Flaming Lips succeed in that. But stick this album in the middle of say 1995 (not the greatest musical year of the 90's, which is part of my point), and this album probably wouldn't crack the top 15. <br />So am I recommending it? Yes, provided you can stand the electronic drums.

B000002HAF|5.0|Surfer Rosa was my introduction to the \\"other\\" music that exists out in the world, and thank goodness I found it while I was still a teenager! Otherwise I probably wouldn't have understood it and missed out on years of great music....Although I had bought \\"Dolittle\\" on Cd, (and enjoyed it), I hung onto my pirated cassette of Surfer Rosa and even burned the cassette onto cd....Surfer Rosa, now considered a classic album by many, has thankfully avoided being remastered by some idiot or put on one of those overpriced gold disks. <BR>Many years have passed since the Pixies were big in their little world of fans but the music still holds up, even today. The lyrics, humor, noise and sound are still fresh and not dated by any means. <BR>The bottom line? Surfer Rosa is the type of album that everyone needs in their collection. It's good and cheap music that can be played over and over again. Even if Punk and Indie rock aren't your cup of tea, you can agree that trying it out at this price is not going to hurt your pocket book if you don't like it.
B000063V8S|5.0|I LOVE Star Trek:TNG!  It had to be (while it was on the air) and still is one of my all-time favorite shows.  It has characters that are engaging, interesting, likeable and just plain well done.  It also seems that the perfect actor was chosen for each part.  I've become so attached to the show that it almost seems like the TNG crew are not strangers but old friends.  I can honestly say, save for one aspect, that I love EVERYTHING about this show.  I already own the first 3 seasons on DVD and I am buying them all as they are realesed.<br />Unfortunately even the best show on TV has it's annoying aspect.  The one person/character that this show could have done without is Wesley Crusher played by Wil Wheaton.  If I was given a choice between watching a Wil Wheaton/W. Crusher TNG episode or sawing my own leg off with a rusty butter knife I'd probably go for the latter option.  Unfortunately he happens to be involved in ONE of my favorite episodes (Remember Me).<br />Aside from that I REALLY love this show.  Season 3 is truly the season when ST:TNG became a truly enjoyable show.  The actors are finally comfortable with each other and have fully developed their characters interactions as well.  But I must say that Season 4 is the absolute crown jewel in the TNG world.  I eagerly anticipate the Sept. 3rd release date of the shows best year.
B000067JBN|4.0|I thought this movie certainly could have been much better, but it was still fun to watch. One of the problems with directors and producers in many Hollywood remakes is that they tend to \\"dumb down\\" a movie, in this case H.G. Wells \\"The Time Machine\\", by making a movie that vaguely represents the original novel. It would have been great to see a more realistic portrayel of the book. For instance, in the book the time traveler arrives to a place where no one speaks English; in this movie, the time traveler arrives to find that a few people can communicate with him. The novel's time traveller goes to the future and explores quite awhile before seeing any signs of life; in this movie, Alexander is taken to a future where people immediately take him in and help him back to health.(This seemed to diminish the notion of mystery that the movie was trying to produce.)<br />Also, I just don't get why they use overblown fighting scenes in movies that do not really require it. Although a certain amount is fun to watch, overdoing it seems to take away from the integrity of the movie. For instance, we have this major struggle between one of the Morlocks (a race of individuals who have evolved into cannibalistic creatures) and Alexander Hartdegan (the time traveller and protagonist) that is kind of tacky and is unnecessarily long. <br />There are many positives to this movie. One is the special effects of the time travel sequences, where we see the passage of modern advances and technology as Alexander proceeds through each century. Another is the main story plot of Alexander trying to change the past to save his fiancee's tragic accident. Believing that he is somewhat to blame for her death, he tries to go back and change this. In discovering that going back to the past cannot change the future, he decides to go into the future to explore the possibilities of fate and decisions. I felt like the acting was good: Guy Pearce is stellar in his ablility of playing  the part of a desparate man wanting to change history; Samantha Mumba is commendable as one of the people of the future race that can speak English, representing his hope of finding his answer.  <br />I must admit that I have not seen the original 1960 version of The Time Machine, but I felt like this was a movie that brings to life the possibility of time travel and its consequences. This movie does not have any \\"big name\\" Hollywood actors (maybe Jeremy Irons), but still it is a sci-fi movie worth seeing.

0805062971|4.0|This was a great book to read.  After seeing the movie and enjoying it, I wanted to read the book since books are usually better than the movie.  This theory was upheld, as the book was not a disappointment.  I look forward to reading Palahniuk's other books.

0684833395|4.0|My sentiments exactly - spoken by Dr. Stubbs of Yossarian, the prodigious, yet pugnacious protagonist. In a paradoxical world, where the supposedly sane commanding officers run the miltary through methodical madness, the \\"crazy\\" Yossarian is deemed so because he values self-preservation over death.<br />The military brass in Catch-22 proves not only utterly pretentious, incomptetent, indolent, and inept, but incongruously insane themselves. General P.P. Peckem ostentatiously states, \\"My only fault\\", he pauses for effect,\\"is that I have no faults.\\" General Peckem is only one of the many well-developed laughable characters developed throughout Catch-22. The general pedestrian reader might say that this is solely another \\"anti-war\\" book. I think that would be shallow and inaccurate as Catch-22 is much, much more than that. To me, Catch-22 sparks many thoughts and feelings concerning individuality vs. the system(and the Syndicate) and the willingness of one person in a sea of conformity to have the balls to stand up for what is right regardless what the consequences may be.
0312265859|3.0|I enjoyed this book, although I would suggest, if you're planning on buying it, to wait until the paperback comes out.  It's not much different from the usual Stephanie Plum book - Stephanie has love life problems and quirky relatives, is an inept bounty hunter, and knows many quirky Burg natives.  Oh yeah, and there's the usual car damage.  I haven't read any Stephanie Plum books in a while, which is probably why I'm not as tired of all of that as some of the other reviewers of this book seem to be.  I agree that Stephanie's ineptness is getting a bit tiring.  You'd think after seven books she would've learned something.  It's amazing that Ranger and Morelli are as interested in her as they are.  All I can think is that they must love her for her entertainment value.  The best reason to read this book is for the update on Stephanie's relationship status with Ranger and Morelli, both characters I enjoy.  I gave this book a three instead of a four because of the incredibly sudden and convinient way the author wraps up some of Stephanie's problems.  Stephanie doesn't hardly need to solve her own problems, because nature and other people will do it for her.  I hope that in the next book she runs up against something or someone that only she can deal with.
0375703764|5.0|Danielewski's book slaps you across the head like - well, like something that's never slapped you across the head before. This is a novel entirely new, something not too common nowadays. The book recounts the story of a spiraling tattoo artist who stumbles across a handwritten manuscript. The manuscript, the product of a blind scholar, is a scholarly essay on a movie about a house that never ends. The house is a terrifying, inexplicable black monster that nobody can explain.<br />Confused? That's part of the delight of this book. Danielewski wraps his story with extended footnotes, innovative graphic design, and massive amounts of meticulously researched information. But most of all, IT'S CREEPY, in a way you never thought self-aware fiction could be. A must read for David Foster Wallace fans, people writing their doctoral dissertations on the Blair Witch project, and anyone else who views &quot;weird&quot; as the most positive adjective of all.
B00005QG9J|4.0|This is a good album. I would usually give it 5 stars but the reason I didn't is because I think &quot;Make Yourself&quot; is a better album. Like Make Yourself, this has good songs and lyrics but Make Yourself has better songs. You should pick up that album before this one and then get this one because this is still a good album.
B000000OPZ|5.0|If I could rate this album with 6 stars I would have. Awesome guitar work from Sykes & Vandenberg, this CD includes the best Whitesnake songs ever CRYING IN THE RAIN, STILL OF THE NIGHT, HERE I GO, BAD BOYS and CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT. I recommend you to get the international version which includes 2 extra killer tunes YOU'RE GONNA BREAK MY HEART AGAIN and the power ballad LOOKING FOR LOVE (listen to the guitar solo). get it & play it loud.
B00005T343|4.0|First, I would like to point out that this movie is very diffrent from the real book. The plot and ending is diffrent. Not that this is a bad thing, The book, over all, was a lot better, but the movie is very good too. Sir Anthony Hopkins was awsome as predicted, and Jodie Foster's replacement (I can't believe she would do this movie!) Julian Moore, was a great actress, playing Starling's part as well as Jodie!<BR>I must say I was delighted with the film's Score, a beautifull piece of artwork that fit perfectly with the moods of the film.<BR>Most people complain about this movie not being a very good sequel to the famous Silence of the Lambs, and its because it's not, this movie is not a sequel, but a second, (third in the book series, and soon to be movie), part in the Lecter/Starling adventers. <BR>This is a great movie with a fabulous scrip and score, as well as fantasic acting by all the acters/actress'.
B00005LOUQ|4.0|I could watch it over and over just for the costumes and hair styles and all the other crazy Who things. The original cartoon grinch is a different story than this one although the same idea. Excellent children/teen's movie. WIth Jim Carey as the grinch you'll be laughing and with Little Cindy Lou Who trying to bring the grinch back inot the chistmas spirit you will be touched by her heart and spirit in the story. I would say one of the best christmas based stories to come out in years.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold's \\"Lovely Bones\\" is a surprising best seller, in that it deals with the aftermath of a girl's death.  In 1973, Susie Salmon is tragically raped and murdered at the age of fourteen by a serial killer.  Although Susie is dead, her spirit lives on in heaven, where she is gradually getting accustomed to her new environment.  She looks down sadly as her grief-stricken father, Jack, her mother Abigail, and her siblings, Lindsey and Buckley, try to come to terms with their horrible loss.<br />Susie longs to comfort her family.  She even brings her spirit down to earth to be near her loved ones. She aches for her father who feels her loss the most.  Susie agonizes when she sees that her parents' marriage is suffering because Jack and Abigail are unable to share their grief with one another.  Equally heartbreaking is Susie's regret at never being able to grow up and experience adult life with all of its possibilities.<br />However, as depressing as all of this sounds, there is something upbeat about \\"Lovely Bones.\\"  It is a touching exploration of the possibility that there is always some connection between the dead and the living.  Not only do our departed loved ones live on in our memories, but their spirits may be with us in a more concrete way than we realize.  Sebold also touches on other meaningful themes:  How do those who survive when their loved ones die manage to face the future with a feeling of hope? How do they achieve closure?  The author suggests that with patience and understanding, families can heal.  Human beings are surprisingly resilient.  \\"Lovely Bones\\" leaves us with the feeling that death may not really be the end, after all.
B00000IPAX|4.0|Its funny its immature and pop punk. They brought pop punk to what it is today too many guys in their 20's making a few (thousand) bucks. But hey i still love em. If thats what you like this is a must buy! if not give you money to barry manalo or some old guy! j/k
B0000630BT|4.0|If you're thinking about buying this, do it, but you must know one thing:  This album is cheesy.  VERY cheesy!  So cheesy it should come with a mullet wig.  This album will throw every heavy metal cliche at you that you can think of.  Is that a bad thing?  Well, perhaps for some it is, but for me?  Not really.<br />As big a metal fan as I am, I've never really been big into Judas Priest.  I mean, I know all about them, I've heard \\"Living after Midnight\\" and \\"Breaking the Law\\" on the radio a zillion times, I've heard every metalhead refer to them as the \\"gods of metal\\" and praise Halford as the greatest singer alive, etc.  So, I figure, \\"Hey, I gotta get something by this band.  What have I got to lose?\\" Of course I knew about \\"British Steel\\", \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\", \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\", and all those, but then I stumbled across \\"Painkiller\\".  Now this sounded REALLY good!  So, I had to go and buy it.<br />I gotta say, I was initially rather shocked.  I'm more accustomed to bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden, who take a more sophisticated approach to metal.  So, when I began to listen to this, and was bombarded with lyrics about blazing guns, metal meltdowns, and leather this and that, I was like \\"Whoa, now this is just too much!\\".  It felt like there should be a label that says \\"Do not listen without mullet\\".  But, I stuck it out, and it just so happens this is quite a good CD.<br />If you can get past the abundant cheese, this is a very well-made album.  The musicianship is excellent, and the aggression is kicked up a notch from the earlier material.  Scott Travis is a much better drummer than Dave Holland, allowing for the band to throw in a bit more speed, and with good results.  The guitar work is the best I've heard from them as well.  Great harmonics, and scorching leads. On \\"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\\", Tipton taps for like 30 seconds straight.  Very impressive.  Now, about Halford.  Personally, I think he's a bit overrated.  While he is a great singer, he is most certainly not the best singer on the planet.  He's got a great voice, but I would never put him on the same level as Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate.  Plus, the high-pitched wail thing can be a bit much.  It works if he throws it in at just the right time, but when he does it throughout the duration of a song (like on the title track), it tends to overstay its welcome.<br />All in all, this is a pretty good album.  Best metal album ever?  Well, no, not quite, it's no \\"Powerslave\\", but if oldschool metal is your thing, and you don't mind a little cheese, go check \\"Painkiller\\" out.  You'll be glad you did.singer, he is most certainly not the best singer on the planet.  He's got a great voice, but I would never put him on the same level as Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate.

I will differ from most people here in saying that my facorite tune on the is seven stones..one of their best songs. The whole cd is excellent...the fading in out of the fountain of salmacis..kind of surrealistic..the good rythm section on return of the giant hogweed and of course everybody else's favorite the musical box..play me song here it comes again. If you have never picked up this cd and like genesis cd's do so.
B000005J56|4.0|Beautiful music and lyrics performed flawlessly by Cuban performers.  There's lots of heart in this one, this is the real thing.  Recording / production quality is good, but not great.<br />The 2 instruments played by producer Ry Cooder and son sometimes sound out of place and overall annoying.  Electric guitar sounds Hawaiian (how far from Cuba can you get...) and percussion (Joaquim Cooder) sometimes introduces what sound like mistakes to me.<br />Does make me wonder how much the Cuban artists were paid for their performance, royalties, etc. or are they still living in great poverty (watch the movie)
B00005JA2B|5.0|I got this in vinyl form when it first came out in 76..wasn't too old at the time. If there was one cd that I can say is my favorite..it is probaly this one.

B00005QK3W|3.0|Macca's latest effort has som nice bits in it (from a lover to a friend, magic) some awful parts (she's given up talking, rinse the raindrops, spinning on its axis) and a lot of mediocre songs. Given the time Paul took after the death of Linda to come up with a new album he could have done a lot better. Driving Rain cannot be compared with Paul's jewels in his crown (Press to Play, Band on the Run, Ram and Back to the Egg). To give Paul credit DR is some respects quite innovative. But unlike Press to Play (joint effort with Eric Steward - 10CC) DR does not contain any real outstanding somgs and does not sound -not of this worldlike- as PtP sometimes does. A must for Macca die hards but not a must for music lovers.
B00000IMYA|5.0|At the time of this concert, Duke needed a comeback, and boy, did he and his band pull it off!  It is sad that Duke never got to hear this _gorgeous_ stereo version of his triumphant concert.  Its even sadder that he and his band had to go into the studio and attempt to mock-up the concert, believing it to have been inadequately recorded in the first place.<br />In reality, it was _superbly_ recorded (check out the low bass from the kick drum!), but it only sounds so good when the two extant recordings are combined and digitally synchronized into a stereo recording.  This is because certain things (such as Paul Gonsalves legendary tenor solo) were better captured by one recording (he was playing into the wrong mic!  Aaagh!), and certain things were better captured by the other.  The stereo image that results from this unplanned combination is surprisingly effective, and much better than either mono recording taken alone.  Stereo purists and fans of minimal micing might not be completely happy, but that's looking a gift horse in the mouth -- and this is about the nicest gift horse anybody could ever hope to get.  The album is a perfect document of a great band's turnaround, and a superb sonic achievement.<br />Playing the CD is like stepping into a time machine and experiencing one of jazz history's greatest moments.  If you love Duke, it will be hard not to weep with joy, for him in his hour of glory, and for the countless future listeners who will now be able to visit Newport and hear him soar.
B000002LCU|3.0|Nice album which sometimes sounds a bit too much like ELO. The album contains a number of great songs and a large number of nice ones. The latter would have sounded better if the influence of Jeff Lynne had been curtailed some more. All in all it is a nice album but certainly not George's best.
0694003611|5.0|My 18 month old daughter loves this book.  We read various books every night, and then I read her Goodnight Moon when we are all done.  She knows it's her \\"night night\\" book.  I recommend to every parent.  Excellent in establishing a night time routine.
0451191153|2.0|As a disclaimer for this review, I must hereby state my political postition: I am a devout liberal.  So devout, in fact, that I considered making myself a nice book cover out of brown paper in order to disguise the fact that I was reading such an infamously aliberal book as The Fountainhead.  (I decided against it-- paper is a valualbe natural resource, you know, and it shouldn't be wasted for something as frivolous as my vanity).  But I must confess, after toiling through all 704 pages of it, that I didn't abhor it.  Not consistently, in any case.  One of my main comlaints is that most of the characters, including Howard Roark, the hero, and his lover, Dominique, are entirely static throughout the book.  There is not one point at which Roark's incredible integrity is compromised enought to make him seen even slightly human.  While Rand's stated goal is to portray life \\"as it might and ought to be,\\" it becomes ineffective when the characters are too obviously godlike for humans to even aspire to.  Also, for all his supposed integrity, Roark (and all the other characters in the book, for that matter) think and act entirely in contradictions.  No one ever sinply eats a piece of bread because he is hungry; he eats it because it is the best way to make someone else conscious of his indifference toward them, even thought what he wants most is their love.  Here is a prime example: \\"It hurts me every time I think of him.  It makes everything easier-- the people, the editorials, the contracts-- but easier because it hurts so much.  Pain is a stimulant also.  I think I hate that name.  I will go on repeating it.  It is a pain I wish to bear.\\" Huh?  Another complaint: after years of the world's absolute contempt (at least outwardly) for Roark, I found his final triumph completely unbeleivable.  Finally, I resent Rand's manipulativeness.  Face it: this book is not an artistically written novel, but a piece of Objectivist propaganda.  I suppose I resent the fact that, no matterhow much one may, in principle, agree with the opinions of the antagonist, Ellsworth Toohey, his positions are so radical, and taken to such ridiculous extremes that the reader has no choice but to hate him.  Who could possible agree with the sentiment that all reason should be automatically discounted in favor of intuition and \\"feelings\\"?  Toohey's lengthy diatribes against selfishness and his sermons about his plans for the world come off more like the rantings of a mad scientist than a sane (if \\"misguided\\")philosopher.  <BR>     I did say, however, that I don't hate the book.  I like the message of the triumph of artistic individualism against the garbage of the masses, and I even found the scene in which Gail Wynand (a man who understands Roark and tries oh-so-hard to be like him and stand up for his beliefs) is finally crushed by the power of the ignorant masses rather moving.  To this end, I say read the book.  Yes it IS long, I know.  But at least you will have broadened you horizons.  If only to understand the mind of the enemy. ;-)
0201626632|5.0|The insights in Feibelman's book are remarkable.  Although it's been 12 years since receiving my Ph.D. from Palo Alto, I found myself taking notes (to avoid making some new mistakes). <br />Though written somewhat for the hard sciences, I found everything had an analogue in the social sciences.  It is required reading for all of the graduate students in my Food and Brand Lab.<br />Something that's also clever about the book is how the author characterizes the counterarguments to many of his ideas and observations.  By acknowledging these sometimes misguided, sometimes cynical views, he adds a nice credibility flair to his perspective.  It also keeps people reading instead of saying &quot;Yeah, but...&quot;  I wish it had been written 10 years earlier.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Before there were special effects, there was a great story behind a movie. While Forbidden Planet may not be your average action sci-fi flick, it does have pre-Star Wars blasters, Hyperspace and robots. When the crew of a spaceship is sent to a routinary mission to replace the researchers in a farway planet, they are surprised to find that only a mad doctor and his lovely daughter live there. The plot thickens as the astronaut falls for the girl, and the doctor discovers the real power behind his mad experiments. Packed with action, romance, wit and a touch of esoterism, Forbidden Planet is a must see for fans of the genre and all that want to know how Sci Fi has developed from its origins to its current state.
0380977788|5.0|I heard this book, in its entirety, before it was published.  At the 2000 World Horror Convention in Denver, Gaiman showed up unexpectedly and volunteered to read the novel to any conventioneer who would come to listen.  He started to read at 11 p.m. and he read the whole thing! I was there, transfixed, until 3 a.m., but it was worth every minute of lost sleep.<br />This book works on the strength of its characters:  the cat is especially engaging, but Coraline herself is a masterful image of how kids (brave, intelligent, but still very young kids) really think and act.  And the images are the things of nightmares -- nightmares that you have had and vaguely remember.  It speaks to subconscious fears.<br />This is a great book for children aged 8 to 12, but not for all children of those ages.  Know your child and consider carefully before letting him or her read this book.  It's a great adventure and imagination expander, but if your child is prone to nightmares, this book will bring them out!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Mental illness is not pleasant.  I've known and worked with a person who struggled with mental illness.  The reality is horrible for family and friends as well as the person.  The movie was excellent and the acting was superb.  I've seen Training Day and Russell Crowe was robbed at the Oscars.  The age changes and mannerisms used by Crowe in the movie were just outstanding.  I loved Russell Crowe in the Gladiator, but was amazed at how well he portrayed John Nash. He stepped up to an entirely new level. Parts of the movie were disturbing, and might have been more entertaining if presented in a different way.  I felt sad and disturbed after seeing this movie, but I have great admiration for both John Nash and his wife for simply surviving this life. I'm sure I'll see movies I like and enjoy more, but I don't think any actor will ever top Russell Crowe's performance.  This had to be a difficult movie to write, direct, and act in, but everyone did an excellent job.

Her diary begins the day her weirdo mom invites her to a New Year's bash at the neighbors house, and she's forced to go. Life doesn't get easier for the British punk girl, as she faces her the fact that her mother has become a chat-show hostess. Bridget lives her life, makes mistakes, makes someone happy, and you begin to feel that she is real, only to be disapointed by remembering she is a fictional character.<br />Bridget's character and problems in life is what pulls you in the book. I think, that if the main character in a book isn't enjoyable from the start, there is no point to reading it. Bridget Jones' Diary is an extremely good read for teens. I must end this now- going to begin sequel!
B000068QY7|1.0|I have listend to Oasis from the beginnig, and I have liked their cd's even when people said they were terrible. i.e Giants. <BR>But this cd is horrible.  THe only reason this cd will sell is becasue of the name Oasis.  If this had been their first cd they would be nobody right now.  &quot;Little by Little&quot; is a good song on this album, but after that, there is not much else. Listen before you buy, I wish i had.
0316666343|5.0|So much praise has already (and deservedly) been heaped on this remarkable first novel, that I fear there is little left to say.  Sebold delivers a beautiful and sensitive work, weaving an engrossing story in language that is a credit to her craft.  The author gives a remarkable voice to our guide, Susie Salmon (\\"like the fish\\"), never losing her teenagers eye view of the terrifying grief her murder has unleashed on her family and friends.  Most impressively, the book never falls into any of the hackneyed clichés that frequently give the author an easy out.  Instead, she always take the tougher road, giving the story a gritty reality that holds the reader in an emotional bear hug.  We want happy endings and easy answers.  Sebold is wise enough to know this would destroy the reality she seeks to create, brining saccharine to her very real feeling world.  <br />As with her memoir, Lucky, Sebold also brings humor where an outside might not feel it belongs.  But as any survivor of random tragedy will tell you, humor often creeps up in the most unlikely of places.<br />What more is there to say?  If you read one book this year, Lovely Bones should be at the top of your list.  I relished it.
B00004XMS0|3.0|All things come to an end, good or bad, we all know that. Batman, Batman Returns, and parts of Batman Forever hold up the lackluster star vehicles for Batman & Robin. The first two radiate with powerful storytelling and unerring capacity for mystery and intrigue. Batman Forever changes speed and flips to a comic rendition of Laurel & Hardy while introducing Robin. Some of Tim Burton's handiwork keeps it tolerable. Batman & Robin - well, the only good thing about is Uma Thurman who plays ultra-sexy \\"Poison Ivy.\\" I do toast a cup to Alfred who's remained a reason to see the last two films.<br />Robert Eldridge (...)
B000068OSK|1.0|All you bad taste trendies thinking you are jumping onto something new and cool are obviously musically stunted bigtime!  If this CD is your idea of good back-to-basics rock, then you need to find another band to listen to.  This CD is the WORST i've EVER heard, with boring, 3-chord guitar tunes, and the worst vocalist i've ever heard over my 3 decades of listening to rock music! Sonically, the instruments sound compressed and flat, and the recording is the worst i've ever heard.  Seriously.<BR>If you have any taste in music and recording quality, do yourself a favor and skip over this dissapointment!
B00005QK3W|4.0|McCartney, who just turned 60, brings a new life into his music. I had listened over this album once before, poorly reviewed it, but after watching \\"Vanilla Sky,\\" decided to listen to the disc over again. What may have eluded me about this album earlier, I believe, was the sincerity it possesses. Also, at the time of release, \\"Wingspan\\" was stuck in my head. I'm not going to say this is the best album he's ever done, though I will say that it is his most personal since \\"Flaming Pie.\\" McCartney's proven that he can stand the test of time and age by putting out some worthwhile material. I've altered this review, not to appease anyone, but to assess better than a passing glance on it. \\"Freedom,\\" is the one song so weak on the album it could have been pulled from a cracker-jack box. It's a nice catchy tune repeating the same words over some 20 times. \\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\\" from his early 1970's days fits a cause better and sorry, McCartney was never John Lennon. No matter how much you want it to be so, he's not -not the activist, maybe not as crazy, and certainly not a martyr. Now before you bash me, let's talk about the rest of the album. As personal as \\"Flaming Pie\\" was for Linda, \\"Driving Rain\\" centers on his new wife Heather, it's that blatant. The title track, \\"Magic,\\" \\"Vanilla Sky,\\" are all about him and places he's been. Watch the documentary short on the \\"Vanilla Sky\\" DVD to see what I mean. Sir McCartney is putting out the music for the generations that have grown with him and staying true to his fans. He's not pretending to be anything he's not, or not anymore...maybe with \\"Freedom.\\" Yet I tend to think of \\"Freedom,\\" as a compassionate piece written at a very difficult time which will always be remembered. Now, I'm not going to hamstring you...I don't in my books, and I won't here...it's a catchy tune, but is it another \\"Imagine,\\" \\"Power to the People?\\" No, sorry folks, no. Overall, the album is a good addition to your collection and a welcome comebackck
B000066NW0|5.0|Ok, a lot of people are against her just because she says she's punk but they think she's really pop. When it comes to Avril, it doesn't matter what kind of music it is. She has an amazing voice, and she sings her heart out with it! Also, her guitar playing skills are spectacular. Her song &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; for me has the biggest message of them all: don't change just because you will fit in, or others want you to change. Just be yourself, don't be dragged into things just to fit in. Also, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; has a pretty good message to. Just because your friends don't like someone or something, that doesn't mean YOU can't like that person or thing. Just go with what your heart says, not your brain. Her lyrics are amazing, well beyond her age of 17. Even if you're not a fan of girl singers, you really should give this one a try. Avril Lavigne rocks da house!!
6305609721|5.0|Star Trek IV was the well anticipated sequel to The Search for Spock. Trek III left a cliffhanger so large that the filmmakers had a veritable world of possibilities available. The mid-eighties Eco-trend was pulled off perfectly in its time, and the present. Species are still on the brink of extinction, global warming, and rainforests are still a problem. STIV takes the trek fans and non-trek fans on a wild ride back in time to 1986 to combat the extinct species problem. The 23rd century is devoid of: Whales. An alien probe is unleashing punishment on man for his abuse, and ultimate extinction, of the &quot;humpback&quot; whale. Kirk and crew (minus the Enterprise) have to go back in time to bring a couple of whales to the 23rd century to thwart the probes destruction. Spock is not himself, but he's far more hilarious, and the crew must travel in a rust bucket Klingon ship that is battle damaged from the late starship Enterprise. The movie is filled with twists and turns that are sure to still please fans and closet fans alike. Remember, Kirk and Co. are still outlaws in the 23rd century, and strangers in the 20th.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers' By the Way is by far their greatest CD yet! Of the 16 songs on the CD only one song is not good. The CD contains funk, slow, and rock songs that has alot of variety. The song I Could Die For You is one of the greatest songs the Chili Peppers have ever written and is up on the list with Under the Bridge and Soul to Squeeze. Like most classic Chili Peppers' songs, By the Way and Can't Stop have the funk and sweet,smooth verses. The Peppers have three great songs, Universally Speaking, Warm Tape and the Zephyr Song that are full of hope and warmth not regularly heard in other Peppers' works and these are among the best songs on the album. And like Californication, By the Way has three songs, This is the Place, Dosed, and Minor Thing, that are close to rock-like but have a sweeter tone then most rock does. Don't Forget Me and Venice Queen are two songs that sound like older, darker songs from the CD Blood,Sugar,Sex Magic but and are two pretty good songs. The Peppers also have two very different songs, Carbon and On Mercury that have a spanish like pace. These songs are also very good. The only song that is dissapointing is Throw Away Your Television. This is the best album I have ever heard. Flee is still the best bassist out there, Anthony has the smoothest voice in Rock, Frusiantes' quitar solo's are a perfect fit (Listen to the solo in Californication, it may be simple but still it is the best solo I have heard) and the drums are awesome. BUY THIS CD.
B000067CPX|5.0|Music is just like movie sequals. The first will never be topped and with the follow-up you don't want a complete clone of the first but you want it to be just as good if not better. With By The Way you get that. It's just as good as anything they've ever done and has topped the album before it, Californication. Most people hate the fact that movie sequals these days are unoriginal and the same as the last and want something new and different. Too bad the mainstream music world is totally the opposite and wants their music to be the same as the last and will give up on it if it's not. <br />Go buy By the Way and enjoy it for what it is...a classic album by the worlds best band!
B000067CPX|4.0|red hot chili peppers are one of my top favorite bands. californication, i would give it a five, but by the way just isn't as good.they are known for their funkyness and i love the funkyness.I WISH FLEA HAD MORE SOLOS!!! however, they lost more of their funk in by the way. they are starting to turn more mellow. it was kind of a let down. i hope their next one will be more funky. cuz they are the masters of funk-rock.don't get me wrong, this is a great CD, just not as great as californication (and their other CDs). so i give it a four.and i hope they don't get all mushy gushy and talk about girls all the time. and i wish their was more funky bass in here.some people say anthony has not such a good voice, but i think it sounds great with his beautiful music.<br />BY THE WAY- love this song, great funk<BR>UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING- nice melody to the song,cool sound effects.<BR>THIS IS THE PLACE- great lyrics, i like how they compiled this song.i like it when he says \\"can i smell your gasoline\\"<BR>DOSED- great song, kinda mellow though. good to sleep to.<BR>DON'T FORGET ME- you'd have to get used to this song before you like it, but when you do it's great.<BR>THE ZEPHYR SONG- i'm very disapointed in the beat they made for this song, it's so typical. they can do much better with the beat. good lyrics and everything, but i dislike the beat.<BR>CAN'T STOP- now this is a cool song, i like how anthony puts his lyrics together. 5 stars!!<BR>I COULD DIE FOR YOU- mellow song, just a chillin song.<BR>MIDNIGHT- love the violins & orchastratic sound to it in the begining. kinda mysterious.i like to sing to the lyrics, \\"we are the lotus kids.. betta take note of this\\"<BR>THROW AWAY YOUR TELEVISION- love the funk in the begining! the funk is better than the lyrics. but kinda funny song.<BR>CABRON- i don't really like that they did a latin kinda thing in their CD, this is a weird song. i don't like it too much.<BR>TEAR-this is an OK song. good rhymes (as always)<BR>ON MERCURY- love the trumpets in this song. it was a nice touch.<BR>MINOR THING- this is a cool song, fast lyrics, good to sing to.and the funk rules in this song! nice lead guitar melody too.<BR>WARM TYPE- i don't really know what to say about this song.sorry.<BR>VENICE QUEEN- i don't really like that they are just talkling about a girl. but this is a cool song anyways. mysterious begining. he says yo a lot.<br />so i think you should buy this CD, but i'm just informing you that it is not as good as califnorication. and not as punk rock as their other CDs. they are tuning into the more mellow side of rock, as they said in the rolling stones magazine. i just hope they'll go more funky, as they were. oh and it's not like californication, how you hear it the first time and you immediatly like it. you gotta get used to it a little bit. by the way, RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS RULE!!!
B000002H2H|3.0|This album is nothing special really, dont get me wrong, I loved metallica back then, and I used to cherish this album. However there are alot a few flaws on the record. Lars does excellent on the drums but the double bass is up way too loud drowning out the bass guitar, as if he was trying to play the bass himself. Just listen to fight fire with fire, Creeping Death and Call of tulu. Kirk's guitar is good but nothing power driving or anything. He is a very overrated guitarist anyway, dont get me wrong he is good though, but he has to realize he is no Dave Mustaine, Mustaine could outplay Hammet with his hands tied behind his back if it came to it, and keep in mind metallica fans that doesnt mean Hammet is a bad guitarist at all. I just thought it was wrong how he stole Mustaine's music, when Mustaine specifically told them not to. Watch VH1's behind the music for Megadeth for yourself. <br />Last, where is the bass? Nowhere to be found on this record as all metallica records. There is a 30 second killer bass line on For whom the bell tolls but once the second guitar comes in, the bass is drowned out. Cliff was a really good bassist too, too bad his work never shined like legendary bassists such as Steve Harris and Geezer Butler. <br />And yes metallica fans there is no good bass required on this album, sorry. If there is then someone write a review and tell me where it is other then track three. Also its too bad this band became sell outs as well, but if your a fan of thrash metal then get this album. However these flaws are minor and may not matter to alot of people, but I think it is an overrated metallica album, the band is overrated now period anyway. Well im sure my review will be hated and criticized but at least I shared some proof on why there were these little flaws, instead of just having to think this album is godly. Please!!! This album couldnt touch Maiden's Powerslave or Dio's Last in Line which came out the same year. Metallica cant stand a chance against maiden or dio talent wise, Lyric wise, or production wise, and thats a fact. Of course both of these bands were some of metallica's main influences anyway. Still it was a good effort, but an overrated 80's metallica album and definitely not their best. Still worth adding to your collection.
0767827716|3.0|Christine, John Carpenter's version of the Stephen King book, doesn't add up despite some great elements.  But after having read the novel I don't think there was much else he could do.<br />This movie has at least one or two unforgettable scenes centering around the 58 Plymouth Fury.  Carpenter takes an (almost) everyday object (it IS a classic) and injects it with pure menace.<br />The source novel was a lengthy affair that personally never impressed me despite a great effort by King.  The novel, despite King taking his time, just never grabbed me, and in the end it came off as just...silly.  The car was evil simply because the guy who bought was just such a [jerk] and was just \\"evil\\".  That extra dimension doesn't really make its way into the film, despite a great little bit by Roberts Blossom as LeBey.<br />The film, instead, opens with Bad to the Bone on the soundtrack (before that song was beaten sour rotten to death in film and TV) as Christine rolls off a Detroit assembly line.  Because we SEE the car--photographed beautifully--we can attach the underlying menace of the book to something striking on screen.<br />The principles are all good here.  Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham has the nerd-with-taped-up-glasses bit down perfect.  (What's with the black leather vest later?)  His friend, played by John Stockwell (who, like Gordon, also directs films now) is Arnie's slightly doofey friend is believable enough as the high school jock.  And a future Baywatch gal plays the chief female.<br />The music is by Carpenter, too, and while not as strong as his other efforts, provides at least one or two really creepy passages with great synths.<br />The film feels too short, too rushed.  The novel goes on and on and establishes strong characters and background story.  The film relies heavily on a few great set pieces featuring Christine's bloody night drives.  (The death of Moochie is a classic sequence, starting with the faint notes of \\"Harlem Nocturne\\" before the chase.)  Arnie seems to snap almost overnight, and the background characters are too faint.<br />The 3 stars is for the film overall.  But I'd turn it up to 4 for King and Carpenter fans.  There are plenty of memorable moments here, and you'll never see a tailfinned car again the same way.the chase.)  Arnie seems to snap almost overnight, and the background characters are too faint.  <br />The 3 stars is for the film overall.  But I'd turn it up to 4 for King and Carpenter fans.  There are plenty of memorable moments here, and you'll never see a tailfinned car again the same way.
B000002H2H|3.0|This cd isnt that great, im sorry. Its good, but nothing special. I mean I admit once when I was a poser aka mallcore, I loved everything by Metallica, since now days they go in the same category as slipknot, korn ect. well since their now sell outs. This cd is good, Hetfield is a damn good rythm player, and a good songwriter, at least once upon a time. I just get so sick of hearing about this band now, they are so burnt out. The album is good though, but no thought of production on the bass, id have to agree with the few people who posted the reviews about the bass not being produced that well, minus the beginning of for whom the bell tolls. Anyway, metalhead's enjoy.
B00005RY7X|4.0|I guess this is a disc that falls into the love it or hate it category.  People either think this guy is brilliant or a joke.  Whatever.<br />What does is sound like?  Basically like it was made in conjunction with the people who make beer commercials, which--surprise!--some of these songs started to appear on.  Coors featured Andrew WK-scored commercials, and it's a match made in heaven.  This is part Anthrax, part AC/DC, one part Coors, and a big part of life, which is what Andrew WK seems to be high on.<br />This is high-octane party music.  Chances are if you're interested in it it's because of the single Party Hard, which is still the best song on the album.  So you probably know what you're going to get.  And you get it.  Most of the songs turn into a Party Hard-eque anthem (most of the songs also sound like they're jacked up on speed.)  It's crackhead big guitar big hair anthemic speed metal.<br />I highly recommend this for the pure passion that seems to be behind it.  It's not the hedonistic hair metal of the 1980s.  There's something else happening here.  Until I figure out what, I'm going ponder why the track I Love NYC has not been used in an NYC tourist ad?!
B00005NC66|5.0|The film that validated the French New Wave and consummated the now-ubiquitous cinma vrit, &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot; cinematography of modern independent film, Jean-Luc Godard's debut feature Breathless, as influential as it's obviously been (one need only gaze as far back as the extended bedroom scene of 2002's &quot;Late Marriage&quot; to catch a recognizable echo of its ingenuity), still remains as challenging today as it must have been in 1959. Stylistically, the jagged editing technique is what will always call the most attention to itself: Godard chose to snip out small pockets of celluloid almost arbitrarily between most of the action and dialogue, ostensibly to cut down the running time, but effectively to mimic the erratic, shallow attention span of his characters. In turn, the deliberateness of this device tends to distract from the essential simplicity of Godard's narrative, about a killer on the run (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who plots to flee the country with his Parisian lover (Jean Seberg). Revisiting this quaint work of artistry today reveals that Godard, in his vision of existentialist ennui and contemporary youth, has never really been intellectually surpassed in this subject matter by any subsequent film directors. For one matter, his picture's visual impudence alone renders most other cinma vrit timid in comparison. It's one of the few films of its kind that actually dares to appear as clumsy as possible.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon is the story of a crime as seen by various people.<br />Like The Catcher in the Rye ...this movie by Akira Kurosawa was released in 1951.  And, like the Catcher, it's a classic.<br />It examines the nature of Truth and how humans are prone to embellish it so that they appear better.  A bandit commits a crime in the forest and the same is narrated by the involved parties.  They say dead men tell no tales.  But this movie has an exception.  The samurai who dies in the movie narrates his story through a medium!  But is his version true?  Do dead people still have an agenda in the after-life?<br />Rashomon dovetailed beautifully with one of my favorite quotes:<br /> Truth has many faces, and any one of them alone is a lie.<br />Thoroughly enjoyed it.  One of the strange things about the movie is the tendency of the bad guys to cackle in a spooky way.  The worse their nature, the weirder their laugh.
B00000IQC8|3.0|Kevin Smith's films are distinguished by a comic sensibility that is at once eminently urbane and pathetically puerile, fueled by a worldview that overflows with offhanded insight and yet remains too quick to acknowledge this insight for its own benefit. Examining his debut feature seriously, what can we ascertain from a film about grocery-store clerks who endlessly pontificate on sex, ethics, politics, and the architectural intricacies of Lucas's Death Star? Judging from the dialogue, at least, we can immediately sense a talent desperate to be qualified as \\"intelligent,\\" in the strictest sense of the term, and though it would be grossly inconsiderate to dismiss Clerks as a \\"stupid\\" motion picture (it is indeed almost as canny and clever as it makes itself out to be), it's difficult to ignore a side of Smith's brainy, sesquipedalian screenplay that emerges slightly cloying alongside his unique brand of scatological humor. Nonetheless, we can still appreciate and enjoy Smith's pretensions for what they are, especially considering the fact that \\"Clerks\\"' most dominant virtue is the sheer presence of its characters, lovingly worked out from the forge of the writer-director's experience with eccentricity.
B000002L68|5.0|I used to own a copy of Purple Rain on cassette back in the 80's, when Prince was bestowed the singular title of \\"Prince of Pop.\\"  Like most audiophiles who listen exclusively to CD's nowadays, I haven't heard to a tape from my collection of 80's cassettes for years.  My cassette copy of the Purple Rain soundtrack has been sitting in a storage box for a long time, a distant memory in my mind, music that would rarely be played again on my stereo.  <br />That was the case until a couple of months ago, when I happened to catch the Purple Rain movie on television.  I'm a sucker for music on TV and was drawn to the concert footage of Prince and his band.  After seeing the movie, I just couldn't get this soundtrack out of my mind, so I proceeded to buy Purple Rain on CD.  <br />Wow, this digital CD sounds so much better than that old cassette.  More importantly, the music on this album is OUTSTANDING.  I honestly think I enjoy the Purple Rain soundtrack more today than I did two decades ago when it was all over the radio.  <br />Unequivocally, Purple Rain is one of the best albums of the 1980's.  Meticulous care was placed into the production of this album.  Prince's masterful songwriting was at its finest in this work.  The musical performance of Prince and the Revolution is ebullient, shining, and electric.  This is high-energy music, the kind you simply cannot resist.  <br />There will be no sitting on the couch when you hear this soundtrack; you simply MUST get up and dance like a maniac.  This is true for all seven of the faster tempo tunes on the album.  On the two ballads, the title track and \\"The Beautiful Ones,\\" Prince delivers some of the most dramatic, heart wrenching vocals ever heard.  In fact, you can tell Prince put his entire heart and soul into this album; his vocals are so passionate and his songwriting is so compelling that you simply can't resist being moved by his music.  When you combine that kind of artistry with immaculate studio production, the result is an extraordinary body of music.<br />If your history dates back to the music of the 80's, try resurrecting this album - you'll still love it!  If you're of a later or earlier generation, the Purple Rain soundtrack is still some of the best, most grandiose pop rock ever recorded.  I highly recommend this album!!!

B00003CXI1|3.0|I'll not comment on the overall movie itself, as that has been the topic of most other reviews here.  I'll just say that the movie itself was excellent, save a couple disappointing visual effects (e.g. Voldimort; he wasn't scary).  Also, the film transfer and sound mix were great (the surround channels could have been used more, but it wasn't BAD).  I would however like to discuss the movie's presentation on the DVD.  There are several problems:<BR>- It is known that there were far more scenes shot than were actually included in the movie.  When you edit a movie for the theatre, you want to keep the running time down for two reasons: the longer the movie, the less tolerant of the running time the casual viewers will be, and the shorter the movie is, the more times a theatre can show it in a day.  HOWEVER, the type of people that purchase DVDs care more about the movie, and will be far more eager to see a longer cut of the movie.  In this spirit, I was sorely disappointed to find out that none of the deleted scenes would be integrated into the movie.  My rule of thumb is that if the scene was a good one but was just cut to shorten the movie for the theatre, it should be put back into the movie for the DVD (the rest should be included as bonus features).    I hope next year's disc has a more \\"full\\" movie, with scenes that don't make it into the theatre.  As a compromise for \\"theatrical purists\\", the DVD could be programmed so you can choose either the theatrical cut or director's cut (and example of this is \\"Stargate: Special Edition\\").<BR>- The lack of an audio commentary track was noticeable.  Practically all big movies these days have an alternate audio commentary track by the director, producer, crew, and even sometimes cast.  This is almost unforgivable.  A movie of this scope deserves one, and again, next year we should expect one.<br />I would also like to comment on the DVD's features, or rather, lack thereof.  Put simply, for a movie of this magnitude and popularity, the disc construction falls woefully short.  To its credit, disc 1's menuing system is set up nicely -- clear, concise, and to the point.  Interesting but appropriately short animations make it easy to navigate through the DVD.  This is not the case with disc 2.  I can understand that to the movie's target viewers, all the \\"games\\" on the second disc might be appealing, but they get old VERY fast.  Whenever you have long animation sequences between menu pages, they are fun to watch the first time, but from that point on, they just get in the way of enjoying the REAL features of the DVD.  Disc 2 was the worst offender I have ever seen of this rule.  While the technical setup of the disc is impressive, it doesn't work in practice.  The single featurette and the deleted scenes were the highlights of the DVD, but you shouldn't EVER have to spend 15 minutes trying to get to a feature.  Here are some things the disc and menu should have done differently:<BR>- It should have clearly labeled menu choices that point directly to either a feature or a submenu of features.  Labeling with wizard terms only serves to confuse.<BR>- No feature should require the level of messing around that the deleted scenes required.  Instead, the game should have been a separate, independent feature.  Yes, I know you can skip this by directly entering title and track number, but having to take that route is really cheap.  The deleted scenes should have been set up as the interview was - through a single option on the main menu labeled as \\"Deleted Scenes\\".<BR>- The other main problem with disc 2 was the fact that it had so little content.  As mentioned earlier, the deleted scenes and interview featurette were the only major selling points of the DVD (the walkthrough wasn't bad, but it still wasn't that great).  There's just too much fluff.  Clicking on jellybeans just to hear the announcer make some stupid remark just doesn't cut it.  For the year 2 DVD, I expect far more content (makingof special effects, blooper reels, more deleted scenes, storyboards, set and prop construction features, interviews with more of the cast and crew, etc.), and far less \\"fluff features\\".<br />When it comes down to it, this 2-disc set IS worth purchasing for fans and casual viewers alike, but only because of the movie itself.   Don't expect much out of the second disc, aside from the two or three mentioned features).  Because of this, I take two stars from the rating.

This book did have a few \\"guffaws\\" but not like the hot dog poop in the purse, Grandma Mazur and the loaded gun, and the Big Blue Whale. Was Evanovich in a toot to get this one finished?

B00003CXI1|3.0|Well lets see here I thought it was a rather interesting movie having never read the book I probably didn't get half the stuff in it. I thought id see it to see what all the hype was about and I guess I was indifferent. It didn't blow my socks off. The effects were good. My favorite part was when they played chess against the human sized pieces. I can't help to compare it to the Lord of the Rings which was a superb movie and even better book. I find that more interesting because it is darker in nature and magic seems to be used as a means to an end not just to have for the matter of having it like it seemed to be in Potter. I Have to compare the 2 because; A) they came out very close to each other. B) Tolkien basically took fantasy to a new level and every thing after it is just trying to come close to matching it.<br />I liked it but it did npt leave me thirsting for the sequel unlike a few other movies I saw in the past year.
0679735259|4.0|It has been said that the \\"real\\" legacy of Vietnam was that for the first time reporters and editors began to question the American authorities as they never had before.  This is not a view Historians can particularly subscribe to.  History presents us evidence of opposition to the `party line' over the last century, including the Spanish American War.  Perhaps this is idea of legacy seems credible due to the general short memory of the American public.  Certainly, the Vietnam press coverage (even before Tet in 1968) stands in contrast to the Korean era when any question of objectives or policy might lead directly to a McCarthyist challenge of where one's allegiances lie.  So it was that in Vietnam the politeness in the line of questioning was certainly in contrast to the Korean `police action'.  Yet, Michael Herr's book Dispatches does not show his part in this allegedly newer style of hard-look journalism.  Yes, things may have been questioned as never before but this occurred only after the failures in US policy became glaringly acute did the editors begin jumping on the bandwagon.  <br />Herr jeers the `syndicated eminences' and mainstream editors and bandwagoneering in oblique passing (Herr 214, 220).  But this is not the thrust of Dispatches.  In reading this work, one finds some portions reading more like a personal journal.  Other portions read like a high-octane fuel-injected amphetamine-driven psychotic episode.  Some parts are a recall of previous experiences, while others were written closer to the time in which they occurred.  Either way, Dispatches gives us the glimpse into the world of a war correspondent covering the Vietnam War.  Much of what Herr has to say is heartbreaking, but more often the words leaping of the page do so with the same adrenaline with which they were originally inscribed.  Herr often mentions the trouble Grunts had understanding why he and other journalist would put themselves in the situation in which they encountered him.  Asa columnist for Esquire and Rolling Stone, it is even less likely that he hardly garnered the understanding that a journalist from the New York Times or Washington Post might have enjoyed. <br />Indeed, there is a sense of self-consciousness when he relates \\"There was no nation too impoverished, no hometown paper so humble that it didn't get its man in for a quick feel at least once.\\"  Furthermore, he informs the reader that he didn't have the deadlines facing many of the other journalists in Vietnam.  Of course, his dismissal of deadlines can be partly attributed to the fact that he considered himself a `writer'... But the distinction between a `writer' and a journalist or correspondent was hopelessly lost on grunts, who were just as likely to see the difference between a Viet Cong and a `friendly' villager.  The fact that he didn't even carry a camera led to further incredulity on the part of the military brass he encountered.  <br />Herr's writing does not need to impugn the Military and Administration's talking heads and their endless chatter of `Victory just around the corner.'  His stories reveal the utter lack of faith in their words.  He tells us a few of the running jokes, and the stale lines for given situations.  Herr might have told us the joke about \\"how do you know when ___________ (insert Westmoreland, LBJ, Taylor or any other name connected to the madness) is lying?  Their lips are moving...\\" But he need not even do that.  His companions in the press corps and the majority of the grunts who were remotely in US policy knew after a few hours in Vietnam that it was not about anything they could have claimed.  <br />Still it is difficult to reconcile Herr's disdain for the grunts' brutality and his apparent admiration that surfaces when his not trying to suppress it.  Herr's narration is colored by the pop music of the era.  Of course, that pop music was as counter-culture as his personal views. It is difficult to grudge a person for their attachment tothe most exciting times of their life.  Herr's is almost an addiction to the life of the thrill seeker, but as he mentions, unlike the grunts, he could always take the next chopper back to an air-conditioned hotel room in Saigon, or leave altogether.  (Not that an air-conditioned room in Saigon would be necessarily safer than Khe Sahn...)  There was a band in the early 1980's that sought to re-kindle the psychedelic experience of the bands that Herr most appreciated.  Herr's Dispatches recalls his experience and the experience of the press corps in Vietnam (and to a certain extent that of all Americans):<BR>Easier said than done you said, But it's more difficult to say <BR>With eyes bigger than our bellies, We won't do it but we can't look away... <BR>What were you thinking of, When you dreamt that up?<BR>We can't tell our left from right, But you know we love extremes <BR>Get into grips with the ups and downs, Because there's nothing in between... <BR>With eyes bigger than our bellies, we won't do it but we can't look away... So much of the press corps, Herr included, lived vicariously through the lives and deaths of the GI's.  The American public lived vicariously through what the press fed them.  Some would like to believe that the lesson of Vietnam is a \\"lasting legacy.\\"  In deed many members of the press continue to claim this.  It is supposed now in the press and the American public that \\"we don't take things for granted; we don't take things as face value; we don't believe officials, as we did before Vietnam.\\"  The `Credibility Gap' created by the wake of the US involvement in Vietnam and the many presidential administrations that tried to deny the reality of its circumstances was supposed to make us somewhat wiser.  However, those who are following the news today, hearing similar themes and even similar speeches cannot help but realize it is not so much wisdom gained by Vietnam, but crass cynicism on the part of the American public.  `Yes, our own governmentlies to us, but that it is to be expected...  It is the journalist job to act as a kind of Consumer Protector...' \\"Just let us know when the amount of lying exceeds an accepted standard.\\" At that point, The Press is then like the USDA.  When a certain amount of rodent feces exceeds the amount we allow for in our food supply, let us know... otherwise keep it to yourself because we don't want to know.<br />In a response to a recent PBS NewsHour special on the Vietnam War, David Greenway, (one of Michael Herr's acquaintances) commented, <br />\\"When you think about it, Vietnam was unique. The same problems... were true in previous wars, in World War II and in World War I. Only in Vietnam were the two bugbears of journalism overcome - censorship and access to the action - that the military can impose. Vietnam is really the only war where there was no censorship and you could go anywhere you wanted. That wasn't true in World War II or World War I, and it's never been true since. So Vietnam was really unique in that - to that extent.\\"  <br />Greenways comments could be a clarion call to the public to demand more access and knowledge about the wars and \\"operations\\" (Grenada, Panama, Haiti, Iraq, Bosnia, Afghanistan etc., not to mention the others that aren't on anyone's radar...) But the publics utter lack of demand suggests another lesson from the Vietnam experience, as consumers, we want only so much and at a certain point we are satiated.  When that point is reached, the twisted and charred bodies, the `collateral damage' is not only unacceptable, it is unappreciated.  On the other hand, there are many who have developed a pallet for it.  As Herr says, \\"I think Vietnam was what we had instead of happy childhoods.\\" (Herr, 244.)  In many ways, He seems to have written the book full of dark nightmares and adrenaline pumped dreams that acquiesces to Page's assignment, (the British journalist friends' acclamation) \\"Take the glamour out of WAR??  How the bloody hell can you do that?\\" (Herr, 248.)  The glamour of war remains in it hellish visions and ecstatic epiphanies.
B00006F7IM|4.0|The F word flys around this movie like bugs around a light bulb. It makes is so hilarious. The movie has some of the funniest lines ever missing. From Euchre's \\"Just a bit outside!!! Tried the corner and missed.\\" to the fan's \\"Its too high!\\" as a home run sails over their heads.<br />This movie is a Ricky \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughn fast ball. Used up and never used ball players are supposed to form the worst team in baseball history. Instead they come together and give a classic baseball and comedic performance.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This movie was just plain old bad and it cost 122 million dollars to make!  Where did all that money go? I think it went to the bad special effects and the futuristic scenes.  Everything in the movie to me looked really fake.  The acting was okay that could have been worse.  If your looking for a good movie try the original Time Machine in 1960, It was more interesting and didn't rely on special effects to be exciting.  I don't recommend this movie at all.
0553573403|5.0|Tired of the same old genre, try GRRM.  Well written, action-packed, twists and turns.
6305127638|5.0|I love this movie I must have watched the movie more than one hundred times and I am still not sick of it.  This movie is about the borg going back in time and altering the corse of the future but the Star Trek crew from the show the Next Generation was there to stop them.  I always love the stories about the Borg and this Star is one of the best.  I recommend this movie to anyone.
B000067CPX|4.0|After listening to this New Album from RHCP, I immediately Fell In Love with it. I love any music from these guys, but this Album was far better than anything I could have asked for in an album. This album is very satisfying and every single song on this album is Great; nearly every track is a favorite. This band remains one of my absolute favorite bands, and this album is one of their best!
6305428042|4.0|This was a good movie starring Bette Midler.  It featured her singing &quot;I Put A Spell On You&quot; my favorite part.  The only problem I had with this movie was the acting by the children with the exception of Thora Birch.  The child actors ruined the movie for me and did they have to mention that Max was a virgin one more time.  I recommend this movie but the best parts are with the witches and not the children.
B00005RY7X|4.0|If so, you are in the wrong place, mister.  Andrew W.K.'s first blip on the music scene's radar came in early 2001, when he became a darling of the British music press by not being Radiohead.  For those who simply need a break from confusing concept albums that don't always sound like rock, Andrew W.K. is a lifesaver: his music is loud and catchy, and his lyrics are defiantly stupid, almost as if he were trying to get people to stop thinking while listening to his music.<br />And, as many, MANY reviewers have noted, this is perfect music to listen to when you turn off your brain.  You may have heard some of these songs before in commercials (Andrew W.K. has apparently decided to sell out, Moby-style), and the entire album pretty much sounds like the singles.  What AWK has essentially done is start with hair metal hedonism and spiced it up with nu-metal energy.  Of course, he can wear thin at times, especially on songs with a slower tempo (for some reason, those songs remind me of Bruce Springsteen), but if you're willing to put your brain in neutral for 35 minutes (and you have enough space to jump around like a lunatic), you'll probably like I Get Wet.
6304504012|5.0|Madonna's extensive voice training in preparation for this role really pays off. She sounds and looks breathtaking. The vocals are outstanding- who knew Antonio Bandaras could sing like that? As usual, Jonathan Price contributes a very believable aspect to the film. The footage shot inside the actual Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires adds a realism that no studio recreation could capture. Over all, this film is an absolute gem to anyone who truly appreciates musical theater.
0446678430|5.0|A lot of people are bashing here his books. I wonder why?<BR>Some are saying he is vague, some say his examples are false or made up.<br />I agree with them but I think Robert is doing it for the right reasons:<br />Being vague: as Robert said: he's writing these books to open up our minds, not to give us a detailed plan to follow up on. Every reader has a different background. Some are poor, some are middleclass, some are rich. They are different in education, some are still in highschool, others are studying on the university or already working. And working people can vary from lawyers to repairmen to computerprogrammers and many others. And his books are sold all over the world so there are even different society's involved.<br />With so many different people it's impossible to write some basic plan which applies to everyone.<br />That's why he's vague, he's giving you the principles, the mindset what is most important.<br />About his examples: I agree with the opinion of the people most of it is made up. Some things are too detailed in my opinion. For example: he recalls about a conversation with his Rich Dad from 30 years ago and writes some silly things as: \\"bla bla Rich Dad said, he smiled and nodded\\".<br />It's not very believable that he can remember such details. Plus that sentence \\"he smiled and nodded\\" just shows up too much in all his books.<br />A lot of the things Rich Dad says is knowledge that showed up in the 1985-2000 era. I can recognize a lot of Anthony Robbins NLP, Stephen Covey 7 Habits and others mindsets in the Rich Dad books.<br />So how is it possible Rich Dad in 1960 and 1970 uses knowledge that has been invented in 1990?<BR>Example: Robert talks about conversations he had with RD in his youth (like when he was 10 years, that should be around 1960). RD gives advice (knowledge) which was invented (written on paper) around 1990.<br />Conclusion: there probably is a RD, but a lot of things RD said is made up by Robert.<br />Why is this positive?<br />Robert is an excellent teacher: he uses knowledge from NLP and 7 Habits and other sources to give us the information and mindset in an understandable way. He simplifies difficult financial matters with a story just like Kenneth Blanchard did with \\"The One Minute Manager\\".<br />He gives his knowledge in the form of stories because that's easier to understand. He gives advice in the form of talking about himself instead of pointing his finger at you and say: \\"you should do it this way\\". (that's Habit 6 of Stephen Covey's 7 Habits).<br />So in conclusion:<BR>The purpose of the book is to introduce you to new ideas and mindsets. It's not a detailed plan for getting rich quick and it never pretended to be.<BR>The stories are made up, but so what? He wrote the book to teach us and if he does it by making up half of his stories, fine by me.<BR>By the way: I loved the One Minute Manager and Who Moved My Cheese :)<br />Final thing: people are complaining about a lot of repetition in his books and how it's a cheap way of making more money with the same stuff.<br />I disagree, as any good teacher will tell you repetition is the mother skill. Robert keeps repeating things which are important because we learn by repeating.<br />For your information: each time you repeat something it gets nested better in your (subconcious) mind. It makes more connections with other pieces of information in your brain.<br />Ok, that's it for my review of this book, thanks for reading :)
B00000ICD9|5.0|One of the most interesting things about this film is the place it has in the career of actor Robin Williams.  For those who maybe dont remember his television show and his early movies he was more or less strictly a comedic actor.  This movie goes so far beyond the type of work he was doing early in his career in terms of the meaning and topic that it is really pretty wild.  He has managed in this film to break so far out of the type cast situation he was in early on that it in and of itself is remarkable.<br />This is a film about heaven and hell and the nature of the afterlife.  This film while it does have some funny parts also has some very sad parts because you can only wonder what it would feel like to die and realize your wife who you loved more than any other has gone to hell.  Whats worse you are partly to blame and she is the only one missing from your family in heaven including as I recall the dog. <br />The portrayal of the afterlife is really pretty cool with heaven being a beautiful and fun place and hell being dark, ugly, and despairing.  Would you willfully reject heaven and descend into hell to save your spouse if you are separated in the afterlife?  That is a pretty hard question for people of faith given what is generally taught regarding the demons, pain, suffering, despair, and agonies associated with Satan.  It is this very what if situation that confronts Williams.<br />This is a fantastic tale for adults if you ask me but frankly its a little too deep and dark in places to be appropriate for younger members of the family.  If you watch it with kids be prepared to explain why the mommy went to hell for committing suicide in ending her life in despair.  If your kids are ready to deal with the serious questions regarding the afterlife then its really not a graphic violent depiction of hell but rather a nightmare come true depiction in which every essence of existence is dark, dirty, decayed, and destitute.  No one is on fire or picked on by evil beings in a physical sense it is psychological torture.<br />I really like this film because quite frankly I found it to be incredibly original in its concept and execution.  I can think of no other movie really like it except perhaps Jacobs Ladder but this takes a step beyond it in that Williams starts out in a really beautiful setting when he dies and then descends into the lake of fire to try to save his wife because his love for her is so strong.<br />Yes it is a metaphysical storyline and yet it is about love and making the ultimate sacrifice of ones eternal fate for the love of another.  Ill not tell you the end but I will say there are things that you may not expect.<br />I saw this on a rental but it is one of the select titles I myself will be buying for my library because it is something I could watch periodically with friends and family.  I recommend it to people of faith, of a spiritual persuasion, and for those who like stunning special effects because it is in my opinion a very special movie with an apocalyptic overtone of sorts (if you see it and are aware of it at any rate).<br />Would you have the courage to sacrifice yourself for another in the end?
B00005J4HH|5.0|Muse is excellent! I pledge to all non-gereatrics to purchase this! Each song is more than just skin deep, you can just sit in a coma-like concentration while listenign to it. Any sex, any back ground you can enjoy this provided your constitutions are stronger than that of a choir-boys.
B000050XEI|3.0|I was a bit dissapointed with this release.  I am a long time Enya fan, and found this one a little too much of the same thing.  Too many strings, not enough of the beautiful vocals she does so well.
630463949X|5.0|A most excellent dvd. You should enjoy this dvd even if you are not a Fleetwood Mac fan. Great vocals from all which gives a variety of different talents. Lindsey Buckingham's &quot; I'm So Afraid ,&quot; I believe shows how much his guitar playing may be very underrated.I rate it 5 stars.
B000063147|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold is an extremely talented band, don't let the  creepy cover and death metal image throw you off. The first song is a heartfelt piano song which gives way to the second track, a hardcore song dealing with suicide. So as you can see these guys are somewhat diverse. They have some really dark deathmetalish songs like we come out at night and another awesome piano song about a girl, warmness on the soul. Therse also some standard straight edge sounding punk like tracks 11 and 12 that kinda remind me of sick of it all and bad religion. All in all these guys just plain kick [butt] so check this CD out you won't be dissappointed. My favorite songs are the art of subconscious illusion, and streets. Also check out one of their unreleased songs - second heart beat. Thats the song that got me into AV7F and other hardcore stuff like poison the well and from autumn to ashes.

The joy is in watching four brilliant comic actors, who all obviously enjoy working with one another.<br />The joy, and the laughs, are infectious. Quite simply, \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" is the funniest movie of the last 25 years.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd gives it all- beautifully orchastrated music of heightened intensity and melancolic despair.  The lyrics are overwhelmingly thought provoking and emotionally stimulating, ingeniusly incorporated with every beat of the music.  You will be forever moved beyond words.  This is the reason I wanted this album.  However, It's been 2 1/2 weeks and I have yet to receive it...
B00005YW4H|5.0|...I have just come away from listening to this cd for the first time. As she started to sing I was immediately struck by her bluesy voice, and began to weave a contemplation that Norah represents the best of the west, and Anouschka the best of the East - both being daughters of Ravi Shankar. But as the cd played on the intimacy in her voice pushed aside my noisy thoughts, and I sat completely mesmerized by her sharing herself, captured by her essence of simplicity. Towards the end, she had me in tears; a very rare occurrence for a tough critic like me.  Norah, Ill come away with you anytime. The songs you wrote yourself are the best. But you knew that.  Love you. Keep 'm coming baby. ;)
0316666343|5.0|Okay, first I'd like to say that I havn't read a book unless I was forced to in high school. I got bored after i graduated and decided that maybe I should pick up a book. I searched for Fiction and got \\"The Lovely Bones\\" as a result. I loved this book with a passion. The only thing that bothered me was the ending. It was like a cliff hanger to me. \\"[Spoiler]?\\" is what I said when I closed the book. Other then that, I was impressed with this book. It's now one of my favorites. I recommend it to everyone! This was one of those books you couldn't put down because you were interested on what was going to happen next. It was AWESOME!!!!
B000067CPX|3.0|This is the new record of a great band: The Red Hot Chili Peppers. They always tried to show new sounds, new forms of make good music. This new album &quot;By The Way&quot; is not a bad album at all, but it sounds like a band that wants desperately to sell a few more millions of records. This is a Pop album, full of soft songs, with some pretty moments, but the magic of the Red Hot Chili Peppers is no longer present like before. <BR> If you are a true fan of the band you won't regret buying this and By The Way: They sold out, unfortunetly...
B000002N3J|5.0|Madonna isn't really an artist known for her ballads, the draw usually is the infectious and well crafted pop songs, songs that make any reasonable listener want to get up and dance and have a goodtime. Madonna could suprise all then, with this smooth ballad collection. Containing new tracks and some of her biggest slow jams, this set is laced with passion, lust, yearning, sorrow, strength, and power. Madge's ballads have been some of her most well written lyrical endeavors, with the intense \\"Live To Tell\\" and erotic \\"Rain\\" being fine examples. Her biggest hit here in the United States is the smoldering \\"Take A Bow\\", which is contained here in, a cut from her previous Bedtime Stories album. The bold \\"You'll See\\", brazen \\"Forbidden Love\\", and the sultry title cut are also highlights, though my favorite track is her theme to \\"A League Of Their Own\\", in the moving \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\". The album's least loved cut, though another favorite of mine, is the remix of \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\". A ballad collection, with a deeper edge, definitely a must have.
B00005JLKB|4.0|NOTE: This review was actually written about a Canadian DVD release of the first two episodes of the series which were edited into a feature-length movie.<br /><br />I was mighty skeptical when I first heard about Smallville. Mainly, I was disappointed that Warner Bros. Television decided to go with this instead of the proposed Bruce Wayne series about his world travels before returning to Gotham to become Batman. Aside from that, it looked like (as one of my friends dubbed it) \\"Dawson's Krypton.\\" To further complicate things, I discovered that Lex Luthor was to be one of the main characters. Basically, it seemed like it would never work. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />I began watching the series in the summer, right after the season finale, when WB started rerunning episodes.  I was immediately hooked. (I preordered the Canadian import DVD of the first two episodes right after it was announced.) What struck me immediately about the series was its attention to character development. While the series is mainly episodic, there are usually several subplots that continue from week to week that advances the characters' relationships to one another. The ongoing story of Clark and Lana is especially poignant and heartbreaking due to the fact those who are familiar with Superman lore understand that, even if the two of them get together, their romance won't last. (Thankfully, Tom Welling and Kristen Kreuk have wonderful chemistry and are fully capable actors.)<br /><br />The main plots are the show's weakest points. I would imagine it's difficult to come up with a way for Clark Kent to be a superhero from week to week, thus they gave themselves an equivalent to Buffy's hellmouth, the kryptonite rocks. The villains can get fairly ridiculous, such as the bugboy in the second episode (included on the DVD). Fortunately, the writers understand how to turn this into a strength. Rather than focusing entirely on the villain, we get to see how the villain or the situation he/she/it causes affects the characters. (A good example comes later in the series when Clark's powers transfer to another boy and he gets to live a normal life for a short period of time.)<br /><br />As to my iffiness about the inclusion of Luthor, once again, my initial reaction was completely off-base. The makers of the show have managed to make Lex Luthor the most interesting character in the series, thanks in no small part to the outstanding performance of Michael Rosenbaum. I've never seen the character given such depth in a non-comics medium and it is absolutely a breath of fresh air. Watching his transition from hero to anti-hero [to villain?] will be fascinating (providing it happens in the course of the series).<br /><br />Of course this review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the terrific work of John Schneider and Annette O'Toole as Clark's adoptive parents. It is important to understand why Clark decides to use his powers to help those in need. The Kents are honest, hard-working people who have instilled Clark with a strong sense of right and wrong, and Schneider and O'Toole pull it off brilliantly.<br /><br />As the title of my review suggests, I only have one major misgiving about the show, and that's the use of Remy Zero's \\"Save Me\\" as the theme song. I normally like watching the opening credits of shows, but since I don't care for the song, I usually fast forward through this one.  It's a shame, since Mark Snow composed a great theme for it. (It can be found on the DVD's menu screen and during the end credits.)<br /><br />I hope WBHV decides to start releasing entire seasons on DVD here in the U.S. soon. I'm certain this is a series that will get better over time. (The addition of Jeph Loeb to the writing staff points to this. To those unfamiliar with the name, check out his and Tim Sale's Superman For All Seasons.)ers.

0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold has written a remarkable debut novel.  The narrator, Susie Salmon, was raped and murdered in 1973 and now resides in her heaven; yet, her voice contains none of the bitterness one would expect.  She is able to see into the lives of those who touched her in life and death. At times wistful - for she will never be able to experience growing up - and others matter-of-fact, Susie witnesses the changes and growth within her family and small circle of friends.  Her story is not one about death, but about loss and affirming life in its face, about moving on not only for those she left behind but for herself.  The reader won't be able to escape the sadness in these pages - I came close to crying several times - but the overall tone is hardly grim. Because Susie is secure and happy in her heaven, she keeps the story full of light and optimism.<br />This novel is not flawless, nor should it expected to be.  The narrative loses some of its momentum near the end. In addition, Sebold makes the mistake of adding a scene (which I won't describe here) seemingly designed to lessen the reader's regret about Susie's missed coming-of-age, but instead the scene falls flat.  Susie's loss is as much a part of this book as her family's is, and to pretend it can be reversed, even if only temporarily, defeats the story.  Still, given the first two-thirds of the book, this misstep and others can be forgiven.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is one of those books you can pick up and not want to put down again until you finish.  At roughly 325 pages, this novel demands to be read on a plane, or on the beach, or when you have good chunks of time available to sit with it. Don't frustrate yourself by allowing a half hour here and there.<br />This is one book that deserves its spot on the bestseller list.
0684833395|5.0|I got to read this book only a few years ago, and suddenly everyone around me looked as if Im an alien. Catch-22 is really wonderful satire about war. The hilarity is wonderfully woven around the unavoidable tragedy during the war era and Heller beautifully alternates between the two. <br />In a sense it is like Voltaire's Candide where the central character oscillates between optimism and pessimism, only here Yossarian (and others) oscillates between the comic and tragic. While Voltaire's is really a serious satire about the evils that humans perpetuate on one another, that was completed in 3 days, Heller's is more funny yet focused on war, probably starting a new genre - war comics (beetle bailey, mash etc). Its ironic that the movie Catch 22 could not bring out the nuances of the war time that Heller has depicted in the book. He probably also created a style of repeating same thing in different words to make it look funny.<br />Anyway this is great novel not only to be read but also realise the evils of war. Yossarian will surely be an unforgettable character whoever read this book.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|This is a poor movie.  The story is unrealistic and un-engaging, the directing is poor and the music is dull and repetitive.  This movie is severely over-rated.  This movie demonstrates that any movie, properly marketed can win an academy award.

B00005R2M3|5.0|Debuting on the mainstream pop scene with the disjointed pop gem \\"Whenever, Wherever\\". The song's proclaimations of small and humble breasts and agile legs became a radio staple. It's definitely the most standout of the album, but there are plenty of other great tracks contained within, including the emotional \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" and the supremely catchy \\"Objection (Tango)\\", both singles that have also been released. She makes an amusing lyricist, and her voice is definitely left of center, making her all the more interesting in the pop world. Great tracks like \\"Poem To A Horse\\" and \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" could easily follow the past singles to the upper reaches of chart sucess. Definitely a good English language debut for the small and humble one.
6304490119|3.0|This film begins with much promise, establishing the existence of the \\"stargate\\", an ancient device discovered in Egypt, which could function as the portal to another world, if only the key to its use can be deciphered.  Scientist and linguist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an eccentric expert in hieroglyphics enlisted into a secret US Government project.  His task, to translate the wring on an ancient stone tablet, the directions how to access the stargate.<br /><br />Spader is perfect as a sniffling, nearsighted, academic type who seems bewildered at times, by the real world.  His natural brilliance provides the means to get the stargate working.  The first humans to attempt to use the stargate, will be an armed military unit, led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell).  They will perform a recon mission at wherever the stargate leads to.  Jackson goes along to make sure they group can return from the other side.  The team heads through the stargate, and pop out through a similar stargate in another world.  They find themselves inside a huge stone pyramid in the middle of a desert.  Jackson can't get the team back to Earth without additional information, so further exploration of the planet becomes necessary, and the party from Earth, eventually discovers a band of less advanced desert dwellers.<br />All this is fine, rather credible and interesting.  The interaction and learning process between the two peoples is naturally awkward.  Where things start to go off track is when the supernatural element is introduced.  \\"Ra\\" the ancient Egyptian sun god, is turned into an alien, in order to facilitate a \\"battle for the planet\\".  The charm and warmth begins to fade, and the story morphs into something we've seen before.  An interesting and provocative concept just goes to waste, and James Spader's excellent performance is somewhat obscured by his dubious transition from bookworm to fighter.  Stargate misses an opportunity to be something special.<br />A few other items to mull over.  The story is set in a desert, but the heat must not be very intense, and never really seems to bother anyone, from the soldiers in dark uniforms, to the guys with the gigantic headgear who should be ready to faint.  The Earth soldiers initially found the desert people at work, after Jackson was dragged by a desert beast.  He should have been roasted like a hot dog by the hot sand.  And how about those desert people, toiling in the heat, then travelling across the desert, apparently not even carrying any water.  At one point, Jackson eats a candy bar, and later offers one as a gift, but in neither instance has the chocolate melted in the heat.  The small team from Earth apparently brought enough weapons with them to arm the entire planet.  That's good, because the \\"primitive\\" native kids handle firearms like combat veteran commandos.  And why, like so many other movies, do the interior sets look so sterile and fake.  Thousands of years later, and Ra and his band still dress like ancient Egyptians?  Talk about a time warp.  Who or what is flying the craft that attack the desert people?  Robots, or does Ra do pilot training too?<br />David Arnold's music does a good job of making some of the mundane scenes seem exciting.  If you don't expect too much, Stargate will suffice as an evening's entertainment.  Something to watch, and then immediately dismiss.  You won't however, be able to watch the regular edition DVD, without at least getting up once to flip the disc over to side B. That's right, the disc needs to be flipped overems to mull over.

B000068IEU|3.0|If a film has ever displayed the benefits of a low budget, this is it. In a time where films are judged upon their special effects, its nice to be able to see a film that is so low budget, it would look like a snuff film if you didn't know any better. According to an earlier review - I'm disturbed because I find this film funny. However, I find it hard to understand how any normal person wouldn't find Craven's sick little piece of black comedy amusing. While disturbing at times, the gang of criminals who rape and kill Mari Collingwood are clearly a parodic sketch of the \\"gang of criminals\\" portrayed in many an episode of Kojak in the seventies. Equal parts terrifying, uncomfortable to watch (espescially since a certain male body part is bitten off *ouch*), and funny - Last House on the Left is one of Wes Craven's best.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I have seen this movie over 60 times. It is my favorite R&amp;H movie of all time. From the way Julie moves her arms singing 'Mi' during Do-Re-Mi, to the way Gretl scoots up the stairs during 'So Long, Farewell.' The score was the last Rogers and Hammerstien ever wrote, Eidelweiss being the last song. Everyone has the memory of Maria the mischeivious young postulant twinling with joy as she begins the prelude, 'The Sound of Music,' but how long has it been sonce you watched the whole film? It had been 6 years for me, gimme a break I'm 14 and trying to prove a point, and now It's only been hours. So enjoy the DVD and look at the other stuff too, that's the main reason we buy 'em right? Anyway, what I'm trying to say is- this movie is simply the best, the DVD calls you...
0452282152|5.0|It took me a day to read \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\". I could not put it down. What a fascinating concept of telling a story- to describe a painting in progress. From the outset we are drawn into the world of Vermeer and get an insight into the lives of the serving class. Griet has little choice but to stay on as a servant for her master but manages to maintain her moral standards despite pressure from the master's sponsor and also from the master himself. Her solution at the end of the novel is realistic and inspiring. Well worth a read.

Its one of the rare instances where the movie will be better then the book.  It was a nice read though.  The concept of the murdered girl's point of view from heaven was inventive and uplifting.  However, I think the story falls off toward the end and left me disappointed overall.
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought this CD about a year ago.  Since then I have listened to it hundreds of times and it never gets old.  The songs are beautifully written.  My favorites are Shiver and Troubles.<BR>This CD is something that Ill be listening to for years to come.
B00003CY0V|2.0|This film gets 2 stars because of the first 10 minutes - including the obviously Tarrantino inspired bit of self-reflexive dialogue. Then the film falls apart and becomes a tired action film - complete with ridiculous &quot;tech talk&quot; about firewalls and such nonsense and a flying bus. Miss this film at all costs.
6305878323|5.0|Being a Julie Andrews fan, this is one of the first movies I watched with her in it. This is where Julie made her Step in Time. Disney's eye for talent was magnificent. Miss Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Jones were the only people imaginable for the parts. The movie was made from Walt's favorite book of the same name. PL Travers wrote the books, I highly recommend reading them. This movie really is Disney's masterpeice, mixing live-action with animation. Wonderful music scores, wonderful storyline, all-in-all Mary Poppins is 'Practically perfect in everyway.'
B000003TA4|5.0|This cd is indescribable. Every song on it is a classic. I do though believe Nirvana is a little overrated. Out of the three major Alternative Rock bands: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Smashing Pumpkins is the best but Nirvana is close. They were really the ones who made it cool to listen to Grunge and Alternative Rock. I would take the time to write out every song and how good it is but I won't. You really need to go out and buy it or download it. It's a must! It ranks up there next to Siamese Dream, Ten, Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness, Led Zeppelin 2,4,5 (Houses of the Holy) etc. Its a great cd. They are the best band after the Smashing Pumpkins.
0316779237|2.0|The book was worth reading, even if it's just for the first story, which I really enjoyed. I would say it was the best of the group of stories that was in the book. The others were okay, but not as good.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I understand why a lot of the real &quot;horror fans&quot; were let down by this movie, but I have to say, it was refreshing to see a &quot;zombie movie&quot; (a real sub-genre with rabid adherents) that wasn't filled with 200 Gallons of blood-squibs. This was a playfully nasty little bit of fun, meant to give you a little thrill, and a few smiles, too.<br />Maybe I was in just the right mood when I saw this in the theatres, or maybe I'm more forgiving than other folks, (yeah, right), but I liked RE for what it is;<br />Fun.<br />It serves it's purpose. Relax and enjoy it.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I.M.H.O. this is the best of Carpenter's horror films - including Halloween. Creepy, moody, and beautifully shot, this DVD offers extras not available on the laser disc version that I own. It has to be said that this film is beautiful when presented in the original widescreen format - and should never be shown in the pan 'n' scan again once this edition is released. The film brings together the \\"lifted\\" Rio Bravo narrative of Carpenter's earlier film Assault on Precinct 13 - a blueprint that would be repeated in the underrated Prince of Darkness. Still, its done the best here, essentially a remake of Night of the Living Dead in many respects - its still an amazing film. Don't watch it alone.
B000002KGT|1.0|Fleetwood Mac were so good in the late '60s, why did Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham have to ruin it?? Dreams? Say You Love Me?? This is [terrible!] I can't believe Mick Fleetwood and John McVie stuck around for this embarrassment. At least Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan had the sense to leave the band before things got this bad.
1577311523|3.0|This book makes the vital point that all we have is now, but misses essential ingredients for self optimization.  Tolle suggests we observe disturbing emotions/thoughts rather than engage in them.  This is important, and Tolle expresses this well.  What is essential, new and life-optimizing is what Dr. Rosalene Glickman explains in her book, \\"Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self.\\"  She says we need to observe and embrace disturbing thoughts/emotions/situations and then optimize them.  She offers simple roadmaps to optimize any thought/emotion/situation and shows us how to choose the best and put any issue to rest.  This is like embracing a disturbed child, accepting their problems and helping them find their best solutions. It is more than what Tolle suggests, which is to watch the child being disturbed without getting emotionally involved.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Yes Jarr Jarr you really did! If only the Liam Neeson had taken his light saber and lopped Jarr Jarrs head off like he did so many of those trade federation droids.  There would have been a cheer and applause errupt throughout the cinema as many fans celebrate the killing off of one of the most annoying characters ever put on the screen.<br />And to think despite the worldwide hate towards this character he again is shown in Episode 2.<br />If Jarr Jarr had never been created my view of this movie would be completely different.<br />George Lucas, please listen to your fans!
B00005MP58|5.0|What an absolute delight this is to watch! I have always loved Pride and Prejudice as the best of Jane Austen's work, and I am utterly pleased with this beautiful film adaptation. The characters are so unfailingly true to the book (Mr. Collins and Mr. Bennett are particularly wonderful) and the dialogue as well. The format of a miniseries allows this tale to unfold in the slow, gradual way that it was meant to, and allows the character development that a good story requires. A must-see for any true Jane Austen fan!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD is excellent!  It's one of those albums that you can listen to from start to finish without skipping a track.  John Mayer is an extremely talented musician, and his lyrics come straight from the heart.  I'm about the same age as John Mayer, and I find myself relating to every song, and as a guitar player, I am very inspired by his musicianship.  Rickey Wright's editorial review of &quot;Room For Squares&quot; could not be more absurd -don't listen to this nonsense! Take a chance like I did and buy the CD - you won't be dissappointed.

0783230370|4.0|I saw this movie for the first time this weekend.  And I have to admitt, I really didnt expect that much out of it.  But I was pleasantly suprised.  This film is one of those films that are perfect to sit back and watch on a Saturday afternoon.  It may not be academy award winning material, but its a true feel good film.  After seeing it, you want to see it again!  If your one of those people who watch a film just for the simple reason of picking it apart and trying to find ways not to enjoy it, you need to get a life.  Just watch it for what it is, a fun movie.  <BR>     For all you expecting mothers out there, you will absolutly love this movie.  It basically has a man (Arnold) going through every stage of pregnancy.  Ever wished a man could know what its like to carry a child?  Nows your chance!  The only thing I didnt like about the movie was the pro choice line , &quot;My body My choice.&quot;  Other than that, its a definate must see.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Peppers released thier new album, \\"By The Way.\\" It is a break from the ordinary for RHCC. The first track, \\"By The Way,\\" has a classic RHCC sound to it. But as you get into the album you find the spanish ballad \\"Cabron,\\" and the song and the soft pop sound of \\"Dosed.\\" It is a very diverse album that contains everything from rap rock to an almost Beatles sound. This is truly a must have album.
B00003CX5P|3.0|(technical review - No story review)<br />I am sure this film looks great on a small to medium sized screen, If you are a home theater owner, you will be unhappy in the detail of this film. At times this movie becomes fuzzy and makes this print a disappointment, I would expect more from a THX labeled film.  I can only guess that this is, ether poor mastering or DVD limitations. Other than lack of detail in the film all other aspects of the image were great. The sound was fine. <br />Picture quality 3.5 Sound quality 5
0060012331|4.0|Pratchett's Discworld series seems like it is endless. What is it now, more than 35 books?<br />So the man is allowed to have some books that are lesser than the others...P>Okay, now to the book. <br />This book is not a full-fledged member of the Discworld series. It takes place on the Discworld, but does not contain any previously-seen characters, and these chracters will most likely not appear again. <br />Not that there is anything wrong with that, it's just that you Death/Rincewind/Wyrd Sisters/Watch fans won't find your favorite characters in this book. This is typical Pratchett - write some books that feature previous characters, and write some with brand new characters that are most likely a one-off. It keeps him fresh and interesting. <br />This was a very good book, and a lot of fun to read. I don't think that it's Pratchett's best, but it's very good, and there are more than a few authors who could stand to do this well.<br />The plot is strong and well thought out. The characters are not always likeable, as Pratchett is often wont to do. The plot twists and turns in a variety of unexpected ways, and there is really no way to predict what comes next.<br />It's a worthwhile book, and I do heartily recommend it to any fantasy fan, and most sci-fi fans as well. <br />Enjoy!
1577311760|5.0|I have listened to each of the five cassettes atleast 40 times.  This is timeless and to say that I highly recommend this teaching to the entire human race is an understatement.  I listen to the tapes while doing yard work -I've got a lot done and enjoyed every bit of it.  The world will simply be a better place if human beings stopped trying to \\"make a better future by creating a present hell.\\"  As Eckhardt puts it: \\"Have you ever done anything outside of the now?  Do you think you ever will?\\"  He also states the \\"you are not your mind.\\"  How much of your day do you spend dwelling on the past and anticipating the future and totally neglect the here and now? This is a wake up call for the human race.  He sites many of the greatest spiritual teachings to make his point, The Bible, The Bhagivad Ghita, The Koran, Hinduism, Karma Yoga and more.  This stuff is not new and all the spiritual texts cited point to the same spiritual teaching, the one that underlies all religions, the one that we are all a part of.
B00006879E|5.0|Everything about this CD screams with mellow coolness and has a great hipster attitude that makes you wonder why Radio Stations don't flood the airwaves with this work of genius. The music is a fresh blend of classic rock mentality, beefed up with a lot of soul, funky guitar riffs, and pure energy. You can detect musical influence from everywhere that helps round out every track into a complete emotional experience. When you hear the quick snappy drum hits, accurate guitars and piercing vocals of Harder To Breathe, you know you are in for surprises around every corner. HTB is the perfect first track on this disc... As the disc progresses you have no idea what will come next. Slow haunting melodies and Funk Riffs mix so perfectly that by the time the disc is over you have no idea what hit you. This is not just some random album with one great song and a whole bunch of other tracks that are worth nothing more than background noise while doing your taxes... this is an experience. Every emotion is expressed so beautifully that it doesn't matter what mood you are in, this album will compliment it. Some tracks make you want to move, others make you want to look into a lover's eyes. Some make you smile, others make you close you eyes and regret not experiencing life to its fullest. Song's About Jane is the best CD I have heard in a long time. You listen to it and wish you had it when you first fell in love, when you lost someone dear, or when everything in you life seemed not to go right. This is pure gold. By the way... I caught their live show and was blown away even more. They play with so much energy and love of music. Each song is played do passionately, and the little jams that follow each song just show how much these guys love to perform. This music is so good; the band has a better time performing than you do listening (which is an amazing feat)...
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Story aside this film has some great special effects mixed in with poor. At times this film is TV quality in effects and writing. My biggest beef is that of picture quality, ether poor encoding or DVD limitations this film becomes very blurry at times, I am sure this is fine on a 27\\" screen but home theaters that show great detail will be disappointed with this film. The only redeeming value is the sound track with DTS was very nice.<br />Picture quality 3.5 stars, Sound 5 stars
B000000OS2|5.0|it is a total shame that this album doesn't get more respect.  i think it is one of the most underrated albums of the last 15 years.  a lot of people wrongfully group this band with the &quot;hair bands&quot; of the late 80's and early 90's.....and that is so far from the truth.  <br />i was about 12 when this album came out and it was the first time i heard the stone's &quot;mother's little helper,&quot; CCR's &quot;lodi&quot;, and the dead's &quot;truckin'&quot; - i have since become a fan of these bands and owe a lot of that to this incredibly live album. <br />this album also gets no credit for being a pioneer of he &quot;unplugged series.&quot;<br />i strongly recommend this album - you'll be pleasantly surprised.

0140187650|5.0|Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil by Hannah Arendt is one of the most disturbing books that I have read in a long while.  Along with Gita Sereny's interviews with Stangle and Speer, they demonstrate the true horror of the Third Reich.  This horror is not the inherent evil of Hitler or Himmler or the sadistic camp guards.  The holocaust presented these already morally bankrupt men with the opportunity to commit the evil which their consciences allowed.  Of greater horror are the individuals, such as Eichmann, who were not evil per se, but who were willing to put conscience aside in order to advance within an evil system.  <br />As Arendt moves through the holocaust in the different countries in Western Europe and the Balkans, it becomes evident that the difference in degrees of the destruction of  Jewry was not defined by the presence of potentially evil wrongdoers, but by the existence of individuals who would not put their conscience aside in order to further short-term goals.  The contrast between the destruction of German Jews and the survival of the Jews of Bulgaria and Denmark can be directly traced to a commitment by the Bulgarians and Danes to save their fellow countrymen.  The German Jews did not survive as the Danish and Bulgarian Jews did because Germany lacked such men of conscience.<br />It is  easier to think of the chief architects and perpetrators of the attempted destruction of a whole people as madmen, the madder the better.  Their acts can be rightfully condemned, but also understood, as evil things done by evil people.  Furthermore, if the holocaust can be blamed on the acts of evil madmen, then it is also easier to believe that it could not have been prevented.  Arendt destroys each of these rationalizations and raises questions that frankly kept me up at night.  If, as she demonstrates, the success of the holocaust was determined by those who put their consciences aside, then it also seems agonizingly true that the deaths of six million were not predetermined.  Had more people acted on their consciences, perhaps those deaths need not have been integral to the Nazi conquest of Europe. <br />The fact that she does not treat Eichmann as a mad sadist, and instead explains why the prosecutions portrayal of him was incorrect, does not mean that Arendt is an apologist for Eichmann - far from it.  Unlike Hitler, Eichmann was under no illusion that the Jews were responsible for all of the world's problems.  His prior relations with Jews had been friendly.  However, he was willing able to put this aside and play a vital role in the Final Solution.  His excuse was that he was ordered to do so.  But the reality was that he was more worried about his failure to get the promotions that he believed he deserved.  This made Eichmann, like most of the perpetrators of the holocaust, the paradigm of the \\"banality of evil.\\" However, such a rational led Arendt not to condemn the Jerusalem Court's death verdict but to condone it.<br />Arendt does an amazing job of delving into the mind of Eichmann as well as the reasons why the Final Solution was successful in some countries and not others.  This is not a book for one who desires light reading.  However, if one is seeking to understand the Final Solution, then this book is a must.

They treat him worse than a stepson, even Dudley gets in on the act. Second, he must learn to train and control his newly acquired powers, and Third, he must discover where the Sourceror's Stone is hidden and its powers.  This is not an easy task for someone that already has a respected reputation.<br />Usually, I would be turned off by so much computer-aided graphics, but in this case, everything was complimentary.  Nothing less is expected from Jim Henson Productions, Inc.  The numerous costumes were so seamless that I never recognized John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, or Warwick Davis as one of the bank tellers or Flitwick.  Some of my favorite scenes were when Harry's cousin Dudley, quite impish with his behavior, ends up in the snake's cage and with a pig's tail after stealing and eating Harry's birthday cake.  Oh, and let's not forget &quot;Fluffy&quot; the three-headed dog on the third floor.  Don't let the cute name fool you, scary is more like it.  One last villian, He Who Must Not Be Named paid a high price in the Dark Forest.<br />All in all this is a good movie, if you can get past some of the raw language.  I cannot wait for the second installment later this year.
0871137380|5.0|Bowden has managed to brilliantly capture the UN ordered operation in October 1993 that was supposed to capture advisors of the Somali warlord Aideed. <br />Not only is it an action packed book that reads easily it also has quite a few lessons for anyone concerned about national security and global politics. The Mogadishu raid and the killed Delta operators and rangers, and the downed black hawk helicopters are really the first good example of the new face of warfare.<br />Bowden describes in great detail a battlefield in urban terrain with the distinction between the enemy and civilians blurred. This is what war will be like in the future. The shot down US helicopters in Afghanistan were brought down in the exact same fashion as in Mogadishu.<br />It is therefore a central book for anyone who wants to begin to understand the fact that the US, and other nations, will not fight a high-tech enemy that can directly oppose American air supremacy and information superiority. Instead, the US will face ragged guerillas, bandits, terrorists, and others who do not want to, or can, fight the way we are accostumed to in the West. And no Joint Strike Fighter, GPS, and Crusader artillery system will win against forces like that.<br />It should also be noted that the US Army uses the movie and the book \\"Black Hawk Down\\" for its officer's training in the subjects of leadership and tactics.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|A musical where no one can sing is about as good as a comedy which is not funny. Every time Ewan or Nicole opend thire mouths to sing a cold shiver went down my spine and i clenched my fists hopeing they wouldn't kill another classic song - but they allways did.<br />The story is weak - and the play within a play idea has been clearly ripped off of mid summers night dream which Baz Lurman directed on stage. The charicters where flat and at times annoying as the script was weak at best.<br />Admitadly Baz Lurmans Directing was flashy, using CGI, modles, fast editting and vivid photography - but a turd is still a turd no matter how much glitter is on it
0812550706|4.0|Perhaps I'm a little biased, being an avid Star Trek fan, but I really am convinced that science fiction is an excellent and far too often underestimated literary genre.  Perhaps the reading community is off-put by the admitted bucketloads of SF that wouldn't meet any self-respecting fiction publisher's standards.  Or maybe it's just the fantastical, sometimes unbelievable settings or the futuristic technology.  It's true: frequently, SF doesn't go much for that whole Suspension of Disbelief thing.  But maybe we're missing the point.<BR>  <BR>Science fiction is unique in that by removing this necessity for settings and concepts to be located somewhere in the real world, one is opening up a literal universe of possibilities to explore.  This unlimited landscape is just what some characters require to grow and learn.  <BR>  <BR>&quot;Ender's Game&quot;, above all else, is a story about human nature.  As exaggerated and cliched as that might sound, it's essentially the truth.  Ender, despite his obvious genius, is just a lonely human boy who has been shoved unwillingly into a role that he has no desire to fill.  Card explores ideas such as intelligence, innocence, violence, war, hatred, and manipulation by fashioning a futuristic world in which his characters can interact.  Which isn't to say that Card couldn't have explored these themes in any contemporary or historical setting.  However, I believe that the fact &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is set in a futuristic, created universe forces the reader to concentrate on the ideas instead of the fictional world.  <BR> <BR>This is, in my opinion, what SF was designed for.  And, it should be noted; the fact that it is SF does not detract from the human qualities of the characters or the plot.  Card is a talented and unsentimental writer through and through.<br />The one thing I had a problem with, though, was the last chapter: the short story otherwise known as &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;.  While it's an intriguing story onits own, associating it with (i.e. tacking it onto the end of) &quot;Ender's Game&quot; weakened both the novel AND the story.  &quot;Ender's Game&quot; was such a complete and polished entity on its own that I think it should have been left untouched.
B000002BMV|5.0|Journey was a great band. Like Boston,Foreigner,Survivor,Kansas,<BR>and a host of others, Journey did metal with melody. Some people label Journey a &quot;soft rock&quot; band. Bull. They were a hard rocking group that also did some slow songs for the ladies. Journey is one of the best heavy metal bands of the 70's and 80's. Escape is their best album. Lots of hits on this one. They could write an album with lots of hits and not have filler tracks like Def Leppard. Get this and turn it up! A great metal album!
B00005JL3A|3.0|Some fans of the Resident Evil video game complained that the film was not true to the game; I have never played the game, so I can't comment on that, but in a sense such a criticism is neither here nor there. It's more important to know that Resident Evil is as much an homage to George Romero films as it is to its video game origins, although I am sure many tried and true Romero fans won't like Resident Evil for its somewhat poor and certainly imitative borrowing of Romero's zombie ideas. Resident Evil doesn't stop there, as it borrows from other sci-fi and horror films; the method the Red Queen uses to kill several characters trapped in a corridor is lifted right out of the low-budget, cult favorite (and successfully eerie) film Cube. Paul Anderson is a talented filmmaker, to be sure, and Resident Evil is a slick looking film with sparkling clear photography. Anderson's screenplay isn't as simplistic as one might expect from this type of movie and it proceeds through a series of flashbacks to tell part of it story. Milla Jovovich, whose energy, presence, and looks always out-pace her acting, is just the type of actress to play Alice. Add to that the nice touch of giving the Red Queen the voice of a young British girl, and you have a film that rises above mediocrity ... even if it never really impresses.<br />It doesn't help this film that zombie movies in general are difficult to take seriously these days, unless the zombies are tounge-in-cheek. But Resident Evil is fun and slightly scary. Just remember that this is derivative, not original, filmmaking and that you too can own this DVD for less than full price. That would be the justification for actually owning it.
B000063V8R|5.0|I love these episodes in Star Trek the Next Generation Season 3.  Despite the advance technology of the future they have, they deal with many of the personal and ethical problems we deal with today.  That makes each of the stories relevant to today's world.<br />One thing that I do personally disagree with in these stories is that the crew completely ignores the possible of God.  I think this is clear in the episode &quot;Who Watches the Watchers&quot; where Picard tries to show what disastrous effects believing in God causes.  And although I agree a lot of bad has been done in the name of God, I do believe God is the creator and that he is ultimately in control of our lives and the universe.<br />Aside from that difference, I do enjoy the story telling very much and do recommend these DVD videos.
B000060P79|5.0|Well I first started liking Simple Plan when they opened at Edgefest 2 last summer.  The minute into the first song I was crazy about them.  After hearing them that day I checked them out on the internet, downloaded more of their songs, each as catchy as the last.  So I knew that their first CD would be great. I counted down the days with a calendar thing in my locker at school, lol.  Anyways my expectations as high as they were, were exceeded so much.  Every song has a different feel to it.  I'd name my fav songs, but I can't cause they're all amazing.  And check them out live, I've seen them 4 times this year, and by the end of the summer I will have seen them 6 times.  They're the sweetest guys, always hanging out and meeting fans after shows.  And Seb gave me a guitar pic!  Anyways after you've bought this CD, download their song on the Scooby Doo soundtrack, it's called Grow Up, plus their unreleased song One By One.  Believe me you won't regret it.  Even if you don't like pop punk you will love this CD.  It's by far the best CD this year, and the best debut CD ever!!
B000002LGQ|5.0|For some reason Madonna's latest techno sounding albums (Ray Of Light,Music)have been getting alot of praise and acclaim.But in my opinion Madonna's best album is Like A Prayer,it's a big change from her earlier pop/dance albums Like A Virgin and True Blue.Like A Prayer is a more serious mature Madonna and it deserves more acclaim then it got when it was first released.With songs about abusive failed relationships (Till Death Do Us Part,Oh Father)and the sad Promise To Try about her Mothers death from cancer when she was still young and Keep It Together about growing up in a large family and wanting to be your own person make this her most autobiographical album to date.There is also Act Of Contrition and Like A Prayer(the music video caused quite a stir when it was first released)in which she sings about her catholic faith.On Pray For Spanish Eyes she seems to be singing about some war or dictatorship in which innocent people are killed.But this album is not all doom and gloom.Cherish and The fantasy like Dear Jesse(with lyrics \\"pink elephants and lemonade\\",\\"mermaids sing as they comb there hair\\" show madonna still has a fun side.Ane Express Yourself is a dance number.The only song that didn't stand out for me was Love Song ,but I guess that's because it's a song she wrote and sang with Prince and I don't really care for his music.I'm still waiting for Madonna to release an album as good as this one because Like A Prayer is her best album so far
B000002JKA|5.0|After much debating, I decided that a big progressive rock fan like myself ought to buy an album by one of today's biggest prog metal bands. So, I went out (looking for &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot;, which they didn't have) and bought this CD. The first time I played it, I kind of didn't like James LaBrie's voice (a little too Ronnie James Dio). But, after listening a couple of times, I really started digging it! This album is nearly perfect. I had heard John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy in the Liquid Tension Experiment (buy their 2 CDs, they're fantastic), so I knew what to expect, but some of this stuff just blew away all those preconceived expectations. So far, this is my favorite of the bands work (I've yet to buy &quot;I&amp;W&quot;). &quot;6 Degrees&quot; and &quot;Scenes from...&quot; are fighting for the #2 spot.<BR>This is HIGHLY recommended to anyone who misses the days when a guitar player actually played some solos! the days when drummers weren't ashamed to use all the drums and cymbals in their kits! when a band could have keyboards and not be Bon Jovi!!<BR>Buy this; you know you want to.
B00005TT77|4.0|I was disappointed with what other had to say about the CD.  You know from the start that the songs are going to be COVERS and therefore aren't SUPPOSED to sound exactly like the originals.  Many of my friends who are die-hard fans still enjoyed hearing their favorite lyrics, just with a new twist.  I think that the soundtrack goes along with the movie great and really enjoyed the tie-ins.
B000001E7L|4.0|I found this album lying around the house. I already knew &quot;Zombie&quot;(my favorite) was a cool song so I decided to give it a listen. The rest was not too shabby either. 2 Other tracks that  stood out most to me were &quot;I Can't Be With You&quot; and &quot;Riciculous Thoughts&quot;.Other cool tracks are &quot;Ode To My Family&quot;, &quot;The Icicle Melts&quot;, &quot;Twenty One&quot;, and &quot;Yeat's Grave&quot;. &quot;Daffodil Lament&quot; was descent, but about 40-50 seconds too long. Other tracks didn't do enough to get this one a 5 star ranking. One more thing, cool little booklet with pictures of the band and lyrics to the songs.
067144901X|5.0|This book has been around for years.  My 13 year old loved it as a 2 year old and when his baby brother was born 2 months ago it was an immediate must have for him.  The pictures are great.  I recommend it highly.
B0000683DH|5.0|I just bought this DVD..., and the verdict is in: It's a blast!!!<br />THE MOVIE: Certanily one of the best Star Trek movies. Although the main plot about revenge is a bit too basic, the sub-plots, including the addition of Kirk's ex-wife and son, makes the movie better. The action is well paced and the special effects are marevelous. Also, the \\"expanded director's edition\\" featured on this DVD adds about 5 extra minutes to the movie. The added footage does little to help the plot, but does a great deal to flesh out more of the minor characters, such as Kirk's son and Lt. Saavik. Also, the last 15 minutes of the film (some added dialogue was put in there to have a little bit more emotional impact at the end of the film) made me jump the grade of the film from a \\"B\\" to an \\"A+.\\" <br />THE DVD: In addition to having a crisp, clear picture transfer of the film with oustanding sound, the first disc has a nice audio commentary from the director and an even nicer text commentary from Michael Okuda, co-author of the Star Trek Encyclopedia. (That guy knows EVERY SINGLE LITTLE DETAIL THAT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW A THING ABOUT that regards to Star Trek.) The second disc contains the following:<br />1) The Captain's Log: A 27-minute documentary featuring brand new interviews with Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner, director Nicholas Meyer, Ricardo Montalban, and others. They talk about how they originally intended to put the film together, how they eventually ended up completing that task, and other things.<BR>2) Designing Khan: A 23-minute documentary that features interviews with director Nicholas Meyers, the costume designer, and the production designer. They discuss the transitions they made in costume and production design from the ST:TMP to ST2:TWOK. <BR>3) Visual Effects: An 18-minute featurette that has interviews with the FX crew. They explain how they executed and completed the FX shots. (Big surprise there)<BR>4) The Star Trek Universe: A 28-minute documetary that features interviews with two Star Trek novel writers. They discuss how they fill in the gaps between the movies with their books and where they get their ideas.<BR>5) Original Interviews: Basically 10 minutes of interviews (from 1982) featuring William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Ricardo Montalban, and Deforest Kelley.<BR>6) Archives: The archives feature 10 original storyboard sequences. (That sure beats the storyboard archives on the ST:TMP DVD, which features a mere 3 storyboard sequences.) There is also a thatrical trailer.<br />So, there you have it. A great movie with a packed DVD equals a great purchase. Buy as soon as possible.<br />1982; 116 minutes; Rated PG for mild obscenity, some sequences of sc-fi action/violence, and brief shots of the aftermaths of brutal murders.<BR>(I DO think this movie should have been rated PG-13, but the rating didn't exist then. See and judge for yourself.)...
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool as a band is awsome becuase they are not flashy like a lot of rock bands out there. Their style is completly unique. They should be listened to by everyone but at the same time that much publicity would ruin everything breat about tool.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This cd is so cool. She's real, she produced it, wrote all the songs. She's no Britney (thank God). Shakira dosen't need a computer to fix her voice. Every song i would rate every song a 5. It's the first cd were i like all the songs. I don't speak spanish and I listen to the spanish songs anyway. This is the tribute to the BEST cd in the world
B00005NW02|5.0|System of a down is some of the best hard rock music out there besides TOOL becuase everything is so harmonic that it is like symphony rock. I think that SOAD is a great band becuase they all understand the basic theory of music and how to create music with others in harmony. The singing is awsome. I have seen few people that can use such a range of notes. He goes from screaming to growling, to high pitch without hesitation. The guitarist and the bassist in SOAD work very well together to create a symphony of rock. The drummer works in perfect. TOOL is the only band that you can really compare SOAD to today. All of the other rock has a lot of bs involved. People who aren't talented musicians are not worth listening to.
6304711875|5.0|This is one movie that every horror movie fan should watch.  Not because it's scary, but because it sort of makes fun of the rules that make up the horror flick industry. I.E. Never have sex or you'll definitely be killed. But this is no, 'Scary Movie' parody.  There is blood, gore, and some very tense and scary moments.  Characters do get killed.  And since they're all aware of the rules of horror flicks, it makes it much more interesting to watch how they try not to fall into a horror flick trap.<br />As far as the DVD is concerned, this is not an *ANAMORPHIC* transfer like Scream 2 and Scream 3. I totally do *not* understand why that is.  This is the best film of the three and deserves the best everything (transfer, extras, etc.)  It is however shown in widescreen letterbox format (2.35:1 aspect ratio,) so you won't miss out on any details.  The picture and sound are near perfect.  Again my only complaint was that the movie was not presented in anamorphic widescreen.  Extras are limited to commentaries by Wes Craven, trailers, cast biographies, and some film facts.  Not great, but not bad either.<br />I would definitely recommend getting the Trilogy set.  That way you can watch all three movie and see how it ends...
6301966562|3.0|Someone smart said that the more up-to-date a work of art is, the sooner it will become outdated.  This film is a great example.  Except that it probably wasn't that good in 1984, either.
B00003CXAA|5.0|It's The Godfather...what else can I say?
B00005JKBC|4.0|Brad Pitt and Robert Redford worked well together to produce a believable relationship between the young, rash, incoming spy and the older, experienced, soon to retire spy-mentor.<br />The suspense of the clock ticking down to an execution and the intrigue of the back room games played by government officials kept me glued to the screen as I waited for the conclusion. Great escapism.
1573225517|5.0|If you like the film, you will like the book even more. It has more humor, it keeps it real with the setting in England, and you don't have the annoying Jack Black in it. :)
6305127638|5.0|After I felt mild disappointment with \\"Generations,\\" I had hoped that a film devoted entirely to the Next Gen cast might work better.  My wish came true, as \\"First Contact\\" is TNG's best film so far (we'll have to see how \\"Nemesis\\" turns out).<BR>Director/star Jonathan Frakes knew his cast and his audience as he had directed several great episodes of the television series.  The film is a nice even mix of spooky suspense, gore (a new addition to the Star Trek movie universe), and a bit of humor.  It's a breakthrough story for the character of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart).  The usually collected captain becomes livid with revenge.  I will only say that.  I'm not going to draw out the description of the plot for you.  Plenty of other reviews on this site slice it up for you.  I will simply say that it's a great story involving one of the most destructive Federation enemy races, the Borg. <BR>The cast is superb, as almost always.  Some fans have not been happy with the portrayal of Zephram Cochrane (James Cromwell).  I thought he was quite good.  Besides, if Cochrane had been the easy going, caring, thoughtful individual, there would have been no conflict between him and the Enterprise crew.  Conflicts keep stories going, not simple solutions.  <BR>Alice Krige was icy and scary as the Borg Queen.  Everytime I see her in another movie or on television, I keep envisioning her with her floating, slimy, bald Borg head.  She must have been that good, huh?<br />Needless to say, there were plenty of eye catching special effects and new Enterprise-E gadgets (zero gravity boots, a holographic medical assistant) to please sci-fi buffs.  If there were historical discrepancies (as in Star Trek history), I didn't notice.  I'm a fan of the show, but I'm not one of those people who breaks out the \\"Star Trek Companion\\" to find contradictions.  It happens sometimes, and I just deal with it.  No offense to die-hard fans, though.<BR>The DVD offers nice picture and sound, butonly a trailer for a special feature.  This makes me a little mad because I know there was at least an HBO-First Look special.  I think Paramount's just waiting to release a special edition so they can make more money.  Typical.<BR>But in the meantime, it's a great movie: gritty, action-packed, and even funny.  Trek fans enjoy...and pray with me that \\"Nemesis\\" continues the tradition of \\"FC.\\"
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Indeed it is. One of my favorites of all time. The direction is so...&quot;Wow!&quot; it's not even funny. Darren is moving on up in the industry...very fast.<br />Everybody delievers great performances and the DVD is one of the best. It has all the features you would want, plus some great menus. :)
B00000IQC8|5.0|Kevin Smith writes some of the best scripts in today's cinema world.  Sure, he can be crude and even a little too descriptive, but he can also be clever and insightful.  \\"Clerks\\" was his first attempt at movie making, and it created such a splash that he now has the money and ego of one of today's top director.  <BR>\\"Clerks,\\" a black-and-white, not necessarily visually-pleasing film, tells the story of Dante (Brian O'Halloran), an unhappy convenience store clerk with relationship troubles.  His carefree video store worker pal Randal (Jeff Anderson) provides advice, good or bad, and comic relief to try and brighten Dante's day.  This movie was sort of a behind-the-scenes at the Quick Stop in addition to being a comedy about Dante's lovelife.  We get a look at annoying customers, being stuck at work on your day off, drug dealers making sales outside the store, and challenging authority.  These are all issues clerks deal with, although maybe not everyday.  After all, it's not everyday that an old man has a heart attack in the employee restroom.  But for comedic purposes, Smith crammed as much as he could into this sort of mockumentary, giving Dante and Randal plenty to deal with and keeping the plot going.<BR>This movie is kind of an acquired taste.  A lot of people don't like the long dialogues between Randal and Dante, such as the one about independent contractors in the Death Star.  But I found them to be to funny.  Lots of people sit around and talk about nothing like these two guys do.  Therefore, those conversations are something audience members should relate to.  But to each his own.  Some viewers want more action in lieu of long, intelligent dialogue.  <BR>The DVD has some good stuff on it, including commentary by the director, cast and crew, and extended scenes.  One of the coolest features is the original ending.  I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it.  For the record, I like the way the movie ended in the final cut better.<BR>Love it or hate it, this movie was groundbreaking and one of the most inexpensive success stories in film history.  Bravo to Kevin Smith for a great first effort.
B00005JKJA|5.0|My favorite Lynch film. Great mysterious story that keeps you thinking for hours afterwards. It's great! Fantastic dream like cinematography and direction. Naomi Watts got robbed at the Oscars with her INCREDIBLY performance, especially in the audition scene.<br />This is a must for all Lynch fans and a must for all fans with love movies that make you think.
B000002KLP|5.0|&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; is probably the greatest album that consists of 8 songs and runs at only half an hour.  Following two impressive, if unspectacular, albums from the 1970s, Prince rang in the new decade with one of the most envelope-pushing recordings released in the last 30 years.  &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; triumphs partly because it straddles so many different fences: it's raunchy and lewd, but never obscene.  It's hip and happening, but never trendy.  Even after all these years, &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; is not only provocative lyrically, but it also has a lot to offer musically.  Check out the melange of rock and synth pop in &quot;When You Were Mine,&quot; the upbeat disco of &quot;Uptown,&quot; and the sinister funk of the still-eyebrow raising &quot;Head.&quot;  However, the track that some people found the most troubling is &quot;Sister&quot; with its line &quot;incest is everything it's said to be.&quot;  No matter what context in which you interpret that lyric, it shows that Prince is not shy about addressing taboo subjects.  &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; is the first masterpiece of Prince's catalogue, and it represents a crucial point in his career.  It's a classic that deserves your attention.
B0000640VO|5.0|You will fall in love with Amelie after you are finished with the film. If you dislike subtitle/foreign films, you will still fall in love with Amelie...It's THAT great!<br />The performances, directing, screenplay, score, and the cinematography is INCREDIBLE.
B00005YUFK|5.0|Whoever's responsible at Triloka for recording South African Flugelhorn master Hugh Masekela in this setting deserves highest praise.  Talk about deep grooves . . . his U of SA band kicks butt up one side and down the other.  Recording him live was a good move, too.<br />Even anachronistic numbers like \\"Mandela (Bring Him Back Home),\\" with its hopelessly sentimental lyrics celebrating Nelson Mandela walking the streets of Soweto with his soon-to-be divorced wife, Winnie, seem somehow right: the musical truth is larger than shopworn politics, no matter how just the cause.<br />Township jazz, performed at some kind of musical Nirvana, is the order of day here, and never has it sounded better.  If you have even the slightest affinty for this transcendent music, this is your record.

B000001EL3|5.0|Call it their make-it or break-it album, Destroyer ensured KISS made it.  Sure, they had help with the earthshattering Alive!, but what they really needed was another studio album to really set their reputation in stone, and that's what Destroyer began, the job to be completed on their followup album.<br />Three all-time classics are present here--\\"Detroit Rock City,\\" \\"Shout It Out Loud,\\" and \\"Beth.\\"  Yes, I've heard them countless times before, but they still deserve their due.  However, I wouldn't hesitate to include the hard-rocking \\"King Of The Night Time World\\" as a classic.  \\"Detroit Rock City\\" has evolved from being one of KISS's best known songs to being a movie.  I sometimes wonder whether anyone knows the story in the song instead of jamming to it on their stereo, or picking out Gene's bass line.  A boy goes speeding on the highway to catch a midnight show and ends up crashing into another vehicle.  The irony is bittersweet:  \\"I gotta laugh, cause I know I'm gonna die.  Why?\\"<br />\\"God Of Thunder\\" is the first weird track on Destroyer, as it has a little kid giving out stage directions to KISS in spots.  For a more kick-in-the-keister version, check out Alive II!  \\"Great Expectations\\" is the other \\"weird\\" track, as it features a boy's choir.<br />\\"Flaming Youth\\" and \\"Sweet Pain\\" are rocking tunes leading up to \\"Shout It Out Loud.\\"  The last track \\"Do You Love Me\\" nearly qualifies as filler, but its inclusion doesn't mess up the album.  Plus what's with that weird psychedelic distortion at the end of that song?<br />It isn't hard to see why the Peter Criss-sung \\"Beth\\" became another one of KISS's biggest hits--chartwise.  Destroyer, if not their best album, at least features classic songs that support it to the hilt.

B00004YZFR|5.0|You've never seen \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and you call yourself a Rock & Roll fan? ...Not likely!<br />All I can say, is OH MY GOD! What a tremendous DVD package! This is one of the greatest Rock & Roll films of all time and has never looked or sounded better.<br />Criterion have done a fabulous job here and it's worth every penny. The film is shown in full-screen, 1.33:1. The soundtrack comes in Dolby surround and 5.1 surround, as well as with a commentary soundtrack of the directors and editor. There is also a mini booklet containing memories of the concert by many who were there at Altamont, including Hell's Angel Sonny Barger.<br />There is a slight grain to the picture, but remember, this was shot on 16mm film - there is only so much restoration can do. While I am not particularly a fan of 16mm film, some people like the look for its own sake.<br />If you don't know what this film is about, or have never heard of it - then boy, do you have some homework to do! Primarily this film climaxes around the Rolling Stones' 1969 free concert at the Altamont speedway in California... But this film shows the Stones at what I feel is their peak - the 1969 tour that kicked-off the Mick Taylor era Stones! See this film, for the first time, or just the first time in a while. Remember Rock & Roll that was!
6304795254|5.0|It's Fincher. What else can I say? This guy knows how to direct a great film. You have great performances, a great story with a great twist, and once again fantastic directing from David Fincher.<br />The DVD isn't much...very good quality picture and sound, but not extras. You do get the trailers, which are very good...The teaser is one of THE best teasers, in my opinion. The film deserves a Special Edition DVD!
B00005ASHM|5.0|&quot;If there is one person that I have to select as a living genius of pop music, I would choose Brian Wilson.&quot; - Sir George Martin.<br />Perhaps second only to Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson stands as one of the giants of American popular songwriting during the 20th Century. Pet Sounds is his masterpiece, and you owe it to yourself to learn this.<br />Like all aquired tastes, this album did not floor me upon my first listening. I give two excuses for my ignorant lack of insight at that naive time: one, I am not a musician - much of what is going-on in these songs is far over my head; two, this album has spawned so much imitaion in all the time since that it's difficult to see the forest for the trees.<br />In time, these songs grew and grew and grew on me. This album has come to embody the summer season for me. Summertime would never be the same without it ever again. True, all Beach Boys material has this quality; but nothing so much as Pet Sounds.<br />The melodies, and for the first time, the instrumentation, is angelic and mindblowing at the same time. These cuts are perfect. Just listen to the key-climbing &quot;You Still Believe in Me&quot;, and the odd time signatures of &quot;That's Not Me&quot;. Brian Wilson has never been more autobiographical in his lyrics as he sings: &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;. <br />No Brian, that's not entirely true. The times just hadn't caught up to you yet (and neither have most of us either). Buy Pet Sounds and listen to it again and again throughout your life. You too will soon fall under its spell and realize that you too weren't made for these times.
0140177396|5.0|Very quick read. Love the detail of the story and you just feel like you are right there with them. Sad is it? Indeed it is...if you're looking for a story that might bring a tear drop from your eye...this is it.
B00000IPAX|5.0|this cd is really awesome.  probably the best blink cd.  it's more pop then some their recent cds but it is still better in my opinion.  i like every song on the cd except &quot;all the small things&quot; since i hate it now because i've heard it too many times, but &quot;going away to college&quot; is really good and it makes up for &quot;all the small things&quot;.  you should really go out and buy the cd.
0805062971|5.0|I'll keep this short. If you love the film, you will love the book.
B00003CX5P|4.0|While this film has it's disappointments, (the idiotic Jar Jar Binks and overly cutesie Anakin) it is still a visually stunning film with great special effects. In many ways the DVD is better than the film. Don't get me wrong, I liked more about the film than I disliked but, the DVD is an excellent transfer with nice extras. There are a few hidden \\"easter eggs\\" which show outtakes and some humorous additions. If you even faintly enjoyed this film then you'll be pleased with the DVD. Of course, we're all waiting for the original three films to get the DVD treatment. One of the beauties about DVD is the ability to freeze the action and clearly see what's in the picture. You may want to do that in a few scenes here. In the Senate scenes you can use the still action to check out some of the characters slipped in here...like the \\"E.T.'s\\" etc,. I personally like to skip to the Darth Maul scenes. Great stuff. For all of it's faults, I still enjoyed the movie. I think we tend to be a bit harsh on the newer films because of the comparisons to the original trilogy. Again, the digital transfer is top notch as is the sound quality. If you have a home theater setup then you'll really enjoy playing this baby.
B000050FEN|5.0|One of THE best DVDs and films. David &quot;The Man&quot; Fincher brought us a truly great mystery/thriller that is unforgettable. This film created Fincher and his style. It's truly a fine masterpiece by David.<br />One of the best commentaries too, with Fincher, Pitt, and Freeman.
0688170528|4.0|As many reviewers did, I read this book in 1 sitting.  The reason I couldn't put it down was because it told a story very similar to one of my own.  As a child &amp; teenager, I was raised in a family similar to the Golds and lived next door to a family similar to the Hartes.  We were as intertwined as they were -- sharing vacations, holidays and relationship that went beyond neighbors and friends.  It ended when my &quot;Chris Harte&quot; broke our engagement after our mothers planned a wedding to finally unite our two families into one.  My heart was wrenched by Picoult's story and I felt deeply the loss of the relationship between the families.  It was encouraging, however, that someone else had thought of a tragedy that echoed my own so similarly.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Dark, Hilarious, and visually stunning. Great performances from Pitt, Norton, and Carter with the incredible directing from David Fincher. This is THE Cult film. Fincher brings such great style with Palahniuk's story...it's mind blowing. The way he uses CG is fantastic.
B000068FUS|2.0|I bought this double album after reading several glowing reviews. Unfortunately it wasn't available on a listening station. I recommend that you listen before buying because the vocals on this album are annoyingly awful. The idea is good; however, this band doesn't translate the idea into good music. I find some of the songs ok, but most are blandly produced with the main flaw being the vocals which sound like someone who lost their voice but decided to keep singing. Why do critics keep hyping cds that simply can not live up to the glowing reviews that are so readily handed out to dull albums? It seems that everyone is so bored with today's music that they will settle for anything that isn't teen pop.
1573226521|5.0|Great adventure with very good themes. If you saw the film, trust me...the book is 50x better than the movie.
B000066C6F|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out at the 7&27 Drive-in back in 1985.  It was great then on the big screen, and I watched it whenever it came on TV.  I remember it didn't do well at the box office, but it has always been a personal favourite of mine.  I bought the VHS tape 2 yrs ago and have played it to death! I'm glad that Columbia has released it on DVD.  Some of the plot drags, but the '80s style aerobic exercises give it the extra energy this movie needed.  Speaking of exercise, it's interesting to see all the outdated ways to exercise in this movie.  \\"Perfect\\" was made during the fitness boom of \\"going for the burn\\" & \\"no pain, no gain\\".  Little did people know that doing those neck rolls like Jaime Lee Curtis does could lead you to a life in traction!  All and all, \\"Perfect\\" will always be a fave of mine because of it's entertainment value and retro exercise routines...love those legwarmers!!
B00003CXRP|4.0|I have seen a lot of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; type movies in my lifetime. Most of them are usually quite dissapointing in the aspect of realism. Not this one.<br />Too many of these island survival films feature unlikely creature comforts; like gorgeous native girls treating you like a king, or building a 5-room tree house with only a pocket knife.<br />This movie remains primitive, gritty and realistic throughout. It is not a &quot;how to&quot; survival movie, but just shows one man's plight that living alone on an island is not only unglamorous, but could lead to ones insanity.<br />Tom Hanks does a swell job here, including achieving weight loss to show a malnourished effect of island hardship.
0446608955|5.0|About a month ago i finished this book and then last night i rented the movie with Mandy Moore. and i was very very very very very dissapointed it was horrible. if u saw the movie and thought it was bad the book is much much much much much mucb better. THis book is about landon Carter who is a popular guy and jamie sullivan a religous nerd. They   fall in love and then she gets sick with cancer and its a wonderful wonderful book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXXP|5.0|I loved this movie. The actors are great, and the plot is amazing. What I liked the most about this movie is its critisism of the human soceity: Its racism and its fear and hate to anything that might be better than the avarage person.<BR>I think this movie is giving a thinking metrial about many relevant subjects that are on the limit between science and science-fiction, especially clonning.<br />My personal conclusion from the movie was that maybe the human kind is not yet ready to play God. We are too close to the animal to have the right of playing God, and until we overcome the primitive part of racism and hatared, we shouldn't try and create intelligent life that might suffer from being here.<br />Anyway, it seems that the original ending was too hard for the viewers, so they pasted a &quot;Happy Ending&quot;. My suggestion, if you really want to get the full meaning of the movie, stop it about 15 mins before the actual ending (Before the Aliens come, you'll see whatI mean.).
B00006G8G4|5.0|This is one of the best movie's i've seen thus far. I loved it! I've seen it 3 times and i love it even more. This movie stays true to the comics because you know that even the director is a fan himself. Tobey, Kirsten, and Dafoe belong to their roles. They did great and i couldn't imagine a better spidey. Even the cgi is great. There are moments that just take my breath away. Just gotta say I can't wait for the sequels.
0812550706|5.0|It's an amazing book, indeed one of the best science fiction books I've ever read. I read it when I was about 12 and it was a great introduction to the science fiction genre. The fact that the hero is a kid makes it a great book to the younger readers, and it is an interesting book, that I read again and again, even today, 6 years later, and still enjoy it. A good gift to the 13th and on birthdays.
B00005O3VC|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.<BR>In the beginning of the movie, you can easily miss the funny German subtitle. <BR>If you have your own DVD, you can pause any time you want. So you can enjoy this movie as much as they enjoying making this movie, and you can also find something you've never noticed before.
0451169514|5.0|I first read this book when I was 13, I was so terrified that I couldn't pass page 30. 4 years later, after reading many others of King's books, I felt brave enough to deal with maybe the scariest charecter in any of the master of horror's books. It was great. This books kept me in tension to the very last page, and it is, surely the scariest book I've ever read.<br />However, it is also an important book. The kids are not the usual kind of heros, they are nerds and outsiders, ... More than it is a book about a monster that is killing people it is a story about the power of friendship, the power of dreaming and of love. It is a story about childhood and about growing up, and about the combination of the two worlds. It is a story about all of us, that with a little help from our friends, defeating our inner demons and outer troubles. A great book, that would give you a good fright, and make you fall in love with it.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Heard It's Too Late on the radio recently. I used to have the vinyl album but after I sold most of them in favour of CDs, this album was one I never replaced. Hearing the song on the radio prompted me to buy it in the new extended version. It's been in my player most of the weekend. Simply Wonderful.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I know Spider-man from the animated series. Comic books were never popular in Israel, and they are not a cultural phenomenon as they are in the US. So I went to this movie with some knowledge about the Spider-man, and from what I heard I expected a fun movie. And it was fun, and so much more. The special effects are amazing, the actors are great, the plot is good. I came in a stranger to Spiderman and went out thinking that he is the best superhero. He is more cool than the dark and complicated Batman, and yet, he is human, and not an Alien like Superman. This movie is more cool and human than the movies of the other two. The only bad thing I can say about it is that when you see Spiderman and the Goblin as men in suits and not computerized, it looks like \\"Power Rangers\\". Anyway, it's a cool movie and I really like it.
6305265488|5.0|I had my doubts about this movie...  I mean how many times can one story be told?  However, after watching it, I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  Drew Barrymore is convincingly both strong and insecure as Cinderella and she makes the movie both believable and fairy-tale like.  This may seem like a contradiction in terms, but see it if you want to understand.<br />At times sad, dramatic, funny, and romantic, this movie is sure to become a timeless new spin on a classic love story.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|What can i say about a record when it just sold out 28 million copies among lps, cds, and musictapes? Eleven songs to express every form of music Dire Straits played in the last nine years.<BR>You've the classical Straits's song like \\"So Far Away\\", it could indifferently be on every work they recorded so far; the twisting \\"Walk Of Life\\", everybody will be dragged to sing during the live-shows; the soft and intimate notes of \\"Your Latest Trick\\" that could break everyone's heart.<BR>The impalpable atmospheres of this record run through again the past experiences of Mark with (and without) Dire Strais, from the musical-cinematogrphic compositions until the instinctive way to drink deep from the fountains of blues. The role played by Mark becames central and one thing is really sure: \\"Dire Straits is his own feud\\"! The caribbean percussion of \\"Ride Across The River\\" introduces you to the second part of the cd, just to face the first touch with the country of \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" in a Dire Straits work. There's a lot of sweetness and incomparable attitude for composition on \\"Why Worry\\" ( a proud cradle-song) and the title-track flowing straight to the brain of every listeners. \\"One World\\" is a funky who gives as a present the right dose of rhythm, while \\"Money For Nothing\\" is (one of) the highlights of the album, where an unusual Mark's guitar's sound mixes with the noisy Guy Fletcher keyboards (listen to the palpitation of the heart-intro!!!).<BR>P.S.: This album has been recorded using the 24 digital-track machine, giving a clear sound and making playing better even the stereos of poor quality. On the notes you'll find thanking for Tony Levin (King Crimson), Sting (do you know who's this man?) and Eric Clapton, but we don't know what (and if) they really played. Remember 28 million copies.............sold out.
B00005JKNC|3.0|First off, this movie isn't that bad.  It's just that this movie simply tries too hard.  It tries too hard to make us cry, to make us feel patriotic, and to make us long for the days of the innocence that supposedly existed in small towns across America during the 50's.  It tries too hard to invoke the images of Jimmy Stewart in his prime... it makes one wonder if the scene in this movie where the studio execs are talking about bastardizing an existing movie script, by adding hackneed sentimentality in order to pull at the heart strings of the audience was something secretly taped when the producers initially pitched \\"The Majestic\\" to the studio brass.<br />This movie is, in many ways, a throwback to those old black and white movies that your parents, or grandparents liked.  The thing is, this film, although competent, isn't stirring.<br />Carey gives a subdued, golly-gee-goshed-darned performance, but... it's just lacking.  Now, I'm not saying that I wanted his character in this movie to begin talking out of his butt, while growing a pompador, but... this role did not allow Carey to inject any humor into the performance, whatsoever.  <br />Although it is nice to see Hollywood put out movies that don't involve explosions, silicone breasts, and massive CGI sequences, there are times, such as in this film, that you simply don't need to re-invent the wheel.  Skip this movie, and go to the source.  \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\", and \\"It's a Wondeful Life\\".  Both did it better.  Both were even edgier, if you could believe that, and both did it decades ago.
0380789035|3.0|I wanted to give this 5 stars and say that it was fantastic but the truth of the matter is that Gaiman took a geat idea and didn't do much with it.  I was waiting for it to pick up and it never did.  Some of the character were interesting  but he could have done so much more with it (almost anything could have been done with these characters)....I don't know , I am confused by what he wanted to say.  I have read tons of fantasy and sci-fi but this is better taken out of the library than bought.  Many people gave it 5 stars but it truly is not a 5 star book.  Neverwhere was much better.
0887309372|4.0|I loved the idea of organizing the world of PR, which is what branding is all about, into 22 general laws. Very easy read, and I liked it as much as Levine's &quot;Guerilla PR.&quot; Great books for research.
6305781427|5.0|I first saw this video on VHS and I was amazed, but when I bought the DVD it was awesome! The night of the concert had to have been amazing. The picture and sound of the video is amazing. I would HIGHLY recommend this video to anyone with a passion for music because you'll find yourself watching it over and over.
B00003CX95|4.0|First, William Wallace was an actual historic persion, but the story described in this movie is completely fake. There are websites about him (Wil, not Mel), so go check out google or yahoo or whatever.  However, the movie itself is very entertaining with a good story, good musics, beautiful scenes.<BR>So, why they wanted to make it \\"true\\"? I have no idea. Maybe<BR>they thought they can grab a bit more bucks by saying so (or if<BR>not explicitly saying, they're implying) like blarewitch project?<BR>Even the interview w/ Mel (on dvd) emphasize the existence of<BR>Wil and praise him as a freedom fighter.  That kind of attitude<BR>really ruin the movie itself.  In addition to Mel, the chick <BR>really acted stupid in the interview even though she looked<BR>smart and considerable person in the movie; this means that she<BR>is a good actress who can completely hide her shallowness in the<BR>movie.  So, if you cannot enjoy something after seeing the<BR>reality behind the scene, don't watch the inteviews.<br />Another annoying point (after watching it few times) is that<BR>Wil justifies everything for \\"freedom\\".  The movie encourages<BR>revenge (or \\"get even\\" if you prefer to call it... well, the<BR>president bush call it \\"justice\\"), and I am one of most ppl who<BR>just enjoyed it... at first.  I personally love revenge, but<BR>after seeing what's going on in the mid east in the real life/<BR>world, and thinking about the true value of forgiveness, the<BR>implication of this movie really is superficial. <br />The last thing to complain is that Mel wasn't young enough to<BR>play as Wil. He was a good actor on this movie (and Mad Max),<BR>but he cannot hide his age. It's hard to be convinced he was<BR>late teen to early 20s. But again, if you don't care about the history, and don't care about the detail of the story, this is a minor bug which can be safely ignored. And let me repeat once <BR>again, \\"this move is finely made, acting is good, musics and all others are really nice\\" and I bet you too will enjoy, but if you<BR>want to keep the good impression, don't seek the true history or<BR>watch the interviews.
B000069HK2|5.0|I love this album. im a big fan of glassjaw and Finch and all those type of bands.. this album is great.. thats all
B00000K3D4|5.0|I love this movie, even though it was made around the year I was born! Even though I'm a teenager, my friends and I still watch this movie!! I first saw it when I was a little girl when my babysitter brought it over because she was (at the time) in love with David Bowie. This movie is something that will never be out of date or forgotten by me & if I meet someone who hasn't seen the movie, I have them come over & we watch it! I'm happy to see \\"The Making Of Labyrinth\\" made the DVD under the Special Features. The plot is great and Jennifer Connelly's & David Bowie's acting performances are wonderful... Any David Bowie fan will love this movie & I also own the soundtrack- which is almost better than the movie itself!!! It's a great movie to remember how truly wonderful Jim Henson was and it's by far some of his best work ever.
B000068TPN|5.0|Being a guy who loves action movies, the parts showing the wifes were a slight setback, but I didn't mind watching them because it all fell into the story great.  I also love movies that are heroic or inspiring (Braveheart, The Patriot, Saving Private Ryan), and this is another movie that I thought did the same.  It looked great also just overall, and was just stunning.  I am not in the army, I don't know much about vietnam, but after I saw that movie I just felt so connected to it (although Hollywood changed some of the parts comparing to the book).  This movie is really only good for action and parts of drama.  But the history behind it, and the feeling I had that people actually did this made me appreciate this movie so much more.
B00000JKH2|5.0|Of all of ATDI's albums, I'd have to say this one is my favorite. It's short, yes, but each of the songs is of such a high quality you feel like you're getting more than just 24 minutes of music. Some of the songs, like Metronome Arthritis, 198d, and Rascuache, just totally knocked me out. Metronome Arthritis, in particular, is one of the best songs I've ever heard. The breakdown:<BR>1) Rascuache- one of the best songs, it's a really good way to start off the album. It's pretty fast paced and very catchy. As always, Cedric's vocals shine, even if the lyrics to this song make even less sense than they normally do.<BR>2) Proxima Centauri- a very interesting song, in the way is speeds up and slows down. The lyrics have something to do with ancient Romans in space and mention things like \\"spacesuit togas\\"- wierd, but cool.<BR>3) Ursa Minor- I had heard this song before I bought the album and I loved it- it's another pretty catchy song. It might take some getting used to, since it's kind of offbeat, but it's another great song.<BR>4) Heliotrope- I love the way this song starts off- the guitars ath the beginning are extremely cool. It stays pretty fast the whole way through and it's got some interesting lyrics- \\"Inseminating motives of a lukewarm persistence/Let the thieves in through the front door/Let them take what they've been missing.\\"<BR>5) Metronome Arthritis- my favorite. It starts off slow and bass-heavy, very ominous, and slowly builds to a stunning climax- \\"What if forensics find the answer?/What if they stole my fingerprints?/Where did I leave my book of matches?/We'll find you.\\" It's got a great solo near the end and the lyrics are the best on the whole album.<BR>6) 300mhz- Probably my least favorite on the whole album, it's a pretty good song nonetheless, especially near the end.<BR>7) 198d- probably my second favorite song. It's very quiet and emotional and builds up to a brilliant end- \\"Tremors that hold us/Tremors that warn us/Nothing bleeds like...\\" A great finale to a great album- BUY IT!
0671027344|4.0|I have one word to describe this book: touching.  I could have used much more words to describe it but I chose \\"touching.\\"  You feel like you want to know Charlie and meet him somewhere.  This book is but it is not for everyone.  You have to sort of relate to him a bit and get past all the times he tediously cries throughout the whole book.  This powerful novel is about a young 9th grade wallflower named Charlie.  You don't know where he lives, where he goes to school and even his real name.  He writes letters to someone throughout the entire book and tells he/she about his 9th grade year.  I don't want to give away anything but he battles through problems of sex, drugs, school, homosexuality, friends, death and family.  This funny/sad coming-of-age novel is really great for Stephen Chbosky's first novel.  <br />Oh and Charlie obviously lives in Pittsburgh, PA.  Here are the hints:<BR>1. It mentions the Fort Pitt Tunnels<BR>2. It mentions Allegheny County<BR>3. The author grew up in Pittsburgh and graduated from my future high school<BR>I know this because I live in Pitt!  Well anyway this book is good but not a must-have for everyone.
B000069KGM|1.0|I agree with everyone else here that this album is extraordinary. My complaint is with Rhino's remastering job, which is simply atrocious for this album. &quot;Introduction&quot; begins almost a semitone flat, and is seriously distorted at times. &quot;Beginnings&quot; is distorted during the big climax. So is &quot;Questions 67 &amp; 68.&quot; Etc. The mastering engineer cranked the average levels WAY up to make the album louder, and the results are often unlistenable.<br />The original two-CD version is dated but okay. The one to get, alas, is the gold-CD MasterSound issue, now out of print. You can, however, get almost 2/3 of the album in the &quot;Group Portrait&quot; box, which is remastered very well by Mark Wilder.<br />Again, my single star rating applies to this remaster, NOT to the music, which earns five stars. Rhino should be ashamed of themselves.
6304595247|4.0|This presentation of Wuthering Heights has so many excellent elements, but just misses. It could have been fantastic, if the director took a little more care to be more faithful to the novel.<BR>This movie is a must-see for the cinematography and cinematic music fans, however. The music is the perfect marraige of haunting celtic with neo-romantic. Ryuichi Sakamoto did a fantastic job creating passionate and heart-rendering melodies that have been richly orchestrated and timed perfectly to augment the viewers sympathies at the right moments. The sweeping views of the moors show the landscape at its most barren and dramatic, beautifully underscoring the doomed love of Heathcliff and Cathy.<BR>Ralph Fiennes makes a wonderful Heathcliff, but just misses by not showing Heathcliff's human side. This is too bad, because just a little more warmth on his part would have made him the perfect Heathcliff. <BR>Juliette Binoche's performance as Cathy lacked the neurotic, petulant aspects of Cathy's personality so vividly described in the novel. Again I blame this on the director, as he left out her bad display of temper and hysteria scenes.<BR>Also, the director should have hired younger people to portray Heathcliff and Cathy in their teenage years--Fiennes and Binoche were not believable as 15 year-olds. Same applies for young Catherine Linton.<BR>With the fabulous scenery, music and casting of Fiennes as Heathcliff, along with an excellent supporting cast, this film could have been really great.
B000001FNL|5.0|i love you it is good cd i will thank you send it to me
B00005JKNB|2.0|Frank Darabont loves old Hollywood films, and that's apparent from his works.  In &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; we saw Rita Hayworth film &quot;Gilda&quot; and in &quot;The Green Miles&quot; musical classic &quot;Top Hat.&quot;  As if he wants to say Hollywood is no longer what it should be, he again took Jimmy Stewart material in &quot;The Majestic&quot; in which Jim Carrey plays a role of Peter, a screenwriter in the McCarthy period, with a lot of references to old Hollywood movies again.<br />Peter is tired of his hackeyed work (as described in   Fitzgerald's funny &quot;Pat Hobby&quot; stories), and of stupid ideas of studio bosses.  But he is suddenly given another life when he meets an car accident, loses his memories, and gets stranded on the shore of a small town.  And the people of the town recognize him as Luke, a war hero supposed to be dead, but now coming back there as a symbol of hope.  He starts a new life as Luke, falls in love with a girl, and finally re-opens a theater &quot;The Majestic.&quot;  Everything is all right until he, as well as FBI, remember his lost identity, which is in fact blacklisted on UnAmerican Activity Subcommittee.<br />The rest of the story should not be told, but it is not a hard task for anyone to imagine that.  And that moment surely has power, sincerity, and good performance from Carrey playing Peter wavering between two ways of life to choose, but the problem is that it takes too long time to reach there.  As is often the case with Darabont's films, the film spends nearly 1 hour in the opening part to set up its situation.  Though helped by Carrey in a serious vein, and Martin Landau as his &quot;father,&quot; the film is sometime undeniably self-indulgent.  (Actually, I slept for a while.  Sorry, but it's true.)<br />But to me, more fundamental problem is that we have much superior film that realizes the value &quot;The Majestic&quot; champions, that is, &quot;The Front&quot; starring Woody Allen (but directed by Martin Ritt).   Just take a look at that, and you know what I mean.  And though I admit the film &quot;The Majestic&quot; goes rather  like a fable than a realistic story, its meaning is too obvious, its way of expressing it too far-fetched.  It is a worthy attempt for Hollywood to look back this dark age, but you don't have to use this roundabout fashion, which includes incredible co-incidences (such as one character experiences two key incidents of life at the same time; or, small townspeople all believing Peter as Luke when he is about to summoned to the committee, etc.)<br />Finally, what I disagree with the film most is its very easy, or naive conclusion about the proceedings at the Committee.  What happened to Chaplin, who had to live in Europe after leaving America?  Or what did scriptwriter Dalton Trumbo do when he was blacklisted (he used a &quot;front&quot; in his work, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;)?  If you know these historical things, you never appreciate the finale as Darabont wanted you to.  I don't deny his good-intention and value of film's allegorical meanings, but the film is too long, too thin, and most of all, misguiding in thinking about this important age in the history of modern America.

0446608955|5.0|For all die-hard Nicholas Sparks fans this is a must-read! If you haven't read any of his books, this one will definitely get you hooked. The prologue mentions, \\"first you will laugh, and then you will cry\\" and this couldn't be more true. I have read it over 5 times and I enjoy it just as much each time. Reading this book you become absorbed in a different time and place, where things were simple and innocent and true love was all that mattered. Once you pick it up you won't want to put it down!
0060920084|5.0|This book represents the best of Bryson's work to-date.  He completely captures the heart and soul of towns throughout America.  Bryson has an amazing talent of bringing you with him to these towns such as Pella, Iowa or Springfield, Illinois.  He offers a unique perspective on Americans within each place he visits on this journey.  Bryson inspires you to want to drive across America and experience each little thing like eating in a small diner or talking to locals throughout the country.  Great book filled with detailed description about the place he visits and the people he mets along the way.
B000003BE4|5.0|Out Of Our Heads was released in the U.S. on July 30, 1965.  It includes the most famous of all rock and Stones tracks (Satisfaction) as well as The Last Time (one of their most enduring compositions).  But this album has what I call the best of the great Stones 2nds....those tracks that formed the basis of the original band.....not the AM hits.....but the developing expertise and taste that eventually gave us the great songwriting and sense of outrage that became the greatest band the planet has ever known.  This includes Mercy Mercy, Hitch Hike, That's How Strong My Love Is, Play With Fire, and The Spider And The Fly.  This album is also memorable for the 7 titles penned by Jagger and Richards (the first time their own compositions dominated an album).<br />Personally, this one is my favorite of all their early albums and I have always ranked it as 2nd only to Beggars Banquet.  But I loved the early Stones first and best and have felt that way for almost 40 years now.  My kids respect them, my grandchildren are just now hearing them for the first time, but I still love the old band as they play on this album.<br />The Out Of Our Heads tracks were recorded during 1964-5 as follows:<BR>1964: Oct 27 - Nov 2 at RCA Studios in Hollywood<BR>     Hitch Hike<BR>1965: Jan 17-18 &amp; Feb 17 at RCA Studios in Hollywood<BR>     The Last Time<BR>     Play With Fire<BR>Live in the UK on March 6 (Empire in Liverpool), 7 (Palace in Manchester), or 16 (Granada in Greenford)<BR>     I'm All Right<BR>May 10, 1965 at Chess Studios in Chicago<BR>     That's How Strong My Love Is<BR>     Mercy, Mercy<BR>     Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man<BR>May 11-12, 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood<BR>     Satisfaction<BR>     Good Times<BR>     Cry To Me<BR>     The Spider And The Fly<BR>     One More Try<br />The UK version was released Sep 24, 1965 but with the addition of She Said Yeah, Talkin' Bout You, Oh Baby, Heart Of Stone, and I'm Free.  The UK release did not include The Last Time, I'm All Right, Satisfaction, Play With Fire, Spider And The Fly, or One More Try.  Also of interest, the UK Out Of Our Heads used the same artwork as the US release of December's Children.<br />This information comes from &quot;It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones&quot; by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.
0451528018|4.0|Recommendation<br /> I recommend this book for all advanced readers.  This book uses hard to understand words like mire. I thing this book is for all high school students that enjoy reading.  I think this book shouldn't be recommended for people 13 or lower. In this paragraph, it shows how hard this book is to read. \\"The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds and of Impressing them with one's own character and ideals, was very dear to me.\\" They also describe with great detail. \\"I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction, and banked itself up like a wall on the side of us, low, but thick and well defined. The moon shown on it, and it looked like a giant ice field.\\" I have come to the conclusion that all high school students should read this challenging book.
B00005ATQG|4.0|\\"How did they ever make a movie of Lolita?\\" asked the original tagline of Stanley Kubrick's 1962 screen adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial classic novel.  The answer: they didn't.<br />Sure, film and novel share many of the same characteristics.  But within this loose framework there are a boatload of differences between the Kubrickian \\"Lolita\\" and the Nabokovian \\"Lolita\\".  Don't get me wrong, though.  I am not accusing Kubrick of trashing Nabokov's vision.  In fact, Nabokov wrote the screenplay for the film version.  But I am pointing out that, despite their claims at having overcome impossible hurdles to make the film, \\"Lolita\\", as written, could never have been filmed in 1962.  Kubrick and Co., however, did the best they possibly could.<br />So what, exactly, do they miss?  Well, the most glaring example is that they cut short when it comes time to show the least bit of physical affection between Lo and Humbert Humbert, never mind the more explicit intimacy.  Whether it came from external pressures or internal pragmatism, the film does its best to imply contact between HH and Lo, rather than show it.  The often cited shot of HH holding Charlotte in his arms while looking longingly at a picture of Lo on the bedside table over Charlotte's shoulder is a good example of this.<br />But the biggest thing missing, and the only editorial decision they made that I feel harms the film, is that HH's psychology, why he desires a 12 (changed for the movie to 14) year old girl, is never explained.  No mention is ever made of his childhood crush Annabel.  And there is only one brief reference to his coining of the term 'nymphet' which resulted from this crush.  The film Humbert's pedophilia seems to have appeared, fully formed, the first moment he saw Lolita sunbathing in the backyard.  Although his actions are largely unforgivable, an effort to explain them may have served the film better.  Still, this is but a minor quibble in a film that, while not painstakinglyfaithful to its source material, at least gets the spirit and tone just right.<br />A lot of credit is due to Nabokov (with Kubrick's help), for constructing a screenplay that retains the literary prose style of his novel (its strength) while adding and shaping and reconstructing the novel's story (its weakness) into a strong cinematic narrative.  Nabokov delights in tossing in names of people and places that appear to explicitly to judge the characters.  Lo spends a summer at 'Camp Climax'.  A hotel clerk is named 'George Swine'.  The night nurse at the hospital where Lo is taken ill is called 'Nurse Fromkiss'.  These deft touches (deft as a sledgehammer) further prove the notion, one I though all along, that \\"Lolita\\" doesn't take itself seriously.  It's an absurd story, and should be taken as such.<br />This absurdity is best portrayed in Peter Sellers' performance.  Or rather, performances.  Like he does in \\"Dr. Strangelove\\", Sellers basically plays three parts for Kubrick here.  In each, Sellers' prodigious ability to disappear into a role is put on full display.  His Claire Quilty is a credible American television writer, bored by his own celebrity and powerful enough to get away with a whole lot of mischief.  Quilty is a man of many disguises, one offshoot being the rambling, paranoid hotel guest, who tries every trick in the book to share more of HH's (and, by association, Lo's) company.  Another offshoot is the delicious Dr. Zempf, ostensibly the psychological counselor at Lo's school, who pays HH one wonderfully madcap visit at his home.  It's only one scene, but \\"Dr. Zempf\\" nearly steals the film, as Sellers, it appears, does a genius stream-of-conscious improv that befuddles HH and, quite possibly, the audience too.<br />Sue Lyon, as the nymphet around whom the story revolves, is a lot older than Lo was in the book.  Well, two years older.  But when those two years are between 12 and 14, it makes a big difference.  Her Lolita is conscious of her power, and, as the film goes along, is more willing to use and abuse it to her advantage.  She, at times, can also be a rather bland presence.  There's a lot of emptiness behind her eyes, and I can't yet figure out of this is a drawback or a boon to her character.  Still, Lyon has an untapped quality to her that gives her a realistic quality despite her mostly amateurish acting.<br />James Mason, as Humbert, has the suave but weathered looks and the English gentility that the character requires.  He's humourous and charming, if a bit shy, during the film's first half.  But Mason ably degenerates into a... well... a degenerate as the second half begins.  The aspect of Mason that's most suited to bringing HH to the big screen is his voice.  Put to good use as the villain in Hitchcock's \\"North by Northwest\\", where it's rolling lilt perfectly conveyed that character's evil, here it manages to be both suave and creepy.  HH is nothing if not suave and creepy, and Mason captures that perfectly.<br />This being a Kubrick movie, you'd expect a lot of flashy, but necessary, camera work.  Besides the opening scene, his camera is reserved.  \\"Lolita\\", for the most part, is staged like a play.  The camera sits still and looks, capturing lengthy scenes of dialogue like a voyeur.  It's a technique that works very well, for \\"Lolita\\" is nothing if not a forbidden entertainment.<br />While generally considered one of Kubrick's lesser works, it does mark the end of his early, pulpy films, and sets the stage for his later, more literary \\"masterpieces\\".  The first time Kubrick deigned to adapt a book to film, a method that would later yield the grand \\"successes\\" of  \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", and \\"The Shining\\", \\"Lolita\\" is as much a success as the prude times allowed it to be.  Which is to say, ultimately, an unqualified one.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Normally I hate movies.  Most of them [stink].  This one was great.  It had everything.  Double crossing russians.  Bare knuckle boxing.  Pig feeding gangsters.<br />Basically it came down to two interconnecting stories.  One centers around underground boxing.  The other follows a stolen diamond.  <br />It's chuck full of memorable characters and comedy.
B00003CXAT|5.0|A few movies I've seen in my short time on earth, I call them &quot;movie epics.&quot; Those that top that list are Men In Black, Titanic, and Twister. But the movie that easily surpasses those three films is the epic of all major movie epics, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park. <br /> The plot is known to almost everyone. A brilliant scientist, John Hammond, discovers a process that is able to bring dinosaurs back to life, and succeeds in doing so. He soon has a giant setup on a secluded island, where he plans to begin a sort of dinosaur park. Hammond invites a group of scientists, archeologists, and his two grandchildren to be the first ones to experience Jurassic Park, but when a scientist who works with the park screws something up, the dinosaurs are let free. And everyone must fight for their lives.<br />   Jurassic Park is the truest thrill ride you can get out of a movie. Although it takes an hour to set everything up, the second hour is when the action begins and barely lets down. The story by Michael Crichton, from beginning to end, is a well thought out and exciting story. The story was initiated very very well by director The acting is brilliant. With performances from Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenburg, Wayne Knight, Samuel L. Jackson, Joseph Mazzello, and Ariana Richards. All performances were right on the mark. I remember being a little kid, and actually looking up to Sam Neill's characters, having a crush on Laura Dern's, and relating to Joseph Mazello's and Ariana Richard's. And the special effects. Never had, or have I been so convinced. They still seem to surpass today's standards. The dinosaurs looked so incredibly real. Whether they were CGI or animatronics. Very awesome.<br /> The DVD presentation is a mentionable one. The picture and audio  transfers are amazing. I actually found myself yelling at the T-Rex for making so much noise. There are some nice supplements. We get plenty of info on the animatronics and EFX of the movie. There's a behind the scenes deal, and a neat dino encyclopedia complete with sound effects. The menus for the dvd are neat too.<br /> Jurassic Park was absolute fun as a kid, but now, as a 17 year old, I'm able to laugh at the grown up jokes and enjoy the actual piece of cinema from the viewpoints of looking at acting and directing. Yet, I still find myself getting hyped up for any scene dealing with the T-Rex or raptors. Always will.
078322804X|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining film, over and over again.  Obviously these guys, Dan Ackroyd and the late John Belushi are having a great time.  They took to the big screen a great \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit and white blues afficionados \\"Joliet\\" Jake and his brother Elwood Blues.<br />Upon Jake's release from prison, he and his brother get together and reunite their band.  The purpose is to raise money for the orphanage where they grew up.  The task is sufficiently bumbled for them to engender the wrath of the Chicago and Illinois police and the Nazi party.  We get extended car chases, random destruction and more general disarray than any other two or three<BR>films need.<br />But it is the music which makes the film and the musicians making it.  Super performances by John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and of course, the Godfather of Soul as Rev. Cleophus James (who shows Joliet Jake the Light in a rollicking church service).   They are backed by the BAND, comprised of Steve Cropper and Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn (of Booker T and the M.G.'s, Murphy Dunne, Willie Hall, Tom Malone, Lou Marinni, Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy and \\"Mr. Fabulous\\" trumpeter Alan Rubin. <br />Great music, more than a few laughs.  We don't need much more.
0316666343|5.0|I have never offered a review on a book - and I read a great deal....but the moment that I closed this book, I walked over to my computer to share my thoughts with others who crave great novels.<br />When I first read the jacket of this book, I was drawn to the story...but worried that I wouldn't be able to handle the book emotionally.  A narrative account from the voice of a murdered child - it seemed like overwhelming territory.<br />But Alice Sebold somehow finds a way to help the reader get beyond the horror of the unthinkable, and follow the books hero as she goes on to share her story about &quot;life after life.&quot;  For anyone who has ever felt that they are being &quot;watched over&quot; by a loved one who has passed away, this book offers a extraordinary journey for the imagination.<br />At the same time, the story doesn't minimize the experience of those who are grieving.  The family, the friends, the community...this is no fairy tale - the moment in time that took this young girl's life forever changes those who loved her.  <br />As I read the last page, I found myself not wanting to say goodbye to Susie Salmon too.  Through Alice Sebold's novel, Susie teaches us that our lives go on after we have lost someone we love, but that we can never really say &quot;goodbye.&quot;  Our loved ones remain in our hearts forever.<br />I'm very glad I had the courage to read it.  It will remain one of my all-time favorite novels.  (be warned - I couldn't put it down, and read over 300 pages in two days! - I good vacation book!!)
6301777387|5.0|Whether it is the PG or R rated version, the classic anti-war comedy MASH is still a barrel of laughs. Not only was it an excellent film about the madness of war, it was also a comedy full of zany hysterics, and a social comment about the United States and England being involved in a war that neither country had no business being involved in. The 1970 film came out at a time when the United States was being blown apart in political and social upheaval, the massacre at Kent State University erupted, and films like Patton, Tora.Tora.Tora, Kelly's Heroes, The Ballad Of Cable Hogue, The Cheynne Social Club, Start the Revolution Without Me, Beneath The Planet Of The Apes, the re-releases of 2001:A Space Odyssey and The Wild Bunch, along with the X - rated comedy Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls, were hitting the big screens all across the nation.<br />Director Robert Altman, along with a cast that consists of Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Sally Kellerman, Rene Auberjonois, Robert Duvall, Fred Williamson, Gary Burghoff, and countless others make their mark on cinema history, with a film that really hits the subject of war on the dot. Not only is it an excellent film with explosive moments, it is also a film that pokes fun at the current state of war, and what people will do to survive such brutal madness.<br />If you enjoy war films and comedies, then come pay the MASH 4077th a visit. Not only is the film a classic, it is a film that started the Emmy-Award winning television series that made entertainment history.
B00002E23E|1.0|This DVD was the biggest dissapointment to myself and a few friends who also 'Could Not Wait' to see and hear &quot;Zeppelin's 'Song Remains Remains the Same on DVD. They really should have released it with a different title like 'The Sound Remains the Same'. Actually if you like [I repeat, 'Like'] Led Zeppelin's music and you never saw the 'T.S.R.T.S.'on Video, buy it because you will enjoy it. But if you love Led Zeppelin as much as I do. And you waited for the DVD because you knew that you were going to get a Briliant/Redone/5.1 Digital Sound or maybe even a DTS Version, Save your Money and don't even rent it! It will only bring you more Heartache of being let down by a Lazy Jimmy Page AGAIN! Anyone who has seen the Video once, twice or over 50 times are not going to get anything better on the DVD! SAVE YOUR MONEY Zeppelin Fans. And just hope and pray that Jimmy Page will take the Original Masters and dust them up frame by frame for better Sound and Vision. But then again, we all are still waiting for the '10 CD '1968 to 1980' ALL LIVE BOX-SET' that was supposed to come out about 18 Years ago? Keep your Eyes and Ears out for the Live Recordings [CD, Video and DVD] that you CANNOT buy in your local Record Store or Record Chain Stores because of Legal Technicalities. But hey, if Jimmy and Robert [and even Jonsey too] will not Give the Fans What They Want, we have to get them elsewhere. Peace and Rock On, Robert

0380820846|4.0|Rest assured I will keep your identity a secret even though it is already exposed by popular romance novelist Julia Quinn on her latest effort Romancing Mr. Bridgerton that chronicles the love chapter between Penelope Featherington and the much-sought after bachelor Colin Bridgerton. I ardently recommend you this book which features your scintillating reports on the beau monde of the ton and the explosive pursuit by the ton to unmask you. Not to mention the nefarious Cressida Twombley trying to impersonate your highness in an avaricious scheme to get Lady Danbury's ... prize.<br />All these is secondary to the vibrant protagonist Penelope who charms with self-effacing humour and a heart of gold. She matures from an awkward debutante to a confident spinster while secretly yearning for the suave Colin who came back after slaking his wanderlust. He observes a new Penelope with robust intelligence and finds an inexplicable affinity with her. Love thunders in unexpectedly but the secret buried in Penelope (which I am sure you would surely know with your astuteness) threatens their nascent romance. <br />It is a most unexceptional book because it deviates from the trend of \\"throwing the bedroom door open\\" ubiquitous in romance novels nowadays. Bolstering on wits and plenty of heart (and lots of speculation and snooping on your identity), the relationship of love grows from secret admiration to platonic and to even trust and sacrifice. It calls upon the couple to confront their insecurities in order to arrive at their happy ending. One thing lacking though was the book dominated with your exploits and under-developed Colin's sudden affection for Penelope as a result.<br />It is with regret that I am apprised of your retirement. Never mind though - this book will serve to relive your memories on your infamous escapades. Gleefully intertaining with irreverent humour, it has been long that a romance book can rival the entertainment that only your publications can provide. I believe that Julia Quinn will earn my fanaticism as well as yours.
6305428042|5.0|I have no idea why critics don't like this film or why it flopped in the box office.  Actually i ran this at my theatre and we did terrific business with this film.Now it has become a Halloween tradition in my house. It's a great movie. Just look at the cast! Three very talented ladies of the stage and screen. The music is beautiful, great setting, very funny and then of course like all Disney movies the part that tugs at your heart just before the happy ending.I recommend this film to everyone that enjoys the Halloween season. For me it's the start of the wonderful festive holidays to come.  And speaking of,,,,check out Mrs. Santa Claus for another GREAT holiday movie.

Prison Song 8/10 Only an 8 because I am comparing it to the other songs on the cd that are better. But a great song non the less. <BR>2 Needles 9/10 One of the best songs on the album.

B00003CXV4|5.0|Knowing Keanu from the stage where he got his start, it really doesn't matter what he does.  He can just stand in front of a camera for two hours and i'll give him a outstanding review.  But seriously, he's one of Hollywoods most gifted actors. Whatever he touches turns to gold even if the critics don't think so.This is a good film. A film with sole and heart. Not as good as the original but seeing Keanu is always a good thing. Just sit back, relax and enjoy this one. It's just plain nice.

B000002UD0|1.0|You wanna know my theory about John Lennon? I reckon that being the focus of so much adulation from an uncritical audience made him swing violently between delusions of grandeur (&quot;Imagine&quot;) and self-disgust (&quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;). The psychic effort of it pretty much exhausted him, until eventually he settled into the zombified equilibrium of making bland, worthless mid 70's solo albums like this thing.
B0000640VO|5.0|The most compelling part of AMELIE is the way that it tantalises the eyes.  While the viewer knows in his or her heart that Paris never really looked this clean or beautiful, the film nevertheless manages to delight every second of its 122 minute run time.  The colors, the light, the imagery, the fantasy:  all blends together to entrance and excite the viewer.  In this way, the film harkens back to the earliest films made, those by another resident of Paris, Lumiere.  There was no real point to those little films except to startle and delight the viewer, and in that sense the film follows very much in that tradition.<br />Audrey Tautou is a wonder!  I hope that she makes very many films.  She is utterly adorable, and a delight to look at with her black hair and apparently matching eyes.  With a lesser actress, this film might have been fun to look at, but would not have engaged the viewer emotionally.  As it is, we care very much for her to find happiness in addition to helping others to find it, because we come to like her.  The rest of the cast was also very enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed Serge Merlin as &quot;The Glass Man,&quot; socalled because he has especially brittle bones.  The film conceit of having him constantly work on hyperrealistic copies of paintings of Renoir works marvelously, though he shouts so loudly a couple of times that I was surprised that he didn't break a couple of ribs.<br />Everything in this film conspires to make it an enjoyable experience.  Visually, as I have mentioned, it is utterly stunning.  The cinematography and the art direction is just extraordinary.  I loved the soundtrack, and for the hour or two after seeing this the strains of the accordion kept playing through my head.<br />All in all, this is as enjoyable a piece of eye candy as I have encountered in a long, long time.  It is as visually arresting as another recent film set in Paris, MOULIN ROUGE, but I personally found the film as a whole far more enjoyable.
B00000DFSK|4.0|&quot;Best of 1980-1990&quot; is an excellent one-disc sampler of U2's best years, and probably all that the casual fan will need.  All of their biggest and most familiar hits are here.<br />However, this sampler also has a couple of weaknesses.  First, Island apparently tried to bulk-up the disc by adding a few unnecessary unknowns (e.g. &quot;Bad&quot;).  The casual fans who will be buying this CD don't want those songs.  Second, the listener should be warned that U2's sweeping guitar anthems, which sound so great on the radio, can become rather tiresome when heard one after another, after another, etc.<br />In other words, all the essentials are here, but it might be a lot to swallow in one listen.

B00005R2M3|5.0|I love this CD! It is absolutely the perfect mix for me!! It has got so much of an unusual variety and that is what I am stuck on these days. I love the way she exaggerates her voice the way she does. It is the most vivacious singing that I have ever heard. It is so unique compared to the way Alanis Morsiette does it and the singer from the Cranberries. With this CD, I find that when talking to people about it that they either like it or they don't. It is so different of a style that it just happens that way. I think it is a beautiful style though and Shakira is going to get better and better with it. She has made me feel proud to be stuck on Latin music also the language itself. Spunky lyrics, yes....and they are irresistable to think about!

B000065V3M|4.0|I caught this movie late night on tv a little while back and had heard of it before but somehow I wasn't aware that Tim Burton was directing it.  I thought it was a big joke when i first started watching Ed Wood.  He had an outgoing personality and he tells someone he wore panties in the war to show someone he knows about transvestites in order to get a job.  I wasn't sure if this was all true, if it was written for screen or if he actually said these things and did them or lied.  The movie making scenes are hillarious, Ed Wood claims that audiences won't care about the little details and only at the big picture.  This philosophy lets him put people that aren't in the scene go in to help someone up or do anything else.  Strings that are easily visible and horrible special effect ofcoarse make all of his films B-movie classics to some people these days.  Seen by many the worst director of all time Ed Wood certainly tells the offbeat story of a man, angora sweaters and film.
6304097050|4.0|This video however flawed contains in my opinion the best boxing footage you will ever see. This is simply because as a diehard boxing fan Sugar Ray Robinson is the closest thing to the perfect boxer that I have ever seen. Although if you were to use one word to describe Sugar Ray I think the perfect word would be: dynamic. This is because as this video will show you Sugar Ray was as dynamic a person as he was a fighter. Although most of Sugar Ray's fights in his prime no longer exist this one shows many of his greatest battles (nearly all of which take place in Sugar Ray's thirties).<br />RIP Sugar Ray you're still the greatest.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Call this one a guilty pleasure if you must but \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" is one of the funnest movies to come out in past years. Explaining the plot to this film is almost meaningless because this film is simply not about plot. It's all about the visuals here. From the sexy girls to fast cars, from the muscular men to the great racing scenes and big explosions, this one is a viusal feast. It's the only movie in the past year that I saw twice at the theater and that is simply because the visuals do not get old. I mean, it was even nominated for an AFI award for Best Cinematography.<br />This is the perfect movie for a kick-back, no-thinking Friday night. It's definitely a \\"Boys Night Out\\" movie though, even though I do some girls who enjoy it. The acting is credible (although all they really need to do is look beautiful), the story movies along and the cinematography is excellent. Highly recommended, just don't be expecting an Oscar-winner.<br />NOTE: The DVD is excellent too, containing a lot pf really interesting features. I found the article the most interesting of these as the rest seem to be just things left on the editing room floor.
B000067CPX|5.0|who would have thought that the chili peppers, after putting out three cds that sold nothing, selling 9 million records with bloodsugarsexmagik, losing a member, waiting 4 years to put out another, and then waiting another four years to put out californication which sold 13 million records and won a grammy for album of the year could put out another awesome cd? well they did. you can expect to hear 6 or 7 of the songs on this cd on the radio. my favorites are this is the place, dosed, minor thing, and midnight. the only song that sucks is cabron. i don't care what you say 'cause it sucks bad. it's got a stupid \\"latin\\" vibe which doesn't mix good with the chili peppers or any form of intelligent music.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This album was authentic.  It was orginial.  Singer Corey Taylor reaches boundaries within his mind and life that singers of music are afraid to reach now-a-days.<br />His voice goes from melodic to brutal screaming to fast rapping so quick, my head spins.  The lyrics are nicely written, and the music is amazing.  Fast, good drumming, crunching guitars... Not to mention the hidden track is hilarious as you hear porn music in the background and them hinting at what they're watching...<br />I think you should definately pick this up if you're looking for something to get you through any emotion.  It touches all dark depths of anything.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is truly the first musical of this era. It proves that the genre can in fact be adapted to the silver-screen. One of the characteristics of this film that makes it so unique is the hilariously cartoonish way of providing comic relief. This DVD is a must-own. I especially enjoyed the special features that take you &quot;behind the red curtain&quot; to see the great lengths the film-makers had to go to to see their dreams realized.
B00000G5VI|5.0|If you ever ever ever manage to put your hands onto this, don't let it go. To put it simply, this is the best record Bowie has ever done, miles ahead of Ziggy Stardust or Low, and if you miss this you'll regret the rest of your life.<br />The disc was released in 1993, following the sort-of-commercially-successful Black Tie White Noise, and was a total flop when it came to the sales (#87 in all-Bowie loving UK!). Moreover, Buddha was released in the US in 1995 to coincide with 1.Outide with the artwork of Bowie sitting on a metal couch. In about ten years, the US version will be priceless. <br />The title track contains Bowie's most compelling vocals of the decade, plus (surprise!) an actual melody, so absent in most of the Dame's work in the 90's. Sex And The Church is a complete opposite with deadpan chanting vocals, showing how minimal and still brilliant Bowie track could be. The two great instrumentals, The Mysteries and Ian Fish UK Heir, Bowie's and Kizilcay's experiment with slowed down fragments of the title track are thankfully reissued on the All Saints compilation. They are moody, ambient and sound as fresh ten years after as they did in 1993. Bleed Like A Craze, Dad is one-of-a-kind funk with crazy lyrics (\\"shine, shine, shine - bleed like craze dad!) fortunately enough not yet discovered by omniremixing DJs. Finally, Strangers When We Meet is the only song so far Bowie has officially issued in two studio albums (second time on 1.Outside), getting a much more plastic and electronic treatment compared to the 1995 version.<br />These brief descriptions of the tracks no way do justice to this album. It must be seen as a whole, and the whole is very compelling. Bowie uses at least 5 genres (classic rock, techno, soft-pop, ambient and funk), uses samples, slows tapes, plays his vocals back, does most of the instruments on the album, recycles fragments of his classics (All The Madmen, Space Oddity, Look Back in and Under Pressure most notably), writes lyrics worth William Burroughs (a deciphered version of the lyrics simply does not exist in any form), and at the same time has fun, shall we say, with no strings of high expectations attached. <br />This is simply a timeless record, superseding millions of better sellers. It is essential to anyone who has a basic appreciation of post-ABBA music.
B0000214F3|4.0|The movie itself's great and it really worth 3 long hours to watch it. Also, it makes u to think about the inner meaning of love, death and life. Anthony Hopkins did play a good job during the 3 hours but disappointingly, Brad could be much better in the part of being Death and I wondered why Death don't know what peanuts butter is. The ending's those of hollywood types and quite apt. However, the fireworks're surprisingly good and I love the coffee shop scene very much....at least Brad has his brain on his head during the scene. He's totally a robot after the first 40 minutes.<BR>In conclusion, the movie's quite good but if the director can edit this movie more convincingly, \\"meet Joe Black\\" would sure be one of my best movies.
0764113496|5.0|To get beyond basic alphabet and numbers in Russian, you need a comprehensive dictionary, an intermediate textbook, and THIS BOOK.  The dictionary defines, but it can't do much when lyou want to use the word in a sentence.  Russian is a language that requires native English-speakers to think differently than English, French, or Spanish.  It does not come naturally-- there are no shortcuts to conjugation, no consistencies in the grammar &quot;rules&quot;.  Make your life easier and invest in this book.
6301966015|5.0|This is a classic film about two days in a fashion photographer's life in London in the 1960's in which a mystery occurs.  For those of us who are fascinated with photographing various subjects that we encounter, posed as well as candid, and have some appreciation of the process of how the image goes from camera to paper in a darkroom, this film is very interesting.  However, one aspect of the tape version is very disappointing.  There is a scene in approximately the middle of the picture when Hemmings is wrestling with two girls in his studio.  This scene has obviously been censored.  In the original release of the film, this scene was much longer and had additional action occurring.  The censoring in the tape version is obvious because for a brief period, Hemmings has a different hairstyle and hair color.  Very disappointing!  Perhaps if it were put on DVD, the original version of the film could be included.  Even with this most unfortunate censoring, the film is still a classic and I am likewise surprised that it is not yet on DVD.
0790749998|4.0|Awesome film, probably the best of jet's films made by a american team, it falls short of a 5 as it is not as good as films such as twin warriors. Aaliyaah is an awesome actor, its very sad to hear that she could not star in the matrix 2 after dying in a plane crash.<br />But this film, actually has a decent story line with good fight sequences, russell wong, the guy he fights at the end is amazing im surprised he does not have a bigger part.<br />This is a film you should see it shows that jet li can act. i would give this 4 and a half stars not just 4.

B000002JNN|3.0|This is close to the axe grinding AC/DC I grew up with in the 1970's or 80's. Gone are the days of albums FULL of rocking in-yer-face tunes that get your blood pumping and make you wanna shake & bounce your head like that angry school boy Angus (i.e. \\"Highway To Hell\\", \\"High Voltage\\", \\"Let There Be Rock\\", \\"Powerage\\", \\"Back In Black\\", etc). While this release does feature some great hits in \\"Thunderstruck\\" (still a later day favorite AC/DC song of mine), \\"Moneytalks\\" and \\"Are You Ready\\"... the rest of this album is weak filler at best. \\"Mistress For Christmas\\" has got to be one of the worst songs the band has put out in the past 2 decades. \\"Got You By The Balls\\" is a close 2nd. Silly sexually oriented lyrics, uninspired guitar solos and very basic ho-hum drumming by Chris Slade (Phil Rudd where are you?). Outside of the above mentioned 3 \\"good\\" tunes, very little here is memorable. As for the song writing, maybe Angus & Malcom are getting tired. Then again, I think of a rock band doing the same thing over and over, album after album... for the better part of 30 years... dare I say this sounds like the previous 2 releases as well as the 3-4 afterwards. The production is flat on the original release (look for the new remastered digi-pack in 2004) and the CD length clocks in at just over 46 minutes. Good effort - just not a classic one (3.5 stars).
7119005901|5.0|I first became intrigued with the Three Kingdoms's historical events when I played the game Dynasty Warriors 2 for PS2. Afterwards I was desperately searching to find the best novel translation and finally bought the 4-volume box set translated by Moss Roberts which is the UNABRIDGED version(make sure to get this edition as it tells the whole story w/o leaving anything out).I then set out to explore the 2200+ pages of Chinese history and I must say, it was a fascinating experience. I initially grasped what was going to happen in time but there was so much other details to the story and idealisms portrayed. Leadership, loyalty, heroism, military tactics and warfare, treason, and even romance play such a significant role in this epic novel. \\"The empire long united, must divide\\" and \\"the empire long divided, must unite\\" pretty much opens and closes the novel perfectly. Heroes such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, and Huang Gai portray such loyalty that it would be kind of hard to imagine in today's society. From the other reviews I've read, most people think Liu Bei (Xuande) is the protaganist of the novel and this seems very true since Roberts lauds Bei's characteristics and portrays Cao Cao of the evil and cunning type. Personally, I think anyone can choose their personal protaganist and for me that would be Zhao Yun because of his undisputed bravery and loyalty. Another character that I admired was probably Zhuge Liang for his awe-aspiring military tactics. Zhuge was the best strategist of his time and he wrote several books on warfare but unfortunately, most were destroyed but you can still buy one of his famous books, \\"The Art of War.\\" Warning, spoiler ahead:<BR>                                                                 This book has its sad moments particularly when someone important or someone who contributed a lot to his lord dies. You'll feel sympathetic towards those who fought hard as well as the ones who died. When the book starts, it's during the impending collapse of the Han then around 220 is when the real three kingdoms come into play: Shu, Wu, and Wei. It's sort of like a battle to the death of who would emerge victorious and indeed there was. Military tactics are exploited on each side and betrayal is widespread. In the end, it would be Sima Yi's family who would unite China under one rule, the Jin Dyansty.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is a truly wonderous recording.  Wilco have evolved beautifully into an introspective and intelligent rock band. Jeff Tweedy's lyrics are unmatched by his contemporaries and the band's ear for the eclectic is unprecedented in this era of popular music.  Without breaking down each track I will have to say this album kept me enthralled from start to finish.  There are no throw-away tracks here.  Simply pure sonic enjoyment.  Oh yeah, Wilco kills 'em live!
B000066NW0|5.0|After seeing Avril's video on TRL, I knew I had to get her CD. When I bought it, I was dumbfounded. She has very profound lyrics and great guitar skills to boot. Her first and second singles are excellent, and the whole CD is pure gold. You MUST buy this!

B00000F5J5|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi has often been compared... to Baraka, though I think the former is much better. Koyaanisquatsi has something to say about the current direction in which humanity is moving, with specific reference to fast paced urban  life (large sectors of the population are shown working like hives of bees,often performing mind-numbing jobs  The real meaning of this movie is up to the viewer to decide for him or herself; the creators just point us in certain directions. Often the really appalling images,such as traffic jams, are accompanied by sublimely energetic music by Philip Glass (which makes being stuck in traffic seem strangely wonderful). The pace of the movie begins slowly, but it steadily picks up, such that after 45 minutes the pace is absolutely  frantic, with music that is now exceptionally lively and (dare I say it?)cheerful. You may even want to get up and dance! If you can only afford one wordless documentary this year, I'd go for Koyaanisqatsi.
B0000640VO|5.0|I missed this in the theaters and just saw the DVD.  Wow, is this a good movie, most likely the cutest, most adorable little movie I've ever seen.  Not a kids movie at all (Strong sexual content, but only for very brief moments.  This is a French movie after all) Audrey Tautou has all the wonderment of a small child, yet in the last scene transforms into a glorious beautiful woman.  Wonderful cinematography, a sweet plot, infinitely likable characters.  It's a fable and fairy tale for adults.  I don't giggle, but the first 15 minutes had me te-he'ing non stop.  The movie just makes you feel good, and it's a wonderful piece of work.
0380789019|4.0|Its been quite some time since I read anything besides sci-fi and when I finally decided to try a few Gaiman novels I was quite pleased. Neverwhere is an excellent adventure fantasy story and definetely brings the reader to another place. Gaiman touches on many genres and throws them into his works. He is a great story teller and he will only get better and better. I think I enjoyed American Gods a bit more but both are excellent stories which have turned me away from Bester and Clarke for a while.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Simon Wells' \\"Time Machine\\" is an ambitious F/X laden re-make of the original sci-fi classic starring Rod Taylor as a time traveller who witnesses the destruction of civilization and travels 800,000 years into the future to find that mankind has survived a planetary catastrophe, but has in the process evolved into two speperate species, the submissive Eloi and the cannabalistic Morlocks.  This new adaptation sticks closer to the 1960 film far more than H.G. Wells' classic novel, but despite the great sets, special effects, and Samantha Mumba's skimpy outfit, something is desperately missing from this outting.<br />Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegan, an eccentric physics professor from turn-of-the-century New York City who becomes obsessed with building a time machine after the tragic death of his fiance.  Despite his attempts to travel back in time to save his love from death, he finds that he cannot change the past, and thus embarks on a journey into the future to find the answer as to why.  After a brief stop-over in 2030 NYC, he witnesses the destruction of civilization as the Moon, blown asunder by a nuclear accident, rains down upon the earth and virtually wipes out mankind.  He accidentally travels forward 800,000 years into the future only to find that, as in the original, humans have now evolved into two seperate species.  It is here that the film loses it's energy and becomes bogged down in typical action fare and overblown special effects that tend to overpower and kill the story.  While undeniably amazing, unfortunately, special effects do not make a good story.  The film also suffers from a few big plot holes that are hard to ignore.  For example, after only what is essentially a few hours of time travelling, Hartdegen seems to have completely forgotten his obsessive love for his dead fiance and falls for the beautiful Eloi woman Mara.  Would someone who was so driven and grief-striken as our hero seems to be for the loss of his true love manage to totally forget about her in the course of a few hours or days?  The film also feels as if it loses pacing in the middle, as if needed scenes are missing.  Certain scenes ARE missing regarding the destruction of Earth during the fall of the Moon.  These key scenes were cut in post-production after September 11 because they showed NYC being destroyed in a fiery rain of meteorites.  I feel that these scenes may have helped add something to the film as it is never really made clear what happened that caused the destruction of the earth, as we are basically given a quick shot of the break-up of the Moon and the chaos that ensues, but the emotional tie-in that SHOULD be there is lost.  In the original film, when Rod Taylor witnesses the destruction of his beloved London during a atomic attack, we feel the terror and awe of the destruction of all civilization, as it truly is the end of the world as we know it.  \\"The labor of centuries...gone in an instant!\\"  It illustrates man's frailty and transience in this world, how we hang precariously from a weak branch despite our belief in our own invulnerablity. But here, we get no such emotionally charge event, nothing to show the terror that anyone who witnesses the anihilation of the world as he knows it would experience.  In losing this we lose something else that seems to leave the story lifeless as it degenerates into a Planet of the Apes rehash.<br />Despite a strong opening, the Time Machine loses its momentum in the last half and we are left, once again, wanting something more.to totally forget about her in the course of a few hours or days?

0380789035|5.0|This was my first Gaiman novel and my favorite to this point. More in depth then Neverwhere, American Gods is another excellent journey, this time through America. I read mostly sci-fi but Gaiman is an all around well crafted author who bridges a gap between many genres. Many Many more great works to come from this amazing storyteller.
0312265859|4.0|As other reviewers have said, this is a typical Stephanie Plum novel, though her relationships are developing.  Finally we see something deeper with Ranger and with Joe.  It's a quick light read, that amuses.  It left me wanting more!
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a brilliant movie for a number of reasons.  It is beautifully shot, excellently edited and wonderfully acted.  Audrey Tautou's smile and presence made her every scene a keeper.  But perhaps the greatest reason to see this movie is the colors!  Do you remember the awestruck feeling that you felt when you saw The Wizard of Oz, when Dorothy entered Munchkinland?  Or when you first saw Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory?  There are scenes in this movie that will give you that same feeling.  It is the reason movies are made, to draw emotion from the audience and give you that rollercoaster experience...
0140288503|5.0|A brilliant example of the modern &quot;popular history&quot; style of historical writing, where the prose reads like fiction, but is actually a referenced historical report.  Thoroughly researched, skillfully written -- an excellent, fast-reading yet still scholarly sound account of an important but forgotten battle.
B00006950W|3.0|This movie starts off slow, but take heart...it takes off in a whirlwind of action.  A group of scientists, working in a secret installation known only as \\"The Hive\\", play God, experimenting on DNA and creating a mutating virus.  When an attempt is made to steal the virus, the thief unleashes the virus.  The Hive's security defenses, in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading, seals off the facility, killing all within.  A special military unit is sent to discover the reason behind the deaths at the facility, and to shut down the \\"murderous\\" main computer controlling the security defenses within the hive.  What they don't know is that the virus that was unleashed mutates the dead into nightmarish zombies.  <BR>Although the action is slow in coming, when it hits you're in for a rollercoster ride!  The movie is very true to the game.  The  zombies move exactly like those in the game, even when they are being shot.  Milla Jovovich is every bit the action heroine.  At the beginning of the movie she appears to be a helpless damsel in distress, but we soon learn that she's anything but.  And there are even some genuine surprises in the end.  <BR>My only gripe with the movie is that it reminds me all too much of Aliens.  A slow start, followed by extreme action and bloody deaths, a strong female lead.  Even the military unit reminds me of the Marines in Aliens.  The character played by Michelle Rodriguez is reminiscent of Vazquez from Aliens.  And the plot twist is also similar.  However, all-in-all this was a pretty decent movie inspired by a great video game.
B000069CWE|5.0|At first I feared that this would be a poor attempt for Linkin Park. It's pretty ballsy to make your next album a remix of the first.  After listening though, it only took once to realize that each one of these songs is completely different from it's predecessor on Hybrid Theory, whether it be through lyrics or music.  If you are a true Linkin Park fan, then you will love this album just as much as the first.  I can't say this album is better/worse than the first, it's just different.
B00005YUNY|5.0|They did it all very well!<br />This DVD really catches the atmosphere I got in the concert of last year. To me the most brilliant songs(Close to the Edge,<BR>The Gates of Delirium, Ritual)were played in a way that seems<BR>to develop the songs, the orchestra(conducted by Wilhelm Keitel,notorious name!)had certainly an added value on the songs.<br />Highly recommanded!
0316666343|1.0|As everyone else on this site, I read this book with very high hopes. It started well -and I was intrigued by the voice and character of Susie Salmon. The idea for the book is also brilliant: the voice of a victim. But after the first chapter or so, the book wanders off into the lives of undeveloped, uninteresting characters. The people are similar to television actors: very rote, predictable and identified through their sex lives. I was interested in Susie and began to feel she was being set aside so the novel could develop the romantic/sexual involvements of everyone else. This is what turned a rather bold idea into a mediocre meandering. Which is sad, because a very brave idea becomes just another formula novel of sex being the only thing really interesting to anybody. I don't know about other readers, but picking up a novel supposedly focused on the rape and murder of a child hardly sets the proper mood for \\"romance\\". Extremely disappointing.
B00003CX8J|5.0|First of all I have not read any of the Xmen comics or aware of how much this film devotes to the comics.  I did enjoy the cartoon series and was looking forward to seeing this movie at the cinemas and was not disappointed.<br />I tend to judge movies based on comic book characters differently because I expect a certain amount of corny action and story telling.<br />I was a little disapointed not to see certain characters such as Gambit, Nightcrawler, Juggernaut, The Blob, Appocolipse (I could go on and on), however I hear that more characters will be introduced in the upcoming Xmen 2.<br />Overall I thought this movie was great and like rate this review based on this fact and the DVD features.<BR> <BR>If you like good comic book character based movies then this is for you (such as Blade, Spiderman, and Batman NOT The Phantom, Spawn, or the rest of the Batman series).  However it depends on how much of a fanatic you are about the movie being faithful to the comic book it was based on.
B000069HKH|5.0|This CD is the first full CD that the Boss has released with his old mates from the E Street Band since Born in the USA... and I have to say that he hasn't lost a single step.  When I first listened to the first song from this CD I thought \\"Man, this CD doesn't sound like Bruce's older stuff at all.\\"  And to an extent it really doesn't.  I have since listened to it all the way through and I have to say, that it is truely a culmination of all of his phases and moods from Asbury Park to The Ghost of Tom Joad.  It is by far and away the most diverse and eclectic CD he has ever released.  Songs like \\"World's Apart\\" with it's Buddist/Middle Eastern vibe sit well right up against the gospel feel of \\"My City of Ruin\\".  It may take some getting used to... but if you are a Springsteen fan and you are interested in seeing Bruce's music evolve instead of stand still in 1984 then this CD will be your bread and butter.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|People say all the time the words, &quot;This is the worst movie I've ever seen!&quot;  Well I can honestly say that about this movie.  I must have missed something because it made no sence.  Its like the director had alot of creative ideas and instead of trying to create a plot, he just crammed all of these ideas and creative scenes into a movie!  I was bored out of my mind sitting through this thing.  Did you ever have a bad dream in which alot of things crazy things happened that didnt make any sence?  Thats exactly what this movie was like, a bad dream.
B000069CWE|5.0|I picked this CD up at Best Buy today, and it was better than I thought!  The 12 tracks taken from the Hybrid Theory CD have been redone beautifully, and most of them feature guests such as Aaron Lewis and Jonathan Davis.  The other 8 tracks aren't much to talk about, as they're basically 30-second musical interludes or listening to messages on Mike Shinoda's answering machine, but there are remixes of &quot;My December,&quot; &quot;High Voltage,&quot; and a track by the X-ecutioners that resembles &quot;Cure for the Itch.&quot;<br />Overall, it's a great buy, and I highly recommend it, but it would've been nice if they had a couple new songs just for the album.
B000069CWE|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out, and, It ROCKS! I usually don't like rap. I like rap rock though, and this fits the bill. For a small description of the backround for the band, if you've never heard of them, they are a rap metal band that doesn't swear. They were formerly known as Hybrid theory. <BR>Most of the songs rock better than the first CD!
B00005M91K|5.0|I wish I had been exposed to Baraka as an undergraduate in cultural anthropology.

B000069CWE|5.0|If u liked the first cd (hybrid theory) you will love this one it is all your favorite song with a fresh new sound. the old songs have other artist (such as aaron lewis of staind) And a few new songs. I like it more then the first cd. Its also an enhanced cd . it has the video for pts. of. athrty and i link to linkin park html Items  and icons. i think any true linkin park fan should rush out and buy reanamation
B00001SIES|5.0|When I first bought this album in 1999 my musical tastes were very......different than they are now.  I listened to &quot;Muscle Museum&quot; a couple of times and then put the album away.  Recently, I discovered that this is one of the greatest albums I own.  When I sat down and listened to the album in its entirety I was absolutely blown away.  The music is, in my opinion, very original, and the vocal style of Matthew Bellamy is definitely his own.  There may be a hint of Thom Yorke in his style, but I didn't hear the similarity until it was pointed out to me.  I've been a big Jeff Buckley fan for a while now, and that is who Bellamy reminds me of.  However, he definitely creates a unique sound, and a very emotional feel w/ the music.  This album is a must have for any music fanatic.  If you are wondering about purchasing the CD, try and download the song &quot;Showbiz&quot; and you will be sold.  I've just purchased The Origin of Symmetry and I'm sure it will turn out to be as good as Showbiz.
B000069CWE|5.0|This, people... this... Is an incredible piece of Music.  It is just so incredible how Linkin Park was able to alter and edit these tracks into new songs that, although they are different, are just as good as the original. I'd even dare to say that some of them are better.  Take P5HNG ME A*WY, for example.  It absolutly one of the best songs on the album.  If you truly want to hear some extremely inovative and catchy... look no further than LP's own \\"Reanimation.\\"
B000002G7E|1.0|One word for this cd: HORRIBLE. I tried to listen to this four times and hated it more with each play. I can't begin to tell you how  awful this cd is. I was reading the 5 star reviews on  here with bewilderment. Then one of these reviews calls this 'the anti- Beatles' and this person goes on to  say the Beatles are hated. It makes sense now. If you hate great  music, you'll love this cd. If you  love great music, you'll hate this cd.
B000069CWE|4.0|if you like hybird theory you will love this. Reanimation gives a good mixture of mixes of the old stuff plus new music. Incropated in the smooth beat are rap rock lyrics. This is a must have to add to any collection
B000005HLV|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever recorded, in any genre, by any artist. A true masterpiece of pure, searing evil.
B000002U9Y|3.0|Pink Floydâs second album, 1968's Saucerful of Secrets had the odds stacked against it. With main songwriter Syd Barrett out of the loop, the compositional chores were left to Waters, Wright, Mason and new guitarist (and friend of Sydâs) David Gilmour. Th e result may understandably not be quite as consistent as its predecessor Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, but it is an intriguing record nevertheless with some great moments. Gone with Mr. Barrett is the whimsy and two-minute splashes of colour. Pink Floyd se t the controls and headed into the direction which would see full fruition on albums such as Meddle and Ummagumma. The title track - a colossal experimental piece in three parts - is the flagship of this new direction; an often atonal, eerie escapade which culminates in the concluding hymn-like passage of unparalleled cheesiness. Personally I prefer the humorous jab at military pretension, Corporal Clegg (â~Mrs. Clegg you must be proud of him/Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?), the pastoral â~Remember a Dayâ, the languid, sun-drenched â~See Sawâ and the definitive version of â~Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sunâ complete with those excellent seagull sounds! Syd Barrett makes a brief appearance to contribute the closing number, the truly cosmic, â~Jugband Bluesâ which is probably the most compelling conclusion to any album bar Sgt. Pepperâs â~A Day in a Lifeâ. To sum up, then, Saucerful Of Secrets is a hotchpotch of dark, ambient experimentation and catchy 60s psychaedelia. I like it simply because it is a great document of a band tearing up its roots and heading for pastures new. And clearly loving every minute of it.Ë
B00005JL3A|5.0|If you are looking for a deep story, social commentary, or an intellectual masterpiece please look elsewhere as this title will not satisfy you. However, if like me you enjoy an over the top action movie that pulls no punches and relies on adrenaline-filled sequences that never let up then you've picked the right film.  This movie just doesn't stop, and is by far the best &quot;zombie film&quot; I have seen.  The acting is mediocre (not bad, mind you) and the characters work in the context of the film. The music is very well done, the general theme of which is borrowed heavily from the George A. Romero films.<br />Not being a fan of the game is irrelevant (I wasn't, but this film has gotten me hooked), you'll still enjoy it if you have any love of the sci-fi/action genre.  <br />This film is what it is...a rollercoaster, so turn your brain off and don't overanalyze it! Enjoy the ride!
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice centers around the Bennett family, mainly Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest of five sisters. Throughout the novel, family relations, economical issues, humiliation of making a mistake, and falling in love are thoroughly described amongst all of the characters. Three of the five sisters marry in the book while encountering pride and prejudice of position or status. The eldest daughter of the Bennetts, Jane, falls in love and marries a man named Charles Bingley. She is the second of the three daughters that marry during the story because of a delay caused by Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy who had initially made Bingley think Jane does not love him because of her poor economical status and family relations. However, it is also Darcy who later convinces Bingley to finally marry Jane out of his own love for Janeas younger sister Elizabeth. After both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth overcome their pride and prejudice against each other, they are also married. Elizabeth is the third daughter to marry. The first daughter to marry is Lydia, who foolishly elopes with the untrustworthy George Wickham whose primary intention was not to marry her, but who eventually agrees to the marriage on terms agreed to by Darcy and Bingley. The novel describes the pride and prejudice that all of the characters manage to overcome in order to live contentedly.<br />Although the language used in Pride and Prejudice was difficult for a fourteen year-old, as I kept reading it became clearer and easier to understand the 19th century speech. The womenaes rights that Austen presented were beyond her time and I developed great respect for her. The message about overcoming pride and prejudice and marrying not for money but for love was very powerful and I felt that it was appropriate to be read for a humanities class because it was closely related to the topics we have been going over in class. Overall, I thought that Pride and Prejudice was a very well written and entertaining novel.
0316666343|4.0|This is an easy-reading book that explores the first person view of the 14 year old murdered victim, Suzy.  I recommend this book for those who ever wonder what the dead thought about the living after the impact of his or her death and the years afterwards.  Also, wonders what really happened to the girls who are missing or murdered (How was the crime committed?).  I thought this book had a unique point of view of writing.  This book kept me reading and was a bit shocking in the end.  At the end, there's a sense of closure and healing of Suzy's family.
B000065U1N|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie \\"Black Hawk Down.\\" I thought it was a nice description of the events that went down in Somalia in the early 90's. It had the power needed to convey the idea that these actors were there reliving the events, rather than simply recreating them. It was good to see that this movie cared more about realism than how pretty Josh Hartnett's hair looked. The actors all looked so similar, that it was almost impossible to tell the difference. Exciting action, coupled with a bad situation gone worse, leads to an excellant movie that would have gotten a better rating...<BR>However, it is clear that a better version of DVD will be coming out later this year, packed with extras, thus making this one almost useless for stuff other than the movie. Also, i found it odd that it billed that one of the extras was a \\"theatrical trailer\\" which i assumed to be a nice preveiw of the movie. Much to my surprise, it was a commercial for \\"Spiderman\\", a movie that the distributer obviously cares much more about, which is a shame because \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a much much better film.
B000059MEK|5.0|This cd rocks! I first heard about Daft Punk through the cartoon network promotion (through the anime music videos of one more time; harder, better, faster, stronger; digital love &amp; aerodynamic) This cd is one of my favorites in my collection. My favorite songs are Face to Face, Superheroes, Harder-Better-Faster-Stronger &amp; Too Long. And why is there no comment for short circuit? I think that is a really cool song, especially in the last minute or so when it slows down. At first I did not like Too Long, but then I actually listened to the whole song...It gets much better as it continues to play..Especially half way through the song at around 4 minutes and 45 seconds when you here the other tune fading in while the &quot;too long's&quot; are fading out. I like every song on this cd, seriously. I think you should definetly get this is if you like, techno, pop, dance or funk.. <br />Thankyou,<BR>*Vapor*
0345440900|1.0|The author was a baby nurse (whose own children were tended by someone else) She has advice about everything but little of it is founded on fact -- she actually says that scientific research is \\"propaganda\\". I was looking for mainly ideas on how to calm my baby and help her sleep better, but mainly found ways to take better care of myself without regard to my baby&#8217;s needs, which is an odd approach for a parent to take. I found several books that do a better job of combining research and common sense: The No-Cry Sleep Solution and Our Baby: The First Year.
0316666343|4.0|I really loved the book and give it 4 stars only because of some character flaws that made me feel a little empty at the end (especially Susie's mom).  Alice Sebold said some beautiful things about death and how the dead hold unto you until their through with you.  I liked that and won't forget it.  She also gave me insight into the mind of the serial killer when she said he had \\"wild and bottomless lust.\\"  In many ways she writes like Joyce Carol Oates. Very observant and deep. I will remember Susie and the horrible Mr. Harvey for quite a while.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie falls into the ever expanding category of movies that are terrible from a non bais point of view but somehow deemed great by hype and good marketing.<br />It is impossible to feel anyting for the main character because when you look at everything from a sane person's perspective the main character is still just silicon and a battery.  Call me heartless or what you will, but I would feel nothing (but fustration) if my computer's hard drive failed no matter how inspiring the daily quotes it spits out are.<br />It is obvious that this kid was not programmed to love - unconditionaly that is - but rather was programmed to be insecure about love.  This came across as very annoying.  Mabye a bug in the code.  I wonder if there will be new firmware coming out?<br />Oh, adults make the connection, or in this case do not make the connection, that it doesn't matter - after all its just a robot.  This movie does far more damage to children.  Children recieve the message that they are replacable when inconvinient (twice).  Always nice to see a children's movie depict a future of prostitute robots.<br />The bottom line is this.  You SHOULD NOT feel anything for the boy and SHOULD feel something for the mother.  The focus should have been on real people.  I found that 'Teddy' was the only redeeming thing in this movie - he gets the one star.<br />Should we cry about a robot that has the best lithium battery not yet know to man being trapped in ice for a long time?  Should I feel sorry for it?  I know that I feel a little guilty when I think about that 386 that is rotting in a dump somewhere.  I mean ... thats no way for a 386 to live is it?
B0000640VO|4.0|Wow. This movie was so unusual, the visual style was so lush and gorgeous, the story was so captivating. Even my husband, who won't sit still for subtitled movies, liked it and chuckled a few times as I saw him watch the movie over his newspaper! (And, not to take anything away from either actress, but Audrey Tautou reminded me of another famous Audrey. She had that same &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot;. That's the limit of my high school French!) The movie has what is missing in so many American movies and that is multi-layers-- mini-stories that don't detract from the main story but add a lot to it. The only bad thing I can say was I had a heck of a time accessing the subtitles and getting them in English. Maybe the DVD (a rental) had a glitch in it but it wasn't a very friendly menu and unfortunately, I don't understand French well enough to follow it in a movie. Liked the music, too. And what a city Paris looks like in this movie! Check it out and give it a chance.
B000069CWE|5.0|This CD is absolutely BRILLIANT for anyone who is a music eclect!! The CD takes you on a journey where the concept of \\"music genre\\" seems to dissapear...... the Opening is a beautiful melodic Violin Cello Harmony that from there blisters itself into this Wicked Techno Rock remix of Points of Authority... and then to a hip hop mix of In The End....... and back and forth between boundaries through out the whole cd, coming to a close with a Hard Hop mix of Cure for the Itch..... and then a Darkened heavier sounding One Step Closer with jonothan davis of korn... and closes itself with the beautiful violins ingtroducing the new Crawling, where Aaron Lewis of Staind Harmonizes with Chester Bennington QUITE amazingly..... and then dulling down to the finale of the Violins...... THis WHOLE CD LEFT ME WITH CHILLS!!!  A definite must have for anyone who enjoys music of all kinds!!!
0380002930|1.0|I had heard great things about this book, but as much as I wanted to enjoy it I was bored to tears.  The endless descriptions of plants I don't care about, the repetitiveness of \\"oh, another threat to the rabbits, I wonder if they will be okay or not\\"... it all got to me within the first 100 pages.  The reviewer who said he lost his copy of the book can have mine (no really, take it, please!).
0679735909|3.0|I cannot quite take in hand my feelings about this peculiar novel to adequately examine them. All I know is that I've been chased by a compulsion to do just that. <br />The subtitle of the novel is `A Romance' and, in order to comply with this promise in the most literal way, the reader is presented with two couples, two loves. Byatt's notion of love is, though interesting in numerous ways, so different from mine that I often found myself unable to sympathize. The idea of two Victorian poets falling in love throughout the course of written correspondence is wonderfully romantic in a very traditional sense. So then why, as I read the letters, was I frowning? Why was I left cold? There was passion for sure, but it was an intellectual passion. A passion that did not seem to truly transcend the mind. And this isn't limited to the relationship between the Victorian lovers. The intimacy between Maud and Roland was tinged with frigidity--their relationship, however, has facets that saved it from being written off. I was hardly expecting, nor did I want, a historical romance novel. But one does not need to sacrifice heat to maintain respectability. I cannot, on some level, accept the relationship between Ash and La Motte, which, no doubt, altered my reaction to more than one aspect of the novel. <br />I wanted to be caught up, \\"possessed,\\" by Ash's and La Motte's sentiments for each other as Roland and Maud were (though I can hardly reason why they were.) I wasn't. I wanted to be taken in by the lush prose I had read so much about before even attempting to read the novel. But for such an exquisite sense of detail, I was hardly moved by Byatt's descriptive passages. There was nothing particularly lyrical about the prose, not, I would say, when compared to some other writers who have the ability to fill pages with the most beautiful observations about something as mundane as sleep. Instead it seemed stilted. All those dashes and incomplete thoughts breaking up the narrative.And at times, though I hate to admit it, it was a guessing game as to which character was speaking. It was necessary to go back to the beginning of the exchange and trace the conversation all over again. <br />And I'll forever wonder why the instigator, Fergus Wolf, drops out of sight. That seems unreasonable.<br />I also don't think it's fair to suggest that Christabel La Motte was even \\"loosely\\"  based on Christina Rossetti. Similarities are sparse, limited, perhaps, to a strong religious devotion, an epic poem based on fairy tale like creatures, and that she remained unmarried. Rossetti, as far as I have found, was considered to be a meek woman with a somewhat weak constitution. It would be much more reasonable to speculate that La Motte was modeled after Dickinson. Whereas Rossetti was inclined to write religiously, Dickinson was more open with her ideas and metaphors. And La Motte's style of writing is more compatible with Dickinson as well. Plus, Dickinson's Master letters suggest a spark that Rossetti lacked but that La Motte was well aware of in herself. <br />What stuck most in my mind was the inability on the part of both couples to reconcile themselves to leading a life less solitary. Which is where the many layers of possession comes to the surface. I loved the image of the empty white bed that Roland and Maud needed to cling to. <br />Delving into the depths of this novel is not something that can be done over the period of a day nor, I doubt, even over a week. And it is certainly a novel that needs to be read more than once to appreciate. It isn't a particularly happy work. There's little enough hope for any of the characters. However, I'm happy that I read it because it does stay, it does compel you to think about it further. The more I think about it, the more it seems this novel is less \\"mystery,\\" less \\"love story,\\" and more the \\"lit theory\\" that it also claims to be.
B00000K19E|5.0|A very cool movie that you will watch again and again...
B00005M91K|5.0|While recently completing a questionnaire for a personals profile, I was asked to describe my most humbling moment.    The best answer i could think of is every time i watch this movie.  Nothing makes me realize the immensity of the world in which we live quite like Baraka.
B000069HKH|5.0|I picked this album up yesterday, without having heard any of the songs before. And when &quot;Lonesome day&quot; started in the typical Human touch/Lucky town style, I was in awe over this album. In fact, the title-track is in my oppinion, one of the best songs on the album. <BR>Bruce picked different sounds for many of the songs, so that you will almost for sure love at least SOME of them, and not care about others. This was the case for me, while I sticked to the classic Bruce-sound found on songs like &quot;Lonesome day&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot;, &quot;Empty sky&quot;, &quot;The rising&quot; and several others, there are other songs who changes direction and style completly, and may thereby not please everyone. I see this however as more of a test from the boss to try out different styles. Maybe his next album will be more concentrated on one style, but still this album is varied enough to give the listener a bit of surprise and excitement for the next song.<BR>There are no BIG hits like earlier albums here. Which means, you won`t get a Human touch, Born in the USA, Brilliant Desguise and those. Instead you will get a more experimental and relaxed album, which certainly keeps it quality high for the most of the time. However, this is a great album, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the Boss. No doubt should be sensed about buying it, and when &quot;paradise&quot; is fading out, you will play it over again. The boss and his band is back!
6301942647|5.0|The first time, I saw \\"KUROSAWA's DREAMS\\", I was awestruck!  I never tire of seeing it, over and over again!  Each time, I see it, Kurosawa's remarkable \\"genius\\" shines through.  Each segment is unique and \\"moving\\" and the characters are intriguing.  The \\"Fox marriage in the woods\\" segment is amazingly-staged, like a Kabuki play.  The \\"Peach Orchard and Royal Courtiers\\" segment brings back sweet childhood memories, when my Family used to set up an elaborate \\"Girls' Day\\" dolls-display, consisting of those same royal-court characters.  In the \\"Blizzard\\" segment, I agonize with the mountain-climbers, through \\"blinding\\" snow, feel \\"false\\" comfort from the \\"snow goddess\\", then share their joy, at finding their camp.  The \\"Soldiers in the tunnel\\" segment saddens me to tears, showing the tragic aftermath of war.  The whimsical \\"Van Gogh\\" segment, with Martin Scorsese, artfully blends \\"canvas\\" into film and makes me want to \\"jump\\" into my favorite Van Gogh paintings.  The \\"Mount Fuji\\" and \\"Weeping Demons\\" segments, though somewhat bizarre, continue to make me think, about Kurosawa's intended \\"messages\\".  In the final \\"Watermills\\" segment, I feel peace, closure and acceptance of what has come before, highlighted by the joyful funeral-celebration for a woman, who lived a long, good life.  In \\"DREAMS\\", Kurosawa presents a magnificent-spectrum of his life-views, in a surreal, yet \\"personal\\" way.  Now that it's available on DVD, I'm THRILLED!  I bought many copies, as gifts for my favorite Friends.
B000069HKH|1.0|I bought this album based on reviews over the weekend pre-release.  Honestly, I find it very boring and simple.  The melodies repeat over and over and have nothing interesting about them.  Maybe if you were a Bruce Springsteen fan from the &quot;glory days&quot;, you can find some nostalgic connection with this stuff, but if you are into modern music you will find it very tedious to listen to.
630469797X|5.0|This film is not for everyone. Those true film buffs would appreciate George Romero's early film styles for depicting gore in subjective ways. This will truly be remembered as a classic &quot;art-house&quot; film of its time.
B000069HKH|5.0|Something for everyone here from a Myrtle Beach-like tune (Let's Be Friends) to serious ballads with important messages (Nothing Man, Paradise). Bruce and the E Street Band produce a very fine effort that was worth the wait.

B000050XEI|5.0|As a first-time listener (and now, fan) of Enya, I can say without conviction that this is a great CD. At first I bought it only to to hear Only Time (and c'mon, I wasn't the only one)and gradually became a big fan of all her music. <br />The way Tempus Vernum flows into Deora Ar Mo Chroi is simply magic. When first listening, I could swear they were one song. Only Time is beautiful as it is simple (not like that radio-remix stuff). And unlike an earlier CD, this one includes the words to all her songs except A Day Without Rain and Silver Inches (as they are wordless).<br />In additon to this CD I would strongly recommend Paint the Sky with Stars. Happy listening!
B000060MY6|3.0|Well, I kind of liked and hated this movie at the same time. Well, to be completely accurate, I loved the first half of the movie and then hated the second half. I realize that in order to truly appreciate this movie you have to put together all the fragments, but there was just too many pieces scattered all over the place to make anything coherant. It seemed to be just one big jumbled mess by the end that left me going &quot;hmm, what just happened?&quot; <br />What I did like were the zany characters that Lynch came up with in this one. Some of the characters that are in this one: an odd cowboy who philosophizes with a movie director, a guy who sees a &quot;monster&quot; behind a cafe in his dreams, a Spanish singer.  I am getting used to his weird movie effects and characters, but still it was fun to watch as this woman tried to recollect the events of her identity.<br /> The first half of the movie represents a &quot;pg&quot; version of the Hollywood dream for an aspiring actress who takes in this woman with the loss of identity (actually the woman just shows up there); the second half is the darker portrait of this dream, and we get pieces of clues to the relationship between the two women. However, there just seems to be too much going on with too many characters for much of this to make sense. <br />This is a movie that will probably be better appreciated if you view it more than one time. I rate it 3 stars for its originality and uniqueness, but there are many holes in the story that have yet to be filled. If you can imagine one of those paintings have been made by an artist taking the paint and promptly throwing it onto the picture canvas, then you will have a good idea of how this movie is constructed. This can be a good thing if you have some time. I do recommend this movie to see, but you will need to be quite awake when viewing.
B000066F6H|5.0|The Hives are the critics' &quot;new saviors of rock n' roll&quot;, but hey is that such a bad thing idea.  Especially if your band is so fun and catchy that it is so hard to turn off once the album is started rotating. That is the Hives for you, and they are much easier to get into than their fellow &quot;saviour&quot; bands, The Strokes and The White Stripes.  The harsh vocals and groovy, almost funky beats make this a highly memorable and enjoyable cd.  The scratchy buzz of the guitar plus the sometimes puerile lyrics help the band to gain a measure of originality.  I mean who can take the song Declare Guerre Nucleaire seriously...hopefully no one.  The highlights are of course the hit single &quot;Hate to Say I told you so&quot;, along with &quot;Main Offender&quot; and  &quot;A Get Together to Tear Apart&quot; (which is a very interesting name, I believe they call a phrase like that an oxymoron).  But the power-driven, raw energy of the album never lets up for the entire half-hour it rotates.  Well ok that is one complaint I mean &quot;more is better&quot;, right?  Especially if you can make music like these guys.  Well anyway i definitely recommend this album for music fans without a religion or faith for perhaps these guys really are the saviours of rock n' roll...
B000006NPY|5.0|After reading some of the reveiws on this page, i have decided that it would be best for me not to beat the dead horse.  This album is more then worth your money.  This music that Corgan writes, it can touch you in ways you never thought music could do. It is absoluty Magical.  No ifs ands or buts.  The Pumpkins have conquered yet another genre of music.  And now for the negative....Jimmy's out!  The world famous Pumpkins drums are out of the picture, which is absolutly tragic, because the songs were strong even without him.  This makes me so sad, because imagine if he was there instead of the machine.  The Smashing Pumpkins would have become a religion.<br />Merry Mellodies folks!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I thought Spider-Man was a great movie! I especially loved the Green Goblin and even ruted for him. William Dafoe did a wonderful job as so did Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Not only is the movie good but they made the Green Goblin high tech now I love the Green Goblin in his regular purple uniform but to see Sam Raimi make him into that it blew me away the effects were great every thing from the glider to the way spider-man swung through the city. If you havent seen it go see it now because you will be pleased...

B000001FA4|3.0|I was very disappointed when I bought THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE in october 1984 , U2 have always been my musical heroes but after buying their first 3 albums it was a shock to listen to their new direction . In fact when I put the LP on the turntable and listned to the first few seconds of A SORT OF HOMECOMING I seriously thought the record store had given me the wrong album ! I seriously did , and the album didn`t improve after this track , songs like PROMENADE , 4TH OF JULY and ELVIS PRESLEY AND AMERICA owe more to Brian Eno rather than U2 . It does have it`s good points like WIRE and the far more traditional PRIDE , but this doesn`t stop this album from being my least listned to album .<br />Trivia point. It was round about this time that SIMPLE MINDS were trying to sound like Bono and the boys. Perhaps in revenge U2 were trying to sound like SIMPLE MINDS ?

B00004TRD8|5.0|Thank you THX and DTS decoding. This disc has supurb sound and picture quality . (Its only rival may be an unamed Lucas flick) The story is great, and it's now better with the directors uncut version. The Disc menu is very cool and exciting. Also, the directors commentary track is actually worth listening to through out the movie. The second disc is full of interesting behind the scenes stuff including almost every story board done for the film. I am re-energized for the upcoming T3 movie. Can he top Titanic? Hum . . .<br />Botom Line. If you enjoyed the theator cut, Buy this disc. Hard to believe it was released so long ago.
B00005JKJA|4.0|As usual David Lynch supplys a film for those of us who need to think about the movie after we have left the building or just lounging on our sofa.<BR>When I see DTS Sound on the cover of a DVD I look forward even more because I have high end equipment and this is an extra bonus for  me. If I don't see DTS on the cover well then I don't expect it and that's OK.<BR>The sound from Mulholland Drive is full frontal with a touch of bass from the woofer. That's it.<BR>An exciting film such as this could have been better with an intelligent sound track.
B00005JKDR|1.0|Am I the only one who thought this stunningly visual film was completely ruined by going W A Y overboard on the cutesy cutesy baby girl aspect?  Don't get me wrong : I realize that family fare such as this is aimed at \\"little ones\\" and those who love them (as I do) but C'MON! This is one of the rare computer-animated releases that will NEVER darken my shelf and certainly never clog my DVD player. Enjoy, all ye sappy-syrupy cravers !
B00005V0X5|5.0|ive been a long time megadeth fan. the original killing is my business album had good material on it, but the recording quality was just downright horrible. or at least the main reason why i never listened to it. but this remastered version is absolutly amazing. you can actually hear the drums, like it was recorded yesterday. i didnt know gar did so much double bass but you can feel it now. the guitars are better the vocals are better. its like a completly brand new album. if you own the original and dont like the quality and kinda like the songs, get this. also, if you are a megadeth fan and think you might like some faster stuff, definatly get this. the audio samples here might give you some idea, but im sure you wont know how great it sounds till you hear it on a stereo in full cd quality
0316666343|5.0|This book was everything I hoped and more, reading it really was an experience that I wanted to continue long after the last page.  Susie Salmon will be someone I think of often and The Lovely Bones will be a book that I will read again in my lifetime.
B000002UUX|5.0|every single track on this album is totally hands down amazing (cept the little 2 minute bass song Dawn Patrol. good stuff but not &quot;amazing&quot;). the solos on the album are my favorite of the lead guitar genius Marty Friedman. the rythem riffs are heavy and complex and kicking your buttocks all over the place.  my only complaint is the mix is a *little* low. i usually have to turn it up a notch or two in my car for it to be as loud as everything else.<br />if you are a megadeth fan, or even a fan of heavy music and draw dropping emotion filled solos and you don't have this album, you're missing out. that's all i'll say. missing out big time.
0804115613|3.0|Fried Green Tomatoes was a readable book. I haven't seen the movie, but just thought I would start with a simple book after a reading \\"drought\\" (you dun wanna know). Though peopled with charming characters and interesting events, I can't help but feel that the entire book was too idealised and over-perfect. Perhaps that's what a writer is able to do, write about things out of the reality. Among the most unthinkable situations was for the Threadgoodes to be so open and receptive of the obviously homosexual relationship between their daughter and Ruth. For those times, they must have been very progressive, or just plain unrealistic. The presentation of black-white relations is oversimplistic and shallow, it is dealt with in a right vs. wrong way, which is hardly as easy when it comes to the real issue of race relations. In discussion of families, communities, life in the south, race relations, dealing with development and progress in a modern world as well as the change in values, Harper Lee's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is definitely superior in everyway to \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\". OK read for an occasional laugh and the recipes given at the back.
0380977788|3.0|The story is quite basic: about a young girl just moved into this new big house with her parent. She likes to explore and found a door way to another dimension. A world that looks exactly like ours, except... everything else is strange and different. She struggles to escape and rescue her parents from her other mother of the other world. Of course, the ending is happy and she learns that her life is not so boring.<br />Before I read the book I thought it is going to be scary and frightening or even creepy like Lemony Snicket's \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\", but turns out the illustrations of McKean is really what keeps up the scariness. From the book I expected scary subjects and gruesome imageries...but I doubt some talking mice and walking hand is going to scare any nine-year-old. I feel that Neil Gaiman is putting too much limit in his creativity. As if he is too afraid to make the story too scary or too \\"not scary\\". <br />Overall, I think the book is scary or frightening  due to McKean's illustration. So don't be afraid to read this book to your kids or students. It is a short story for a biweekly read, and the plotline is interesting... but don't expect anything in the book to get you goosebump.
1573225517|3.0|Hornby's book is readable but predictable and corny but does try to explore deeper meanings underneath the camouflage of irreverence. The themes of aging, loneliness, finding love and losing it have been done and re-done but Hornby manages to shape them all into an engaging and humorous novel. I especially liked the passages when Hornby's protaganist realises that the man he wants to be and the life he wants, is with someone he loves, something permanent, rather than transcient and ever-changing like that between the Thai lap-dancer and her bouncer boyfriend. Do we know what we prefer? Perhaps the difficulty in life is that we never really know or comprehend what we want out of it. If nothing else, Hornby's book gives us a glimpse of British culture, humour and the &quot;perils&quot; of middle-age.
B000056PWV|5.0|Rear Window and North by Northwest are my favorite Alfred Hitchcok films and rank very highly on the list of my favorite films overall. Although they are very different films, they both share great suspense, creative plots, some humor, and wonderful stars - what more could you ask for in a movie? Additionally, Rear Window offers some interesting insights into human nature and shows that, like L.B. Jeffries, we (as movie watchers) are essentially voyeurs.<br />Basically, Rear Window is about photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) who, not being able to move due to a cast on his broken leg, starts to use his powerful camera lenses to observe people in the neighboring apartments. While watching, he notes the strange behavior of one man...and then begins to believe that the man murdered his wife. With a beautiful girlfriend (Grace Kelly) at his side, Jeffries investigates the situation, creating a great deal of suspense. The movie has a wonderfully clever conclusion which I am NOT going to describe: watch it and find it out for yourself!<br />Anyhow, this is a true thriller, Hitchcock style. It features classic actors (James Stewart, especially, is amazing in this film), a creative, original plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and interesting thoughts about voyeurism, etc. As a last point, Rear Window has a real sense of atmosphere - it really transports the viewer to the apartment building in the hot summer. All in all - this is a FANTASTIC film - I don't know how else to recommend it!
B00005JKTF|2.0|Charlotte Grey stars the brilliant Cate Blanchet in a story reminiscent of the old British war movies about Odette Hallowes, 'Odette', or Violette Szabo 'Carve her name with pride'. All of these films have elements that intertwine with each other, such as strong women characters, wartime propaganda, romance, etc. But as a film of its type, \\"Charlotte Grey\\" fails quite badly.<br /><br />Grey is a Scot who falls for an RAF pilot, but their relationship is cut short when he is shot down over occupied France. On the basis of this, she then decides to join the SOE (Special Operations Executive) as a spy for the British. Which is severely undernourished as a plausible reason to grab a weapon and a bit of silk and jump into enemy territory.<br /><br />Her command of French comes in very handy (not that she'll need it for this film) and her strong will is helpful too, not to mention her unrealistic hyper-patriotic notions.<br /><br />After a disappointing and all too hasty \\"training\\" section of the film, Grey is dropped into France where...yes you guessed it...she falls in love again, this time with a member of the French resistance...of course she does. It seems to me sometimes, that all women can do in WWII films is fall in love with everyone within a 20km distance and \\"Charlotte Grey\\" is no exception unfortunately.<br /><br />From here the film falls rapidly down a seemingly never-ending hill and it's a hill sodden with tired old clichés. Nothing much of consequence really happens and it's a shame, as the film could easily have been expanded into a far more entertaining and realistic exercise. The usual stereotypes of bad WWII movies are all here...The beautiful woman pining for her man, the noble French resistance (who all speak in mock French accents that sound like they're extras from the old BBC sitcom \\"Allo Allo\\"), the slimy Vichy French and of course the \\"evil\\" Germans who, by the way, seem only to want to catch Jews and ship them off to Auschwitz. Like nothing else ever happened in WWII.<br /><br />All in all, this is a film that is severely truncated by the producers fear of actually making something different, other than the usual wartime trollop that's served up to a generally unknowing audience. Oh well, we'll have to mark it down as another missed opportunity. See the other two films mentioned above, they are far more entertaining and they do everything \\"Charlotte Grey\\" does... but much, much better.
B00005RY7X|2.0|Yes, this is a fun record, and reminds me of the 80's music, but I kinda like to here some variety within a record! The songs on Andrew W.K.s' I Get Wet, all sound the same, and it's like one long song, with only a few speed variations! I like \\"party hard\\", and is why I bought the c.d., but all the songs sound like this, so I guess I like all the songs? I also like to hear some sort of vocals, this is all chanting, like a football team or something. Other tracks that I like are \\"she is beatiful\\", and \\"I love N.Y.C.\\" Hopefully Andrew's next record will be titled \\"I Get Variety\\"!!!
B00005Y228|5.0|I'm a trance lover. I'm not saying Kylie is a trance singer, but you can dance to her songs. I'm not playin! Since 'can get you out of my head' and 'love at first sight' were featured on dance formats radio stations all across the world, I decided to buy the CD. I didn't regret buying it. This CD keeps an upbeat mood in me. Most likly in you also! There is NOT one song that puts you to sleep. So buy this CD! Okay? Okay.
B000002UDB|5.0|I Am the Walrus.<br />Baby You're a Rich Man.<br />Blue Jay Way.<br />Hello Goodbye.<br />Flying.<br />And most of all, Strawberry Fields Forever.<br /><br />I could not live without these songs. I would die without them. Seriously.
B000069CWE|3.0|It's a good album but it just sounds like a remix of their last album hybrid theory...
B000002J29|5.0|I first heard this two-album set -- yes, I said ALBUM -- back in 1978, and was utterly blown away by it then.  Over the last 24 years, it has continued to one of my absolute favorite musical recordings ever . . . not just by Genesis, a fabulous band (before they went pop), but this is one of the best collections of songs and performances by anyone at any time!  <br />Get this disc set.  You will love it!
B0000636UN|4.0|The CD album, \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is another one of Sheryl Crow's masterpieces. \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is a representative Rock & Roll album that reveals Sheryl's enthusiasm for music. She sincerely places music as her priority. \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is an album with a lot of emotions. Every song in \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is unique because each has a little story and a different character.<BR> \\"Steve McQueen\\" is a song with Rock feeling, which also contains a rebellious, mysterious and freespirited tone. Sheryl had mentioned that she felt down and bounded because of overworking for her last few years. \\"Steve McQueen,\\" illustrates her yearning to be free and wild.<BR> \\"It's so easy\\" is a song that Sheryl and her sister wrote together. The song is a waltz. It has a country feel.<BR> Sheryl's friend, Emmylou Harris sings on\\"The Weather Channel.\\" Sheryl specially requested to record Emmylou's voice because Sheryl liked her deep voice, which carried a spiritual sound. She thinks that Emmylou's voice resonate a healing effect.<BR> Besides \\"Steve McQueen,\\" \\"It's so Easy,\\" \\"The Weather Channel,\\" and the rest of the songs left in `C'mon C'mon,\\" there are also other good songs worth listening to. Sheryl's beautiful vocals cannot be denied. This gifted singer/song writer composed \\"C'mon C'mon\\" with a lot of human feelings. \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is a pleasant album that gives listeners many enjoyable moments.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is the best remix cd i have heard in a long time, it is hard to say what is the best song on this cd, but i would have to say FRGT/10(#5) is a great one, go buy this cd you will not be dissapointed, and there is a video caus ethis cd is enhaced so go buy reanimation,that's all I got to say.
B000069CWE|4.0|When news first broke out that Linkin Park was doing a remix album, I was less than thrilled. Normally I hate remixes and despite Mike Shinoda (the band's rapper) saying it would be more than remix album, I was still hesistent. It was similar to how they referred to Tim Burton's &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; as a reimagining. Anyway, I recently had the good fortune of catching this album on MTV2's Playback. I was shocked. These new versions of my favorite songs were actually good! Some songs are much better than others. Personally, I think they killed &quot;In the End&quot; but the rest of the CD makes up for it. Some songs received a much needed makeover. &quot;One Step Closer&quot; is much better this time around. &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; and &quot;A Place For My Head&quot; have new twists. Other songs such as &quot;My December&quot; and &quot;With You&quot; sound new and old at the same time. I think the best remix is the last one, &quot;Crawling.&quot; If you're going to buy this disc, I suggest you buy their first album, Hybrid Theory, if you haven't already. You need to hear the first album in order to appreciate this one.
B00005BL2A|4.0|Exciter to me seems less dark that Ultra. It's a bit more lush and some of the songs here are as good as since the time of Violator. &quot;Freelove&quot; is the best track on this album. &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; is really, really good. I think Depeche Mode can still deliver the goods, and it's great to see a band that has survived time and troubles...they're still relevent. I like seeing they've held the long haul and haven't been just a flash. Of course, it's not kosher to like bands or music that's over 2 weeks old today, but I'm 33 and I've liked Depeche Mode since I was a teenager a hundred years ago...back in the time when bands had true careers. Boy I am so old hat...but you know what? I like being old, and I like this band and this album.
B00003CXSP|2.0|How bad is this movie?  Well the opening shootout gives us our first glimpse.  The &quot;crying&quot; scene by Julianne Moore is so bad you feel embarassed watching it.  Hannibal's ability to overtake people is laugable and just too unbelievable.  You know all along it's just to advance the script in that direction.  And as to the ending, I squirmed initially, but was not grossed out.  I did have a good laugh on retrospect after realizing it was straight out of an epsiode of &quot;Itchy and Scratchy.&quot;
B00003CXI1|4.0|I procratinated seeing &quot;Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; for months, having been put off by all of the overwhelming hype. However, when I finally sat down to watch it recently, I was completely entertained and totally charmed. The story is engaging and well thought-out, the actors do a wonderful job, and the special effects are every bit as good as I'd hoped they'd be.<br />The special features on the DVD are pretty extensive, and can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. If you're a grown-up who's been avoiding this film for fear it would bore you to tears, let me assure you that it's a timeless tale for all ages. There are elements of &quot;Cinderella,&quot; multiple Grimm's Fairy Tales, and other stories, as well as completely original ideas.<br />I plan to watch this film many times, and will likely get more and more out of it with each viewing.
6305513406|5.0|Two of Trek's best early episodes, both dealing with encountering the unknown at the limits of man's former boundaries.<br />&quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; was Trek's second pilot, the one that sold the series.  Captain Kirk's old friend Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood, pre-2001: A Space Odyssey) becomes infected by an energy field at the rim of the solar system, which the Enterprise discovers from a former lost ship's probe caused the destruction of that ship:  the field effects people with strong ESP abilities, heightening their powers and making them drunk with them.  Mitchell rapidly becomes a power-mad monster, similarly infecting fellow crewmate Sally Kellerman, and plans to run off with her to produce a race of ESPer gods who will one day rival humans.  Kirk has to stop him  -  but can he do it without Kellerman's help?  And without killing his old friend?<br />The actors are excellent, especially guest stars Lockwood and Kellerman.  Shatner gives one of his better performances, showing the star quality that made him what he was before he descended into a caricature of himself.  The production is terrific, the story managing to raise a few chills despite its hackneyed sci-fi plot.  Being the second pilot of the series, the costumes and makeups  -  especially Mr. Spock's  -  are jarringly different, but that adds to the illusion of reality when compared to later episodes since it denotes a natural evolution in the Star Trek universe.<br />&quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; is a great taut, suspenseful story, well-directed and -acted, bringing the Enterprise into contact with an alien probe that attempts to prevent their entry into its space.  Kirk orders it destroyed and proceeds, cueing the arrival of the alien probe's builders in the form of Balok, a scary, giant creature looking very much like a UFO Gray with Ted Cassidy's (The Addams Family's Lurch) intimidating voice, who coldly announces his intention to destroy the Enterprise as a hostile invader.  Kirk resorts to trickery to buy time in finding a way out of the mess he's gotten his ship into, and ultimately discovers much more about Balok's race and true intentions  -  which are not as hostile as they appear.<br />&quot;Corbomite&quot; benefits from three great guest star performances:  Anthony Call as an inexperienced bridge officer who snaps under pressure, but whose sensitivity and innate abilities serve a higher diplomatic calling; Ted Cassidy's voice, which truly does contribute to a frightening alien presence; and child star Clint Howard, who has a surprise role (with a dubbed voice) which can't be discussed without giving away the game.  The alien ships are also quite impressive, the more so for their simplicity:  they are purely geometric shapes, but of great size and destructive power.<br />Great sci-fi, still worth watching after all these years.
B00005JLDW|3.0|Before I start, I have to admit up front that I went into \\"Reign of Fire\\" with exceptionally low expectations - I figured they'd find a way to really muck up what could have been an interesting story; after all, doesn't that frequently happen with fantasy films? Look at \\"Dungeons & Dragons,\\" ferinstance - ugh! But, braving the potentially awfulness, I went to see it. Imagine my pleasant surprise upon being very entertained through most of the film. I'd actually give it 3.5 stars - if only Amazon allowed half points, alas.<br />There defintely are some rather large holes in the plot, but amazingly they detract only slightly from the overall effect. The dragon effects were very good, the direction was better than I expected, and the acting was above par. There were some excellent suspense scenes, a handful of decent emotional scenes, and far less gratuitous, meaningless, over-the-top action sequences. There were actual *nuances* in facial expressions, tones of voice, et cetera. <br />I feel they could have explained more of the back story, but as the film is nearly two hours long as cut, that would have been pushing things just a touch. This would very likely make an excellent book, which could go into more detail, character motivations, dragon culture, and so forth.<br />The film isn't high art, but I don't think any of us expected that, right? It's very enjoyable for someone looking for a little mindless entertainment.
B000066I6N|5.0|Though you know it won't get the support, this cd puts everything else being foisted as music these days to shame. Robert's voice hasn't sounded this good in over 20 years, and if you saw the VH-1 &quot;Storytellers&quot;, it's obvious he is still quite at home on stage. Good news for those who are tired of seing old rockers re-hash the same songs they were selling decades ago. There are tinges of Zeppelin in here, but don't expect anything like what you are used to. Plant moves on while looking back on some of his favorites from years ago. This is a great CD that no matter how many accolades it garners, can't possibly get the attention it deserves. Five stars is not enough.
B000069CWE|5.0|...that Hybrid Theory would be outdone. In fact, I had the expectations that this album would be great but would not be able to touch Hybrid Theory. All of those expectations have been shattered after hearing REANIMATION. The only word that could possibly sum it all up is amazing. <br />The album opens with a haunting, yet calming violin and cello piece played by bassist Dave Farrell that is revisited again in the \\"NTR\MSSION\\" as well as Mike Shinoda's new version of \\"KRWLNG.\\" Although all of the tracks are great, there are a couple that stand out above the rest:<br />- \\"P5HNG ME A*WY\\" is a much darker piece than the original, although the underlying beat keeps it from becoming dreary. Stephen Richards of Taproot lends his voice to the track, blending in and out with band vocalist Chester Bennington's. The result is a haunting track that seems to lock on to the listener and not let him/her go until the end.<br />-\\"PPR:KUT\\" is a very original reinterpretation that includes heavy guitar playing over a hip-hop beat with various samples. Cheapshot and Jubacca do a great job of recreating the feel of \\"Papercut\\" while turning it into a completely new song. The song also features Rasco and Planet Asia rhyming over a violin. Great track.<br />-\\"KRWLNG\\" is the final song in this masterpiece that begins with a violin and cello. Blips of the original \\"Crawling\\" are played through out the intro until the song breaks out into the familiar opening of chime-like samples. The song is arguably the best track, seemingly taking elements from the previous ones and mixing it into it. The remix and album end with the violin fading out over bells.<br />The album was produced by band emcee Mike Shinoda who also remixed a few of the tracks. \\"Chairman\\" Hahn, Linkin Park's turntablist, oversaw the remixing of \\"WTH>YOU\\" and \\"KYUR4 TH ICH.\\" From beginning to end, the album is definitely an evolution from not only Hybrid Theory, but from past remix albums. If you have an open mind towards many genres such as hip-hop, rock, electronica and even some classical, then you will enjoy this album. It will be in my CD player for a very long time to come.
B00000K0DK|5.0|Loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, this is the story of the rise and fall of one of the wealthiest men in the world.  It is also the story of a period of time in American history beginning in the 1890s when it seemed that all was possible.  Its innovative film techniques also raised the standard to which the world of film would forevermore have to aspire.<br />The film begins with the death of the rich man, Charles Forster Kane.  The audience sees newsreel footage about his life and so the general outline is established early.  But when a newspaper reporter now interviews all the people who knew him well, the flashbacks tell the real story.  Orson Wells plays Kane in an outstanding performance, the use of makeup as well as his voice and body language making him age before our eyes.  Joseph Cotton plays his best friend.  And Agnes Moorehead has a small role as his mother.  The rest of the cast's names are less familiar today:  Ruth Warrick is cast as his first wife; Ray Collins as a corrupt politician; Everett Sloan as his business associate; Dorothy Comingore as his second wife.  They were all young unknowns then, and it was Orson Wells' skill that brought out outstanding performances from all.<br />The Turner Classic Edition of the video I watched included a short piece about the technical aspects of creating the film, which I found fascinating.  According to Robert Wise, who did the film editing, shooting though cheesecloth filled with sand to get a grainy effect created the newsreel shots.  Some shots were done from a camera that was actually placed below floor level and aimed upwards or a ceiling camera aimed downwards. The dominant characters had camera angles aimed upwards at them; the weaker characters were shot with camera angles aimed downward. The film is shot in black and white with high contrast, often having the foreground characters completely in shadow. Often, the features of a character are indistinct and shadowy and it is the voice that carried the action.  Other times, the entire scene is in what is called \\"deep focus\\" with every bit of it absolutely clear.  It was Wells' genius that made it all work so well.<br />The film moved fast and held my interest throughout.  There was never a lull or a dull moment because of the technique of overlapping dialog, which moved the viewer from one scene to another with maximum effect.  No detail was left out to make this a perfect film, which can be watched over and over again, just to see its unique composition.  I give this video my highest recommendation.  If you've never seen it, don't miss it.  If you've seen it before, see it again.ce that carried the action.

B00000I07P|5.0|Simply put, if you're into the music from the 'Big Hair' 80's era, than you'll love this CD.  Check your pulse if this CD doesn't take you back to your days of immortality and remind you of someone you once were!  Example... the first speeding ticket I got was while this cassette was playing in the car.  I had a Radar Detector that was screaming at me, but I had the stereo cranked so loudly with &quot;Dead Or Alive&quot; that I couldn't here the alarm and got busted by the Florida Hwy. Patrol for 72 in a 55!  Sometimes the music is worth the price.
B000069HKH|5.0|The boss is back- it's as simple as that. Not only that- the E Street Band are back in a studio album for the first time since Born In The USA and it's Bruce's best cd since that mega album. He says he wrote it quickly and it sounds as if all the energy he's saved up in the last decade has exploded into a great album with so many highlights it's virtually impossible to guess the hits here. Here's a rundown of the songs with my marks:<BR>(1)Lonesome Day(10)- Catches you by the balls straight from the start. Great rock. The boss means business.<BR>(2)Into The Fire(10)- A song dedicated to the firemen/policemen who went into the fire on 11/9 and lost their lives(most of the album revolves around 11/9 as you know). Moving song.<BR>(3)Waiting On A Sunny Day(10)- Starts a bit like Tenth Avenue Freeze Out and Hungry Heart and sounds like the old boss especially when Clarence Clemoms infamous saxophone enters.<BR>(4)Nothing Man(10)- A slow moving song. Philadelphia style.<BR>(5)Counting On A Miracle(8)- Like Born In The USA's songs, hard lyrics covered by pop/rock. A person who knows his lover won't come back is counting on a miracle.<BR>(6)Empty Sky(8)- Similiar lyrics to the previous song.<BR>(7)Worlds Apart(10)- A defenite highlight. An ethnic start suddenly explodes into Bruce's rocky best. Brilliant.<BR>(8)Let's Be Friends(8)- A rather naive song, but here's to hoping...<BR>(9)Futher On Up The Road(10)- More brilliant rock from the boss. Nothing to do with the Eric Clapton song.<br />(10)The Fuse(8)- Alright, not great.<BR>(11)Mary's Place(8)- The writing on the cover mark this song along with Into The Fire and The Rising as the hits of the album.<BR>(12)You're Missing(8)- Another sad 11/9 inspired songs.<BR>(13)The Rising(10)- The title track and first single. It says a lot of the album's strength that it's first hit in near the end.<BR>(14)Paradise(10)- My personal favourite. A quiet haunting song in the style of The Ghost Of Tom Joad.<BR>(15)My City Of Ruins(10)- Ironically written before 11/9, but sounds as if it was written after. Brilliant and  fitting end. Sounds like a quieter version of the title track.<BR>How does this album rate compared to his back catalogue?<BR>Greeting From Ashbury Park, N.J.(1972)(7)- A Bob Dylan style album. Great lyrics.<BR>The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle(1973)(7)- Similiar to his first album. Features early hits Sandy and concert encore Rosalita.<BR>Born To Run(1975)(8)- The big breakthrough. Considered by most critics as his best I prefer his later work. Brilliant title track, great lyrics in Thunder Road and Backstreets is powerful.<BR>Darkness At The Edge Of Town(1978)(8)- Angry boss following a legal dispute with a former manager which resulted in a 3 year break. <BR>The River(1980)(10)- The big commercial breakthrough. One big party, but the best songs are the quiet ones: the title track, Independence Day, the dark Point Blank and 8 minutes of bliss in Drive All Night.<BR>Nebraska(1982)(8)- Dark, acoustic, very good late at night...<BR>Born In The USA(1984)(10)- Commercial, catchy, poppy?

B000069HKH|5.0|Nobody needs recommendation to buy the new Springsteen's album .<br />Notwithstanding , I wish to offer you a glance at the new release from what I've gathered thus far .<br />As you must have heard , &quot;The Rising&quot; is heavily influenced by the terrible tragedy of the 11th of  September , 2001 . The shadow of the disaster is interwoven throughout the whole album , while several songs are of the saddest and most painful Springsteen has ever written : &quot;Into the fire&quot; , &quot;Missing you&quot; , &quot;Paradise&quot; and of course &quot;My city of ruins&quot;. However , other songs can be heard and regarded otherwise than within the context of the Twin Towers' collapse : &quot;Worlds apart&quot; - brand new direction for Springsteen , &quot;Lonesome day&quot; and &quot;further on (up the road)&quot; . Both kinds are divided to Rock N' Roll and ballads , and probably all of them are what the hardcore fans call &quot;instant classics&quot; .<br />In all , a sad album - but not entirely saddening - that worth every penny you're going to pay for it .
B000069HKH|5.0|The boss is back- it's as simple as that. Not only that- the E Street Band are back in a studio album for the first time since Born In The USA and it's Bruce's best cd since that mega album. He says he wrote it quickly and it sounds as if all the energy he's saved up in the last decade has exploded into a great album with so many highlights it's virtually impossible to guess the hits here. Here's a rundown of the songs with my marks:<BR>(1)Lonesome Day(10)- Catches you by the balls straight from the start. Great rock. The boss means business.<BR>(2)Into The Fire(10)- A song dedicated to the firemen/policemen who went into the fire on 11/9 and lost their lives(most of the album revolves around 11/9 as you know). Moving song.<BR>(3)Waiting On A Sunny Day(10)- Starts a bit like Tenth Avenue Freeze Out and Hungry Heart and sounds like the old boss especially when Clarence Clemoms infamous saxophone enters.<BR>(4)Nothing Man(10)- A slow moving song. Philadelphia style.<BR>(5)Counting On A Miracle(8)- Like Born In The USA's songs, hard lyrics covered by pop/rock. A person who knows his lover won't come back is counting on a miracle.<BR>(6)Empty Sky(8)- Similiar lyrics to the previous song.<BR>(7)Worlds Apart(10)- A defenite highlight. An ethnic start suddenly explodes into Bruce's rocky best. Brilliant.<BR>(8)Let's Be Friends(8)- A rather naive song, but here's to hoping...<BR>(9)Futher On Up The Road(10)- More brilliant rock from the boss. Nothing to do with the Eric Clapton song.<br />(10)The Fuse(8)- Alright, not great.<BR>(11)Mary's Place(8)- The writing on the cover mark this song along with Into The Fire and The Rising as the hits of the album.<BR>(12)You're Missing(8)- Another sad 11/9 inspired songs.<BR>(13)The Rising(10)- The title track and first single. It says a lot of the album's strength that it's first hit in near the end.<BR>(14)Paradise(10)- My personal favourite. A quiet haunting song in the style of The Ghost Of Tom Joad.<BR>(15)My City Of Ruins(10)- Ironically written before 11/9, but sounds as if it was written after. Brilliant and  fitting end. Sounds like a quieter version of the title track.<BR>How does this album rate compared to his back catalogue?<BR>Greeting From Ashbury Park, N.J.(1972)(7)- A Bob Dylan style album. Great lyrics.<BR>The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle(1973)(7)- Similiar to his first album. Features early hits Sandy and concert encore Rosalita.<BR>Born To Run(1975)(8)- The big breakthrough. Considered by most critics as his best I prefer his later work. Brilliant title track, great lyrics in Thunder Road and Backstreets is powerful.<BR>Darkness At The Edge Of Town(1978)(8)- Angry boss following a legal dispute with a former manager which resulted in a 3 year break. <BR>The River(1980)(10)- The big commercial breakthrough. One big party, but the best songs are the quiet ones: the title track, Independence Day, the dark Point Blank and 8 minutes of bliss in Drive All Night.<BR>Nebraska(1982)(8)- Dark, acoustic, very good late at night...<BR>Born In The USA(1984)(10)- Commercial, catchy, poppy?

B00000JL86|5.0|Anastasia has to be the first movie i've seen in a LONG time from disney/atlantis in the animation genre. Being close to sixteen yrs old, there isn't alot of free time to sit down and watch animated films, what with uni and studys and all, but, in my opinion, anyone wanting to see a beautifully made movie should see 'Anastasia'.  <BR>   Sure, the movie might not be historically accurate, but if it were, it would take away alot of the beauty element of the movie. and sure, it may have drawbacks, but that's to be expected....everyone has different taste in movies and films, and so everyone will view the film in a different way. <BR>    In my own personal opinion, i found the movie to be one of the greatest achievements of animation technology. Based around young Anya, it is a movie about self-discovery, personal beliefs and the desire to reach a goal, no matter how impossible.<BR>Although it has been five years since the movie made it's debut screening, i consider it a classical piece of animation achievement. <BR>  With its attractive storyline, superbly drawn and animated characters and beautifully performed songs, i would recommomend anyone, in any age group, to watch this movie. if the movie itself doesn't entice you to enjoying the film, then the music certainly will.
B00004NRWH|2.0|Two songs: \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Leader of Men\\".  Those are the best two songs on here, and both get old really quickly.  All of the songs basically sound the same, and don't exactly leave you with a good impression.  Don't get me wrong here- Nickelback is a great band, I just don't like this CD.
0684833395|1.0|Tried it twice; couldn't be bothered, really - life's too short!  Only amusing if you thought war was a sensible career option for mankind.  The book I really want to track down, also published in the 60s, was set amongst the postwar occupation force in Japan (a lot of haiku writing went on, I remember) - can anyone assist?
B00004Z459|4.0|Despite the fact that this band's debut CD was nominated for 3 grammy awards, it really isn't a 5-star CD.  If you enjoy rap, this is a CD you'll love to add to your collection.  This is a CD of rap/metal fusion, and is still a good CD, not perfect.  Puddle of Mudd's &quot;Come Clean&quot; is much better.
B000069HKH|2.0|After hearing all the hype and media push I was expecting a ton more from this album.  Being a Bruce fan from the early days, I was hoping for a return to the bigger, &quot;movie-like&quot; songs of the past. This album has Bruce again in &quot;simple&quot; mode...simple nursery-rhyme type melodies, a few boring standard chords. It all sounds so obvious. Why can't Bruce say the same message with some more interesting chord changes or a little musical flare?  I'm sure the band could handle it.  In some cases less is really less, Bruce.  Don't believe the media...listen to your friends copy before buying this one.
6304806426|5.0|In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set.  It's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances.  And thus is the situation in \\"The English Patient,\\" directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.<br />It's WWII; flying above the African desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft.  And though he survives the crash, he is severely burned.  To his great good fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital.  But existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility.  Upon reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue on, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.<br />Hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as Almasy remembers nothing of his past, and not even his own name.  Thought to be English, the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient.  Slowly, however, under prompting from Hana, Almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold.  And his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he's been looking for-- a man with whom he wants to settle a score.  But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man.  Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to surface; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth).  And, crippled in mind and body as he is, those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all, even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.<br />In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje.  The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" and \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\"; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty.  Simply put, Minghella's film is genius realized; crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection, watching it is like watching a Monet come to life.  From the opening frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer.  In every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental.  Nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography.<br />If one had to choose a single word to describe the \\"essence\\" of this film, it would be \\"excellence.\\"  Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term \\"Oscar worthy.\\"  Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for \\"Shine\\"), Fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable.  Private and introspective, Almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him.  And it works.  Almasy does not seek your friendship; he will, however, gain your compassion.<br />Kristen Scott Thomas, too, received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for \\"Fargo\\") for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her.  The reserve Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, as Scott Thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect.  It's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast, taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion.  Understated and shaded with subtlety, it's terrific work by Kristin Scott Thomas.<br />Binoche gives a stunning, affecting performance, as well, as the kindhearted nurse, Hana; it is her humanity, in fact, which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film.  Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine.  \\"The English Patient\\" is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not want to see end.Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for \\"Shine\\"), Fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable.

B000069CWE|4.0|As an avid LP fan, I have been waiting for this release for quite some time. Reanimation is the follow up to 2000's massively successful Hybrid Theory. Packed with 20 tracks, this record definitely has more of a hip-hop feel than the first one, but, that's not a bad thing. At first I wasn't sure if I would get along with beats and samples favored over rock guitars and Chester's screaming, but Reanimation proves itself to be a suitable companion to Hybrid Theory. It's insane how Linkin Park can create music like this that has so many layers and vibes and emotions all rolled into one compact package. Hybrid sound is right. If nothing else, Reanimation will certainly hold you over until the next Linkin Park CD comes out, which will be the end of this year or early next.
0385720920|4.0|I Loved this book, I was completely taken by surprise!  I was a big fan of fight club, and this book was just as good.  If your looking for something different and funny this is a good pick.  I will definitely be looking forward to Mr. Palahniuk's next book.
0316666343|3.0|I give Alice Sebold high marks for originality; the idea of the story being told by the girl murdered in chapter one is clever. Unfortunately, though, the unfolding story fell far short of the hype - and became totally ridiculous when Susie came back to earth. Had Sebold focused on the hunt for the murderer it could have been much more interesting.
B000069CWE|5.0|it seems like this year, about every band, group, singer or whaterever has to have a remix cd brought out. most of which, stinks but this cd caught my attention. ive always been a linkin park fan since there first album came out but they became WAY to popular and began to be careful at what i was listening. but this cd is wow. amazing is the word that comes to my head.<BR>the remixes of the songs are unbeliveable; u wouldnt think that the song u heard was a remix at first but listen to the  lyrics and you already kno the title to tracks. ah, which makes its  more of a remix ; the band changed most of the title around, thus the name \\"reanimation\\".<br />if you are a die hard linkin park fan this is a good cd to listen while there making there follow up to hybrig theory. if your a rap/hip hop fan, then maybe you want to check up this cd cause its really worth your money. but if your those teeny boppers that think \\"in the end\\" is the only good song.......then maybe you should look for something else to listen.
B00005N83M|5.0|I'm very critical of albums, especially pop albums. At first, I thought, \\"what a surprise! Junk from the filler machine!!\\" I bought this album about a year ago and it wasn't until a few months ago that I realized this cd's awesome. They all have such excellent rythem and beats. While the production is iffy in some songs(the ones P. Doody produced. He's an aweful producer, btw. Back away from the pop!!!) the rest of the songs' production are brilliant! This album will go in my list of the best albums of all time. She's currently recording her third album. I pray it's as good as J.Lo!
B000069HKH|5.0|Wow...that's all I can say.  I was lucky enough to get my hands on a copy of this CD 10 days ago and it just gets better and better.  This album has everything that you could ask from Bruce at this stage of his career, and that's not somehow making excuses.  This album is being widely advertised as his first studio album with the E Street Band since &quot;Born In The U.S.A.&quot;.  They're making a point of this since that album sold millions.  While the statement is true, don't expect part two of that album.  Also, don't expect a whole lot of Clarence Clemons, but do expect more Soozie Tyrell.<br />This album sports a number of textures and some of the best material in years.  Tracks like &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, &quot;Waiting For A Sunny Day&quot;, &quot;Into The Fire&quot;, &quot;Counting On A Miracle&quot;, &quot;Mary's Place&quot;, &quot;Further On (Up The Road)&quot; and the title cut warrant repeated listens, but not at the exclusion of everything else.  In fact, I have a hard time finding a weak track on this album, though frankly I could live without the lightweight &quot;Let's Be Friends (Skin To Skin)&quot;.<br />Is this album going to convert the unconverted?  Perhaps.  It may convert some due to some of the topics it covers and the absolute marketing and image blitz that's being put on.  This may be the first Springsteen album that some &quot;Born In The U.S.A.&quot; era converts buy since that album.  Still, while most true Springsteen fans can't tolerate &quot;Born In The U.S.A.&quot; anymore, I believe this album will have legs.  It's deep, well written, well performed and the right album for the right time.
B00003W8NM|5.0|In today's world of film and moviemaking, it is uncommon to see a movie apart from the 7 basic genre's: Action, Sappy &quot;Feel Good&quot; movies, Romantic Comedy, Teen Comedy, Family Film, Drama (which all seem to follow the same general path), and of course the ever-popular Horror Film wave that comes along every few years. Rarely does a film with such depth and wonder come along. Rarely does a film truly make you THINK these days (i.e. ACTIVE VIEWING). And when a film DOES make the audience think more than they normally would have to while watching a movie...it is rare that such a film would be widley accpeted by the masses.<BR>Yet Fight Club has accomplished all this and so much more. With absolutley incredible cinemotography this movie has taught me that it IS possible for modern film to be ART rather than something to keep us occupied. There is not a single aspect of this movie which I would critisize. The use of cinematogrpahy, costumes, symbolism, the acting, the direction, the dialogue, the screenplay, and just about everything about this movie truly reaches maximum potential. <BR>The movie follows Edward Norton through his most unusual journey to enlightenment and freedom. An insomniac, Norton searches for ways to ease his psychological unrest. He finds comfort in support groups but is quickly driven from this comfort by a new comer, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). Norton's chance meeting with the charismatic and wacky Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) leads him to a different sort of comfort. Tyler teaches Norton of the evils of society, consumerism etc... and encourages him to free himself of this consumer world. &quot;It is only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything&quot;. Together they start &quot;fight club&quot;, a &quot;club&quot; with 8, not very confining rules, that hosts an underground society of men who explore their masculinity by fighting eachother and by doing so, achieve freedom within themselves. However Tyler and FightClub take a strange turn and Norton has to either continue on the path to enlightenment with Tyler or stop him before he carries out his plans of destroying the corporate world. Full of hundreds if not thousands of carefully placed hints, add ins, subtle jokes, subliminal &quot;messages&quot; (I find something new about the movie everytime I watch it. And trust me, I've watched it hundreds of times), and a fantastically well done twist at the end (which makes you want to go back and watch the movie again and again until you've discovered all the aspects that now seem to make so much more sense in light of the end twist), Fight Club gives us a dark, disturbing, satirical, and often hilarious view of the society we live in. <BR>The spectacular performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonhem Cater show how incredible these actors can really be and have resulted in my undying respect for them (a respect that, before this movie, was highly underdeveloped or non-exsistant)and smaller roles played by actors such as Jared Leto (&quot;Angel Face&quot;), Eion Bailey (Ricky aka &quot;Space Monkey&quot;), and Meatloaf (Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Paulson) contribute to the darkness, the satire, and the comedy of the film. Clearly an all around wonderful film, one that will go down in history and that will not be forgotten. <BR>This DVD version of the film just makes it all the better. It gives spectacular insight into the making of the film, the message of the film, and much more. I particularly enjoyed the commentary by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonhem Carter, and David Fincher. I highly recommend this DVD edition. I also recommend the book &quot;Fight Club&quot; by Chuck Phalahniuk.
B00005JG6R|5.0|If you like any anime or anything about the future this is a definite movie for you. There are 3 (in my opinion) main characters. They are Kaneda Tetsuo and Kae. The beginning is kind of slow in a way and hard to figure out. But as you go along it gets more action packed and then you figure out whats going on. Near the beginning Tetsou becomes a test lab expirement.(I couldn't stop myself from telling you) It would be a great buy for anyone 12 and above i think.
6303182577|5.0|No words can describe how wonderfully this film has captured the moment in the event which defined the Hippie Movement, which amazed the world by truley and fully living up to its catch phrase: \\"Three days of peace, love, and music\\", and which made those who did not attend wonder what they were thinking. <BR>The music, first and foremost, is truley wonderful. Spectacular performances by CSN, Joe Cocker, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Ten Years After, Richie Havens and so many more. I most especially enjoy watching Joe Cocker's rendition of \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\". His voice and the energy which radiates from him as he performs is truley mesmerizing. And of course who could forget Jimi Hendrix famous performance where he tore up his guitar with his captivating version of the National Anthem. I also love Country Joe's performance of \\"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die-Rag\\". A wonderful performance, it truley captivates the peace and love of the event as, toward the end of the song he encourages the audience to stand and sing to end the war...and the majority of the 500,000 or so audience members stand and sing along. <BR>But it's not just the music that make's this film wonderful. The film show's the organization of the event, the building of the stage etc... We meet the people who made the event possible. And when the people begin to enter the site without paying for tickets....and the producers realize how much money they've lost...they shrug it off and say that they don't mind because the event and the people loving eachother and sharing everything is such a beautiful thing...and that the money doesn't matter. Do producers of rock concerts (or producers of anything for that matter) ever say that money doesn't matter these days? It truley shows what a wonderful generation it was. The audience is beautiful as well, everyone being themselves, everyone having a good time and sharing the experience that was the last bang (and what a bang it was) for the Hippie Movement.

B000069HKH|5.0|I think the CD is great.  I've read the hype for a month before todays release and it lives up to it.  I didn't think an album relating in any way to 9/11 would be rewarding, however I was wrong.  It doesn't exploit , but it does remind us of that terrible day.  And like our country the Boss has risen again.  Rock on....
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is the unfortunate epitome of life in many suburban families.  A bunch of middle-class individuals worshiping the almighty dollar instead of worrying about family stability and moral values.  Foolishly thinking that once they have moved out of the city and have achieved a certain tax bracket, that all of life's problems will evaporate.  Just watch the evening news or read the newspaper...or look around most neighborhoods.  The families in American Beauty are not the stretched imagination of some Hollywood writer...those characters are based on what anyone can see, any day of the week.  A narrow-minded homophobic father who berates his only child every chance he gets - driving the kid to the very edge.  A miserable middle-aged man discontent with his job and his marriage - seeking affection from young girls to recapture his lost youth.  A middle-aged woman obsessed with money and status -seeking physical gratification as a substitute for other disappointments in life. Who, with any good sense can still say that American Beauty is a Hollywood farce?  The characters in this movie were desperate to find something, anything to fill their voids.  How many people make all the right decisions for all the wrong reasons?  The cast of American Beauty and Sam Mendes deserve all the accolades that were bestowed upon them (and more).  Hey, wake up...the truth does hurt - but sometimes pain has to precede the healing process.  American Beauty is worth a watch, with an open-mind (Spacey never disappoints).

0694003611|5.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite books.  She will be four soon and still loves this book! She enjoys the rhymes and bright, bold colors--and the bunny.<br />I think what makes this book so special, among many things, is that it's short, full of contrasting, bright colors, and the fact that \\"Mommy\\" is reading it.  I cuddle up with her and have the lights dimmed and she's dressed and ready for bed with her favorite blanket, relaxed and ready to look and listen.<br />The part after, \\"Goodnight comb, And goodnight brush,\\" where it next says, \\"Goodnight nobody,\\" I have placed a baby picture of my daughter and we say together, \\"Goodnight________,\\"(her name.)  She enjoys seeing herself in the book and I think it's great for her to basically tell herself to go to sleep!<br />The last full-page spread (which by the way, every colored page is a full-page spread) is particularly pleasant; the lights are dimmed in the baby bunny's room, he's in in his pajamas in his bed under the covers and the only things that are dominant and glowing are the moon and night stars, the fire in the fireplace, and the toyhouse's lights. Looking at that, what else would a child want to do but follow the bunny's lead and go to sleep? Goodnight Moon! (Big yawn...)<br />Suggestion: If your child doesn't want to let you leave after reading the book, you can make up your own \\"Goodnight ROOM\\" story and help him/her say goodnight to objects in his/her room. This in addition to the book, should do the trick!
6305263248|1.0|This is one of the most tedious movies I have ever seen.  I am amazed that other reviewers are discussing plot (was there a plot?) and I am equally amazed that Robert De Niro couldn't find something better to do.  It must have paid well.  The center of the story is a mysterious brief case...   It does afford an excuse for a couple splendid car chases in splendid European cars that you won't see on the streets of the U.S., the only reason I gave it even one star.  Oh, and there is the usual beautiful 20-something girl who...  So we get conflicting and, the director probably hopes, self-cancelling sexist/feminist versions of the usual Hollywood cliches.  If you are a serious German car nut, rent the DVD and skip to the car chases, otherwise I wouldn't bother.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I really liked the song New York, New York, but not enough to get the cd after reading a few reviews that said average. I am glad I finally overcame the 'corporate' reviews and went with a hunch. I am pleasantly surprised. Gold is an excellent collection of alternative, pop- country guitar rock that leads one back to the countrified Byrds period of the seventies. In fact, I would classify Adams' sound as very 'Gram Parsonish' with more leaning towards the rock side of country-rock that Parsons helped introduce.<br />NY, NY is a great poppy lead off track with the guitars setting the backdrop to quick poppy vocals. Firecracker continues the upbeat start with harmonica.  A nice one two opening. Answering Bell slows it down with a swampy swagger with steel guitar. La Cienega Just smiled is pure acoustic beauty while the Rescue Blues kicks in the  slow electric blues.  Who could have thought in this day and age that a 9+ minute song could hold your attention, but Nobody's Girl does. It is the kind of song that you can drift into and out of and then you realize it is still playing and what a great song it is! Gonna Make You love me is now recieving more airplay, yet is only an average song when compared to the other gems on this release.  Harder Now that it's Over is an interesting song in which Adams sings a little different than usual (and I can't quite figure out who he reminds me of...) to set a fine somber mood. Yes, there are a few average songs, but the jems shine and hold together a solid alt. country/rock release.......
B0000640VO|5.0|have just returned from seeing this movie  for the third time at my local cinema, and it is just as good as the first time. <BR>Despite the fact that i have always had a liking for horrormovies and that sort, this has turned out to be the best movie experience i have ever had, and it is definetely NOT a horrormovie. It is the wonderful tale of a young girls struggle to make other people happy and thereby making herself happy. Should you think that this sounds really boring, then let me tell you that in the hands of any other director than Jeunet it probably would be, but he manages to make it into not only a fantastic story but an audio-visual experience beyond anything i have seen in a long time.<BR>Not only is the story funny, charming and welltold, but the technical side of it all is also topnotch. The actors, especially Audrey Tautou(Amelie), the rest of the cast, the director Jeunet and the rest of the crew behind this film, has simply given themselves 110 procent. There is simply not one weak link in this movie.<BR>So if you are looking for a movie to cheer you up, or if you are just looking for something a little different than the usual hollywood-run of the mill, then give this great movie a chance. I promise you it is better than alcohol, drugs and pills, at least it put a big smile on my lips all of the times that i  have seen it!<br />PS. And if you can stop from falling helplessly in love love with Amelie then you must surely have a hard of stone or a very bad taste in women!<BR>PSS. Dont be fooled by the fact that Jeunet also made ...Alien 4, he has made a gigantic comeback here with Amelie. <BR>By the way while youre here, buy a copy of his two earlier french films \\"Delicatessen\\" and \\"City of the lost children\\", although they are not quite as good as Amelie, they are still very entertaining.
B00001PE4D|5.0|\\"Cruel Intentions\\" is without a doubt one of the best movies of 1999.  The characters of Sebastian and Kathryn are very sexy and manipulative, and it seems that throughout the movie they have everyone in their circle of friends and foes on very short leashes.  The story is simple: In an attempt of soiling, (yes I wrote 'soiling') the reputation of her ex boyfriend's new steady, (Blair), Kathryn, (Gellar), calls upon her sex driven step brother Sebastian, (Phillipe) to seduce her, thus tainting her name.  However Sebastian has grown weary of sleeping with the same type of women, and opts for a challenge: seducing the new headmaster's virgin daughter Annette, (Witherspoon).  Kathryn makes a bet with him, telling him he has no chance of success.  If he succeeds, he can sleep with her, if he loses, she gets his car. Deciding to take his sister up on her bet he seeks out Annette, and just for fun, he does what he sister asks of Cecile.  The one thing that really stands out in this movie is the soundtrack, it's awesome.  Perfect songs at the perfect time, helping set the scene's mood.  The supporting characters are very good too.  Joshua Jackson as Blaine is almost as cunning as Sebastian in his scenes, and the pure innocence of Selma Blair's Cecile is cute.  The subtle humor in the movie also makes it a winner.  A movie definately worth buying.
B000067DNC|5.0|WELL, MGM finally squeezed every penny out of sindication and now the second season is finally here! This season is considered to be the worst season of the series while season 1 is considered to be the best, especially the episode \\"politics\\", which was rated as the best episode ever. The second season only has 2 episodes that you can call good which are \\"family\\" and the extra episode the did not air on TV, but comes hidden on the third DVD of this set, \\"Lost\\" which is absolutly amazing. I give this five stars because its stargate and that alone makes it worth buying!!!
0792164903|5.0|With quite a different story and much darker tone, Tim Burton's new twist on this spooky tale still brings to life the eerie autumn atmosphere of  Washington Irving's classic.<br />Set in 1799, \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" follows the adventures of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York constable who is sent two days journey north to the tiny village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate who has committed a recent spate of gruesome beheadings.  A man of science and logic, Ichabod is most skeptical when the townspeople claim \\"The Headless Horseman\\" is responsible.  That is, until he witnesses a sample of the Horseman's handiwork himself!  What follows is a delightful blend of elements, with the film alternately a horror, fantasy, whodunit, romance and suspense.<br />The one problem with the film is that it delivers the goods too soon; there is little time spent building the mystery around the macabre spectacle of the Headless Horseman.  However, that does nothing to undermine an almost sufeit of visual and auditory treats - Tim Burton's intensely stylish (as always) direction takes off with Danny Elfman's brilliant (as always) score, uncanny visual effects, superb period detail, and scrumptious art direction, evoking the haunting and surreal atmosphere of Sleepy Hollow and the surrounding forest.  The scenes in which the Headless Horseman applies his trade are really fun, and while graphic, hardly gory, and done with a sense of wit and dark humor.  Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci stand out in a cast that could not be better.  Depp's idosyncratic portrayal of Ichabod Crane is perfectly complemented by the child-like beauty of Christina Ricci, and her delicate performance as Katrina Van Tassel.<br />On a misty October night with a crisp breeze blowing, I could suggest no better film to watch.  Just be certain not to loose your head.
B000069CWE|5.0|wow, great CD, beautiful remixes, new lyrics, nice music video built in, start saving your lunch money...
B000002HAF|5.0|this, the pixies 2nd record, is a great record. There are some classic moments on this album. the whole album is great, but especially the first 7 songs. bone machine is a great opener. something against you is one great song. gigantic is kim deal's only real song, and it's good. they use her very well, by only using her voice when is neccessary. &quot;where is my mind&quot; is one of the most memorable songs ever recorded, a gem. maybe their best song. the pixies had such great, obviously insane lyrics. so, in conclusion, one of the most influential, truly great records of all time.
B000069HKH|5.0|Stunning, as good as anything he has ever done. He brilliantly captures the raw searing pain and insurmoutable grief of that  horrific day in September.  To get  background for some of these songs  he contacted  widows of firefighters whose dead  husbands were big Springsteen fans. Hence a lot of the lyrics are based on the lives and histories of real people and real familes trying to cope with their loss. Bruce Springsteen has always preached the healing powers of Rock and Roll. In &quot;The Rising&quot; he succeeds in sharing our loss of 9/11, and giving us the hope that things will get better set to gorgeous lyrics and music.  I can't think of another artist who could have taken on such a huge project and succeeded with such dignity and grace. An 11 on a scale of 1-10
B000002H8F|5.0|bossanova is a spooky album. It is a very good album. A lot of people view this album as not as good as the others. I view it as a success. Bossanova doesn't sound like the other records. It doesn't even sound like any record i have ever heard. The album starts with a instrumental. (ehh!!!). song 2, \\"rock music\\" is good. \\"allison\\" is very good. song 6, \\"ana\\" is great. In my opinion, THE highlight of the album is \\"The Happening\\", one of their best songs. Some \\"wacked out\\" (need i explain more)people think it's their best work. It's not. However, it is GREAT. Definately an album any fan should have.
B000069HKH|5.0|He's back and better than ever.  Come on, who else is going to come forward when he is needed the most?  In uncertain times, the Boss strikes the right chord of familarity (with the E Street Band), inspiration, and caring.  He is the genius of our times, and reunited with his E Street buddies, he is here to Rise again.  All tracks are excellent, but The Rising really inspires, My City of Ruins hits all the right markers, and Further on up the Road will surround you with its sincerity.  Mary's Place parties on, and the other dozen tracks challenge and move you like no one else can.  Five stars for the Boss and the E-Streeters.
B00003CXA6|5.0|The special features on the DVD version make it worth buying again if you have already purchased the VHS release.  If you don't already own it, what are you waiting for? The commentary track not only gives additional insight into the battle but the craft of filmmaking as well.  Interviews with cast and crew highlight The Making of Gettysburg documentary also included in the DVD.
B000069CWE|5.0|Ok, I know it's a remix album and everything which sort of made me hestitate on giving it five stars simply because it's not all new material.  I have loved Linkin Park since their early days so of course I picked up a copy early this morning and I had no idea how amazing this album is.  Hybrid Theory truly probably is my all time favorite CD due to lyrics and the music of it in general but I have to admit this album almost does or does top even Hybrid Theory.  The remixes of each song is absolutely amazing and takes some of these songs to a new spinning edge and 180's them in ways that truly make Linkin Park still a cutting edge band in today's seemingly \\"all the same\\" music released over this past year.  Ok, now for the tracks...\\"Points of Authority\\" with it's new militant sound (and video too!) excels even over the original...\\"Pushing Away\\" builds with the true passion of the lyrics and even flips itself to being even more aggressive than the first.  I could go on about every track forever but that would take too long...the only songs I was not crazy about the remixes of where \\"In the End\\" and \\"High Voltage\\" even though they still are extremely good.  Definately a CD to buy, even if you are not a big Linkin Park fan...it has everything in it!
0446677450|5.0|Very good. Read it. Live it. Refer to it.<br />This book will change your outlook on money and work. This is not a how to book, rather  this is the what to do before you read a how to book. This explains how to expand the CONTEXT of your mind as well as the CONTENT in your mind. Very inspirational by making things that seem difficult to grasp appear to be a bit more attainable.<br />Just read it.
B00003CXN4|4.0|Beautifully directed and photographed. The acting is wonderful. Benicio del Toro shows an amazing range (including pain, grief, ambivalence, and sensuality). The problem with this movie is that the director poses real politicians and personalities to deliver perfect little sound-bites about the drug war. The problem is that these sound bites are delivered in such a scripted and stilted way. You can almost hear the director's cues, and ultimately the effect breaks the mood. You're suddenly thinking, hey, there's Senator so-and-so and he's spouting some fairly obvious platitudes about the drug war. An excellent, if not perfect, movie nonetheless.
B000069HKH|1.0|Give any third-rate singer songwriter 6 months and the assignment to write songs which reflect on September 11, and you would definately get a better record than this one.  The Rising has the same worn-out musical mid-life crisis sound that Bruce has been wallowing in since &quot;The River&quot;.  Boring, child-like in simplicity and over-hyped.  Avoid this one like the plague.
B000069CWE|5.0|I got this cd the day it came out and wow -- the remixes are just sick.  If you liked the 1st album you'll like this one, especially if you're into techno remixes.  This is a sweet cd, I think every LP fan should own this.
6304458304|5.0|This is a powerful story about Clint Eastwood as an aged secret service agent who has experienced turmoil in his life. Once a young brash man who rose to a position to protect the president, he has fallen onto hard times with the personal guilt of having seen his president  assasinated. By chance he has the opportunity to redeem his life and once again defend the president. John Malkovich portrays the potent and sinister, yet very personable ex-CIA assassin who has revenge for the government that betrayed him. We are drawn through the eyes of Clint Eastwood's character as he battles one last time to combat a strategy of this cunning opponent to perhaps, rebuild the life that was taken from him.
B00005RRG9|5.0|I remember seeing the remake of &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; on TV once, and I was immediately turned away by it. I am also sorry to say that it didn't exactlymake it a priority to watch the classic version either. But then the Vault Disney collection were announced, and I had a sudden urge to see how good this movie is, supposedly.<br />I have to agree with almost all of the previous reviews: &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; is a great Disney classic. Although I prefer live action Disney classics that do not take place in &quot;modern&quot; settings, the story and the great acting by Hayley Mills really won me over. She does an excellent job protraying the twins, SO good that I am having trouble remembering to type &quot;she&quot; and not &quot;they&quot;. The twins are two seperate individuals and you can tell that Mills did some homework to make each character it's own.<br />The Vault Disney DVD offers a wide variety of bonuses, the best of which is the Making Of The Parent Trap. I also liked &quot;Hayley Mills: A Disney Legend&quot;, which chronicles Mills' professional career at Disney. Another great bonus is the &quot;Disney 1960 Album&quot; which shows clips of all the projects that Walt Disney oversaw in that year. I also enjoyed a 20+ min segment of a vintage Disneyland episode, which was used to promote the movie in 1960.
B000066C8G|4.0|THE FILM: I rented Zoolander hearing it was very, very good, even better than Meet the Parents. Now, I don't think that's quite true, but Zoolander comes close.<BR>Ben Stiller is hilarious as Derek Zoolander, a very stupid \\"male model\\" with some stupid friends. (Example: his friends get in a fight at a gas station, pouring gasoline on each other- guess what happens) Owen Wilson is also great as Hansel, a very hippie-philisophical male model that threatens Derek's career. I found myself laughing over and over again, especially at the hilarious character Mugatu. This is a good movie, generally underrated and completely original.<BR>MY GRADE: B+
0812513495|5.0|This was a way diffrent book then I expected. The plot is wonderful, but kind of hard to follow. YOu really have to pay close attention to every word. The main plot is a boy, about 6 is transferred to a space station where they train to kill and destroy buggers(aliens). Ender is supposed to be the best of the best, and he is. But life here is not so easy. Jealousies, Trials and Fears dominate the air. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. If you like Sci Fi, this book is for you.
B000002MI4|5.0|You who long for the same elation you experienced when you first got enlighted by Costello's early works such as Armed Forces, My aim is true and This years model may want to look elsewhere. As a Costello &quot;fan&quot; you never know what to expect from the master himself. This excellent work is unique and beautiful. It's not a naive cross-over record combining rock singing and classical music as some of you might expect.The juliet letters shows us Costello's narrative and vocal talents and at the same time his ability to write string-quartet pieces.Without doubt one of his best works.Buy, buy!
B00005QB9A|5.0|Great movie - couldn't remember why the &quot;r&quot; rating though....
6304490119|5.0|This is a fabulous story about Egyptian History in the fold of a Sci-Fi genre. A down and out Egyptologist is given a chance to prove his worth by deciphering an ancient object secretly discovered in a archeological dig decades before. Through his ingenuity and some luck, he solves that mystery of the translation only to find that the object is really a portal to a planet lightyears away. <br />This is a story of romance, of action and of suspense that created the legacy  and the craze of the Stargate SG-1 series.
B00006674X|4.0|This was a good movie, touching in it's sentiment.  If it wasn't Elvis, then there wouldn't be the immediate expectation of a bad movie (thanks to many bad Elvis movie's) and therefore the self-fullfilling prophecy effect of already being predisposed to ridicule it from the \\"git-go\\".  I don't find ANYTHING WHATSOEVER unbelievable about a ghetto doctor working in a clinic and some nuns are sent to help as missionaries, doesn't that happen all the time?  Why, because it's an Elvis movie, does that suddenly sound like the plot revolved around an alien U.S. president having an affair with Miss Piggy?  Elvis' acting is the some of the best I'd ever seen him do, why?  Because he saw that this wasn't an excuse to sing songs to turtles and guys he just beat up, there was a serious story here.  In the spirit of King Creole, Elvis could only be a good actor in a good movie, otherwise he didn't give a hoot.  And he looks great, \\"the dry look\\" beatle-esque haircut he had in this movie and regular-guy wardrobe really took him in a more natural direction.  And someone mentioned it was \\"dated\\" - yeah it's dated 1969 that's 33 years ago would you expect to see a story about computer hackers with cell-phones glued to their ears?  Maybe we should digitally update the film and insert 2000 Corvettes and sterile buildings made of glass so it can be fake like people who say things like that like it.  Keep watching movie's like Men In Black where every line of dialogue is a set up for a bad joke, I'll decline.  It is what it is - it's Elvis last acting role and he did a great job.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I don't see why this film has been getting the praise it has.  I heard all the hype and said, boy I think I should rent that one.  Unfortunately it made absolutely no sense.  The film ended and me and a friend looked at each other in disgust.  Nothing really happens.  I couldn't make out a plot, and I was really hoping they would clear things up in the end, making it a good movie, but no, the ending makes you want to hang yourself with a belt or something.  I should have known when I heard that David Lynch directed it.  Has anyone seen Dune?  I read the whole series and then saw the movie and haven't seen a worse film adaption of a book since Breakfast of Champions with Bruce Willis.  All in all, this movie kind of [was bad].  But if you just want to see two chicks get naked and make out, and you don't really mind the total absense of a story or a plot or cohesiveness or relavence of any kind, then by all means...
B000069HKH|5.0|As I received my copy of &quot;the rising&quot; yesterday and having listened to it now twice, I am still hearing many overtones of what happened 9/11. His words echo saddness, hope,and optimism of recovery.<br />Being a fan for almost thirty years, this recording will no doubt last in our minds as long as &quot;born in the usa&quot;, &quot;born to run&quot;, but for differnet reasons. Songs like &quot;empty sky&quot; and &quot;paradise&quot; really paint a picture that I believe every person will attain a different meaning.<br />There are some rockers &quot;further on&quot; and &quot;waiting for a sunny day&quot;. Some nice work from the &quot;big man&quot; its good to have him back and some nice backing vocals by Mrs Springsteen.<BR>This may not spin the big radio hits, but no one giving this a listen will be disappointed.
B000067CPX|3.0|By the way is an alright cd. If you stand it next to some other albums..say, BSSM..its not that good. But on its own it stands at a 3 star. THe songs arent that bad, but if you compare it to their other albums, its really not their style. if someone were to listen to it, RHCP is NOT what would come to their minds. Where are all of Flea's great solos? True, the peppers are changing..i.e. californication, but still, where are the old chili peppers funk rock? They do best at hardcore music. And also, if you started liking the peppers because of Californication, then you would like this cd. BUT, if you are like me and started listening to them from BSSM, you will not think its that good. But still after all that, my suggestion is buy the cd. It is a rhcp cd, and its really not TOO bad. Its not as good as the others, but its worth getting it. But if you do buy it, also if you dont have them, buy the other cd's. BSSM is their best, and any pepper fan who says otherwise, is..well..NOT a true RHCP fan! And if you think I dont like RHCP or something, its my favorite band next to zeppelin! anyone who got introduced to RHCP thru californication has a very insignificant opinion, sorry!
B000069CWE|4.0|If you dug Linkin Park's recent collaboration with The X-Ecutioners &quot;It's Goin' Down&quot;, then you will definitely like this CD. A quick note to fans of Hybrid Theory(their debut): This disc has more of a hip-hop/breakbeat flava and the guitar-riffs are almost nonexistent. Therefore, I highly recommend giving this a listen before outright buying it. There are 20 tracks on this CD. 5 of them could be considered fillers; 3 answering machine messages, 1 intro, and 1 instrumental. The songs from Hybrid Theory that have been reanimated are &quot;Points of Authority&quot;, &quot;In The End&quot;, &quot;Forgotten&quot;, &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;, &quot;Place For My Head&quot;, &quot;With You&quot;, &quot;Papercut&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;By Myself&quot;, &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot;, &quot;One Step Closer&quot;(featuring vocals by Jonathan Davis of Korn), and &quot;Crawling&quot;(featuring vocals by Aaron Lewis of Staind). The new tracks include &quot;X-Ecutioner Style&quot;, &quot;High Voltage&quot;, and &quot;My December&quot;. At first, I was unsure whether or not some of the songs would be edited for lyrics(language), but thankfully they are. The only reason I rated this CD 4 of 5 stars is because it's not the dance/trance genre which I prefer, but I purchased this disc mainly because of the great flava of breakbeat music, which I also prefer. In closing, I say, don't delay, checkout  &quot;Reanimation&quot; today! If my review was helpful to you, then don't forget to vote!
B00005JLDW|2.0|I came away from Reign of Fire very disappointed.  The trailer showed an action packed movie with modern technology battling dragons.  An idea that is very cool in concept, but very poor in this execution.  Based on all the TV, print, and trailer advertising, I was expecting a fast-paced action movie with dog fights between the dragons and the humans in aircraft.  It seems like the logical sort of action for a movie with this premise.<br />Imagine my disappointment when the movie turned out to be mostly a survival drama with long gaps between mediocre action sequences.  Set 20 years AFTER the dragons have destroyed most of the Earth, you have a small community of survivors holding fort in an old castle, and an even smaller group of soldiers with very little in the way of an arsenal or army.  It's like taking the 1500s time period and injecting a couple of military vehicles and dragons.<br />The poster for the movie shows 14 helicopters.  There was only ONE in the movie.  The poster also shows 6 dragons.  We only see TWO.  The advertising and the movie being advertised were two complete different animals.  If they had shown at least one of the first battles between the humans and dragons -- instead of just *telling* us about it in voice over and skipping ahead 20 years -- I might have let this movie pass with a higher rating.  But as it stands, it is a so-so movie that in no way delivers what the advertising promised.
0316666343|4.0|This novel is really engaging. It is a subject I have never read before, i.e. the dead person watching the reaction from heaven of her family and friend after her murder. I do wish there could have been a bit more character development. I loved Samual and Hal but it seemed that they just appeared in the book. I wanted to love them more but couldn't because I didn't know them well enough. I was a bit taken aback by the sexual encounter, it made me think of the movie Ghost. But overall this is a great novel, I really could not put it down. Alice Sebold has a beautiful voice.
0446678430|4.0|Mr. Kiyosaki's ideas and strategies can be used to help people diversify an investment portfolio.  Generating alternative means of income is an important point he stresses.  This book is an easy read with an upbeat pace.  The motivation and dedication he lives is illustrated in the flow of the book.  However, too many plugs for his other books and books of his friends are listed throughout the book.
B000000W6F|5.0|I think it is necessary to give a review of this album.  More than 10 years have passed since i heard it, and it s a really 'good' album.  B Corgan does things w Zwan now but this is remembered.<br />There are so many influences here.  It sounds like true Pumpkins, but we have some Floyd, Hendrix, etc.  Crush sounds like it borrowed a bit from Meddle and Atom Heart mother of PF, and other songs here well sound nothing like any other group.  <br />This is an album of all hits.  I was 16 when i first heard it back in '91, now i'm 27 and it feels like it has a timeless quality to it.  I feel i'll be 35 and 45 and i'll get it out to hear it.<br />Cheers to this band.  <br />4 1/2 stars
B00005B36H|5.0|With Laturalus, TooL finally shed most of their more juvenile antics to craft an awe inspiring piece of music.  It is extremely rare to find a band with so much potential, and even rarer when such a band pushes itself to the very limits of its musical ability.  <br />The results are staggering but not self indulgent.  The band weave through some of the most difficult time signatures \\"rock\\" bands have  exposed us to since King Crimson, but the band never allows the music itself to become simply an exercise in ability (as KC sometimes does).  <br />The sound of TooL on Lateralus is as energetic and vibrant as any of their earlier works, but much more mature.  The lyrics are extremely involving, and have evolved beyond the point of needing shock or curse words for effect.  Although it's sure to disappoint some of their younger fans hoping for an f-bomb every five seconds, the maturity of the lyrics makes them more powerful, not less so.<br />The title track, arguably the best of the album (and the current finale on their tour), uses all of TooL's musical technique to the fullest.  From extended buildups to massive crescendoes, the song rides a tidal wave of emotion, from contemplative to ecstatic.  <br />This album is one of a very few pieces of music crafted in the past five years worth owning.  I cannot reccomend it highly enough.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is a wonderful album. Even though many songs evoke the horror of the attacks on the WTC, there is a spirit of hope and redemption which is palpable throughout the songs. There are some weaker songs (Nothing Man didn't do much for me), but at almost 74 minutes playing time there almost have to be. I especially liked the world music touch on Worlds Apart and the already famous My City of Ruins which of course was played during the Tribute to Heroes broadcast. The lyrics of Paradise and You're Missing are exceptionally moving. Mary's Place, on the other hand, is a joyful celebration of life.<BR>There's not much music of this quality around any more.

0195067142|5.0|\\"With The Old Breed\\" is a stunning eye witness account of one Marines trip from Boot Camp to the South Pacific during World War II.  Sledge writes an autobiographical and historical account of his own experiences as a member of K Company, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division.  Coming late to the war in 1944, Sledge \\"only\\" participates in two of the famous 1st Marine battles - Peleliu and Okinawa.  Throughout his account he speaks of his training, the closeness of combat and the horrors of war.<br />After initially enlisting in the Marines in 1942, Sledge enrolled in Marine ROTC but like may others in his class, he felt the call of the war and after a semester he went to boot camp.  It was here that he got his first taste of Marine training.  By this time the Marines had plenty of combat veterans who had been rotated home to fill the ranks of instructors.  The effect of having veterans train the newest can be measured by their initial survival in combat.  The instructors prepared Sledge and his peers well with tough, realistic training - training that would keep them alive in the first days in combat.  His state side training was followed up with more once he reached the Pacific and a healthy dose of iron discipline.  Again, the hard training paid off for Sledge.  Later in the war the Marines ran out of time for proper training and integration of new troops.  The result was dead Marines, to new to know what to do.  Training and discipline were the difference between life and death in the initial days in combat.  Sledge received and absorbed his training and went home without a scratch.<br />Though Sledge does not specifically address it, I was struck by the closeness of the combat he faced.  Peleiu was a only 12 square miles - 6 miles long by 2 miles wide.  Given that the average artillery piece of the day could range more than 6 miles, Peleiu was a division sized knife fight that lasted 30 days.  30 horrible days of almost non-stop fighting.  Even when sent to the \\"rear\\" artillery and snipers were a constant danger.  Okinawa was more of the same but on a larger scale.  60 miles long and between 2 and 18 miles wide, the Americans put a Field Army up against more than 100,000 entrenched Japanese.  The vast majority of the island was covered by indirect fire and snipers were again a constant danger.  Multiple Corps fought side by side where the island was barely 3 miles across.  That anyone survived let alone prevailed through 80 days of bullets filling the air is amazing.<br />Unlike many military writers who only saw combat in pictures, Sledge was there.  He writes a Marines thoughts in Marine words.  And unlike writers who wax poetic about the intense experience of men under fire, Sledge repeatedly calls warfare what it is - a waste.  A waste of men and material.  A destroyer of lives and land.  The only good he finds in his service are the friendships that were born and continue.  Okinawa is an \\"abyss\\" and he tells of a battlefield so littered with dead that pieces of flesh fly with the shrapnel and mud flung by exploding artillery and mortars.  He recalls a friend tricking him into not pulling the gold teeth out of a dead corpse by warning him of germs.  Only later does he realize that his friend was trying to save his soul not his health.<br />When old men sit and decide to send young men to kill and be killed, they should be forced to read Sledge's words.  War not only kills but also justifies killing.  There are times and places where there is no other way.  Times when the greater good can only come from the horror of war.  But those times are few and I doubt someone like Sledge could find many after seeing first hand what war does to both those who die and those who survive.n sent to the \\"rear\\" artillery and snipers were a constant danger.

B000069HKH|5.0|This a remarkable landmark for bruce's career and it calls upon some greater power for us to achieve full listening pleasure. All of the tracks scream for some sort of &quot;rise&quot; to live our lives in the best that we can and to always remember those who perish.  In an age of pop plastic Springsteen delivers a marvel that can almost be described as a modern day classic. A perfect album for anyone's music collection.
0140544518|4.0|Anyone (and I mean ANYONE) raised in the western industrialized world of the twentieth/early twenty-first century has at some point heard the story of the three little pigs. But not everybody has heard it told like this.<br />I love Jon Scieszka's \\"The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs.\\"<br />This version is from the wolf's side of the story. And Mr. Wolf is a deliciously suspicious (if not untrustworthy) narrator. In correcting the story that we, the public, have blindly swallowed whole, Mr. Wolf has hopefully vindicated himself while doing us all a great service. This whole charade was the fault of the dull-witted, untrusting pigs.<br />\\"The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs\\" is a powerful parable about what it means to be a good or bad neighbor. If the tragedy of this story teaches us nothing else, it is at least hilariously entertaining.<br />I give this book my full recommendation.

It's awesome - and coming from a non-jazz fan, that's a huge compliment!!! The songs are so beautiful and sultry and her voice is just simply amazing!! When I have my \\"ME\\" time, I light the candles, pop in this CD and lay back and relax to some truly beautiful music. Highly recommend this CD!!!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I'll admit, I wasn't sure what to think of the movie after the first viewing. However, the second time I saw it, it was wonderful. <BR>The plot's a good old-fashioned love story. Some might call it tired or cliched, but that only applies when it's not done well. When I saw the story unfold, I felt like I was watching the love story for the first time. When the first few words are spoken, you know that this is going to be a tragedy, yet the whole way through, there's plenty of laughter, plenty of high, giddy emotion. Just like the character of Zidler, everything in this movie's so over-the-top, you can't help but crack a smile and laugh. The best thing about this movie that I can say is that it made me feel. Usually when I watch a movie, I get all analytical and wonder about motivations and reasons for the characters' actions and all that garbage. For this, I just let go and let things come. I can't name too many movies that manage to do that.
