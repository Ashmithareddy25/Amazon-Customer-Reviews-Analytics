B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game... Ever. Oh my God. It's Bejewled on steroids. Favorite game on the kindle. Make more levels please! I'm blown away.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Gabriella kept me turning page after page, waiting to see how far Gabriella would push the envelope. I don't know that much about cricket, but find myself dreaming about it after reading this book. The main character is a delightful tease and kept my desire to jump tight in the pages and join in. The novel is a clever lesson in the battle between social class and the constantly changing dynamics between the sexes.<br />Wonderful read.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book cover to cover. Having tasted the freedom of being in business for myself for the past two years, this book confirmed everything I have encountered. Now thinking about ideas to make the business run more by itself, so I can increase the freedom and flexibility I now enjoy, this book gives me much to work from..not too much. After reading this, I feel like I could start another business and be successful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game, easy to play and quite addicting. Works well with the kindle. Actually easier to play thanks to the bigger screen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is so awesome but hard. I am at level 25 and stuck. I think this is so cool but hard.
B00F33E3C0|5.0|Excellent beignets book and also good to refresh your german language if it's been a while. Only wish there was more than one book or it had more stories.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Since cable is getting was too expensive, I now have Hulu Plus, Prime, Netflix.  Chromecast is so easy to hook up and the picture on the tv is very good.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I'm educated, I went to college.  I can appreciate works of \\"art\\" and I have done.  However, to watch this movie is to waste time and money on a kaleidoscope of someone else's brain vomit.  If I hadn't read the synopsis, I very seriously doubt I would have had a clue what this movie was about.  Scattered images and very little dialogue thrown together in a pathetic attempt to seem \\"arty\\" when, in fact,  it comes off as very contrived and forced.  When filmmakers come up with this tripe, I can only imagine that they have simply forgotten the \\"point\\" which is to entertain the viewer.  I was not entertained.  Only shallow people attempting to exhibit nonexistent depth are even going to pretend they enjoyed this viewing experience.  However, if you marvel at seeing wonderful actors spin around in the sun and actually NOT act (or even speak audibly); if you enjoy watching a movie presented very similarly to a dream I had last night; or, if you are out to impress that cute blond in your liberal arts classes by feigning intellectualism -- then by all means, go for it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has done a masterful job with this book. He grabbed my attention in the first chapter and never let go until the end. A wonderfully entertaining read.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I have an iPad, Nook color and a Nook Tablet, and it works on all three.  And if you follow directions, you can go on the internet through WIFI.  No complaints.
0062238868|5.0|I can;t say anything bas about his so if you dont have time to read it, get it on audiobook!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series :) the story pulls tears to my eyes, I can feel her pain...I would recommend to everyone!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I re-read The Shining before I downloaded Dr Sleep to refresh my memory. I love how Mr. King ties everything together, especially carrying through the family element. I usually refuse to pay so much for a digital copy, but I'm glad that I caved. This book is absolutely worth it.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|It was clear to see why this picture gained so much acclaim. My wife felt the actors got  inside the skin of the roles.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is amazing and awesome and gave me lots of fun and enjoyment. When I played it gave me lots of joy.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Much better than the previous version.  I like the multiple download thing, it's really cool. I would definitely reccomend it.
006202406X|1.0|I loved the first two books. They were exciting, funny, serious, and action packed. I love Tris and Tobias. They are a couple that has gone through so many trials and suffering, but they have managed to stay together and grow through it all. I hated the third book. I really didn't like the alternating perspectives. Now don't get me wrong, it has a place, (one of my other favorite books series is written with alternating perspectives) but it seemed odd and didn't  mesh with the series since the first two were not written that way. Also, in a world where life is crazy and the world sometimes throws terrible things your way who doesn't want a happy ending. The theme of hope has been there throughout the series only to be crushed at the end. I know the author was trying to be different and new but it failed. Veronica, your fans loved you, how did you not see this ending upsetting them? Did you just write the book to make money knowing fans would buy the third book without question? I hope Hollywood changes the ending for the movies.
B0002HWJUK|5.0|I collected all the smurfs in the 70s / 80s with my son. Collecting again has brought back the memories!
B000FC1PNE|5.0|We know the story will end well but to go through the process of falling in love reminds us of our own personal journey when we too discovered love right before our very eyes.  Penelope's journey from a wallflower into a self-confident woman is in itself worth the<br />read.  Kudos to Lady Danbury for helping Penelope achieve her dreams from spinster into womanhood.  Julia Quinn has done an excellent job in writing the Bridgerton series.
B0002HWO8C|4.0|I don't recall this particular figure from the original collection back in the 70s / 80s but added to the collection.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I didn't think they could top last season, but they are of to a great start. Plenty of victims now.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I am so happy i purchased this mic.  The audio is wonderful.  I am using it to  capture audio for short films, and web purposes.  The only CON is that there is no way of telling how much battery you have used up or have left.  There is no light indicator to alert you off that.<br />  But on the PROS side, the manufacturer says that it has something like 1000 hr battery use out of a single battery.  There is an ON and OFF switch so you have to remember to turn it on.  One word of advise that threw me off...The first time i tried it, i turned it on and had it plugged in my handheld audio recorder  and i couldn't figure out why the mic wasn't working.  After fiddling with it much i figured out that the mic was not the problem, i never hit REC to activate the mic, so that's why i couldn't hear the audio LOL.  But once i figured it out I was loving the audio it was recording.  Now to make it wireless i plug it into my handheld voice recorder and put that in my pocket to conceal the whole thing and that's how i rec audio, then i just match the audio with the vid later.  Or you can directly connect the mic to whatever camera/camcorder you are using.  It's just my way of making it wireless :)  Some reviews were also saying they have issue installing the battery but there are some great vid instructions around the net that helps you with that and i had no issues in that part :)  Also REMEMBER THIS IS NOT WIRELESS, but it hasn't bothered me at all because the cord is far more than generous (about 20ft).  For the purpose i use it for the mic conceals easily inside you shirt and last time i used it i was surprised that the mic was picking up the audio of the other person sitting next to me during my conversation which was perfect because at first i thought i might have to mic them up too !!! I love the product enough that i am buying a second one very soon and all my friends who are interested in it love it.  Audio- Technica has put out a great mic IMO for the budget conscious buyer.  I am very happy with this product....buyer.  I am very happy with this product....
B006S01GH2|5.0|I don't usually like movies with subtitles, but this was well worth the inconvenience.  Amelie is delightful!  Story is heart-warming
B008JFUO72|5.0|Lots of action is continued in this film.  If you are a follower of this series then you won't be disappointed!!!!!!
B005USZYDU|5.0|Different view of the legal system. Enjoyable reading, liked the way  Grisham  wrote from a child's view point. Interesting story with a sense of humor and humanity .
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book gave exactly what I wanted and more. WARNING! Do not read when you are emotionally unstable; I you are as into the characters a I am then you will probably cry for a few days even when you are emotionally stable. But it's a great book with a solid plot and many unexpected elements.
B005V5WBFG|4.0|So far is working as indicated. I hope it keep working as it does, not as other products that I tried before.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|The zealot was well written and I found it very interersting. I also felt that I had learned things about the historcal Jesus that differed from the traditional Chrstian teachings. I believe Reza Ason's version to be more objective and accurate.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Been waiting for this a long time! Love it so far. Level 30 is a bit of a challenge for me.....
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I am stuck on the spot with the amulet. Can anyone please help. Thank you.  Also this game is very challenging. Between my mom and I we couldn't even play this game
0062109383|5.0|Do we still? Great insights in an intimate tone. Smith shows us the world of art, poetry and music of the late 60's and early 70's and how they got by with little money in New York City.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|i love this game so much but im out of boosters and cant beat this one level and i cant buy any my mom wont let me. its a great game and i think everyone should get it its fun and addictive.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love the feel: muddy, cold, gritty - and the acting is flawless.  Eddard and Robert are wonderful in this episode.  I am glad it was done as a mini-series so they can take their time and tell the whole story.
B00338QENI|5.0|Spellbinding story, incredible research, gifted writing!  Rebecca Skloot's relentless pursuit and passion to tell this story has yielded a masterpiece.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This is my first Neil Young cd and I love it.  I have always enjoyed his music, but never bought any.  This cd sounds great. It has been re-mastered and it shows in how clear it sounds.  If you like Neil and want all the good music I recommend this disk.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I also was waiting for a Kindle version of this popular game.  What a disappointment!  This game is a shameless attempt to extort money from the players. You play a few trys<br />at a level and then it tells you to go away - for a few minutes up to 24 hours - OR you can pay and keep playing. Well, I went away for good!  Try Bejewelled, it is very similar but with better graphics and they actually let you play!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Spoilers! Some of the best stories of all time don't have a happy ending and I admit that it was what I was hoping for. I just finished this yesterday and was a little let down because of Tris' death. After thought and reflection it really gives the book the purpose it intended.  The ultimate sacrifice for the greater Good. Being completely selfless and brave at the end. Abnegation and dauntless All the way. If you wanted a different ending imagine your own its just a story. Overall I say it was a beautiful conclusion Tris saved them all.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Okay I got this game because it was free and I needed something to play while my singing monsters were waiting to hatch; this thing is addictive. Be warned, the only thing is the waiting to get your lives back but you can buy things inside the game but it your like me and don't like spending real money in a make believe world then you will just wait on your new lives or do without power boosters. Fun game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad you finally got this game! Hope you can get access to more of the games on Facebook. This one needs to come with addiction warnings!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Just pointless is all I can say. I'm completely disappointed. This book has made me regret even starting the series. Who does this to her fans?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! It is somewhat addictive though. I play candy crush saga all the time and still really enjoy it! Plus, there are tons of levels so it will take a long time to finish.
0783219733|5.0|My husband loves watching this.  He is disabled from a stroke and watches this over and over and laughs each time.  I enjoy listening to him laugh.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I liked the book very much except, the part where dan exhaled the cancer onto the true knot members.  Too much john coffeyish.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|I received my Sony LX300USB turntable as a Christmas gift last year. It's not a high-end turntable with great sound quality, but it worked for playing my vinyl records through my audio system. Using the product to rip vinyl to digital files was a mess -- the software didn't read track skips, so ripping one album turned into hours of work manually editing many parts of the album into separate tracks.<br /><br />The digital capabilities aren't the worst part... I was fine forgetting the conversions and using the turntable for listening to vinyl. However, after about 9 months of use, the needle broke off of the stylus cartridge. I looked for a replacement, but couldn't find one to fit the model. So, I called Sony to check on the replacement stylus, and they told me it was a model-specific part that was only available from Sony... at $47! The entire turntable cost about $130, and this isn't a high-end turntable where you'd expect to invest this type of money in a replacement stylus. Now, I'm looking for a new turntable.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! And be sure to do your homework before buying any Sony product, to ensure you don't get ripped off replacing parts that are only available from Sony at highway robbery prices.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What more can you say about this book. It is wonderful. Have purchased all three and looking forward to the movie.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Two and a half stars. Takes a LOT of suspension of disbelief. Still fun if you like zombie flicks though.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This is so simple and yet profound. A short truthful snapshot of the life cycle in a functional family. Everyone needs to read this one.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|it did not work for me, tried it twice, to no avail.  So I would not recommend to any body.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Hey you! yes you! get this app I does not drain your battery it just tells you the weather and when the sun will rise and set I recommend this app for 7-up it I very useful and helpful when your outta town!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love competing with my Facebook friends on this game. Challenging, Addictive and Fun! Easy to advance through the levels, even when you have  to enlist the help of your friends!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pe is awesome! it needs the ender dragon though,  and also a spawn human feature,  but otherwise it is great!  I got a cast on my right arm,  so I cannot play with bolth hands.<br />but it is still epic.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I dont think you need to be stuck on a level for months on end. I get bored with the wait
B00992CF6W|5.0|Omg i love this game!! Last time i was playing and i found 11 pieces of gold in one mine if u know what i mean!!!:)Fellow Minecraft nerds
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Overall I am very happy with the game. Other then being stuck on a level for so long<br />And getting lives
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Dracula. Great book. I loved all the characters particularly Dr. Van Helsing. Thought the beginning of the book that took place in Dracula's castle was a dark image.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Best game I've ever bought its so much fun you can't not do anythingcyyc it v out chug ;) b Lily b dBm dBm the great
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I think this album is just a starting point to Ariana's singing career. I love the beats. I have noticed that most of her songs share common elements. It seems like similar sounding tracks were used for some of the songs. Her voice is incredible. She has a lot of soul with an infusion of pop. I think her raw voice gets muted by some of the tracks but it does have moments when it shines through. Keep up the good work. Ariana's voice is amazing.
B00594XOZU|1.0|All i have to say is that i used this to keep in contact now i cant keep in contact with people
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This must be the most versatile and sturdy backpack I've ever come across. It has almost limitless room and I can keep everything well organized within. I can only recommend it.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|GAME HAS HAD ANY UPDATES WOULD MAKE THE GAME 1000000 TIMES BETTER<br />I WOULD ALWAYS PLAY THE GAME IF IT UPDATES BUT STILL A GOOD GAME AND I DO RECOMMEND IT
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Some levels are better than others~ But  I am glad I can finally play on my Kindle fire :-) hey
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first 12 chapters were well done but the book falls apart after that. I appreciated being spared the typical happy ending, but this book didn't add much to the overarching plotlines. In the end the whole series falls flat. Also, Tris and Tobias alternate as first-person but their voices are indistinguishable- annoying.
B009V0TV6O|1.0|Heading indicates that the app is the $1.99 app offerred as free app of the day.  Make no mistake.  This is the free version warts and all.  Amazon... you freakin' suck.  Uninstalled.
B00005NTJM|5.0|I was missing this CD in my collection and was not able to find it in stores.  The additional tracks are great.  This was rather a jazzy album and does not sound dated at all.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|I rarely ever watch a movie more than once. This one I did.<br /><br />I have read the Judge Dredd comics and I loved them. I was excited the for the first one with Stallone. I watched that one only once. :) As one commenter pointed out, the movie discards the fluff that was present in the first version. This is a great adaptation of the comic book character. Just plain ole judgement. Nothing more and nothing less. It is gritty and the camera work is great.<br /><br />Additionally, the acting is good. There are no weird characters or cheesy lines. Most importantly, it is action packed all the way. No introspection or pensive moments boring you to death.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have been waiting for the kindle version, and am so happy it's finally here.  This is a very fun, sweet game that keeps your blood sugar regulated, and your mind busy!! :)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to use and show's up clear on my Kindle.  Would recommend it to any one needing a helpful tool in calculating numbers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book recommend to anyone looking to read a good book and now I'm trying to make it to 18 words
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The kids and hubby love the game and its minions. It is not for the young set (3 year olds)  but fun for all others.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|I have been a Pink Martini fan for almost 10 years now. Having lived abroad for many years, I especially appreciate their mix of songs from different cultures, always maintaining their unique sound. In this album, I enjoyed the addition of the style and voices of their 2 recent vocalist additions.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Basically this device will turn your existing TV into a smart TV for under $40.00. The apps that are supported work well although I have experienced some lag from time to time. Using a smart phone as a controller is handy as well. If you are planning to buy a smart TV I highly recommend you consider the Chromecast and save yourself some money.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|His musical talent exceeds his fan base. Ben Howard get 5 stars from me because he makes my train ride every morning blissful. You will not regret buying this album if you want to relax to a good voice and an awesome acoustic guitar. Some of the songs have more instruments.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|By the time I got halfway through this book-- which I had anxiously awaited all year-- I was feeling oddly bereft, like I was missing something.  I decided to jump online and read some of the reviews to see if others felt the same.  Needless to say, everyone else has already picked apart in great detail the shortcomings of the third installment: a disappointing ending, dragging storyline, weird, out-of-left-field character development, and an underplayed romance that didn't progress or evolve enough.  For me, though, the thing that I missed from books one and two was the magical, ethereal quality of the characters' lives within the faction system.  Yes, it was hugely flawed, often evil and corrupt... But they were still enchanting.  The amity in their apple orchards, strumming banjos and laughing... The dauntless hanging around the the chasm or boisterously scaling the pit, all covered In tattoos and black... The cool blue and glass erudite, the frank and unflinching black-and-white Candor... The somber, grey Abnegation, calm and compassionate.  It was these colors of fantasy that captured my imagination, and that I sorely missed in Allegiant.  I found myself unable to care about a group of characters who couldn't seem to decide what they stood for, in a setting as dull as dry toast, with a constantly and confusingly  shifting array of &#34;bad guys.&#34;  My heart just wasn't in this read...  However, the two stars are given for the fact that Tris and Tobias finally stopped with all the lies and secrets, and that I kind of dug how the city turned out in the end.  Considering that books one and two were an off-the-chart SIX stars, two isn't saying much...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really liked this book! In the first couple of chapters, I didn't think I was going to like it. But once I really got into the book, I was hooked. I had to stop reading at one point because I was totally in tears!  My sister is now reading it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|sure, not just another &#34;law show&#34;, but none the less a good law show!<br /><br />Amazon requires i write longer which i would suggest makes most people at this point click the &#34;forget it&#34; button and go back to their email or whatever, thus losing the real value of this rating system unless that  is their intention, to only get ratings from those who are will to write this much... either a proven marketing value, or some guy just figured it out of dumb, and if it's the later this review system should be rethunk:  if someone wants to say &#34;i don't know why i like it, i just do&#34;, then let em!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|this is a wonderful show very sad that it is going to end. found it on amazon for a wonderful price.
B0093X805W|5.0|Great book!!! The pictures make it even better. This is a great read for a child. Very imaginative. I will buy the paperback too.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|this is a wonderful show very sad that it is going to end. found it on amazon for a wonderful price.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I just found the overall story boring. Great writing, but the story itself didn't do it for me. Started out strong,then slowed way down...
B005FISBTO|5.0|this is a wonderful show very sad that it is going to end. found it on amazon for a wonderful price.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Was interested in reading the book after watching the HBO series. Downloaded a free sample and knew I wanted to continue.  Great way to pass the time on the subway to/from work!
B003L77GRO|5.0|this is a wonderful show very sad that it is going to end. found it on amazon for a wonderful price.
B00EUS9JF0|1.0|I am just going to stop buying anything new these days period! Record exec's or whoever have DESTROYED music by jacking up the volume levels and making the drums and everything else thunder and distort and gives you a \\"in your face\\" type sound. I hate it with a passion! You'd never have dreamed this trash would happen back in the 70's or 80's, can you imagine if they jacked up Hotel California? I mean who takes a prob very well produced song in the studio then when it's time to cut it or master it they just turn the volume controls into over drive!!  I want the best OPTIMUM sound, not crappy Loudness distortion!
0307939693|5.0|Beyond the intransigence of the North Korean government we get to see little of the reality of life in DPRK. From the outside it appears to be populated by 22 millions who, look alike, dress alike, and are unaccountably loyal their despotic rulers. This loyalty exists despite famine-like starvation conditions and many other privations both large and small.<br /><br />Adam Johnson demonstrates why he is a Pulitzer-worthy novelist by lifting the curtain to show us the humanity that lives within this lockstep society. We follow the protagonist, Jun Do, through a believable but improbable series of life changes. It is through these changes that the author is able to show us many North Koreans in different strata of this strictly regimented society.<br /><br />Dr. Johnson beautifully crafts this story using changes in perspectives and chronologies and sometimes using the regime’s ubiquitous propaganda loudspeakers to advance the narrative. Through this story he exposes the horror that is life in North Korea.<br /><br />This review is of the audio edition, read by the author and three others. And, this is one of those cases where the quality of the audio enhances the experience.<br /><br />Recommended: Yes.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love cut the rope. After completing all the levels I had to go back and get 3 stars on all the levels. The graphics are very nice and smooth. Wish they would hurry up and release more!
B009SKPVO8|4.0|The strap has a good quality feel to it. The sling strap design is handy and keeps your camera at the ready for a shot. As others have noted, the shoulder pad will move around as you move your camera from your side to take a shot.  Eventually the shoulder pad will find its way to the bottom and off your shoulder.<br /><br />The only downside to this design is the way the strap connects to the tripod screw/connector on the base of your camera. The connector is a loop design that protrudes about 1.25in from the base of the camera.  For me this protrusion has meant a not so easy fit for my camera with the strap connected and my camera bag's side zipper access.  Some of the other straps have a slimmer connector design but in the end it's a minor flaw.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love Cut the rope. This new one did not disappoint. It introduced us to a few new omnoms. Just like the original, this one is a lot of fun. I recommend it for everyone.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Totally worth it and an absolutely perfect tribute. See this movie if you are a fan of the original series and movies. There is no way anyone could do better than these modern movies. Get into the alternate universe thing or I'm telling you..you're missing out! LIVE LONG AND PROSPER!
1401312853|1.0|I could not believe that its the same Mitch Albom who wrote Tuesday with Morrie and For One More Day can produce such a boring piece of literature. It is so \\"light\\" and full of endless cliches. The dose of symbolism in that book is pathetic. And frankly, I was not sure what was the message eventually. Father Time? Tower of Babel? It is so artificial. And the cryogenic story - total lack of creativity. What I also hated about this back was the intense kind of preaching that repeats itself over and over again. Cannot wait for a new book by Mitch Albom where he would prove again his talent, passion and authenticity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it!!! It is all consuming and challenging. I wish I was better at the solutions . I am learning.
006202406X|4.0|When we get down to the nitty gritty of the uproar over this book, the primary complaint is the ending. Without any specific spoilers, there are certain character deaths that have people rallying for poor Veronica Roth's head. That, first and foremost, is a great example of just how amazing Veronica Roth is as a writer. She created characters that readers cling to, rally with, and mourn deeply over. She made us, to varying degrees, cry and scream and rant and shake the book so hard, hoping to somehow change it's fate. She wove a story that imbedded the characters into our hearts, making it all the more difficult when they were taken away. That is talent and honesty and greatness that only comes from the most imaginative mind. The question that most people seem to be asking, though, is why? Why kill off that specific character? Was it necessary? What was the point? Some even go as far as saying she deviated from the cardinal rule of fiction. WAKE UP, PEOPLE!!!!! This story is set in a Dystopian society where cruelty, death, violence, and fear are the primary rulers. How can anyone be upset with death infiltrating the main characters? It's realistic, it's honest, and it fits the story. It fits the character's personality and, honestly, could not have been avoided while staying true to his/her character. The foreshadowing was undeniable, though I tried to deny it for far too long, and fit with the entire series' standard. A happy ending is subjective, first and foremost, and honestly wouldn't have fit well. It's not a happy-go-lucky world. It's a world filled with a lot of bad people and a lot of bad stuff. It's gritty and real and a true commentary on our own broken society. Her ending was fitting for the story she created. There was no cardinal rule broken here, folks, other than the one between the readers and the author. We are here to ponder and enjoy what she so willingly shared with us - her story and characters that are most likely a heck of a lot closer to herthan to us. So to those of you that are trying to decide whether to read it, DO IT. Just don't expect rainbows and butterflies, because that's not what the series is ultimately about and hasn't been from the very first page.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Granny Smith is absolutely wonderful. The physics are great and the action is very funny. The kids enjoy it as much as I do and we always laugh when Granny crashes. The other characters are creative with funny sound effects, but Granny is our favorite. The levels are increasingly difficult and interesting with gravitational shifts and excellent physics considerations. The sound effects remind me of Benny Hill, which have us cracking up. A stable application that has become one of our top 5 games with PVZ and Field Runners.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|This is our world if the government takes away our freedom and constitution as depicted in a scifi action adventure movie. I highly recommend. EXCELLENT writing, acting, casting and directing.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got this mouse to replace an old, heavily used G9 mouse from Logitech that I had had for about 6 years. While I initially thought I would go with another Logitech mouse, I saw this for sale and decided to try it since it had good reviews and was much cheaper than many of the Logitech offerings.<br /><br />I am not disappointed. The mouse glides smoothly over my mouse pad and feels wonderful in my hand. With the added weights it feels perfect but I do tend to like my mice on the heavy side. The middle button/wheel doesn't free rotate like the G9 but I never used that feature anyway. I did have to reprogram the side buttons to be forward/back but it wasn't hard to do.<br /><br />Hopefully this last 6 years like my G9. Ok and one last thing - Anker's support and customer services seem to be top notch. Shortly after receiving the mouse I got an email asking me what I thought and how I would improve the mouse. My only complaint was in the weight tray - it is possible to drop the weights into the mouse if you are clumsy.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|Great action and good story. Another good movie in the Bourne series. If you are a Bourne fan you will enjoy this movie.
B0001XAPX8|3.0|You dont have to traverse too far into the movie before you figure out the secret that is referenced in the story description on the cover.  Both Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman give award winning performances however the story itself moved slowly.  There were some fabulous moments both funny and sad but overall it failed to keep me rivetted to the screen.  With the subject matter and the outstanding cast this should have been fodder for an Oscar.  Disappointing but worth a watch if it goes on sale or comes on tv.
B00111YM5G|5.0|I really loved this movie. although it is not for everyone. plot can be complicated, but overall it was a wonderful movie. great take on spirituality and heaven and hell. as well as, redemption.
B001L62REY|4.0|If you're not into period pieces you won't like it.  Performances were good all around.  Music score added to the drama appropriately.  For those of you who are cultural and history buffs, if you can't discount some of the inaccuracies then it'll irritate you BUT if you view it for what it is, a movie based on a book....a story of a few select people set in that time period....you'll love it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The convenience of using a smart phone or laptop makes this device shine.  Native apps work fantastic and the Chrome browser display feature is an extremely useful feature.  If it had Hulu I might be tempted to give it 5 stars.
B0074QGGK6|3.0|Haven't personally found new insights as an artist. If you are not an artist you may get a superficial perspective of the way we really thing and act.
B00E1LT41K|5.0|Such an AMAZING show. I can't get enough of it. All the characters are beautifully played and its amazing how human nature is portrayed. Highly recommend!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I loved every minute of reading this book. Laughed, cried, honored...proud of our military. God bless our men and women.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Omg this is the best series I have ever read I have read these books hundreds of times and I just bought them I want a 4th book
B001NCYSNO|5.0|Leonard Cohen is the master poet of the 20th Century, and his music is filled with the same brilliant imagery, mystery and beauty that made him the great poet he was.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive. I can't wait to get more lives. It's the first thing I do in the morning. I have it on 3 devices. Phone n two kindles
B000YDG6CY|5.0|I usually get size 13's because 12's in most shoes are too narrow.  The 12 W are perfect.  They fit great, perfectly roomy.  Love the style, very casual go with anything type of boot.  I've found that not tying up to the top two laces and using a over under lace style is best.  It gives room at the top of the boot when driving where ankle room is needed, and isn't as uncomfortable as lacing to the top.  Very secure and easier to take on and off without the top two.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can't say how much fun I have had with this app on my device.  It has made Facebook fun again not a chore lie it was on my computer.  Now I am able to check out my Facebook friends anywhere I wish to and have the net available.  I can enjoy posts now ans leave my comments to friends and foes any time.  I am at last no longer lost to my online friends.  I know you will enjoy Facebook more with this app on you device.  Well worth the time and memory used to get this app! As for memory not much used so go ahead GET IT!!!!!
0891419063|5.0|Very intriguing and a very intemet veiw of life in combat of the WW2 Pacific Marines. I don't believe that I could of made it through with what they saw or did.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This is a game I have enjoyed playing on Facebook bu,t my only regret is that I am, so far, unable to connect this game to my Facebook on my device.  Never fear, you still can play this game not connected to Facebook just have to live with out the things that you can get from friends on Facebook.  you still are able to play and earn game boosts.  So Go ahead and get this fun game and shoot them out of the sky so to speak.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Game kept me on my toes and hopping back and forth looking for the items to solve the rune game. Very nice graphics and soundtrack. Loved the game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this. It has tutorials and helps you threw the levels. You can even connect to Facebook and show everyone how far you are in the game.
B00F880BWG|5.0|One of my all time favorite shows. Helps that Kirkwood is from Lextown! Carol too. Gotta be loyal to Kentucky people. Kentucky Kicks Ass.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have never really played this game before but find it quite a fun and enjoyable game to play.  Looking forward to hours of  playing.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book as it gave a lot to ponder on .It makes us think about what lies in our afterlife but moreso that the writer went through a near death experience to be able to write her own personal explanation  of what happens and what is learnt from it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is awesome. Simply because it's just that, a calculator. And it shows the work, so if you're adding a lot of stuff and you forget what number you just added, it shows you. Very cool!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Hard to believe such a nice game can be available for free, but it is! Thank you to the creators!
0525478817|5.0|It was amazing! Heartwarming,hilarious, and a little inappropriate because of the swearing.<br />Overall loved it!<br />Btw movie coming out in June 2014
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very interesting story. Throughly loved how the author tells this story and makes you feel like, what would you do? Highly recommended.
B0072IS13G|5.0|SO, so cool.  This is actually my daughters toy that she bought with her own money from a yard sale this past summer.  BUT, I think I love it as much as she does.  It is one toy that I don't care if it gets left out because it is so neat!
B00C061I3K|3.0|All the music here is well-executed, technically skilled, etc., but it's just not interesting. It sounds like an amalgam of electronic and disco cliches that's been polished to a glassy, textureless surface. If I try to pay attention, my mind slides right off.<br /><br />Basically, there is nothing here you haven't heard before and probably it had some character the first time you heard it. That said, as derivative bland mush goes, it's extremely well-done and has production values through the roof.
B00E6F159A|5.0|This video is what a great concert video should look and sound like. I've been a fan of Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry for a very long time, but never had a chance to see either one live. This video gives me a glimpse of what I've missed.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|it arrived fast and courteously.. i will order from these folks again... I was glad to be able to find an old favorite and bring it home for a reasonable price!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|14 songs of the great Paul McCartney that you expect from a master musician/poet/artist.'NEW' is his most spiritual album he's ever layed down to track.The cd has something for everybody.FM hits(Appreciate & Road),AM hits(Save Us & Alligator),and the middle of the roads hits(Early Days & On My Way to Work).I love Queenie Eye. Not a bad song on this cd...support your favorite artists.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Garth brooks at his best! You can always count on him to be very entertaining. Enjoyed the albumn very much.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|The thing I like best about Brandon Sanderson's books is that you can read them as one-offs, or you can see them as a part of his larger universe.  Always enjoy his writing!
6304675348|5.0|Just watched Scream again after a few years of having not seen it. It's one of the best scary movies of the 90's. Loved all the little puns thrown in at just the right times. The cast was really great with the acting. Wish more movies could be like this one was.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Fantastic!  It's my go to app n I'm taking pictures.cccc cccccc ccccc CCC CCC CCC ccv fvv fvv gvv bb
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Anthem is by far Hanson's second best album. The first being This Time Around which Anthem tends to remind me of in a lot of ways.<br /><br />The album starts off with Fired Up which I would give a 5 out of 5 starts too. It has the right oomph to start off an album with. It was definetly a good choice.<br /><br />The second song I've Got Soul is one I have to admit I am not fond of at all. I kind of almost wish it hadn't made the album. I would give it a 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />You Can't Stop Us is a song I loved ever since hearing them perform it in Jamaica though the album version was slightly changed. I kind of wish it wasn't but I still loved it and it reminded me of a bunch of Queen songs. I'd give it a 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Get The Girl Back the first single off the album is catchy enough. It reminds me of their last album Shout It Out but I think it was supposed to, to help bridge the gap. I'd give it a 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Juliet is a song I fell in love with mainly because of the fact that I am a major Romeo and Juliet fan which this song references. I'd give it a 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Already Home is a good song. I like what it is talking about. That maybe even though you want to be somewhere else, maybe where you are is where you need to be. I'd give it a 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />For Your Love is the lone Isaac song, something the last album was lacking. It was nice to hear an Isaac lead and it is one of my favorite Isaac songs. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Lost Without You is track number 8 which usually has gone to Zac. It was kind of nice to see a change but then again as a Zac fan not so much. But I'd still give the song a 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Cut Right Through me is a song I have seen a lot of fans say reminds them of John Mellencamp and I guess I can see that. I started off liking this song but over time I just can not like it as much as I used too. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Scream and Be Free the song where the album title comes from. It's a good song to play on a summer day and one of the best off the albums. 5 out of 5 stars for sure.<br /><br />Tragic Symphony was a song that took a lot of time to grow on me but now I really love it. 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Tonight is another song I am not to keen on. It kind of just bores me to death. 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The encore song Save Me From Myself is another one I instantly loved and I still love it. It is just a sweet, sad, melody. 5 out of 5 stars.m and Be Free the song where the album title comes from.

0786958731|5.0|Great!  Was exactly what I was lookin for in DND game.  And for the right price.  You will enjoy this.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book was just ok. If I wasn't vested in th  entire story I wouldn't have finished it. Not my favorite
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|It wont download for some reason. I'm not sure what's wrong this app on my kindle. I'm at a lose here lol
B008ZVJE3A|5.0|Ad lib is great. I bet the out takes are great. These guys are the best at random humor and were doing it before every
1416589473|5.0|Very good story! Enjoyed reading it. Brings an added dimension to playing the game with a little more background behind the characters.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved reading about some familiar characters from my favorite Grisham novel, A Time To Kill.  Fast paced and well written with nicely timed twists.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an amazingly grabbing story and it tells of the life inside Germany during Hitler's reign of terror.  Wonderful book recommended to me by a friend who had discussed it in her book group.  Thanks Roberta!
B002X6PTH8|5.0|Best movie ever, jim carey really does it in this epic comedy that wakes every ones inner cartoon carracter! Epic
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I bought this book along with the Audible version.  I enjoyed the story.  The emersion reading does have problems. There were several places that the narration didn't follow the text.  Usually this meant one or two words were changed to synonyms.  In a few places the text differed from the audio by a paragraph or two.<br /><br />In general it is a good story.  I took Russian history in high school and it was nice to see how well the historical events tracked real history.  Books often change things like this for convenience. Although it is a novel, you get a good feel to the events leading up to World War I.  Near the end, it starts setting the stage for World War II.  I will soon be working my way through the next book in the trilogy.
0321934318|5.0|I am new to digital photo editing, and this book was perfect at taking me step by step on the process. Easy to follow and thorough.
0812973992|3.0|The style of writing was not my favorite. For lack of a better description, I would say it was too choppy in the way it jumped from one story to another before it arrived at the relationship of the characters.  However, I think that the character development was good for the most part.  Not my best read but by far not the worst.
B00FHAM3Q2|4.0|I was never a Miley Cyrus fan until I heard &#34;Wrecking Ball&#34;. me and that girl knows how to sing! The rest of the CD is just as good if not better!
006202406X|5.0|Not sure what all the fuss is about. Just because it didn't end how you ideally would have wanted it to, doesn't mean that it isn't beautifully written and a great end to the series.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was amazing, extraordinary, fantabulous, and just great in general.  Roth gives as a phenomenon once again and I truly enjoyed it.  I hate to see the seiries end and it was an adventure that I enjoyed being a part of.  You are sure to love it.  There was a twist at the end and I literally cried.  It broke my heart to read it.  I won't say wat happened but you are going to have to read it in order to find out.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift last year for a family member and didn't think I would also enjoy watching it and learn as much as I did about the space program. I found the episodes entertaining, enlightening, and educational. From a non-technical/scientific person's perspective, I would highly recommend regardless of current knowledge of the space program.
B000RLH2VM|2.0|Too much to follow and the style of acting wasn't my cup of tea, so I watched about half-way through and then moved on.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book by Ms. Meyer completes the love story and coming of age tale of a new generation who shows us that life really evolves the same way - whether with humans or fictional vampires.  There are moments that anyone can relate to no matter what generation one comes from.<br /><br />My one wish is that there could have been more to the story of Leah Clearwater.  I would have liked to see how she continued to cope with her ancestry vs. her love of Sam and her adjustment to the fact that Jacob has brought two \\"enemies\\" together and made them family.  I would also have liked to hear her relationship with Charlie - after all he was her Dad's best friend - and how that affected her feelings towards Bella.  I think that Ms. Meyer could weave a really good story starting with Harry's death and how that affected Leah.  I also would love the twist of Leah feeling drawn to a vampire (a nomad?) and how something like that would affect her thinking.
B0026Q8EWW|3.0|Its a good movie, but the story line is an age-old one. Big Company treats an individual wrong and so the new, young, lawyer takes on the big Company's lawyers.
B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|I was thrilled when I learned a new Donna remix CD was being released...The thrill is gone!  These remixes DO NOT capture the essence of Donna Summers or the songs.  The one saving grace is the remix of Love To Love You Baby.  No surprise that it's by Giorgio Moroder.  Everything else should be re-remixed......by other people!  I will say that I love the Holy Ghost remix of Working The Midnight Shift, but why aren't Donna's vocals used? Then, I could have gave this a 2 star review.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I don't have high hope for sci-fi movies, but this one was great! Good storyline, decent acting, and good action.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Really good I like using it but i wish you could pause while video taping.and the panorma is confusing cx opps so yeah
B00915G6MG|5.0|Itues. At 8 on cbs! I DVD every show until the end of the season, when I can order the cd.  I am wary of this season<br />Because of the departure of Ziva.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love angry birds star wars 2 because it's just like the first angry birds star wars I love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy to be able to play on my kindle fire now. will tell all of my friends and family. super fun
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Like all his novels, Fall of Giants sweeps you up, whisks you away, and carries you off to its world of drama, intrigue, and historically accurate fiction. Follett is fabulous!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We've been hooked!!  Couldn't NOT have this season to prepare for January's Season 4...  Watched all 3 seasons within the last two weeks!!  We are READY!!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|EXCELENTLY WELL WRITEN  you  won't be able to  put down the book  and wish it did not end  so read the next one THE SICILIAN
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is a nail-biting type of story!  I could not put this book down.  You'll want to read it from the beginning to the end the moment you read the first page.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|MUCH BETTER THAN A HISRORY BOOK TO UNDERSTAND THE PAST CENTURIES  ALL YOUNG PEOPLE INTERSTING IN THERE PAST SHOULD READ IT
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is highly addictive. Good clean fun for all ages. Would recommend it to all my friends.  Good for killing time when waiting at the airport or on those long plane flights.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I can't explain how great of a movie this is but I think everyone should watch it. The acting, the writing; it's a movie unlike any other.
B005K01VZS|5.0|If you've read anything by Mitch Albom, or if you haven't, I highly recommend this book. It's absolutely great and takes the reader on a journey of faith.
B0034G4OZE|4.0|I thought the acting was fairly good and the characters, as in the book, are so perfect. I recommend the book over the movie but still enjoyed this.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|you are trying to figure out the puzzle of each box t o get to the contents inside. it is fun, but takes time because you have to think and solve each piece and part. if you are looking for a game to play without thinking or effort, do not get this game. but if you are looking for a challenge, this is the game for you. out of five stars, its a six for sure!!
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|You can't go wrong with Mr Chow! Plenty of funny spots in this movie. Alan is always funny.  Worth watching
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really great game for minion lovers. Especially for little kids under 12 years old. Really super fun especially since its free.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Bought this for my little brother for his birthday when he turned 10 and he loves it. My mom's best friend loves these movies too. She own all of them accept for this one s I am buying her this one. I personally enjoy these movies too. Peter Smith
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's a cute game and it runs well but there is so much going on that it is hard to focus on what you are doing, also loading between screens is frustrating
B005FUTC86|5.0|I bought this DVD for my mom's best friend who had lost her VHS version years back so I bought the DVD as part of a movie night box I am putting together as a Birthday / Christmas gift for her. I am buying and collecting movies from her youth to give to her as a Birthday / Christmas gift and I know that she will be thrilled to have this again only this time on DVD. Peter Smith
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game it reminds me of the pc version on Facebook. I am a true Facebook gamer and I can still get interested in the kindle app version.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Great product, does what it is suppose to do. Good shipping time! Works fine, not 100% sure it will not hurt your Iphone, charging volt wise.
B009V0TV6O|4.0|The full version of the app downloaded without any hitches. The preset rhythms and the ability to create presets will be very helpful as a practice aid for my students. IMO, this feature alone is worth the money for a teacher or serious student. Like a few others I find the UI a bit clunky. I'd prefer having the option to run the app in portrait or landscape.<br /><br />I don't need glitzy stuff in an app like this. What I need is clarity. It should be so intuitive that a young student would see immediately or with very little explanation how it works. Other than the not-so-friendly UI I'd highly recommend the app.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|My kids really like this movie.  The animation is beautiful and artistic, something different. The story is interesting and magical.
0375869026|5.0|Our main character, Auggie, was born with a facial deformity and up to this point has been homeschooled. His mom has decided that it's time for him to attend school with others and the story starts with his taking a tour of his new school with some recruited students. In front of the principal, these students are well behaved and welcoming. Alone, there is one boy that is not.<br />When Auggie attends school, he deals with the comments, stares and questions of his classmates and feels like he is making a friend...until he over hears him making a nasty comment.<br />It's a good story about friendship, standing up for oneself and others.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Bought this for my six year old. He loved it and beat it in a few hours. Going to look for the sequel now.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|When you open the app it gets a little slow. But, while your playing the game it is the most cutest thing EVER!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome and I have to cepe it away from my sister it is not easy for me
B00CVCG87O|5.0|I'm really not a metal person.<br /><br />That's OK, because this isn't really a metal album. It might be tagged that way, but I'm starting to think genre's just a way to organize things by something other than quality so that journalists can write about them and salesmen can sell them. You can throw in a lot of genre words to describe \\"Altered State\\"--if pressed, I'd say it's a complicated and beautiful prog-rock construction with a fine metallic sheen. But those are just words. And as Elvis Costello (among others) famously said, \\"Writing about music's like dancing about architecture.\\" The words dart around the music, giving an idea of what it is and what it isn't, but at the end of the day, it is what it is. I can say the musicianship is dense and impeccable and chunky and delicate and beautiful. The songs are just plain well-built--they careen between dissonance and organization in much the same way that, say, Radiohead's \\"Pyramid Song\\" resolves itself. And the vocals are clean and soaring and glorious, a great big fricking eagle that soars peacefully one moment and then dives shrieking into the metallic canyons below. But the most important thing I can say is: you just gotta hear it.<br /><br />I stumbled across this band accidentally; I went to see a Katatonia show because I'd accidentally stumbled across THEM a while back, and TesseracT was one of three groups opening. I was less than pleased to find out there were THREE opening acts--it was a work night, and I wasn't looking forward to making it a late night--but once I heard Ashe O'Hara's vocals, I was like, OK, maybe this isn't a bad thing. (They were great to see live, by the way--he's new to the band and was obviously just having a blast getting to the U.S. for the first time and touring and playing shows.) And the songs--it was that rarest of things, when you hear something once and want to hear it again, and you hear it again and want to keep listening. Listening to TesseracT is like looking at Owen Wilson's nose--there are all these weird and cool angles, and you just want to figure out what the hell is going on with all of it, so you check it out again, and you still can't figure it out, even when it's RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU, but damn if it isn't compelling.<br /><br />I'm sure those Amazon song snippets don't do it justice. Heck, LISTENING to it won't do it justice, if you only do it once. You're gonna have to put on some headphones and crank it up and spend some time with it. Just trust me on this.son's nose--there are all these weird and cool angles, and you just want to figure out what the hell is going on with all of it, so you check it out again, and you still can't figure it out, even when it's RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU, but damn if it isn't compelling.<br /><br />I'm sure those Amazon song snippets don't do it justice.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series. Watched from the beginning of Season 1 to Season 3 on my day off. Not expecting the ending there for Season 3...Eagerly anticipating the next addition with Season 4.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that this game is finally available on Kindle! Lots of fun without having to pay for upgrades. Just need a little patience and persistence.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is just a fun game, really gets your mind going fast. Our grandson 5 years old also loves it. We go back and forth playing with each other.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game keeps me playing for hours. That's if I am lucky enough to beat the level I am on. There are some tuff levels but I keep coming back and finally I get it beat. I am on level 254 on Facebook. Starting over on my Kindle and trying to improve my scores and position.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Our grand son likes this. He spends a lot of time talking to Ben and making him say funny words.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun Game!  Very Additive.  Sometimes to challenging, but fun to meet the challenge, and defeat it!!!  A couple of the boards have not made much sence, but if you keep trying eventually you make it thru.
B00FPH51LQ|2.0|This is a M.I.B wannabee movie without the charm. The special effects fall short, and I found myself playing Candy Crush toward the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|HURRAY,HURRAY HURRAY. It's about time the real candy crush saga has arrived.  This is great. Now I can play like my friends. This is great for All ages. THANK YOU AMAZON.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is a really fun game. The graphics are terrific, and its very impressive for a free game. However, it does lag occasionally, and will sometimes freeze to the point I have to restart my kindle. if this issue was fixed I'd certainly give 5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Play it all the time. Can't stop playing it. Just wish you wouldn't need tickets to move on to the next level.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator plus works great for all your calculating needs. I've never had a problem with it and I'm very satisfied with this app.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz has proven once again that he can continue to give his followers some wonderful tunes. We've followed him for years and continue to like his music. Saw him in concert earlier this year and what a treat! He was part of the audience and seemed to enjoy every minute with us, just as much as we did watching him. Will continue to purchase his music for years.
B00BEIYMIS|1.0|If you want a pointless film airing- say perhaps while you are Halloween decorating or doing your taxes- this is it. First off the \\"investigators\\" are a couple of frauds who- when I knew of them in Massachusetts, back in the mid to later 80's- were traveling in company of a defrocked priest who charged exorbitant sums to rid people of demonically possessed homes. Fact is, every single case they investigated was deemed \\"demonic.\\" Sad thing was they even got some media attention. I operated a non-profit investigative agency (just myself, a couple of other like minded fellows and long before the high tech investigators of today)and ran afoul of their fee rates on a few occasions where some folks were genuinely scared of goings on and these \\"investigators\\" just happened to get to the client first. It doesn't surprise me that the misfortunes of those in real need should be perverted into sensationalism. In summation, throughout all my years of investigating I never came across one authentic case of demonic possession or even a serious enough haunting that couldn't be resolved with a bit of research and understanding. These people are frauds and certainly don't deserve the publicity this film will bring to them. Are they the next reality show? I sincerely hope not.

B00B7ERH04|3.0|I'm happy to have a camera app for my kindle fire. I just think it could do with a few adjustments. Being able to move where the shutter button is on the screen would be helpful. Also being able to edit pictures after they are taken would be nice, or at least another app to accompany this one for editing purposes.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This is an excellent series. I really enjoyed the first two books and could not put them down. The action and twists had me ripping through the pages. I struggled with the  third book as it took awhile to pick up and when it did it started to get pretty dark. Nonetheless, I couldn't stop reading. I did feel like the end come on a bit too quick, like maybe there should have been a part 2 to resolve everything and take us up to the epilogue. All in all I am completely satisfied and would highly recommend these books to anyone. Thank you Ms. Collins, and now I look forward to see what they do with the movies!

0486282112|5.0|Great book. Fast shipping. And it met my expectations as an AP literature student.  This is a great story with thrill and adventure.
0385523394|1.0|This book is just terrible. The woman is extremely self-absorbed. She constantly whines about her experiences in a min security prison- she did a crime, now she has to pay for it. She tried to play the innocent act, but she was a college graduate and well aware of what she was doing to get her into the mess to begin with.<br /><br />Considering her bragging of her upscale education, you'd think she'd be able to count (in many instances, she flip flops on when she and other inmates will getting out) and be able to write. Her grammar is atrocious.<br /><br />Then there are the false statements. Knowing real correction officers, I'm well aware that prisons do NOT have lakes on campus for the correction officers to store their private boats. Nor do correction officers have housing on prison grounds.<br /><br />This book is a waste of time.

B007BLCGNU|5.0|Great acting and storyline, and the make up was incredibly effective at showing the actors at different ages.  The sensitive subject matter about J. Edgar's private life was handled tactfully and with sensitivity.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a challenging game. I enjoyed it. Keep them coming. I like games that use your mind! They aren't too difficult, but I surely wasn't bored!
B003K16P50|4.0|I really enjoyed this - a lovely style of writing, interesting, a cleverly woven tale.  However, having seen the film first which I thoroughly enjoyed, I would have preferred a different conclusion to the book.  Highly recommend though.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The game is fun if you want to spend the time it takes to level up  the dinos and to evolve them...costs a lot and takes a long time to build up the coins to do it.  The buildings and decorations cost a lot of coin and it is difficult to build up  enough dino dollars to buy the items you really want like the trex.  Like I said the game can be fun but it will cost you many real world dollars to get the things you want and take you a lot of time getting dinos evolved ...wish I never started.

B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It's fun and all but it doesn't work very well on the kindle fire. When u have to blow and make the airplane go up it doesn't really work because u don't know where to blow.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book definitely exceeded my expectations. I thought the first book was just alright, and the second one was pretty good. But City of Glass made me so glad I decided to stick with this series. All of the mysteries from the first two books are answered, and it really feels like everything is resolved in the end. After reading this, I'm surprised the author decided to write more books in the series because CIty of Glass just seemed to be such a fitting end for the story. I do plan to read the next 2 books in the series however, because this book made me like certain characters I didn't really care for before, so I'd like to see where the next two installments take them.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Don't like the fact that if you don't get enough you have to wait 19 min or so to play again.  Do like the concept of getting he candies off the board, but I have never gotten all that I need to to keep playing.

1476727651|5.0|Stephen King in top form. The little boy Danny from &#34;The Shining&#34; is followed to the present day where most of the book takes place. It is mainly set in September 2013 and very much set in &#34;our&#34; world as it ingeniously ties real world events from our timeline to the lives of Dan Torrance and a child he encounters with a psychic power that perhaps dwarfs his own.<br /><br />&#34;The Shining&#34;, because of the popularity of both the original novel and the excellent (but not especially faithful) Stanley Kubrick movie version that followed, is simply iconic. And with that in mind, it's a real treat that in a sequel to something of that stature, King also gives shout outs to other pop culture icons such as TV series &#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34;, &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; and the Harry Potter book series, to name a few (there are plenty more), and all very cleverly written into the narrative.<br /><br />This has plenty of nods to the original &#34;Shining&#34; but its a completely different story with a hero we know, a new one who is instantly endearing in the child Abra Stone (although potentially too powerful for her own good), and a nice cast of villains including old &#34;favorites&#34; from the Overlook Hotel and an unusual RV travel group known as the &#34;True Knot&#34; whose members all have simply fantastic names. I'd list some here, but I'm trying to give as few spoilers as possible while still praising this work effusively. I guess one's OK: &#34;Rose the Hat&#34; and she's not a nice lady.<br /><br />King can still capture the reader immediately, give a good scare, and best of all, he can pack real emotion into scenes.<br />No spoilers, but when &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; of the title does the work that has earned that moniker, the language used is perfection that only a master can command, and the effect of several of those scenes is rapturous. It is not merely genre writing at its finest, but writing at its finest without any qualifications.<br /><br />This is a great read that reveals more of what exactly the &#34;Shining&#34; is, builds on and enhances the original novel, and has a lot of potential to eventually be considered middle part of a classic trilogy should King be further inspired. My fingers are crossed for a third book.<br /><br />While I felt it could've been a bit longer, perhaps another 200 pages, &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; is still immensely satisfying as is and ranks high on my list of King favorites.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Glad I read this! I didn't expect to enjoy it so much and now I am looking forward to the sequels. A gripping story with some surprises.

B003XVYLDU|4.0|It has been over 40 years since I first read S-5 and I was a true believer.  Mr V. never seemed to get that communism is the physical reality of the idealistic notion of socialism. This so wrecked his perception that toward the end he refused to see the improvements in this world and he became a poor judge of character of those who did not share his idealistic notions.

B003DCPGNS|5.0|I have recently discovered the \\"screwball comedy\\" genre of older movies, and I wish I had discovered it earlier. They are very enjoyable and funny movies. The genre lasted through the 1930s, and into the 1940s in its prime. Bringing Up Baby is one of those movies. Screwball comedies liked to feature battles of the sexes, and conflict between the classes. Another element of the Screwball Comedy was fast-paced dialog, like in [[ASIN:B000HPJITC His Girl Friday]]. It is actually the fast-paced dialog I like the most, it is very engaging, and makes the movie feel overly energetic and very boisterous -- similar to what Aaron Sorkin does with dialog today with TV shows like [[ASIN:B000HC2LI0 The West Wing]], [[ASIN:B00006IRH9 Sports Night]] and [[ASIN:B0092QHXZS The Newsroom]].<br /><br />Anyway, Bringing Up Baby features two of my favorite classic Hollywood era actors: Cary Grant, and Katharine Hepburn. This is the first movie I have ever seen Katharine Hepburn being so silly in! It was delightful to watch her being so over-the-top. I have never seen her in anything other than very dignified roles. She was absolutely stunning in this movie. Cary Grant was his usual stolid self, and plays a perfect straight-man.<br /><br />The movie is basically a story (told at breakneck speed) of a scientist (they call him a Zoologist, but he is clearly a Paleontologist) who is trying to get a rich lady to donate money to his museum. He runs into a girl on the golf course who causes him all sorts of trouble, and then accidentally steals his car, and makes him ruin his chances of impressing the wealthy lady's lawyer. The girl is smitten with him and contrives to break up his engagement so she can have him, and does everything she can think of to make him stay near her, including saddling him with a \\"tame\\" leopard her brother sent her (the \\"Baby\\" of the title of the movie). The results are hilarious madcap antics, social faux paus, mistaken identities, and all sorts of the comedy staples of the 1930s and 1940s.<br /><br />The movie contains no crimes against women, no extreme violence, no sadism, no nudity, and no strong language. The worst thing that happens is that Carry Grant's character stomps on Katharine Hepburn character's foot, on purpose, because he is mad at her (amazing what society thought was acceptable behavior between men and women back then). I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and laughed out loud in many of the scenes.<br /><br />5 stars.f the 1930s and 1940s.<br /><br />The movie contains no crimes against women, no extreme violence, no sadism, no nudity, and no strong language.

B002KYXO7A|4.0|I took a few film classes in college, so I am familiar with the silent vs. sound era, the significance of The Jazz Singer, the Hayes code, and the classic/golden era of Hollywood. So, I was expecting a certain kind of movie when I rented this one, and I certainly got it. I had, of course, heard of Singin' In The Rain before (it gets mentioned all the time in discussions of movies) -- I just hadn't seen it. The movie is indeed a classic 1940s/early 1950s musical. It has silly song and dance numbers and all of that stuff.<br /><br />What I wasn't expecting, and was surprised by, was the in-depth story that the musical tells. Reminiscent of [[ASIN:B004EBI4K4 Sunset Boulevard]], the story covers the silent era to talking era change-over. However, unlike the dark and brooding Sunset Boulevard where the change has already happened and has cast out some of the former silent stars who had terrible voices -- in this movie the change is in the middle of happening.<br /><br />There are plenty of laughs, madcap hijinks and even a couple of plot twists. Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much. If you like older movies, especially musicals, you could do a lot worse than this movie. It has no dark elements to it all (no torture, no sadism, no crimes against women, no murder, nothing but singing and dancing, and the occasional human disagreements). The movie didn't have me enthralled, though, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. There are some boring songs, some boring dialog, and some scenes drag on longer than I would have cared for. But, overall, it is still a solid movie.<br /><br />4 stars.

B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun game and a lot of fun.  This game has a piece of candy on a string.  You have to figure out when to cut the rope so the candy falls into the mouth of the creature waiting for it.  That sounds pretty easy but there are spikes, wheels and other items in the way that smash the candy before making it to the creature to eat it.<br /><br />Fun but it does take some patience to master.

006202406X|2.0|I enjoyed the first two books very much. It was hard for me to remember the basic story line when I began the third book. I went back and reviewed but still felt fairly confused through 2/3rds of the novel. I am not a professional critic and cannot put my finger on why the first 2/3rds didn't draw me in  - but there was something about the story that was just not interesting to me. As you know by now, the end feels forced and almost silly. I do not have a problem with a character (SPOILER ) being killed off, but the actual killing and the conclusion was very trite in my opinion. I do not normally have strong feelings about YA literature but this book seemed rushed and the story lacked the effort and complexity included in the first two novels. At this point I am sorry I read the series. I do not recommend.
006202406X|1.0|Literally crying at the ending of this book.<br />I've never even written one of these \\"reviews\\" before and I dont know if this will even work but here it goes.<br />Couldnt Tris and Tobias have a cliche happy ending?<br />I get its a war and lives are lost but there was already so much death... werent you satisfied once you offed Uriah?<br />I'd seriously just stick to reading Divergent & Insurgent and then creating your own happy ending.<br />That is all I have to say.

The spider would not move forward but only would turn in circles.  One of the buttons was defective.<br /><br />I contacted Uncle Milton, told them that it was a gift & we have no receipt.  But they insisted I \\"return it to the store it was purchased at\\" with no other option.  So, I guess we are stuck with a toy that doesn't work...what a shame!  This isn't the first thing I have purchased from Uncle Milton that didn't work...buyer beware!  I feel really bad because the gift was bought by his friend who is going to ask about the toy eventually.  He gave it to my son with the intention of him loving the toy & could not have picked a more appropriate toy for my son!  What a let down :(

B009V0TV6O|1.0|Thank goodness it's the free app of the day because it's only the free app that gets installed. As a music teacher, I was really excited to get this app. I don't like the fact that the developer is dishonest and offers a free version of the app as the free app of the day instead of the $1.99 version.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Well I guess like pretty much everyone one else here, I was counting the days for the release of the 3rd book of the trilogy. I bought my book on the 22nd at midnight, just because I could not wait a second longer. I guess books is one of the only ways we can kind of use our imagination of a \\"better world\\", and this trilogy was one of those cases for me, people fighting for a better world, a fight worth fighting for. But then not just the main event but through out the entire book, it's just tragedy after tragedy. Maybe if I was reading one of Nicholas Sparks books I defiantly would expect that, but not this one! I am so upset, almost with like a hopeless felling of some sort, and that's is defiantly not the felling I expected to have at the end of the trilogy. It's kind of SAD!!!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I believe that this book is a good book for readers how loved the Hunger Games. The many turning point for me is that the main character is a male which is different from many of the other books I read. I like the aspect that the main character isn't shown with gaining great strength but shown as a man how looks to help. My on complaint is going the book it takes a why for the book to kick off like in the 30-40 chapters.

B00FPH6A70|5.0|This movie is one of the most terrifying horror movies in a long time.  The only one within the past few years that I would say is better is Mama - which is one of the best psychological terror movies to date - period (absolutely awesome imagery).  This movie will keep you interested - no time to be bored.  Many surprises - even when expecting the next one and prepared for the terror - this was still able to get to me.  If you are like me and are fairly numb to what the horror genre puts out - this one will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat.  Normally I am not the one yelling out loud out of fear - this movie had me screaming like a little girl.

1416549447|1.0|There's no such thing as \\"Tai Chi\\" (太气) in Chinese traditional life force practice. There's a thing called \\"Tai Ji\\" (太极) in Chinese traditional martial art, which is used as a way of exerciser and keeping health by modern Chinese. And \\"Chi\\" or \\"Qi\\" (气), a life force in traditional Chinese culture, is regarded as a underline force of all Chinese martial art practice, including \\"Tai ji\\" (太极). Clearly, the author can't tell the difference of this two notions, I doubt he can develop a good way of running.<br /><br />By the way, \\"Qi\\" or \\"Chi\\"(气), the life force, is a false concept and has been disproved its existence by modern science. You could say modern science doesn't have all the answers, but disproving a false ancient concept is well in its ability. It's just like a Mathematician spot a fault in a pupil's math homework. And the \\"Tai ji\\"(太极), which the author claimed as \\"Tai Chi\\", is no longer served as a combat technique in modern martial art. It is just another way to stay in motion and stay health. And when it comes to exercise, \\"Tai ji\\" is not better than jogging, if not worse.

006202406X|4.0|This was definitely not the ending I was hoping for, but I still really enjoyed the wrap-up to the series. I think everyone wants a happy ending for Tris and Four, and it was devastating when she died, but as I was reading, I wondered how she could accomplish a happy ending and I understand the reasoning behind the death. I thought it was powerful and seemed appropriate for the character of Tris, although tragic. Of course she would have sacrificed herself for family. I did have a few issues with the book...<br />I was really looking forward to the dual perspectives in this story, particularly since the reader gets to go inside Four's head. I did like the insight we got into his mind, but it was often confusing who was actually narrating the story. I had to go back several times to the beginning of the chapter to make sure. I think it would have been less confusing to have larger chunks of the book from each perspective, but I liked that each situation got two viewpoints...<br />I found myself missing the world that Veronica Roth had created in the first two books. However, this longing and confusion was exactly what the characters felt. To find out that their entire existence was nothing more than a genetic experiment was shocking and infuriating. Of course, my own curiosity wanted to know more about the United States, but I understand the limited viewpoint, as it was coming from the characters in the story. They wouldn't have had the opportunity to learn everything. There were a few story points that I would have liked to see wrapped up better, and a few holes that left some questions...<br />Bottom line, I don't consider it a good story just because the author wraps it up in a tidy, happy package for me, or because the writing and story is perfect. My definition for a good book is one that pulls me in, connects me to the characters, and makes me feel something, whether that emotion is positive or negative. This book did that for me. Don't discount the book or theseries just because it ends tragically. There is some hope at the end...Tris accomplished her mission, reconciled with her brother and was reunited with her mother. Four and the other characters are struggling with grief, but still moving forward and are making changes in their world.

1588394123|2.0|This book has a beautiful holographic front cover, which adds greatly to its appeal (and I would think value); the seller described the book as being in very good condition, but with ONE MINOR scratch on the holographic cover. There were unfortunately a series of scratches on the cover, one of which was 8 inches long (approx. 20 centimeters). This has to affect the book's value. The interior of the book was in good condition, as described by the seller.  The book came in a package with 4 other items I ordered from Amazon; the only protective packing material in the box were two sheets of brown paper, and the book itself was not  wrapped, or protected; because of this I am not certain if the scratches on the book's cover were there before it was shipped, or--since all the items freely rattled around in the box when I received it--if the scratching could have been done in transit since the book was not protected in any way, and the lack of packing materials allowed everything in the box to freely move around. Not happy though, no matter the cause of the damage to the book.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|How lovely to spend Christmas (or anytime) with The Piano Guys' music.  There are some lesser-known pieces on this CD, as well as two pieces written by Jon Schmidt, but all played gorgeously and in the TPG's inimitable style.  My favorites are \\"O Come O Come Emmanuel\\" (which has been one of my favorites of theirs for the past year), \\"Where Are You Christmas\\" (with a sweet performance by Jon's daughter), \\"Winter Wind\\" (one of the pieces written by Jon Schmidt), and a beautiful rendition of \\"Silent Night\\".<br /><br />It doesn't have to be Christmas to enjoy this CD, because the performances are just so beautiful.  I can especially imagine Steven's face as his plays the cello on these pieces, particularly on \\"Silent Night\\".<br /><br />Although I live in Southern California (and saw TPG in Anaheim last year), I have tickets to their Christmas concert in Boise, and to their concert in Seattle in February.  Guess I've gone from a fan to a fan-atic, but I truly think they have made the world a better place with their music.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It is wonderful device.  It is made to work with all kind of routers.  But some routers vBulletin settings not let it to work.  For example I have century Link's Zyxel c1000 router at home.  I given call to Century Link's technical department to help me for access point settings so that my router can communicate with this little device. Because this Chromecast device was working fine at my friends home. I tested with two different model routers of century link. It was working fine. But it was not working at my home. Century kink couldn't help me. They send me new router of same model.  But that has same problem. I returned that shipment.<br />  I know this device is good. I am still working with settings of my router. I got this device one month ago but unable to run successfully at my home.

B00DURHYWC|3.0|This is the first album using both China Forbes and Storm Large.  Well, they're both fine.  Their numbers are easily the highlights.  Thing is, the album's 16 songs long but China and Storm are only on nine of the tracks.  That leaves us with Ari Shapiro, Meow Meow, Rufus Wainwright and...um....Phyllis Diller at death's door.  Well, all I'll say is that you probably won't find yourself wanting to hear any of the guests more than you will either China or Storm (Rufus is fine but &#34;Kitty Come Home&#34; should be on a McGarrigle tribute album, not here).<br /><br />Half a great album, half a mixed bag.  They shoulda just focused on China and Storm.

B00BT70J7M|5.0|This was my very first Jonas Kaufmann CD and it surpassed my expectations. In my lay person's opinion it comes as close to perfection as you can get. I read one man's review where he called the orchestra and conductor third rate and he further was of the opinion that Herr Kaufmann should have waited until after he had performed all of the roles on stage. Well, I for one am glad that JK didn't wait until then because I suspect that I may be deaf or dead by then. Furthermore, having read, seen, and heard many of Mr. Kaufmann's interviews I have to conclude that he invests much thought and preparation into all of his work and is his own worst critic. I also appreciate his comments regarding each presentation on this CD as it expands the listener's knowledge and understanding. His Luisa Miller aria rendition gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. I also appreciate that the text of the arias is included in the original Italian and in various translations so that the listener can follow. I will be ordering more copies of this CD as it will make wonderful presents for family and friends, even those who are not familiar with classical music.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Before reading this book, I read a lot of the reviews about it and there quite a few mixed reviews. Some people hated it, some loved it. The majority of the bad reviews were based on the fact that they didn't like the characters.<br /><br />For all intents and purposes, Travis is controlling. He isn't God's gift to women, more like God's gift to psychoanalysts. I get that people are outraged over his actions. I get that people were outraged by Abby's meek-will-keep-taking-his-crap attitude, especially in a world where we are attempting to raise independent strong willed women. As cliched as it sounds, maybe there is a love that can change people from confident independent individuals into blubbering, annoying needy, psychos. I have certainly never been in love like that and would immediately head for the hills if that type of love was bestowed upon me.<br /><br />With that being said I prefer to rate and review a book based upon the writing and the way the story makes me feel. Granted, I am a 33 year old adult woman and this is a book from the YA genre. When I read fiction it is for entertainment purposes and I guess I am past the age where what I read deeply influences my actions and decisions. So I accepted it for what it was, which is a work of fiction. I truly liked this book. I have no complaints about the author's writing, and she was really good at portraying the characters in a way that I felt like I knew them and was rooting for all to end well. Which... (SPOILER ALERT)... it does!!<br /><br />I am not prepared at all for my 13 year old daughter to read this, although she says her friends have, but for me, I enjoyed it. I do not, however, have a desire to read Travis' point of view in Walking Disaster, the follow up switcharoo to Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|Loved the music, the singers, and the staging of he opera. The voices and acting skills were superb and the orchestra did a fine job supporting the singers, I thought. I also think that the French language heightens the listener's pleasure.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The good wife is one of the best tv dramas on today!<br />The writing is original and is current!<br />The actors are the best, a great ensemble!
B003AMAOW4|5.0|The first time I watched the first act I thought &#34;Oh no, this is Munich and the brown shirts are back!&#34;: I had expected a more traditional staging of &#34;Lohengrin&#34;, obviously. The beautiful overture with Anja Harteros designing her house was intriguing and heightened my interest and expectations. Jonas Kaufmann's pianissimo rendition of &#34;Mein lieber Schwan&#34; was deeply moving as was his &#34;Gral&#34; aria. Anja Harteros' Elsa was enchanting with her gorgeous voice and expressive eyes. I thought that all the lead singers were extremely gifted and I enjoyed their performances. I'll be watching this one many more times and would recommend it.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|I have been a devoted reader all of my life (I am 51yrs old), I can remember where I was and when I read The Stand for example (home in bed with chicken pox!) I read the Shining during another difficult time, I read and waited for each of the Dark Tower series and in between somehow or another I have read and loved each and everyone of his novels. The one thing, of course, is his ability to tell a tale which conquers evil. I have finished Doctor Sleep and am returning now to The Dome, but The Stand will always be my favourite.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|Opening night experience. It has been a long time since I've heard an audience in the theater applaud after a movie. It was ninety minutes of total excitement, suspense and in your face 3d! Unbelievable visuals. Mind-blowing music. More than once I could feel my heart beating. When the movie started I got up from where I was sitting in the middle of the theater and went down to the front section. I sat in the third row from the front of the screen. I was surrounded by what I can only say was awesome! I almost gave myself whiplash a few times as stuff flew by me.<br /><br />Just as I go to an action movie for the action and not for its \\"accuracy,\\" I went to Gravity to be \\"wow'ed\\" and despite a few moments of \\"they can't do that\\" it did not disappoint. Now waiting until I can get my home 3D version. :-)<br /><br />Do not miss this movie in the theater if at all possible in 3d IMAX.

B00BPDR3F6|5.0|After reading Elizabeth's first two books, I was already a big fan. But this seemed to be a very different type of book, so I was wondering if she could pull it off. Well, she not only pulled it off, she did so in a way that will have me eagerly awaiting ANYTHING she continues to write. From the first few pages of THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS, I was hooked by the captivating plot, the complex and well-drawn characters, fascinating historical tidbits, and a rarely matched storytelling skill that has me grabbing my Kindle at every moment possible. Well done, Elizabeth!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Reading is a passion of mine and when a wonderful book comes along I cannot put it down.  This one is in my opinion the best I have read this year.  Grisham has not always excited me with his work, because his early work A Time to Die is one of the most provocative novels ever written about the deep south. It was a hard \\"act\\" to follow but he has done it this time.  The \\"why\\" trigger for Seth's holographic will is not the mystery for those of us born and raised in the South, and it does not lessen the development of a well written, spell binding work from a Master Southern Author! Looking forward to more of Jake's history as he moves on from the 80's.  Please don't disappoint us Mr. Grisham.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King once again writes in a way that keeps the reader so interested--it is hard to put it down.<br />I read the whole book in under 4 days. The Shining is my favorite book of his, so when I found out I could<br />see where people were at in their lives today--I couldn't wait to read it. Doctor Sleep did not disappoint .<br />Any Stephen King follower needs to get this now & settle in for a lovely ride.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|Love this movie, arrived on time, great flick, my son took to school and watched In class. Good movie for kids.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|this whole thing is really varied.  each song is its own entity - the vibes, moods, and feel of each song change as the album moves along.  Even in the drums and guitar tones created for each track.  Personally, I feel thats an excellent quality of this album - instead of progressing forward with the Alice In Chains saga at the fear of recycling something tried and tested, Cantrell has taken more of a step sideways and said, &#34;Well this is whats happening NOW.&#34;  Cool.<br /><br />The albums highlights are numerous... from the albums starting guitar lick I love the BWAAAAA!!! entrance of Mike Inez's bass, through to the amazing DuVall vocal in &#34;Last Of My Kind&#34; ,the haunting &#34;Your Decision&#34; ,into the incredible low dirge dark acoustic tone Cantrell creates for &#34;When The Sun Rose Again&#34;.<br /><br />Again, you guitarists listen out for that low-dirge tone for the intro to &#34;Acid Bubble&#34; - theres a lesson in taste right there!<br /><br />* For those looking for the obvious Layne-era comparison there's only one here in my opinion - the excellent &#34;Check My Brain&#34;  .And for that reason I suppose it was the clear choice for the albums lead single.<br /><br />The album plays and flows brilliantly in the order the tracks come on the CD - I've tried spinning this on shuffle and it almost doesn't work that way like some other albums do.  To me it shows just how each song can stand up in its own bubble.  Its awesome!<br /><br />&#34;It seems you prophesised,<br />All of this would end&#34;<br /> sings Cantrell.  this is not the end - its the start of a bright new era for this excellent band.<br /><br />5 stars!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a good read for me. It was just a tad slow in the beginning but the character development and story unfolded in a wonderful way! It was great how the whole story tied together in the end.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Big emphasis on the trademark Cantrell lead guitar style here.  That drone string bending rhythm style he's made his own is particularly evident on &#34;Pretty Done&#34; ,which got me thinking that the interplay of the 2 guitarists doing all that string bending while they're both singing at the same time must be pretty damn hard to accomplish Live!  must check for youTube videos!<br /><br />Theres more here about the 2 vocalists singing harmonies rather the Cantrell / DuVall tradeoff that went through the first album, although both do get their parts - with DuVall really shining on the haunting &#34;Hung On A Hook&#34;  .Come to think of it, all the singing on this album is astounding, but particularly on &#34;Choke&#34; and the end section of &#34;Breath On A Window&#34; - these guys know how to deliver a brilliant vocal.<br /><br />You see, even though we can't compare this new-AiC to Layne-era Alice we CAN compare it to its predecesser &#34;Black Gives Way...&#34; and this offering, in my humble opinion, is not as musically diverse.  But thats not a bad thing at all - its exceptionally well-written, and whereas their first album felt like all the songs were grown individually, this one is the sound of a new band writing, rehearsing and recording collectively while broadcasting its own cohesion and sound as an entity.<br /><br />A personal favourite is &#34;Phantomb Limb&#34; ,and I wonder if the title and maybe the inspiration came from the 2007 Pig Destroyer album of the same name!  Maybe they thought &#34;Wow thats cool! What a great ideal!&#34;  * BUT!  Therein also lies my only critisism of this new AiC record - the music war LOUDNESS mastering.  Even though this is a powerful rocky metal album and therefore needs appropriately powerful production, they've gone with Ted Jenson who seems to love the way drumming pumps and breathes and fills in all the spaces in the dynamics.  Pig Destroyer's death grinding album sounds great like that but its a bit of a shame that its been applied on this one.  Oh well.<br /><br />Lastly, props for the fantastic album title and artwork!<br /><br />5 stars for the musicianship and packaging but I'm giving it 4 because it makes my car speakers all fizzy.that its been applied on this one.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Compelling, believable, well written account. Ms Kerman imparts a clear-eyed view of the familial and societal devastation incurred by inconsistent sentencing terms and the bureaucratic and dulling experience of incarceration for non-violent offenders.

Her one-year sentence made it no doubt easier to make the most of her time, seek whatever positive aspects she could and focus on glimmers of humanity and grace.

B0071XO8RA|1.0|I looked at this award winning series with a 4.5 star rating and thousands of positive reviews and thought \\"How could I possibly go wrong?\\"<br /><br />I don't get it.  This book is terrible.  Or at least I should say what I read was terrible.  I couldn't get past the first few chapters.  What a massive snooze-fest.<br /><br />People are living inside a gigantic silo that's almost entirely buried in the earth.  Anybody who wants out is welcome to leave except for one tiny problem - the atmosphere is toxic and going outside will kill you.  Still, every now and again, somebody needs to go outside and wipe down the sensors and cameras.  The whole culture is based around the act of cleaning the sensors with a wool pad - thus the name of the series.<br /><br />We are introduced to the sheriff of the silo.  His wife had become convinced the whole \\"air is toxic\\" thing is just a big scam to keep people locked inside.  She found evidence that the history of the silo has been tampered with to hide the truth.  She found more evidence of software that can generate false video images.  Perhaps this explains the video feeds from the surface showing a dead toxic world?  She asks to go out.  Asking to go outside is a terrible crime and it guarantees you a one way ticket out.  Her sheriff husband is obligated to see her out the door.  Off she goes to clean the sensors and then, she assumes, she will be free to go frolic in the nice green hills even though everyone tells her that the air is so toxic it will quickly eat through her suit.<br /><br />A year or two later her distraught husband decides she might have been onto something with her conspiracy theory and he decides to follow her out.  So far the story is interesting.  Our sheriff discovers the truth about the earth and that would have been an amazingly good place to end this story making it one of the best short stories in Sci-fi history.  Or maybe an excellent Twilight Zone plot.  It would have been right up there with the original short story that inspired the book Ender's Game.  But like too many authors before, this author decides to drag a simple idea out in excruciating detail for endless pages to come.  Much like the author of Ender's Game decided to drag out his story into a multi-book series.  Groan!<br /><br />As the story grinds on, it takes a distinct turn for the worse.  The mayor of the silo decides to find a replacement sheriff and off she goes into the bowels of silo.  Seems these people lack the ability to make a safe space suit and also lack the ability to make an elevator.  The aging mayor is forced to walk 140 or so flights of stairs down then back up again.  That's where they lost me.<br /><br />We had a massive flood in Calgary this year and our building has been without elevators for 4 months.  I live on the 4th floor.  I can tell you from personal experience that walking up and down the stair wells is not fodder for an interesting series.  It is tedious.  It is boring.  It is tiring.  And so is this book.<br /><br />So how can thousands of Amazon readers give this thing 5 stars?  Now THAT would be a good plot for a Twilight Zone episode.  I assume you are all some kind of pod people?  Who knows...

B00BD99JMW|5.0|*Warning. This review may contain spoilers. Read at your own risk.* Allegiant is the third and final book in Veronica Roth's Divergent Trilogy. It is a young adult novel, which means that most of the readers are teenagers. I mean no disrespect to teens when I say this (because just a few years ago, I was a teen as well), but some of them (not all of them) have not experienced deep personal tragedies such as the death of someone close to them. I'm only saying this because the older people get, the more likely they are to experience that. So when the book ends in such a tragic way, obviously it is bound to upset people, but I think the older (and/or more mature you are) the easier it is to accept something like this. Yes, I was upset by the ending. I cried nonstop through many of the chapters at the end. But if anyone can say that they cried at the end of the book, how can they give it one star? If a book is able to captivate you and draw you in and take a hold of your heart in a way that you begin to cry tears for a fictional character, then the author has done something right. Yes, you can be angry about it. You can hate the ending. But if the ending made you that upset, does the book truly deserve one star?<br /><br />I am proud of Veronica Roth for doing something that many of the other famous young adult authors couldn't do (Rowling, Collins, Meyer, etc.). *SPOILER ALERT* She killed off her main character. Not A main character. THE main character. That takes guts. And I think it was the right choice. It fit with Tris's personality to go out in the way that she did. She sacrificed herself in a way that was similar to her parents. She died doing what she believed was right, and she didn't do it to be reckless and just throw her life away. She knew that she stood the best chance of succeeding at the mission. Let's face it; if Caleb would have done it as planned, they would have failed. He wouldn't have made it. It's as simple as that. Tris was the only one who coulddo it.<br /><br />The book did not leave me feeling angry or hopeless. I understood why Veronica Roth did what she did. The epilogue was a perfect ending. It left the reader hopeful for the future. This book, in my opinion, was the best one of the series. It was exciting and compelling. I didn't want to put it down until it was over. There were so many twists and surprises. It was complicated and made me think.<br /><br />I say, just give many of the readers some time to accept what happened and mull it over. I think some of them posted their reviews in the heat of the moment, but later they will come to realize what a good book this truly is.
076790592X|5.0|This is a beautiful little book that reminds us what a treasure the older generation is. They have so much to offer, if only we will take the time to listen. It's a quick read with a big message that stays with you long after you turn the last page, with tears in your eyes.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like everything about this show! Learn a lot about what lawyers have to go through day in and day out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Please make more puzzles such as this.  As I made it thru each door I was looking forward to the next room.  Reminded me of the old text only puzzles we played on early computers.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Cried through the entire last half of the book... So sad... Read it every chance I got and couldn't put it down!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This is the first Star Trek book that I have ever read.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story--it left me just wanting to read more of David Mack's books.
B00ESNE696|4.0|This show is better every year. Looking forward to Sundays show..It will be quite an explosion at the law firm. By the way I love all the actors on this show. The writing is great too.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher books and this one did not disappoint me.  It kept me guessing until the end.
B00FSBW2L6|4.0|I see this story as an lesson in a human's tendency to lose themselves along the way. The dangers of going too far with power, religion and self-discipline can make for a miserable life. Each of these causing prejudices, hate, self-importance and revenge. There is much more involved in The Black Eagle Inn that Fischer wishes express. He has a deep realization of what drives people, not only in Heimkirchen, but throughout the world. This is not an easy task to put into words, but with each character, through their lifetime, was able to display many of the faults of everyday people.<br /><br />Fischer perceives human actions and results below the surface, where most people tend to put little effort into understanding. I gave him a 4-star for trying and succeeding.<br /><br />I would have loved more color with the characters and setting. The characters were interesting, but I needed a face of some kind to relate to. I have been to Bavaria and it is very beautiful. I wanted to see that also.
B005HEXOWK|1.0|This review applies only to \\"Homestead\\".  The audio is not mixed properly.  While the dialog appears in both channels, all music and sound effects appear only in the right channel, making the viewing experience quite annoying.  I am looking for a way to contact Amazon to ask them to fix the audio.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I enjoy watching Castle and Beckett catch the bad guys! This is my favorite show to watch over and over again!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like the way you can kill as much animal's YOU want<br />I love the game<br /> So many good graphics<br />Well not to much to say
B00BEYX7TW|4.0|Pretty decent mystery movie - although Tommy Lee Jones was the best part bout the movie. I'd definitely recommend watching.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|The game mechanic is very linear but every thing works great.  This is a very enjoyable game.  It. Is probably more enjoyable if you want to spend money on it.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|So practical and simple, just click and watch it! So happy that I was able to find it so quick and see it online - no need to download or other kind of complications!
030014332X|4.0|i think anyone who has a vague idea of the history of the world would appreciate the simple yet complete history of the origins of our world knowledge and culture.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It's supposed to do very little. Somehow it manages to do even less. It connects to the wife and scrolls though background pictures.  Pretty sad that a such a limited device can't perform the one task it's intended to. I thought this would be easier  or more convenient than using my Xbox, Wii U or even my phone. Turns out I'm wrong on all counts. If it doesn't immediately work, give up. There is no support and a dozen better ways to do this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and good for the mind!  Extremely fun to complete with your family.  Very enjoyable at pretty much any age. I would and reccomended this to friends.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I love Star Wars movies.  This is great to have them all in one set.  Now I can get rid of my VHS versions.
B005LAJ16I|1.0|My DVDs are defective.  They freeze. They dont have scratches. Maybe is a defect from the manufacturer. All the dvds have these defects.

B000O14VAU|4.0|In this outing it is Vampire vs Lycan.  Lycanthrope being roughly “werewolf”.  I suspect between this movie and the colossal vampire story output by Anne Rice it was inevitable that any number of people would want to take this theme and idea in every direction imaginable.  This particular outing is not highbrow.<br /><br />This one is action packed.  From the beginning we’re shooting 30 -40 -50 rounds out of a single 8-9 bullet clip in a pistol.  Then, how some of the bullet victims can appear to squeeze their sphincter and have the bullets crawl out of the holes they’ve made in heads and bodies leaves me a bit curious, but it is kind of exciting.  I had to get used to the idea that some die and some don’t, and I never really figured out why because the movie was moving so quickly, and was exciting, so I just forgot to care why.  And I think that is what this movie is shooting for… exciting.  Unlike many “shoot ‘em up” fun-arcade like movies, this one actually has a story line.  A PLOT!  Actually there are a few subplots going on as well. Mind you, the story isn’t written by Jane Austen.<br /><br />How about this… there is enough “plot” left over to demand Volume II.  Let’s raise the Pom-Poms for sequels.  Think Kate Beckinsale in tight black shiny leather and superhuman strength.  But ladies, don’t cringe away from this one so quickly.  There is some kind of epic love thing going on here as well and plenty of “love story novel cover” type objects of affection.<br /><br />So, you know it is a vampire vs. werewolf shoot ‘em up story with a love story subplot.  What?  You want me to write the whole story?<br /><br />I was entertained. I’m not going to knock some “taking liberty” with things like how many bullets, and what can go through brick walls, or leap from high buildings.  With me...  I recently learned J. Michael Strazynski wrote Underworld #4, so I’m starting again from the beginning as I’ve never known JMS to write a bad script. This one earned its #4 by pure excitement and entertainment.  Sorry to the highbrow’s who think Bridges of Madison County is the only way to climb up to high ratings.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game on my computer and Android phone for months but was upset that I couldn't get it for my Kindle Fire. When I saw that it was finally available for the Kindle Fire, I was tickled! :-)
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I've used these with my iPhone & MacBook Air and the following sets of headphones:<br />Monoprice 8320, 8323, Sennheiser HD 201, 280, Sony MDR 7506 and my favorite, Sony MDR V6.<br /><br />Each set of headphones sounds marginally better through these.  Not enough to justify the time plugging it in.  The 8323's probably benefited the most, gaining nearly the bass response they have plugged in to my home receiver.<br /><br />I'll buy another FiiO amp, but it'll be one of the USB DAC models.  To my ears, these don't improve the sound enough justify their use.  They would probably help more with high impedance headphones, but if you've spent the money on a pair of those why are you buying a $20 amp instead of something better?
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun sudoku type game. It doesn't take too much time and it Can be as challenging as you want. The kids enjoy it as much as I do. It's a great time killer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addicting game. can get very frustrating when you run out of moves. great time passer. I love this game
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Great!  I live that there has been another great movie in the saga!<br />I will watch it again and again!
006202406X|1.0|The ending was pointless, needless, disappointing, and most of all, selfish. That Tris was still willing to sacrifice herself for those she loved was apparent when she took her brother's place, not knowing for sure whether she could survive the death serum. Nothing else was needed. The only thing Roth accomplished here was to ensure no other novel of hers is successful, because her readers no longer trust her.<br /><br />I usually advocate for film adaptations to stick closely to the book, but in this case I seriously hope they change the ending. Divergent readers deserve a good ending, Tris and Tobias deserve a good ending. Maybe the films will succeed where the author utterly, and so unfortunately, failed.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Wonderfully thought out... deep world, deep and  thorough characters. As in other Sanderson novels,  some of the dialog and  humor seems ill-fitting, but this is a small price to pay for the whole experience.
8866137510|3.0|It met below my expectations but it was my fault because I didn't realize how small it was. I love moleskine products and get them every year
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|its a really good game so keep on going dumb charcters.<br />I give this game five stars.So bye guys bye
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love readimg about other cultures and this book is one you do not put down until you are finished.
B005N95JA4|5.0|The Deluxe edition is 2 seperate CD's : First, the original CD remastered. Excellent songs, one of many strong albums from the band and still fresh all these years later.<br />The second CD is the 12 bonus tracks. These songs were started back at the time of the original recording sessions and completed by the band for this special release. Although not quite as good as the original songs that made the cut, they are still very good songs that add to the release. So this is what it might have sounded like had they chosen to do a double album then and it is something that fans of the band will certainly enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is awesome you should totally get it! I have been waiting for the game to come and it finally came!  *sweetest game ever*
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun addictive game!  not too hard but not too easy either. totally recommend. best part about it is its free!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very entertaining. It is for the kids and they love it. I woul recomend it to anyone. Thanks a lot.
B009V0TV6O|3.0|play store describes the pay one as having unlimited rhythm variations, this on limits you to 4, Amazon should fix this fatotd problem. Also mis stated permission : says phone state, but is really phone state AND identity! uninstalling, 4 rhythms is useless.<br />REVISED: Going on the developer's feedback to my rant, I tested their words and installed the Playstore free version: There is a big difference including lack of ads in this \\"full\\" version.<br />  To the dev: sorry I was wrong about endless rhythm assertion, actually Play store says \\"endless loops\\" (the metronome won't stop after 2 cycles) and there are no ads in this.<br />The permissions are the same from both sources, so I stand by why does it not say \\"read phone identity?\\"<br /><br />I ran them side by side and you're right- so I upped my stars. The problem is still with stated permissions, because even on the play store the dev is honest about the phone state AND read identity, but neglects to inform us about the internet connectivity feeding the ads to the app, so I think this one is also connected...sending my identity through non-disclosed internet access.
B00E257ZKW|5.0|It's a beautiful story about love but you probably feel sad when you finish it.  I like it tho !
B006WMILQU|4.0|I wasn't familiar with the story so I enjoyed the discovery.  The costumes and scenery were beautifully done.  I appreciated the character development.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Good movie for those who like the weird-side (myself included). Very close to the original book. A really good movie for the whole family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love how candy crush finally came to kindle. I love this game!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you all need to get candy crush you will love it!!!!!!!!!
0545615402|5.0|It great to get these entertaining books is Hardcover. They are beautifully bound. Perfect for the avid collector of J.K. Rowling's works.<br />The box that they come in complements this set nicely.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OH MY GOODNESS!!! On Amazon scrolling thru the apps and what do I see CANDY CRUSH SAGA app!  I've been searching for it on the Kindle for so long.  I hope it's compatible with the new Kindle Fire HDX.  I just purchased this and waiting for my new Kindle HDX to arrive.  I'm getting all my kindle apps and games ready.  Oooo weee I can't wait.  This is a very addictive game.  There will be times you will get stuck on levels for days and weeks at a time, but it's a good stress buster and I highly recommend to download it.  Don't delay it any longer no matter what you've heard.  You won't regret it.  At least it's not a violent game.
B00FR3WZKI|1.0|I have been waiting on this project since I first heard of it. Being a long time fan, I got the CD on the first day of release. Hoping to hear a fresh remix of the songs included, I happily put the CD in and let it go. To my ears, what a major disappointment! One of my favorites by Donna, Dim All The Lights, is reduced to a few word from the original repeated over and over to a dub beat. Seems like the remixer couldn't even be bothered to pay tribute, SHAME. Then one of the better remixes, hard to say that, is Working The Midnight Shift, which really doesn't include Donna, but a session singer. What another great tribute? I would rather heard that on another CD of other artist paying tribute to Donna by covering her music. This Cd is way off the mark and to me, a massive disrepect to a true artist who transcended the musical genres.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Not sure I why I didn't watch this series sooner! Kept me hooked, but luckily I watched it on Amazon Streaming
B0036S4B6M|5.0|My book group read and reviewed this book and it was a great discussion. This book is well written, interesting and opens up a world of things to think about and discuss.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I could not stay interested in although I finished reading this book.  Felt as if I were back in school and reading a textbook.  Where was the humanity of it all not to mention the spirituality?
B009JBZH54|5.0|I know that there is a bigger, more expensive blu-ray trilogy availible, but I think it's a waste of money. This comes with it's own behind the scenes book, and tons of special features. This is a great value for any fan of Nolan or Batman
B001BANK32|5.0|Great novel. One of King's best. And now if you're wanting more you don't have to wait, just pick up a copy of Doctor Sleep.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Resolution is really great, it's a reliable product that hasn't cut out for me yet. No complaints, it matches its description and is cheap to boot. Hopefully they will add new apps for it soon.
B003CH9PTU|4.0|At times this is actually hard to watch, yet despite the violence, I am unable to walk away because I want to see what happens next.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It keeps my kindle protected.  It is easy to use and the fact that it rotates helps depending on what you are doing.  The only part I wasn't as happy with is that it is hard to remove from the case
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This application allows me to better enjoy viewing  sites like C-Span. The Kindle apps were allowing me to view the posted stories so I needed this app to stay informed.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|The book was turned into a show which we watch.  I didn't know it when I purchased the book.  It was good and gave some back ground for the show
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|A very useful application if you do a lot of research and downloading from the web. I Great for older people to download various research on medical conditions which we need to stay on top of and well informed to understand our various treatment options and their side effects.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book - it worked on two levels - as a picture of people existing in a totalitarian state and as an investigation into the victims of a serial killer. The background to story is Russia in the time of Stalin where it was not necessary to have done something wrong to be charged and sent to a labor camp or executed. It depicts day to day life and survival in that kind of environment very realistically and gives an idea of what it must be like to live in North Korea now. The murder mystery aspect of the story was also well done (it was inspired by the actions of a actual killer). The only downside for me was the twist near the end that was to me a little too unbelievable. The book was so well written with a solid structure that this small flaw can be overlooked. I would recommend this book and have bought the other two books in the series to see what happens next.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I just prefer the is browser over Silk, which I find doesn't do a great job on searches. This and Google are what I prefer.
B00CM03H4C|4.0|I have not seen the movie, but I have read the book so I know the time period it was set in. I have watched other movies by the director so I know that he uses modern songs to convey the feel of what he wants (prime example Romeo & Juliet - a soundtrack which I also liked). I liked the songs and some of them were given a 20's vibe so the compilation was nice mixture which came together well. I liked the CD overall and would recommend it.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app is really nice, it helps my brain to think of all the places once I met. Enjoy a lot.
B0032FPVKE|4.0|Always knew I would have to have something to carry my cam corder and camera together in and this size was just perfefct, even letme carry my cords and extra sd cards.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The Despicable Me : Minion Rush  is the best game the family and I are all over it !!! I always say this is the last game and 15minutes will go by lol....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Kindle finally has candy crush. I love it. Now, I don't have to be on Facebook to play it. It's a great game that will not disappoint.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Our 12 year old granddaughter really loved this game.  She played the songs and we did a sing-a-long -- a fun game.  We both would recommend this game for family fun or fun for one person!!
1781162646|3.0|First let me say that I enjoyed the book tremendously.  Quality writing (which one would expect from King). . . . .It was entertaining, good characterizations, etc. . . . .I'd recommend it.  However, I reserve my &#34;four stars&#34; for books that I would read again and JOYLAND just doesn't meet that standard).  Still -- for light entertainment -- I say BRAVO!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Our granddaughter really enjoys this game.  Whenever she visits, she always wants to play on the Kindle.  She recommends this game.
B000SEH80I|5.0|One of the best and most practical books I've ever reading you've grown up in a family with toxic parents.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is really cool also you can compete against your friends but all you need is 500 coins to sign up on Facebook.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Missed this at the theaters and I always wanted to see it. Prime was a great way to see it
B009O2XY12|5.0|My wife, granddaughter and I all enjoy this game and play it quite often.  We would recommend it to all ages.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|A most intense and gritty side of national politics than West Wing was. It seemed a little more real for the depiction of the power plays behind the scenes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's hard for me to find games that keep me interested...but this one is awesome! I definitely recommend it! Love it
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Another great season with a fun show that I look forward to getting each year since I don't watch on commercial tv during the year. Things have matured in several ways was this year. The daughter is off in college. There is romance finally thrown into the mix. I really enjoyed this.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Lots of good Lego's out there and this is great gift item. Plan to buy more different ones as well, and recommend product to all people I know, and spread it around to others what a great item it is, fast prompt shipping, and secured package.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|I was really impressed with this show since I didn't know anything about it before buying it. I got to see what because I was curious about the lead actress patricia Arquette. I had been a big fan of her sister Rosanna and could not remember seeing Patricia in anything before. It turns out I had after going to Wikipedia. The show is as much based on her family life as her medium work. Show is based on a real live person. Worth a watch.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Lots of good Lego's out there and this is great gift item. Plan to buy more different ones as well, and recommend product to all people I know, and spread it around to others what a great item it is, fast prompt shipping, and secured package.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A fitting return for Jake and the gang. The finale was moving and quite powerful. The supporting characters are well drawn and engaging. Thank you, Mr. Grisham !
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I'm  hooked and half way through season 2.  The writing is excellent and keeps you waiting for the next show.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Nothing  really  needs  to  be  said.  Perfection.<br />Couldn't'  wait  to  put  this  in  my  CD  Player  and  turn the  volume  up  full  blast.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Alma Whittaker is the kind of character you want to wrap in your arms and hold forever. I loved living in her world and wanted nothing more than to be with her every step of the way and give her all the things she wanted.<br /><br />Gilbert creates three dimensional, complicated characters that live in 19th century Pennsylvania. The smallest, quietest lives are filled with tiny, quiet tragedies that make your heart ache and your head spin - in a way that's tender and magical and delicious.<br /><br />If you're a die hard Gilbert fan, you'll be relieved and thrilled. If you're new to her work, you'll finally understand all the hype surrounding Eat, Pray, Love.<br /><br />Buy this book!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Susan is a spellbinding writer I enjoyed every minute of her book, it was exciting romantic suspenseful all the way. I can't wait to read the next book.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It's the best series in the world and now it's over. I don't know what to do now.... I guess I wait for the new Mortal instruments book....
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I Loved this CD I can relate to many of the songs. Especially ROAR I was bullied in high school and I am trying to make something of myself to show them that I am bigger than that. I Liked this album just as much as her other 2. I have the Zine Pak and it is awesome there is so much in there. I  Love this album. My fiancee also likes it we listen to it all the time. Keep doing what you do Katy. I wish I could see her live I bet she is awesome like she is on her CD's.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|When the football game is all but over and your team is winning than it time to play this game.  The game is designed to take your money but it is possible to play without paying.  You just need a lot of boring football.  But really it is a good game.
B00E6895M6|5.0|I was lucky to have been introduced to Chvrches via Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. After hearing them, I ventured to YouTube and other performances on the internet that made me anxiously await the release of Bones of What You Believe. Many albums only have one or two songs that are good but this album has no dead spots. The vocal style of Lauren Mayberry stick with you long afterwards and the more you listen to the album the more you appreciate them.<br /><br />My only criticism and it is not just with this album but many new cd releases is that it seems the sonic quality is degraded maybe to be more playbable on portable devices. The keyboards could have been much more rich and punchy as hear on many synth oriented albums from the 80's i.e. Depech Mode, Human League, Gary Neuman. I wish Chvrches would remix the album especially &#34;Lies&#34; which fails to deliver the kick that it can, but is lost in the mix. Love the album though, just know what it could sound like if given the proper mix.
006202406X|1.0|I've never been more disappointed in a book before. I have loved the series and really became connected to the characters. I was looking forward to finding out about the world outside of their city and how Tris and her friends would help put things back together. Instead I was left with unbelievable reasons as to why these people are fighting, and no delvelopment in any of the characters.<br />If you loved the first two books, do yourself a favor and do not read this book.<br /><br />******spoilers below******<br /><br />The main conflict in the story was very difficult to believe, I just couldn't make myself accept that that's why everyone didn't get along. The book got to be slow and a bit confusing at times.<br />And I know the big thing with most people is the ending. Yes, it was a very unsatisfying ending and of course I would have had it any other way. I found it very disappointing how she died, it wasn't heroic in my eyes. It wasn't really for any greater good at all. And in my opinion how she died was completely out of chatacter. Not true to Tris at all.<br />I couldn't tell Tobias and Tris apart when switching up the POVs. I used to like Tobias but after hearing from his perapective I started liking him less and less.<br />The book as a whole felt flat.<br />I was really looking forwars to finishing this trilogy, now I wish I had never picked up the book.
B009T1J0PM|5.0|The third wheel is a great book I have read it more than 8 times in a row. it may be a sort book but it is full of exciting pages. this may be the very last chance to get date to the dance will he get one?
B008ROG6E0|4.0|I love old TV shows from my childhood. They may be kooky or corny now, but I still love to watch them ;)
006202406X|5.0|So much to take in... So many emotions... Can relate with many of them! Grateful Roth was brave and showed that life really sucks sometimes!  It is important to recognize and enjoy the moments that don't suck!
1423170644|5.0|My daughter loves \\"Read-Alongs\\" and has a ton of them. When I saw that the Frozen audiobook was available I had to get it as we are very excited for the new movie. We loved the audio book and loved the characters/story- can't wait to see the film now!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This device did not work with my wireless (originally due to low signal strength). It required the AP to be directly behind the device, and, even though it is an 802.11n AP, the higher resolutions could not stream. Maybe the network is crowded here (there are lots of other APs) but none of my regular devices (phones, laptops) have had any issues with the wifi.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|After the first two books, I was head over heels for Four....I love that I got tons of him here but the ending needed more Tris!! I'm not giving out spoilers about why and I guess I understand why it ended the way it did but it lacked some emotion and could've went further....I just needed more....more!!!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|they were disappointed because you had to use internet to play this one, and we didn't have it where we were so they were somewhat disappointed.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|The noise cancelling is exceeds expectations.  I can listen the car radio at normal levels without the caller being able to hear any of the music.  No issues.  Great headset and pretty comfortable.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I downloaded this for the kids. they seem to enjoy it. It was easy to put on my kindle and when they left I took it off. Just something for them to play with. but the really enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show!  The story is well written and the historical snap shot is amazing!  My husband is even hooked, that tells you a lot!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have been counting the days until this release. I have never been more disappointed with a series then this one
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Very easy to get hooked on watching the episodes. I am looking forward to watching the additional seasons. I like the three main character in the show: Olivia, Peter, and Walter. They are a good combination.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|The most well written show on TV today!  Layer after layer. Simply beautiful.  The Shakespeare undercurrent is intoxicating. Thank you.

B00E3I3KDE|5.0|Usually, I'd Disapprove Of Artists Releasing An Album, And After A Year Has Gone By, They Release It With New Material.

I Thank God Everyday For Letting Such An AWESOME Artist Exist. Thanks, Ellie!

B009P0VLGI|5.0|Having All Of Their English Albums Already, I Was Skeptical About The Reissue. But When I Read That The Long Awaited English Version Of Their 2002 Single, Prostye Dvizheniya, Titled A Simple Motion, Would Be Released For The First Time Ever, I Screamed In Joy! It Was Totally Worth It, And I Recommend This To Any t.A.T.u. Fan!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wasted time investing in a series that falls right into the trap of killing a main character for &#34;the good of mankind&#34;. Please, try something creative & not such a cop out, Veronica. I will never read another one of her books and I will not be seeing the Divergent movie.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Great book! You should read it science rules if you love talent shows you need to read this book right now !!!!!!!!

B008LV8TSU|5.0|Like probably so many others I was brought in by Miyazaki's film but Diana Jones held me there. While the film will always be one of my favorites it really doesn't do this book justice. I HIGHLY suggest anyone who has seen the movie (and who hasn't) to go ahead and give this book a try.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this forever when I got it it rocked and it is so much fun when you start this you most likely get hooked on it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Such an incredible series and in my opinion the \\"hands down\\" BEST dystopian novel out there no matter if you are 10 30 or 88, this is a MUST read that takes your breath away! Well done Mrs. Roth

B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love guess the emoji.why? It is a game that test the brain on combine words to make words.you should get this game
B00DJWV11I|5.0|The writing was just hilarious! It was different and engaging! The hero, Drew, was the perfect leading man! There were a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, a few erotic scenes but not completely over the top. The book was so visual it was like watching a movie in my head! You know what would be great is if they actually brought this to the silver screen!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting for this to appear on Kindle and was so pleased when it was announced  This is a very addictive game and would rather play this than do anything, like work!
B004XZR63M|5.0|One of the best book I read! And the best Investment I made! Reading this book for the second time right now.
B005544V6A|5.0|A nice twist on what has become an overpopulated segment of TV...the lawyer show!  This show somehow captures you, not with the cases they deal with, but more importantly with the characters that have developed....giving it a stronger foundation. Great show.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Meh.  Annoyed with the never-ending circles.  Entwined in purgatory.... pick a freaking plot and stick to it.  Not getting the reviews that complained about explicit content.... found it to be Luke warm and very slow moving.....
6302794331|5.0|I bought this VHS because I purchased a VCR and a small collection of sentimental movies on VHS because they bring back fond memories. This movie makes the holiday viewing list most years. It's one of my favorites.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A really nifty little application that one is comfortable using. Works as it should and is good for basic calculations.

B006AZZPCM|4.0|This is a good application for downloading content on You tube easily. It does sometime stops but not often. Would recommend it.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I bought season one because I was a huge Six Feet Under fan, and I wanted to watch Michael C. Hall. Boy, is he an altogether different guy in this series. Interesting watching. Still prefer him as David (grin).
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|Not at all what i expected it to be. it also gives link to adult stuff and I do not like that at all.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|you can not beat Victor Hugo in creating the period of time he is writing about. A great novel about human nature
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|I have been a fan of Def Leppard for 30 years this is the best live cd yet. The sound is in-freakin-credible throughout the cd and dvd. The hair stood up on my arms when Animal came on. Songs sound new and refreshed with new guitar riffs added. Awesome to hear older songs such as Wasted, Mirror Mirror, and On through the night that don't usually get played live. Loved the Steve Clark Tribute. RIP Steamin Steve Clark.... Long live Def Leppard... Rock On...
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I would not recommend this application to others. its operation is sticky and one gets frustrated. This could have been tested before release.
B00E5N8E6K|5.0|Awesome music, song choice, sound, everything about this dvd is 100% amazing. A must get for the Def Leppard fan. Would recommend to anyone. Rock on... Long live Def Leppard...
1451695195|1.0|He takes an opportunity to glorify GOD, and minimalizes what he claims is a near death experience. If he truly had a near death experience he could NOT be this indifferent to what can only be an awe inspiring experience.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|The Kaiju - Jaeger fights were fun, and really the only compelling reason to watch \\"Pacific Rim\\".  Too bad they only make up about 20 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The plot and the characters, on the other hand, are the products of a Hollywood committee.  You can almost see the checklist being ticked off.  It is hard to believe that Del Toro directed this movie, and even harder to believe that he wants to produce a sequel.<br /><br />The movie has a completely predictable plot, with over-the-top characters who are forced to recite some of the most painfully bad dialogue you could imagine.  You can almost hear Del Toro yelling \\"Care about these people!  Care about them!\\"  But you just don't.  You've seen it all before in movies like Independence Day and Transformers.  You know exactly what's going to happen.  You've had all those buttons pushed too many times before, and it just doesn't work.<br /><br />What makes it worse is knowing that Del Toro could have done so much better.  When Michael Bay makes a stinker, you don't care because you know he has no real talent.  Guillermo Del Toro, on the other hand, had made some great movies.  Hopefully he will make more in the future, but \\"Pacific Rim 2\\" won't be one of them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad to finally be able to get this on my Kindle Fire! And this app  links to my facebook app so I am playing at the same level.
B0031Y4ALC|5.0|The sound of The Cure in this Vynil, is amazing, takes me back to when I first heard it. The quality of the product is great.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Great concept, compelling characters. A future you can believe might happen. Really enjoyed it and can't wait to read the next.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book.  Suspenseful, &#34;edge of your seat&#34; good!.  One of those reads where I was sorry it was a Kindle edition and not an actual book.  I wanted to hold it and turn back real pages throughout the story - it was that good.  Didn't want it to end.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|To the free games....I on disability and can not afford to pay for the full game I was lucky someone bought me this kindle fire hd, but I do enjoy the games...please continue to make more but with endings...thank you
B006GWO5NE|4.0|What else can one say.  It is a cable that syncs and charges both my Kindles.  It is an authentic cable made by Amazon.  I wish it was longer so I can read while charging.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Our of all the crossover novels this one is by far my favourite due to dramatic cliff hangers and a bond with the characters that simply come from good writing. I cannot wait until the next release see and applaud Sylvia day for her amazing talent.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|Brandon doesn't have the same skill set as Robert and kept repeating himself throughout the book. Also he could of done a much better job with the last two books. Some details left very bare and then some he just couldn't stop telling us. That was made these last books so crummy.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Now I understand why the author wrote in two voices Tris and Four. I didn't like that from the beginning of the book because their voices were too much the same and it was confusing to start a chapter thinking it was Tris only to realize that it was Four. A lot of the book was confusing or boring because it seemed like Tris and Four were just facing the exact same situation in this book as they had when they wre still inside the city except that instead of the factionless it was the GD and the fringe people. I wouldn't have finished the book except that I lived the first one so much that I wanted to know what happened but now I'm sorry I did.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|It's just an insouciant romp. Totally just for fun. Some unhappiness with the recurring enemies. Nice to get new adversaries more frequently.
B0064NTZKI|5.0|If you're a Woody Allen fan (and even if you're not), you can't miss this funny and insightful chronological look at Woody's movies and insights from him and of those around him. A great peak under the covers, you won't watch another of his movies without thinking of this documentary.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Exasperatingly sensual, but would've loved more from Grey's point-of-view...could not seem to put the book down until I had exhausted ev'ry last period!
B007ZYK3CE|5.0|This movie is so bleak that you're tempted to shut it off after 20 minutes. But don't. Tremendous character development takes over, and by the end you've witnessed a beautiful grey portrait, where nothing is what it seems.<br /><br />Watch it.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|One of the best movies of the summer, love to see a Macross or Gundam movie made by these producers/ directors
B007CGLRWA|4.0|I'd give this one 4.5 stars if I could.<br /><br />This is a dark look at a teacher coping with his own demons and an education system that doesn't care about the students or the staff. It starts slowly, but the parade of cameos from a number of great character actors holds your attention long enough to get you truly invested in the story. Keep with it, and you'll be rewarded by the end.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Nice movie .you can see they spent $$$ for 3D conversion of this film, i love 3D flicks, this one gave me a headache, they overdrived the image split,like a cleaver to the skull, still one of the greatest movies EVER !!! thanks SS :)
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|You can't go wrong with this game.  It is pretty and has good puzzles.  Happily it has NO hidden object scenes which are not my favorites.  I am a point-and-click girl from the early days of PC adventures.  And it was only 99 cents.  I have liked other Fire Maple games and hope they make another similar adventure.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is so addictive. I started season 1 on a Sunday - watched the whole season in 1 day. Proceeded to watch the whole of season 2 the next day, and the whole of season 3 the following day. Now I have to wait forever !!!! for season 4
B009O2XY12|5.0|Love this bubble craze spend hours playing and waiting to recharge to play again, needs to give more men to play more bubbles
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This was a fun watch.  I would watch it again, but probably not buy it for my dvd library. special effects were good.  good writing.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Acting is superb as always-very nice to see Dianne get a breakout role.<br />The rest of the actors are their typically good excellent selves as well.<br /><br />Great storyline to cause a dual-split in the firm-Dianne leaving to become<br />Supreme Court Judge and Alicia splitting off with Cary to avoid further<br />romantic complications with Will.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Okay, so I know the critics did not give &#34;After Earth&#34; a good review.  That did not stop me from wanting to see it.  The film was obviously Will Smith's attempt to debut his son as a central star and I think Jaden did a fine job of acting-- for a teenager.  I liked the move and would probably watch it again.  My grandchildren 8 and 10 liked the movie, too.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Absolutely an amazing TV series. It does not disappoint. Watch it now, do not wait, you will not regret it.
B00607EWYC|3.0|A fascinating story of three generations of fathers, all &#34;touched&#34; in some way, set against the backdrop of a man on his death-bed. The tale jumps around seamlessly in time through the lush and rich Maine woods, filled with tinkers, clocks, memories, family, and madness. The writing is exquisite and brutal in its humanity. As an exercise in excellent storytelling with insight into the internal struggles of everyday men, it succeeds. And there are moments of levity and light-heartedness as well but they were few and short. Ultimately, I'm disappointed to say, it is very sad and unfulfilling. The redemption or understanding that I was hoping would come forward by the end never showed. This fact it shares with so much modern literature and it left my brow furrowed and lips pursed. Really not the expression I prefer to wear upon completion of a good book.<br /><br />(Edited to add:) An hour after I hit enter on this I still had that expression on my face. I thought about it and realized that though the story is &#34;billed&#34; as touching on love and family, it really was only a shell of it. The only love that was really exhibited in any of the relationships was a mechanical love, one of obligation and duty, not of the person. I suppose that fits in with the stereotype of the cold and stiff-lipped wasps of the northeast however I begin to wonder if the author did this intentionally or simply lacked the capacity.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Good mouse for the price. Programs easy and is very precise.  A little small for my hand and that makes it easy to accidentally bump one of the thumb buttons as I work.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Aslan seems to breath hot and cold. I can't figure out if he is for Jesus or against him. Or neutral.
B001TM14VC|5.0|Loved it then.  But now when I look back on it it seems a little silly.  Still have to give it 5 stars for what it meant back when it was first released.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it,  play all the time. Have insomnia and it keeps me company. LOL<br /> I like to replay levels to get 3 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad that the Candy Crush app is now available for the Kindle. But I'm not able to get my lives from my cell phone onto my Kindle. Please help.
B000NA28I4|2.0|ok it has its good and bad points. it sort of followed the book in how some of the events happened. How ever it strayed of coarse BIG time. If you have not ready the book, the movie is great, if you have read the book then it is a huge disapointment. I wish Christopher Poalini had more say in how the screen play was done. they could have done a better job. Needless to say I was very disapointed. I do not want to see any more of the series turned into movies.
B003I55BIA|4.0|After reading Easy, I went in search of more contemporary romances that had a dark edge to them. Perfect Chemistry kept popping up, I saw some really great reviews for it, and had numerous people recommend it to me. So I gave it a go and I am very glad I did. Perfect Chemistry was the perfect mix of romance, drama, heartbreak, and trouble.<br /><br />The best part of the book is that there is no insta-love. The characters build up their relationship as the book progresses. Their chemistry builds as the story moves along and the characters grow over time. These are two people who seem extraordinarilary different on the outside, but have much more in common then they once realized. Their relationship is not easy and it is definitely not without it's problems, but it is also very deep and very meaningful. These two find exactly what they needed in each other, even though they didn't know they needed it.<br /><br />This book takes the stereotypes of the perfect cheerleader and the criminal gang member, and shows that things are not always what they seem. Maybe these teens are just trying to fit into the roles assigned to them and are really just looking for a way to be themselves. This book turned out to be much more serious than I anticipated. There was some humor, but most of the book dealt with some terrible and seemingly insurmountable situations.<br /><br />While I liked Alex, I do have my reservations when it comes to him. I had a hard time getting past the initial bet, because I just felt like any guy who would make that bet in the first place is simply a jerk. However, he did change a lot throughout the course of the novel and did make up for it. It just took me a while to warm up to him because of it.<br /><br />Overall Perfect Chemistry is a great read, especially for fans of contemporary romance. The story is very sweet and also very moving. I am looking forward to reading the rest of this series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I not only got this game me for free but Amazon actually paid me 20 coins to download this awesome game!  It is a lot of fun and is challenging but not so bad as to make you want to pull out your hair.....THANKS Amazon!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I am not going to say I am disappointed, but I do feel cheated. Cheated in the way like how I felt after I saw the movie “Seven” for the first time.  I am not the target audience for this book, but that did not stop me from picking it up and really enjoying Divergent and Insurgent. Allegiant not so much, for me I didn’t find the story or the characters personality as coherent to the other 2 books. It seem predicable and written fast as if trying to close up all the loose ends or making it a fast and easy read for the YA audience. It followed every blue print that has been used in every future dystopian society: Class warfare, racism on some level, a couple trying to find love in spite of all the obstacles that are tossed at them, ect.  Not all is bad though with this book which is why I did give it 3 stars. I think the author took a risk with this book and that I have to acknowledge. The alternating view of Tris and Tobias, while not popular with many, was an extremely risky way of getting 2 points of view across. I did like that because it read more like a TV show or movie .Also the author is not afraid to try and take a page out of the George R. R. Martin school of writing or as I now call it “all the people I love are dead” style of writing. I did feel cheated though with the ending, but I do feel the epilogue made up a little bit for it. If you have started the series I do recommend finishing it, don’t cheating yourself that way, but go into it with caution and keeping in mind this is a dystopian society and sometimes the better love stories are the ones that end in tragedy.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love it! I can wake up to any of the songs I have on my Kindle Fire HD and the various clocks are really cool.
006202406X|1.0|This was incredibly slow and almost a choir to just keep turning the pages.  The ending just doesn't make sense and leaves you feeling empty.  People read to escape this world and find heroes in the most unlikely characters.  Dystopias thrive on hope and when hope is crushed all we have is reality once again.  I can't think of one reason to recommend this book because I don't have a reason to hold this story in my heart any longer. Very disappointing.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark and hard to read (emotionally) but, overall, great.  Characters are not easily accessible and tough to like.  Wrap-up seemed a bit hasty.  Still, with those criticisms, I have to say:  She is a terrific author.
B000MR1V22|5.0|I have seen this movie a number of times, including at the theater.  It has a lot of drama as well as humor. I would see it all over again  which I only am willing to do with about three movies
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I would be curious to meet the people who feel this book should be banned from schools. This book is not what they say it is. It is beautifully written and heartbreaking. Eleanor lives with her Mom and Stepdad, who is a drunk and violent. She has 3 younger brothers and a younger sister. They don't live in a nice part of Omaha. Eleanor meets Park and they fall in love. Park is from a healthy family who love each other. Park's parents know a little of what Eleanor's home life is like and so they allow her to spend as much time at their house as possible. Eleanor gets bullied at school, but it's subtle. I figure this book is set in the late 70s and early 80s, just when I was that age and school was a lot like what Rainbow wrote about. If people don't want their kids to read this book it's because they don't want their kids to see that some families are like Eleanor's. Some kids are in families where they have to watch what they say, watch what they have in their possession and even watch what time they take a bath. This is a book that must be read. It's a book that will stay with you for a long time. I like the way it bounces back between Eleanor and Park. How they misread body language and words. How they really are a lot a like. Some kids at 16 really do fall hard for each other.
B004KAWC0C|5.0|I love this movie because everything that is said, is sung. The music is beautiful, it is a great history lesson and my husband and I both love it
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|Great movie for the kids, just as good as the original. The kids have watched it 5 times in 3 days.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book however the end was anti-climactic, which I didn't care for. The storyline does keep your interest.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After loving the first two books in this series, I cannot help but being so disappointed in this final installment.  I am just beside myself with how many things are wrong with this book, but these are my main complaints:<br />First, the switching points of views from chapter to chapter.  I kept forgetting which point of view I was reading from throughout the book.  I have read plenty of stories where the author changes points of view and never had a problem keeping track of which person's viewpoint the story is being told from.  There was just no real distinction in their thoughts, it all read the same way.<br />Second, the setting of the story made me disconnect from it more. The first two books are so well established in the setting of Chicago.  It was its own world, and now we are torn away from it all that is going on there to be placed in this sterile environment with all these new people that I have no connection with and don't care about for the majority of the story.<br />Third, the big reveal about the purpose of the factions was such a let down.  It was anticlimactic and, well, boring.  It made me immediately think, how can there be over 300 pages left in this story?  Where can she be going with this, and how can it be a good story?  Well, my answer was, she ultimately went nowhere with the story, and it's not good.<br />Fourth, where was the action?  I felt like so much of the story was wasted on explanations of a world that Tris and Tobias knew nothing about, or trying to figure out who is lying to them and who is not.  I wasn't compelled to keep reading.  The first two books I couldn't put down and read them each in a day.  This book took me five days because I knew it would just keep getting worse, and it did.<br />Finally, the ending.  It felt so unnecessary and without reason, like she wrote it that way because it would be the unexpected thing to do (or maybe just the sacrificial thing, since that was such a major theme of the story).  But I just feel cheated.  I started on a journey with Tris in Divergent and I did not get to finish this journey with her.ed on a journey with Tris in Divergent and I did not get to finish this journey with her.
B0001I561E|5.0|The movie was shipped promptly, and in the condition stated.<br />I would definitely recommend the seller for future purchased.<br />This is my friend's favorite movie, and I decided she should own her all time favorite movie! Shouldn't we all?!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I have anxiously awaited the release of this book. Roth didn't disappoint. She wrote just as tight and strong of a story as the first two. I both liked and disliked the alternating narration. Just as I both loved and hated the ending.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This is a simple old school monster movie! I mean who doesnt love giant robots vs monsters with the world in the balance? The special effects are second to none, the movie will leave you wanting more of GYPSY DANGER!
0740797719|5.0|awesome book. highly recommended. a must read for every visual artist. clear, cientific, and nice paper. the only thing that should be improve is the hard cover
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  It has it all: action, comedy, suspense, even a little romance.  I love the throwback to Wrath of Khan also.  There's really nothing bad to say about it.

B000002JNJ|4.0|lam very classic!! for metal IRON MAIDEN, METTALLICA, BLACK SABBATH!!  etc, but pantera has good guitars with drums l don't like the stupit screaming l like a good real power screaming like JUDAS PRIEST,DIO etc but l like pantera and will get more music from them.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great clock! I love the blue numbers and I love that I can pick my favorite music as my alarm. I also love that I can set multiple alarms......and a different some to each alarm.
B00005JLKB|4.0|great story, pretty girls! with actors that were in the original movies,, the best series for his infance no doubt SUPERBOY
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Well its just plain fun.  If you're looking for the fist-pounding heart-stopping wham bam action of, say, the Jason Bourne novels, this is not the book for you. This story is for those who like their conspiracies light-hearted and their characters just a little (but only a little) daffy. There are no guns, bombs or kill shots; just affectionately drawn nerds with laptops, algorithms and loopy quests. Find a big comfortable chair in front of a window flooded with sunlight, loop your legs over one  of the arms the way you did as a teenager (unless you're still a teenager, in which case you'll like this book even more) and lose yourself in the delights of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.
B00005U122|5.0|with great beginning in the 60's with PINK FLOYD amazing creation on dark side of the moon, the wall, animals, final cut for example any thing from him its guaranty the best rock on the planet ever!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|was waiting FOR EVER for this app!!  terrific graphics and now i can get 1 life at a time if i wish!
B00002Z88D|4.0|l love Michael kamen with pink Floyd,,  and l love metallica and l do like this concert but honestly l was expecting better,  there are some songs that some how don't convence me but of course you gotta have this on you collection.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|When I first got this app I kept on losing because on plane one you have to blow and I don't have a sensor so I kept on crashing, but then I noticed in the settings you can disable the plane part...  SO I'M HAPPY!!!!!!!
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|I just read Percy jackson and the Lighting Thief and LOVED it!!!!!! Its a great book that keeps you the edge  your seat the whole  time. Recomend this book for 10-14 yr olds
B000QWA7EG|5.0|Bought this for my husband since it was one of his favorite albums &#34;back in the day.&#34;  It sounded as great as ever and brought back some fond memories.
B00499NHLC|4.0|This show is obviously the forerunner to Elementary. so many parallels. The only difference is that Lucy Lu Is hotter!!!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A beautifully written and hilarious read. Go on an emotional journey with plently of laughs with these lovable (and sometimes frustrating) characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy this game so much. Not too hard but not too easy. Just enough to pick your brain. Interesting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its great to finialy get this app on to the kindle. I'm so excited to have it. I played everyday
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is fun and the graphics are great. The rewards are real nice too. I recommend this to my friends & everyone.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The garden and prosthetic leg give us hope.  Better reinforce those fences, though! BTW, Daryl, your hair rocks! I want that style!
0345529057|4.0|Purchased as a gift for a friend of mine after watching the tv series and its a great read still waiting on the fifth one.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|WWQZ (Quick Zombies)!  Scrambling up that wall scared the britches off me! Get your flu shots, people! Looking forward to WW2QZ!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game for all ages!  Challenging to play.<br />I am playing all the time and I have enjoyed it a lot.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game. it has beautiful graphics, lots of interesting puzzles, and a lovely storyline. I wish it was longer. Hopeing to see more like this.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is a fun game about matching.  While it has some challenges, it is basically a boring game.  This game will keep you busy with mindless fun so I would try it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun games look bad when you play this game it is fuunnn best game in the galaxy and download it it is fun.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|I have just finished 'The Luminaries'and, while I'm going 'Phew!  I'm finished!', I find myself wondering what I'm going to read next that will satisfy me as much as this book did.<br />'The Luminaries' is an unputdownable read from start to finish, yet I didn't find myself immersed in the plot or the characters' lives as I normally do - it was more like watching an interesting documentary on TV.<br />I admire Catton's writing - especially as it is written in the style of the classics - interesting for one so young.  I especially enjoyed the precursor to each chapter and how they got longer and longer as the book went on until the last chapter was just the precursor (for want of a better name!).<br />The characters and the plot were very authentic, evidence of honest research done by the author - they must have been interesting times!!<br />Congratulations to Eleanor Catton for an amazingly well written and captivating book - the Booker Prize is much deserved!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|This is a good read that straddles the divide between the details of the quantum physics that govern the law of attraction and the laymans explanations that you see in books like the secret. It points to the simple fact that we can read books like the secret, but deep down don't believe it. It's a great help in showing how to experiment and prove it.
B004AKCME8|5.0|I love this movie and I recommend it for adults as well as children. The colors are so vibrent and the story is so real. It's a nice change from the other movies that are coming out these days. It is a movie that the whole family can watch together and love.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I could watch this movie again and again. Very moving and educational. Will make you cry every time. Sad but wonderful.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|This movie is great, I watched it a few times because the story is so good. The colors are awesome too. It's a good movie for the whole family to watch.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|great shopping experience, easy to use and check out, Follow up email is quick and good at letting you know your purchase is on the way.  Very informative
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie is my favorite. The colors in it are so vivid and amazing. The story is almost believable and will have you wishing you were there with them. It's a movie that the whole family can watch together and want to watch it over again.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|We love the witty lines, silly plot lines, and the on going story arch.  Fun show, and great ideas for creative writing.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I am shocked I loved this story so much . Not usually my kind of book and bought it based on the bestseller list recommendation when I needed a book in a hurry. Could not put it down . A month later ( and 4 or 5 books later !) I am still hung up on the story and the characters...I keep thinking about it ... the tragedy ...the moral dilemma. This story opened my eyes to what some people in our world have to live with . Crying while reading is NOT optional.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I thought this game looked simple, the beginning rounds were.  But the later rounds took some reverse engineering.  It was fantastic.
B002ZG999U|5.0|My husband had wanted this movie but the price in the store was more than I could spend at the time, bought it for him for Christmas, saved money which kept us in budget and he loved having the movie in his collection.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Excellent game, just like the Ipad version, I like this game a lot. Fun to play, good for everyone in the family.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|Kids and parents should read it.  Dr. Ratey brings to awareness key elements of wellness and academic success.  Reading through is exciting, projecting to other parents through comments of the book is a challenge. I recommend it!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Excellent writing, acting, twists, characters. As usual the government agencies don't look good. Being in CIA must not be a fun job.
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|everyone has seen this movie by now...but I still enjoy watching it again...when you're in the mood for being chased by extinct monsters with distinct procilvities for eating sleezy attorneys and little kids...this is just the ticket.  Plus get some science tips. Impact tremors. African frogs that change sexes. You'll never look at birds the same way is one of the lines in the film which ends with Pelicans escorting all to safety.
B000FCJZ3G|1.0|In my opinion this is a copy of Bob Proctor Born Rich Seminar from the 80s.<br />The book is a promotion of his seminars.  You can find the same information for free in the web without investing a lot of money.  What I really don't like about T.Harv Eker is that he tries to make you feel guilty if you don't invest in his programs.  My advice look for Bob Proctor Born Rich program.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Thank you for the movie I enjoyed it it is a very good movie thank you thank you thank you
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Its cool so far but tjey always ask 4 a review so fast that im not sure it is great. I never update reviews unless I hate them so...look back later &amp; see if I hate it in a month
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is SO entertaining. I wish we didn't have lives because I  don't ever want to put it down!
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|The transition of songs is interesting and the more I play the CD, the more I like. Cher does it again.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is not a traditional game, kids has to face the challenge of using water properties to solve problems. Using the laws of gravity and the different states of water (solid, gas and liquid). I do recommend it, you can use it as a tool of education.<br /><br />The paid version include more levels that challenges even more the strategic of the game. Worth the price!
B006BQM762|5.0|It's not ET and it's not Huckleberry Finn or Lassie Come Home either.<br /><br /> There's a lot of movies it is not and if seeing young faces in a movie reminds you of something else... stop it and pay attention to the movie you are currently watching. Social sites aren't as social as you may think but you can get your opinions bent on one.<br /><br /> But it has kids with troubles in it; so doesn't that make it The Goonies? But one of the kids is overweight?<br /><br /> But there are train tracks in it; so doesn't that make it Stand By Me? But there's a death near the tracks?<br /><br /> No.<br /><br /> It's a good, fun, 50s style monster movie... with young people, instead of some 40ish guys, dating women far too young for them,  for the 50s... starring in it.<br /><br /> I give it 4 stars but because of the internet and all that it collects, I clicked all 5 stars.<br /><br /> The internet? I give that 3 1/2 stars. It needs work; should have stayed in beta longer.<br /><br /> Rent it; watch it alone. Never mention on your favorite social site that you've seen it. It will be okay.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|As with the Disney's Where's My Perry? game app, the challenges for the kids are even challenged by the laws of physics of gravity and attraction. Kids has to use even a proper orbit to accomplish the level goal. Love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I cried at the end and wish I had a Mr. Grey. All us girls need a man like that
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Stargate has been one of my favorite series of all time. Season Three of Atlantis captivate me with all the turnaround and not expected situations. I'm now in Season 5, and even though all the changes in the crew, makes it more attuned to reality that any other series in the TV today.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|The plot twists and turns as bungled anti-terrorist action is covered up and denied. However as intriguing as this is, the joy of reading Le Carre is riding along with his brilliant  grasp of the range of vernacular English as spoken by Brits from various classes and regions.  The story is revealed through many different voices, all establishing memorable characters.
B005HSL626|3.0|Same features as the paid version, but with other advances as Rewards and Coupons, that help paying the development team. Give 3 stars because is unsafe even in Kindle Free Time, let open up unwanted websites in an none protected internal browser api when kids press an ad.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|At first I wasn't sure I was going to like it. But at as I started playing I was hooked!! I have a hard time putting the game down. If you like puzzles then you will love this game!!
B005F3GMAO|5.0|If you want to be inspired then this book is a must. From the first page until the last page I didnt want to put it down. It makes you feel like anything is achievable. I would advise people to read it if you want to get the best out of yourself.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I just didn't think this story was all that original or interesting.  I tried to see all the hype but just couldn't.
B007UK83S4|5.0|I enjoyed this book but in some places found it wanting, in saying that I really enjoy the Who's music and Pete Townsend is a great guitarist song writer.
B009ZUKY52|5.0|super great condition. works well and looks good! just what I was looking for!! to get my productions going! thank you!
B0047DVHV2|5.0|I found this book to be and honest an open story about Keith Richards life of sex drugs and rock and roll. Its alway good to read books that are forthright and honest. It certainly open my eyes and filled in the gaps around some of the things I had read scraps of but never knew the real story about. Another enjoyable autobiography.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The story looks at the lives of two troubled orphans - going back in time for one of them.  I liked the juxtaposition of the two stories and how each girl, in her own way had to deal with prejudices related to her ethnic origin as well as her troubled background.  I'm not sure the Irish were as disliked in the 30's as suggested here - the strong anti-Irish emotion was much more prevalent in the late 1800's following the potato famine immigration wave - but I fully believe orphans were treated as badly as was depicted in the book.<br />I found the characters fully developed and compelling.  I was a little sad the book had to end, but was content with how it did end.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I loved this movie and cant wait till the new ones come out . thank you very much for the movie
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I didn't realize you could buy these at Barnes & Noble. Spent about 3 hours one afternoon/evening searching for this damn thing at brick & mortar stores. After I already ordered it I saw it in stores for $3 or $4 cheaper, but hey, if you need your Settler's of Catan fix, you gotta do what you gotta do.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a book that is very difficult to put down. The story is so fantastic, heartbreaking but there was also so much love between the slaves.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|it is so fun you will. love. this. game it is like you travels to a world of fun the game is Amazons you should get it
B009AMALLM|1.0|Horrible horrible movie. All you have to do to get to the scary part is just look for it on YouTube. Please do that and save your money and don't waste your money like I did mine.
006202406X|2.0|Like many others, I eagerly awaited Allegiant to be released this week.  Also like many others, I was left very disappointed.  Boo.  This book had way too many scientific explanations for my taste.  There were too many explanations for Everything here.  Where was the action, relationships, suspense???!  I missed it!  There was a small amount sprinkled in this book, but left much to be desired.  Of course, I hate that Tris gets killed off.  I was not surprised that she went into the weapons room instead of Caleb.  That was just like her.  However, I was already turned off way before that.  Poor Tobias!  I hated reading about him grieving.  I was not surprised to get online & see so many bad reviews of Allegiant. It's truly a disappointment after the exciting previous 2 books!  So, if you haven't bought it yet, don't waste your money.  Just imagine your own continuation of Insurgent!  I guarantee it will be better!!!!<br />V. Gill
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I would have gave this book a 5 but because Tris died I had to bump it down. Other than that this book was amazing!
B0012GTZC0|3.0|but nothing particularly outstanding.  Follett is a good storyteller, but unless he intended to re-write history, the end result was a foregone conclusion.  The only mystery was how high the body count would go.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It is a game based off the real movie epic when I first saw this game I thought it will be boring but it isn't
1400069289|4.0|Couldn't put the book down, it's an easy book to read, and to follow. The stories are great and relevant. Makes you look at things differently, analyze situations in a different way. I loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game just wish didn't have to wait so long between games if you don't pay for more lives. Otherwise a fun game  very addictive!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love these games (there are several), maybe it is because everything 'pops' when you click on them.  Maybe it is because the game lets you know when you fulfilled the rows.  Not sure, but I do like the games.  They are quit easy as long as you keep updating your latest move.<br /><br />I have several of these games, some are very short, some are larger.  One of my favorites was my first download, Jurassic, but that is probably just because it was my first.  The one I am reviewing seems to be the largest so far.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I always hoping candy crush would be on the kindle fir but it wasn't. Now it is and I love it I'm so happy and excited!!!!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is so cute and fun I can't stop playing it, and u don't need any thing special to buy to play and progress in the game
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Spoiler alert: Veronica Roth killed Tris. Shatters Tobias and Christina. Seriously screw you Veronica. I'm sad I even read this series and appalled I recommended it to others. I will not be going to see the movie because you killed off the star. Horrible way to end it.  Will never ever read anything by Veronica Roth EVER again.......
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a mix of Bejeweled and a mixing puzzle game. I love the fact that I can combine different candies to make something new.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a fun bubble game I like the &quot;pull back&quot; and aim feature rather than just aiming, I have played lots of bubble games this one rocks!!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is delightful, engaging, humorous, emotional, and wonderfully descriptive. The people, places and things are described with imaginative detail in such a way that I felt I could visualize everything the way the author intended. I felt deeply each character's emotions. The descriptions of the young Jamie were heartwrenching and disturbing, provoking deep empathy. The action in the book for me was in the characters' interactions, thoughts and emotions.
0792839676|1.0|It was such a long time since I saw this movie. I was a younger teen back then. I thought the movie was ok. I really wasn't sure about the story line. All I know is Carrie got some power to move things with her mind when she was a senior in high school not giving enough information as how she come to get them and the house being swallowed by the ground. There just wasn't enough story to the story. I was very disappointed. It's not worth buying.....
B0050R0XEG|4.0|Always concerned on when I will be receiving product.  I opted to pay extra to receive it in time for my son's birthday, when we actually received it in plenty of time.  Thank you.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Photo books don't tend to make my To Be Read list but I bought the book Humans of New York and I am in love!  I love the pics but the little blurbs about pics make it even better!  You could get through the book in about an hour but you will want to take it slower than that because it really is such an amazing experience.  I felt like I spent time people watching with an in the know narrator.  I think this book truly shows us not only the story of the human condition but that we are all on this path together.  I love how it celebrates our differences and connects us through our similarities.
B008MM9630|3.0|Although I thoroughly enjoy the game I find completing tasks/quests next to impossible due to the amount of gems it costs to buy required items. The mere cost alone for purchasing animals and land expansions is insane. The creators of this game have made it virtually essential to use your real money to purchase gem packs because leveling, quest completion and their meager achievements provide so few... however if you decide to go that route you don't get your moneys worth anyway. Its rather unfortunate and in that alone devalues the game. Eventually you will get bored unless you pay for the gems to continue the quests/story line.
B00CP4RZCU|5.0|Filled primarily with previously recorded tracks \\"Unblackend\\" is rightly titled as the familiar tunes are slowed down, rearranged and given a new twist.  Recorded live, aside from the crowd noise you would think it is studio the songs are so polished.<br /><br />Several of the songs actually sound better in their unBLACKend form, 'Stillborn' for instance is a slowed tempo and primarily clean undistorted guitar but feels so much more soulful in the new timing.  The solos are still as ferocious and sounding even more complex with the upfront guitar melody.<br /><br />Former gems like Rust and Queen of Sorrow were always a slower tempo but now have a new take with the live performance.  Sometimes a tune like Rust doesn't necessarily sound better than the studio, but it still excels in its new form.<br /><br />\\"Unblackend\\" is a must get for a fan of BLS, but it is even a good entry album for newcomers with the collection of high quality songs and very catchy riffs.  BLS and Ozzy fans already know what they are getting in Zakk's music, but if anything will dissuade a new fan it might be Zakk's vocals.  Personally, I enjoy his mumbley, whiskey sounding vocals that complement his deep sounding play, sounding much like a cross between Ozzy's cadence and Lemmy Kilmister's drawl.  But I can understand a fan of more clean and higher sounding vocals that you may hear in something like Train or Kings of Leon, this may not be the sound for them, but they should surely try.  As for fans of Southern Hard Rock, Motorhead or Pantera, you need to hear this album.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I couldn't wait for this to be available for my Kindle Fire HD! The only thing I don't understand is why it only lets you play for a certain amount of times till you need to wait until the time is up so you can play again!?! That's why I gave it 4stars. Other then that I LOVE this game! If I could pay for unlimited times to play I would but, I don't see that option! But, I still definitely recommend this game! It's SOOOO FUN!!!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Best Action game by far! Non stop and fast loading game.<br /> This is what Kindle needs to get more of!<br />Very Addicting!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I've been using Weather Live for a year+ now on my Kindle Fire HD! And I absolutely LOVE it! I can check the weather for any city/state. I have a beach house so before my husband &amp; I go down I always like to look at how the weather's going to be for the week! :) I love how I can check the weather for any State &amp; City when we go on Vacations! I definitely recommend WEATHER LIVE over any other Weather app!!!! Definitely 5stars all the way! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I'm only 10 &amp; this is what's keeping me busy after school. Sometimes I get frustrated when I'm stuck, but that's the fun of it! The game challenges you and that's okay!
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher is soooooooooo great in this! I love her songs anyways but she out did herself with Womans World. That is most definitely MY song!!!! She has all the right sounds throughout her CD and it is fun to sing along with her. I loved getting the songs for my cloud player as well. Thanks Amazon for stocking Cher Closer to the Truth on your shelves!!! GET THIS CD!!!You won't be sorry!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever! I am thrilled its on my Kindle now. I was charging my phone several times a day due to playing so much. Thank u.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It makes me feel happy, relax, enjoy in playing the game. Graphics used in the game are so adorable that anybody loves it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This Alarm Clock has very nice user interface. Great cost value. I really like the various clock faces one can choose from. Options and settings are very easy to use.
1423140605|5.0|I have no words to describe how amazing reading this was! From the first word to the last one, it was perfection. You get to know the characters in a way you didn't before. Last but not least, THE NERVE-RACKING CLIFF-HANGER AT THE END! You better have The House of Hades next to you when you finish reading this or you won't live much longer.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|Great group of new songs along with a great cover of &#34;They Call Me the Breeze&#34;. Really enjoy John Mayer and I would rate this as one of his 4 best albums.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I just started this series about a week ago and I finished both the first 2 books in 4 days. I LOVED them. I was glad that the new one was coming out and I read it in 2 days. I am still mad at the author. She wanted a strong ending and a dramatic flair to conclude but she could have died and another chapter said \\"I woke up in the hospital\\" or something instead of KILLING HER!!! Uriah (sorry if that's misspelled) also would have been a dramatic ending and a sad one as well because Tris and Tobais would have lost a dear friend and Tris would always have to rememeber Tobais essentially killing him. I like the comment that said \\"If Caleb had died then Tris would have to rely solely on Tobias and her friends because that is her last family. So angry and this book will not do well. Hope you happy Roth you just ended your career.
B00FR88VTC|1.0|Just like Peter, I just wasted two bucks. It just utilizes your camera, which you already have. I should have read the reviews first - save your money!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Good to have movies such as this for the entire family.  Great Christian message. Keep more movies such as this on file.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Loved this book, had high expectations and was not disappointed! Would definitely recommend it to everyone. A book that makes you think about the meaning of life and look at every situation as a positive experience. A masterpiece!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. It was nice to revisit Danny Torrence. King does it again!
B0000009SY|5.0|What can you say? It's Zappa, love him or not, he's a genius. Joe's Garage is an epic musical adventure story about Joe, music, decisions and consequences. Any one that calls themselves a fan of Zappa must own this piece of work. Every player involved gives outstanding performances.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|Lacks the intensity, dare I say ferocity of the precursor story and is a more enjoyable read as a result. One of Stephens &#34;better ones&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy  Crush is a great game. It is most challenging. I haven't had much time to play it, but I find it to be very addictive to others.<br />I've been fortunate that this game has not done this to me as some have in the past.<br /><br />This is a good game which I think is good for all ages.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is by far my favorite site. I could and am in this site for hours.<br /><br />I'd recommend it for all age brackets. (Only mature to read some light profanity.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|Truly enjoyed this original take on what drives societies. Diamond's format of looking at the concept in miniature before rolling it out to world history was very compelling.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Great collection, easy to read. Sherlock is going through a great resurgence of interest and this is a well done basic collection of stories
B004RQDQIQ|5.0|this has been a favorite of my since i first saw it years ago. Byrne, Turturro and Finney are stellar. The story is focused and compelling, and the Cohen's early in their careers show incredible range.
B00DEFW998|5.0|Rise was my favorite until I heard this.  There is less diverse sound and genre range here compared to some of her other records, but with greater emphasis on classical playing, craft, flow and coherency and with concentrated emotion.  The sound and arrangements are a lot more organic than a lot of her most recent records.  Half sister Nora Jones' tracks are very pleasant and melodious with touching lyrics referencing the recent passing of the late Pandit Ravi Shankar, their father.  In an interview, Anoushka mentioned that he passed while she was working on this record.  There is a certain class and elegance to the fusion that is less obvious than in some of her previous works and with great respect and preservation of raagas and traditional classical forms.  In all, a less adventurous album relatively, but with greater focus, beautiful flow, and very heartfelt, sincere emotions expressed.  The album seems more personal and you can definitely feel it.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|amazing game.

B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I like the challenge as it progresses through the levels.  Nice game to keep you occupied while waiting in line or sitting in an airport.
1451662432|5.0|Great book and written in a tone befitting the big man! As much about body building as it is Hollywood and humor.
B003RRY60S|5.0|I read this one over and over! I just can't get enough of it! Definitely an A+ novel! Would recommend to any Doctor Who fan!
B008B8DY2O|4.0|This book is highly original, the descriptions are so vivid that you see and breathe the setting and the characters (especially Prabaker) are entertaining. After the first half of the book, the story takes a rather long and unnecessary digression to a place where it does not need to go. Nonetheless, there is humour, romance, drama and action. It is one of my all-time favourite books.
B0031R5K68|3.0|If you're looking for a non-stop page turner then this book is fast-paced and action- packed and will keep you reading. The last few pages are a bit of a drag but nothing to put you off the whole book. The characters are what you would expect from a book in this genre (none too deep, rather clever and suspiciously flawless but reasonably entertaining). Aspects of the plot were cleverly constructed but others ran to disappointing reveals. In summary, mediocre but still better than many of other the books in this genre.
B006FE83UE|5.0|It goes without saying that this movie is very important as a portrayal of how AWFUL bigotry was (and still is), especially in the south.<br />I know first hand because I grew up in Jacksonville, FL, in the 50s and 60s. Racism is SO STUPID!! I am white; my family, my ancestors grew up in Jacksonville...most of them were racist.  But for some reason, even as a small child, I could not understand judging against a human being just because their skin was a different color. It made no sense. I knew some pretty detestable white people, and I knew some very kind, loving, smart black people. The movie was a fine portrayal of how people thought in those days---the good, the bad, and the ugly!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I had tried a couple of others prior to this.  I have Windows 7 on my desktop with high resolution and small icons ... i.e. I like to have plenty of real estate on my monitor screen.  I tried others (2X) and they would shrink the screen size and were klunky to navigate.  When I'd go back to my PC, the desktop screen icons were left moved around the way the remote product had rearranged them to fit.  BUT using SPLASHTOP, all those woes went away.  I'm glad I was home when I set it up because it does require you to put a hosting piece of software on the desktop (it does not use the OS remote desktop functionality).  However, once you master the mouse, it is more than worth the price.  Great, clear graphics ... can use every functionality and program that are on my desktop.  It does not mess with the desktop's layout.  Great value and a great product.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|mine says it downloaded the free version but it looks like there's no difference in  the two. I will be using this for my kids practicing and try reinstalling later today to see if a different version installs<br /><br />**UPDATE**  I installed the actual free version here on the appstore.  It asks for Network Permissions and even has the word free on the icon.  The dev is not trying to swindle anyone.  He just forgot to take the word free out of the title of the install process.  It is the free version.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|very good for older people. makes you use your brain more. some are more interesting than others, but they are all doable.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|**Warning- spoiler alert**<br />I stayed up until midnight finishing this book and ended up having the worst nights sleep I've had in a long time.  I feel like my best friend has just died.  Which in fact she kind of did.  I have been reading other reviews and there are two that I keep thinking of...one that says something like, \\"if you devoured the first two books of the trilogy and loved them as I did, stop there! Don't read the third one.  Just make up your own ending.\\"  And the other is, \\"does the author want to end her career?\\"  I can honestly say that I feel pretty certain that I won't be following or supporting this author anymore.<br /><br />I think I would've been able to accept the ending better if Tobias had been killed instead.  As Tris is the main character of the book, I came to love and admire her. I identified with her.  What will this book say to all the other girls who also identified with her?  Will they feel like they should sacrifice themselves also?  I hope not!<br /><br />I was barely able to finish the last chapters and epilogue.  Who wants to watch the man you loves trying to move on?  And to imagine who he might end up with?  Who will take Tris spot?  It was heart wrenching.<br /><br />Seriously, what a huge disappointment.  Tris did deserve better and so did we.  I reserved this book months ago, not caring how much I paid.  And now I find myself thinking what a waste of money and I'm so glad I only paid $7.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|T2 is seriously the best movie out there as of NOW, 2013. Many action movies have come out recently that cannot top this movie's action scenes, and plot overally.<br /><br />A must have in your collection!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Dear V. Roth (an open letter)<br />It is you.  Like an ex that one is afraid to admit having ever loved, I propose the following:<br />1- you take a writing class (really) I read the Legend series and the Maze Runner series also and know when an author has ...<br />2- We agree never to see each other again.  You can keep my money, but be aware that it is the last bit of money you will ever see from me again...<br />3- I will agree to see better writers<br />4- I will NOT recommend this series to my YA readers (it was that bad)<br />Signed, Scrapper
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|So, I did not 100% agree with everything...but I loved doing all the little experiments...especially the one with the coat hangers...I use my magic wands a couple of times a week to keep my energy in check. Strait forward and easy to read. for $2 you can't go wrong. This is a book you will read a couple of times over ....
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed how the main characters lives became entwined and the surprise at the outcome. This is the first book I have read by Liane Moriarty but will definitely read more of her books.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I've been a fan since 95/96 and PJ is my all-time-favorite-band. Their best album since Yield and a grower every time you listen to it :-) Must buy for PJ fans!
1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan is a great author.  This book was very informative and entertaining.  If you like Omnivore's Dilemma you will like this.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a brilliant story that wove characters and timelines in such a manner that left you wanting more.  Hosseini's writing style flows brilliantly.  I have recommended this book to others and will continue to do so.
B000FC0ZAI|3.0|Well written, and the author makes some interesting comments about the spiritual life of the central character who is a priest. Good character development. I enjoyed the author's description of Alaska during the second World War.  I found the book engaging, but not compelling.
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|Engrossing and enjoyable. A departue from what you expect from elizabeth gilbert, and a delight because of that.<br />Has momenta that drah, but many more moments that delight
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant is an amazing book. I know people will say otherwise, but I loved it. Even with some certain things happening, it was a great book. Fangirls will eat it up, as I have done. We will share our tears. We will all fangirl over this book together. We will fangirl about Veronica Roth. Fans of the series, I hope you will love this series as much as I do. This was well worth the wait.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is pretty straight forward, easy to learn and play. It's a good relaxing game if you're trying to kill some time or relax for a little while.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Suits is an interesting experiment. It is somewhat hard to believe there is a genius college dropout who can fake the behavior of a great lawyer. Yet it makes for a compelling watch.<br />It is hard to say what exactly keeps this show from being &#34;oh man, this show is amazing&#34;. Breaking Bad it is not. Suits definitely has the potential to be better though. Maybe if it can spend a little more time on the dialogue and story. Harvey is far too mysterious to draw much empathy. In fact, the character development takes a really long time per character.<br />Anyway, it has drawn my interest, so we'll see how it fares. Hopefully, there is an end in mind. I couldn't do this show for more than four seasons.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|There is a huge amount of information here by an investigative journalist that has eluded most of the public, I think.  Most citizens have no idea of how many nuclear weapons the US possesses or possessed.  Most have no idea of how weapon control was organized.  The problem of having weapons ready to fire if we were subject to a launch by USSR or China, and at the same time avoiding an unauthorized launch by the US by an intruder or a semi-crazy launch team member, is discussed in detail.  Horrifying is the history of nuclear weapon preparedness from the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, to the turbulence of the Middle East.<br />The story is a bit disjointed, flitting from one aspect to another, yet this serves to maintain interest in finding solutions to what is still a current problem.  I am more than halfway through reading this work a second time.<br />Apart from the Damascus Accident, there is mention of Greensboro (NC) and the lost weapon in the Mediterranean.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Replaces the original equipment exactly. Matches perfectly and fits the same. My headset fits again and the sound is much clearer than without the eartips.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I didn't think this movie was going to be good, but I was pleasantly surprised!  The crew is really growing on me...though I still can't get over &#34;who's&#34; playing Uhura...but oh well.  Hollywood will cast whoever they want to get the star appeal they aim for.<br /><br />Action-packed, dialogue smack of familiar movies over the years for film buffs...not bad!

076781326X|2.0|Very short movie...and not very much like the story we are familiar with....not sure if there is another Oliver but we were very disappointed.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|when I saw this game on my laptop i said wow this game is awesome so looked in the appstore and i zaid 99 cents i must have this game its fun addictive and kids can also play it
B001MSMULG|5.0|This is the first of Silva that I have read.  I will now go through some of his other books.  The story line was intricate and intriguing, as well as factual in the art history/restoration realm.  A bit of &#34;yiddishkeit&#34; made it familiar to my background and therefore more enjoyable.  The main character, Allon was believable, humanistic and credible in his field(s).
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|i just want to start by saying if you like ironrman before youll like it again i thought it was a very good movie but i like ironman alot the movie itself was very good no let downs i thought the 3D could of been a little better thats why i gave it 4 stars but overall its worth watching alot of action and the usual blowing up and smashing things alot of action good story it was all good if you like ironman then i think you will like this movie..............richie41

B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Good kids flick.  Although I certainly could have done without Nicolas Cage's voice for 2 hours.  All in all a good movie.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I really liked the book. Suicide is a real life problem. Some parts are advanced for kids under 12 or 13.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have had this game for so long. Never has it bugged out on me. 5 stars, but this game deserves 10.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good game. It is fun for all ages because something is find picture that match the words or mix match game. The games is hard and mystery. Pretty much.
B00CJ1PXNW|4.0|First thing that came to my mind? Bobby Leibling. I am sick of hearing the same old Sabbath refrence. This album is influenced by Pentagram all the way. In a good way too. This ain't just some rehashed riffs and vocals. No my brother's and sister's. This album is fresh. I was so happy to come across it. These guys are tight. There is even a bit of Grand Funk's, Grand Funk in there. Bouncy bass lines, tight riffs and straight forward drum beats. Buy it. But don't freakin call it Stoner Rock.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game for boys and girls I fun and exciting but faster updates please oh yeah all the boys who play this game girls can play to!!!!!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Some songs are not as good. But there are 5 songs that are super good! And they go really well with the music videos
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a great show with strong female characters who aren't just stereotypes. The plots are complex and interesting, usually with a little twist.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is a great app to learn Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian. It has a lot of variety of questions. The narrator can sometimes be hard to understand but it is still great. There is a microphone setting that can be turned on, however I have  a kindle that does not have one.

B00BRYDKM8|4.0|This book is practical and to the point. If you want to improve your speeches and succeed to wow, this is the book for you. Highly recommended for the serious speaker.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Even though these songs have been around for years you can still turn up the stereo and feel them all. Alicia is timeless. No one does it like her.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE IT SO HAPPY IT'S FINALLY ON MY KINDLE been wishing and hoping for so long it is great best game so addictive!
B008JFUPFI|3.0|I used to as a kid read the comics, I know the story. I have also seen the movies, and bluntly this is the worst one made since they started remaking it in 1978. Okay you are trying to modernize the character. To me, it failed. The story was too obvious; it has been done too many times before. The superman failed to keep my interest up.<br /><br />Russell Crowe played well as did Amy Adams.<br /><br />What it did have was brilliant special effects. They obviously spent a lot on that so if you are going to see it, you need a big screen.<br /><br />I think it would have been a better story if some more money had been spent on writers.
B000YDAYW2|1.0|All of Size of My shoes is 10.5,but this one is too large!!!!!!I can't change it because I am in china now.......

0451232852|5.0|It's gettig too easy to expect agreat book out of Ken Folett; but I still do and am not disappinted.
B00FI7XBIS|3.0|Sort of a child-like Angry Birds type game. You play as a vampire flying around a short level, You throw things (suck as rocks or bombs) to move or destroy lanterns, Which prevent you from moving forward in the level, in order to reach the woman at the end, Who you then bite on the neck and suck their blood. I didn't expect it to be this enjoyable considering the lack-luster reviews it got but it's actually not that bad.<br /><br />However, There are not many levels in this (40 I believe) and they should add more. Also making it more challenging as it goes on would be a plus to because it's a bit too easy in my opinion. Still, It's an enjoyable game and I'd recommend downloading it through the Free App of the Day promotion.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Spoilers.........  I think this is a great beginning to a season.  Setting up a real threat that would plague the population, living in confined quarters, via a common virus that causes people to die - who then become Walkers!  Then you have the mystery of who is assisting the Walkers at the gates of the prison.  The twist of Rick and Karl's fates having to strap their guns on again.  Whew boy!  So far, this is a superior follow up to last season's ending.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This was a different approach from Sanderson, but I think he pulled it off well. Quick fun read that is worth a look!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I thought it would be like the xbox but there are no wolves and you cant make roller coasters do it was disappointing but it is still awosome and super fun so I think everyone would love it because it has tons of cool stuff. so get it.
B00DGNO3WE|1.0|This movie was a stinker. Somehow it was amazon rated at four stars, and one can only imagine that it's because of the Brit accents.  ZZZZzzzz
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was looking forward to this book for some time, having read the previous books quickly because I enjoyed them so much. While the book wasn't horrible, the ending ruined the series for me. I can't reread the other books and think happy thoughts of the romance between Tobias and Tris without feeling sad to know what ultimately happens in the end. I'm not even sure if I want to see the movie anymore.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I must admit that secretly I thought Macca's best years were behind him. He has proved me and the thousands of followers that he is not even close to losing his edge.<br />The \\"NEW\\" cd is flawless from beginning to end. The bonus tracks should have been on the standard cd, that's how good they are.<br />I find it hard to imagine how after touring all year he kept this project a secret without any hints or even a sneak preview of songs from this awesome cd.<br />There will be a total injustice if its not nominated and wins album of the year at next years Grammy Awards.<br /><br />He truly is a living legend whose music will live forever
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Please bear in mind that I am a fan of both Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan. I'll spend pretty much every day until my terminal breath defending Sucker Punch and Snyder's Watchmen adaptation. Nolan's work with the Batman movies is nothing short of absolutely amazing and he has one eye for a tragic superhero story. He turned the story of Bruce Wayne into a beautiful tragic story of a man who must choose heroism or sanity. Watchmen is the story of former superheroes who realize that even though they're retired, they have a lot of saving to do- themselves for a starting point. And so when you take Superman and give it a dark spin, it's bound to succeed, right?<br /><br />Absolutely wrong.<br /><br />Alright, so maybe the movie isn't bad. If you're a pedestrian viewer wanting an explosion filled action movie, then you'll get that here. But for us Superman fans, it's a disgrace. I don't know who these &#34;fans&#34; are telling us that this is close to the graphic novels, in fact the way they adapted the comics is among some of the most appalling adapting work I've ever seen. There are problems right off the bat when Jor-El is stabbed to death by General Zod. REALLY? If anyone has even read the comic books, you'd realize that Jor-El is much stronger and more defensive than that. But it doesn't stop there<br /><br />To begin with, the Superman is greatly raped with a stove pipe and executed Tarantino- style throughout. He spends the whole movie angsting and whining. It's as annoying as The Tenth Doctor's final episode of Doctor Who. Alright, that's a little dramatic, sure. But half the exchanges between Clark Kent and people around him consist of:<br /><br />PERSON X: Clark, can we talk? CLARK: I don't want to. PERSON X: Look Clark, nothing is wrong with you. CLARK: I know. PERSON X: so why don't you send your powers to the world? CLARK: No, you don't understand. People CAN'T know who I am. They'll reject me.<br /><br />Every time one of these rubbish soap opera dialogues rung out over the cinema speakers, I groaned. To be fair, it is SLIGHTLY true to the comics, but they take it up to 11 here and it's unnecessary. The cutting of the film is really off here too. One minute, Superman is being interrogated, the next he's in the desert. It comes off as if Snyder dropped the script on the ground one day thus messing up the pages, then decided, &#34;ah, never mind, let's just shoot it like this&#34;. Your head will explode trying to make sense of this thing, man.<br /><br />And then there's the second half, filled with nothing but action, explosions, Superman pushing General Zod through several buildings (I laughed several times). The action itself is bloated, boring and incomprehensible too. Shaky camera and quick cutting combined with 3D, when I wasn't falling asleep, I was wondering what in the hot frak was going on. And then the climax, or lack of was just laughable.<br /><br />So, are there any positives? Well, the cast do a good job. I did like Henry Cavill a lot and I think given the terrible script that he had to work with, he did a decent job. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are also great, but the highlight of the film is easily Michael Shannon as General Zod. He really knows how to make a bad guy scary- watch the film &#34;Bug&#34; for proof. But he shines here and he plays the villain in such a way that you both feel bad for him and hate him at the same time, which is proof of a well executed villain.<br /><br />Otherwise, stay away from this turkey at all costs. Don't believe the positive reviews, the critics are right for once. I figured it was just the unhealthy and unfair hate-on they have for Snyder, but nope. They're right. I'm guessing WB hired plants to write reviews, because a lot of the reviews do seem very much vague. This film will ruin everything you love about Superman, so avoid at all cost.es rung out over the cinema speakers, I groaned.

B00G32OER4|3.0|This movie can be broken down into 3 parts.  The first half of the movie was great and contained all the good jump at the screen type scares you might expect.  The next quarter of the movie was just strange, and the last quarter of the movie was just dumb.  I should have turned it off half way through and I would have been able to give it 5 stars.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|As far as TV goes, I can't name a mainstream series that has captivated more than Breaking Bad (Doctor Who notwithstanding). And it isn't hard to see why it's so popular. For starters, look at the opening scene of the very first episode. It starts the whole series off on a bang and very tightly. With an evident drug deal gone wrong and a normal looking man, the last guy you'd suspect is a meth cook, and a kid who is very clearly a drug dealer and is passed out, driving in their R.V., fearful that the cops will catch them. Then the man, named Walter White, records a video &#34;suicide note&#34; and prepares for his inevitable execution by cops. Now THAT's how you guarantee the audience that they'll stay with the show to the end.<br /><br />By now, Breakng Bad needs no introduction. It started off as a small cult favourite with rather unsatisfactory ratings, before everyone rented the first season on home video and quickly got in line. I didn't join the Breaking Bad party until just after the show ended, but I managed to binge-watch the series on Netflix (downloading the last eight episodes as they arent commercially available on DVD yet) and throughout the whole month I spent watching it, was hooked and wanting to know what happens next.<br /><br />I guess what really makes the show so addicting is its characters. Even when the show is unsatisfying, which is rarely ever, the show has its characters to fall back on. Beginning with Walt White and Jesse Pinkman. Their chemistry together makes them an unforgettable character duo. They go through the wars together and they love and hate each other so many times. You'd never imagine a high school chemistry teacher turning to cooking and selling meth with one of his former students in real life, and in a way you can sympathize with him. He has been diagnosed with cancer, he has a family to support and some good comes from this bad decision- funding his brother in law's treatments after taking down two drug dealing twins goes wrong, etc. Jesse is a character who starts off as a total klutz and an idiot, in a lovable way too. Some of the show's funniest moments (a dissolving body in a bathtub gone wrong, a simple payback in season two that becomes a home invasion unexpectedly) come from him. But starting with season three, you realize he really is a good character behind all the drug dealing. You can feel for him too, despite not being the most likable character. And then Walt's family, including his wife Skyler who may seem annoying at first but soon becomes a hero in and of herself, and his son Walt Jr., a disabled teenager who loves his dad and would hate to lose him (for the most part, of course), are just as interesting and sympathetic. Then there's the badass Hank and his naggy wife Marie, and the comic relief characters Badger and Skinny Pete. And has there been a better TV villain than Gustavo Fring? Considering he was just a filler character when the actor who played Tuco abruptly left, it's hard to tell that because he's such a good character and is both evil and scary, yet charming in a way.<br /><br />The performances only further the show's staying power. Bryan Cranston is not just that klutzy dad from Malcolm in the Middle anymore. In fact, with how well he plays Walt, it's hard to tell he played Hal before. Every trace of Bryan Cranston is gone and Walter &#34;Heisenberg&#34; White has taken over. He never goes over the top, he plays a normal human being, which is what makes Walt's rise to power even scarier. Jesse Pinkman is equally as amazing and he manages to play a drug dealing young man very believably, to the point where you feel as if you're watching a real person. Everyone else is equally as fantastic, especially Giancarlo Esposito, whose villainous performance as Fring puts Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker to shame. He doesn't go over the top as well, and his triumphant final scene manages to make one of the best villain exits ever.<br /><br />And not to mention just generally how consistent the series is. The show starts off slowly, but gets going in season three and keeps building up to the final episode in an explosive payoff, it makes the show far more poignant. In general this series is just really fantastic and one of the only shows that comes close to perfection. The hype is worth it.... you can trust me on this one. By all means a must-see television show!eries is.

B006LSZECO|3.0|While I did like this book I felt like it took me more than half the book to get into it. I felt like the beginning droned on too long. At the same time, the end droned also but that was more interesting. It has a bit of a Hitchcockian flare so that brought it to a higher level for me. Enjoyable in the long run. I've recommended it to others.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Good book well written'. Kept my interest throughout. Inspiring would highly recommend for upcoming Entrepreneurs. Walter Isaacson tells it like it is no holding back.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I had to keep checking the first page of the chapter because I couldn't tell the difference between Tris POV and Four POV.<br /><br />  The ending was horrible and pointless. (SPOILER) Tris triumphantly overcome the death serum only to be shot 2 seconds later?? Are you kidding me? There was no reason for her to die. The build up created over the first two novels was to see her and Tobias happy together. I feel like I have wasted many hours of my life. The sweet moments between Tris and Four are just sad now. I can't read them and find the same joy. I have left the fandom. No merchadise or movies for me! I am throwing some tomatoes at Roth! BOO!!!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The best ever - she deserves 5 stars plus - I have been following her since her first audition and have seen her and followed her progress - this is the best - very professional - I'm hoping she has confidence in herself - know she had a hard time with her success which would happen to anyone when you are not in the limelight and with the internet too - it was pretty overwhelming to her.<br /><br />Just want to say to keep on going Susan Boyle - we all love you - just wish her mother were alive to see her perform - who knows maybe she is looking down at her in heaven and knows all about it.<br /><br />God Bless you Susan Boyle - superb singing.

B00FPH51LQ|3.0|I was hoping for a bit more of the fun and passing of MIB however, its good in it own right. if they Make a second one I hope there is more funny and more back an forth between the to leads. Also more than two female Characters would be another really good start. If it was such a team that put this together I wouldn't have like it. But now and especially talking it over My Lady with Pie. We Apporve:D
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really enjoyed the first three-fourths of the book and then one chapter disappointed me. I won't spoil it but let's just say I was hoping I was reading the words wrong. Overall though I did like the series.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does exactly what is says it does,,,, great app<br />Would definitely recommend to every one.have already told my friends with kindle fires to get it
B00B2FLDRQ|4.0|If you want to light reading, this is a very good book. It is also very funny. I really laughed out loud several times.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Bruce Willis is clearly ready to turn the reins of the Die-Hard franchise over to someone younger (his co-star, perhaps?) and he practically screams that to the audience every minute of the film.  Do yourself a favor and rerent one of the earlier films in the series.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app is horrible! It always keeps playing the thing I'm watching even if my kindle fire is off!!!!!! I hate it!!!!
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|This movie stunk from beginning to end.  Denzel Washington plays a completely pathetic character.  Never have I had less use for the lead character in a film.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY ON THIS CLUNKER!!!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I was really excited to see this movie.  I loved the first one and it seemed to me that it would surely be as good or better with the addition of Bruce Willis and The Rock (two of my favorite action movie actors).  Boy was I wrong.  This was by far one of the worst movies that I have seen this year.  The plot was not presented in a cohesive manner.  It was hard to follow and in some spots just down right boring.  I took several breaks because it just did not hold my attention.  My husband stopped watching it all together.  I had to force myself to finish it.<br /><br />I don't like to do spoilers so I'm not giving too much details, but if you are a fan of Duke you will not like this movie at all.  I know it is just a movie, but you expect events to be at least somewhat plausible.  Many of the fight scenes are so over the top that they border on ridiculous.  I'm sorry, but in my opinion this movie was a complete waste of almost two hours of my life.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Action-packed, filled with special effects nearly every moment, a worthy third chapter of the Iron Man saga.  A must see!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it but it Is too addictive.  I spend too much time here.  Glad I downloaded It.  Do iI have enough words now?
B007EE4XKI|5.0|It gives insight on how and why Data was created, the issues Dr Soong had to deal with and the sacrifices made to reaniemate him

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|can't wait to do it any spare minutes I have.  love love love wish it is all I had to do!!!! my kids are dissappointed they don't have the kindle as much anymore
0525478817|3.0|I have seen this book in many must read lists and so was always curious about it. Then without knowing what it is about I gifted it to a friend who's not a very avid reader. My friend didn't read it because she thought it was depressing. I was more intrigued in my resolve now to read the book. I picked it up seven days back and I liked the beginning a lot.<br /><br />I liked the way the author says things which if you try to quote people will consider largely flat and out of context so you can't quote anything from the book without reading a whole big paragraph and giving an introduction. This I actually liked a lot because it is about two teenagers realistically.<br /><br />I also liked the circumstances, the jist of it, the despair and the very poignant random musings but I felt like the author tried a bit too hard at this formula. Somewhere I felt the protagonist in trying to overcome their own bad luck is trying to tell the reader something. She seems a bit too ideal for me to consider real. Repeated musings on the poignance of a given situation and helplessness I felt didn't translate the sorrow all that well.<br /><br />Yes, this is sad.<br />Yes, it is a good book.<br /><br />I just feel the author could have written it a little better and I am not in the business of knowing how to do that. It was the end I didn't like. It left me wanting to re-read every page to see if I missed out on something here.<br /><br />His conversations could have been more clear - sometimes one would get confused between who is saying what. I often found myself re-reading more pages.<br /><br />A friend texted me today saying &#34;looking for alaska&#34; is the best book that they have read this year. So i'm looking forward to this. I liked this but I am not sure what I am taking with me that i didn't have a view of.<br /><br />Love? Sorrow? Hope? Amsterdam? Sorry. Lost.

B0015F1VY8|5.0|I love this movie. I love watching movies that are based on real life facts. To know that this woman really existed, and this is a true life story, amazes me. The characters were the best part, and portrayed to the hilt, by all. Cate Blanchett is amazing in this movie.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I enjoyed this game thoroughly, and was very disappointed when I beat it. I would love a sequel.<br /><br />It had a little bit of every kind of game I love. It had a story line. It was cute. It had memory games. Reflex games and strategy as well.<br /><br />I think it was great because the hint book could only be bought every four hours. It was a little annoying at times, but it made me think, and sometimes I could solve the problem by myself after all.<br /><br />I didn't have any problem with ads...but that's probably because I bought the game rather than getting it for free.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I can't watch this movie enough! Everytime I watch it, I catch something else that amazes me even more. The characters portrayed are true to form, I've done some research, and this movie is really a true..............this really happened!

B00CLD671A|5.0|I was thoroughly captivated by the characters, the story line and the tension between the characters and change, as well as often between one another.  I was hooked from the first episode and now can't wait for Season 4 to become available in the U.S.  Simply outstanding!!!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Great casting, although Sarafine was a little over the top and I'm a little disappointed that they stripped out so much of Amma's character. I don't know if it's any good to people who haven't read the books, but if you HAVE, it's a good representation of the characters. Just, seriously, be prepared for the most bizarre soundtrack. Its especially disappointing since the trailers had such good music--but they use sappy music at inappropriate times, dramatic music that borders on goofy at the wrong times.. It's a good movie beneath that.<br /><br />Also be warned they did change the ending, but it isn't terribly out of place. And it's probably a more satisfying ending for people who haven't read the books.
B003L77GRY|5.0|I cannot speak more highly about this. And you probably agree since you've watched seasons 1-4!  And how bout the end to season 4!  Wow!

Then I couldn't put it down. I finished it in two days, and it was all I could think about when I wasn't reading. Beautiful plot development that totally draws you in. Definitely pick this one up! I am probably going to give a few copies to the readers on my list for Christmas this year.

1908407379|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3T0K05XB17B3W]]<br />A CLEAR AND PRACTICAL APPROACH TO EMPLOYMENT LAW FOR THE BUSY PRACTITIONER<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Employment lawyers everywhere will welcome this latest edition -- the tenth to be precise -- of `Employment Law', recently published by the Legal Action Group.  As author Tamara Lewis describes, it covers `the wide range of employment problems in a clear and practical form'.<br /><br />The aim, she adds, is to provide everyone and anyone involved in employment law with a supportive guide which not only identifies the relevant law and evidential issues; it can be used as a self-contained guide to the conduct and procedures pertaining to unfair dismissal and discrimination cases - hence the emphasis on evidence, precedents and checklists.<br /><br />It is pointed out that employment law is a large subject (huge in fact) which has burgeoned over the last decade or so as a result of EC influence, which is why this volume of over 900 pages is now twice the size of the first edition, although as the author explains, it is impossible to cover the whole of employment law in one volume.  As this particular guide comes from the estimable Legal Action Group, which seeks to redress where possible any form of injustice against the vulnerable, the book centres on advice that would be most useful to low paid workers and their advisers, as well as issues relating to discrimination.<br /><br />The expert author has endeavoured to include all the changes and new developments in this area of law, including `a completely new set of employment tribunal procedural rules.'  The end result is what has been rightly referred to as `the definitive text on employment law for the adviser'.  As the focus is on the claimant, the approach is practical and the language is clear.<br /><br />The organisation of the book too, is logical and therefore timesaving for the busy practitioner. Each chapter starts with a summary of the main points, with extensive cross-referencing throughout.  There are over 80 pages of tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and of European and international legislation.  The no less than six appendices include useful forms and a bibliography of further sources including websites. The detailed table of contents and index at the back are invaluable aids to navigation.<br /><br />Here then, in one compact volume, is an amazingly useful and up to date resource for busy practitioners grappling with an increasingly diverse and complex area of law.  The law is stated as known at 1 August 2013.ach chapter starts with a summary of the main points, with extensive cross-referencing throughout.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very realistic and fun for all ages. Would like a few different things to be done to make the game better.  Like the different choice of guns also.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Enjoyed this book . I very much enjoyed the whole series all five books were wonderful , now I'll start the next series.
B00DW39B2K|1.0|This movie was a total waste of time. Travolta and DeNiro must be behind on their electric bills to have stooped low enough to make it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time my favorite game is here I love this game I hate to play on my phone cuz it kills the battery.
006202406X|2.0|I absolutely loved the first two books and could not wait to read the third. I started reading the book and finished it in two days but not because it kept my interest. I just wanted to know how it ended.<br />Some of the explanations given were hard to wrap my mind around and seemed implausible. I have read several books that change character point-of-view and it is an extremely difficult task because the author has to capture the book through each characters' personality. This author wasn't incredibly successful with this as the tone seemed the same through the whole book.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert<br />I don't understand the reasoning for killing Tris at the end of the book. She beats the death serum, releases the memory serum, only to be killed by a gun?!?  What was the purpose of her dying?  The idea that she went instead of Caleb was successful in expressing the idea of self-sacrifice for love and not guilt. She didn't need  to actually die. I cried and felt so empty at the end.
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie. It's entertaining, funny and I love the themes about family. Nicholas Cage and Ryan Reynolds were hilarious!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have to admit I am a little upset with this book. It wouldn't have been do bad if I hadn't waited the last year and a half for this book. However, this book was not worth the wait. At times it was so slow that I dozed off, and other times it moved too faced that important details were missed. Though I wasn't happy about the ending, I think I would have accepted it more so if it had been better written and justified. The ending isn't the one you want, and worse, it is for no good reason. It was a sad disappointment, and it ruined Divergent and Insurgent for me. The hope is gone which leaves little value in all of the story up to this point.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|of course i liked it. who doesn't like a good disney flick where the princess falls for exactly who you thought she would and somehow true love saves the day?
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Can't go wrong if you're in the mood for an action movie.  Always loved the humor and storylines of the iron man franchise.  No need to see previous movies as each movie has its own story line but would recommend seeing them just because they are so awesome'
B00000JPH6|5.0|had to order it, hadn't seen it since my childhood - nevermind how long ago that was....... still a great
B007SOQBCM|1.0|You can only view random streams that show up on front page. As far as searching for your favorites, its will not work. I would recommend if you don't mind just viewing randoms. Im sure there are fixes if you scrounge around forums, but for the average user it seems like a big oversight and they do not patch it.
B005MMYEF8|5.0|graphic and definitely not for the kiddies, but it's a great adult show. lots of sex and gore. probably why my husband loves it too lol. definitely something you can watch together unless you don't like soft porn.... in which case, just let him watch it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very cool. I have fun and helps clear my mind. Why does this review have to be so long. Try this game for yourselves
B0084U0IEG|2.0|No plot, just a long rambling story about a boring girl who's sad about her life. Well written though, author does a great job painting a picture.
B007MXM7OK|5.0|I was in the USAF when I first heard this. Brings back great memories. Made that winter feel warm. Saw George Duke with Stanley Clark in NYC at the Blue Note last winter. One of my favorites of many.
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|it's all good but i wonder why the last track is on the album. call it fate call it karma. seems so tacked on. its a cool track, and its a diverse album but that song fits nowhere on the album. i guess that's why it's at the very very end. i remade myself a copy without it. even tho it's one less track, the album as a whole just seems more complete without it. sounds more like an angle than a song on an album with some consistency. other than that one track i think they got it right with making all the tracks sound from the same sessions and done with the same people and everything. its more complete than angles. its angles done right, with a little bit more time + effort.<br /><br />it's a great album tho. it's the kinda album that has to grow on you. Combat Rock by The Clash was the same way for me. didn't listen to it when i bought it, but when i finally came around to it, it's the only thing that would do the trick for a while.<br /><br />one fine point is you get to see their studio work mature. at first, with is this it? their sound and their songs were very clean and straight forward. now everything sounds so layered. so deep. it's a good thing, and a natural progression. i don't see how or why they'd go back to sounding the way they used to. i guess that's part of the game. a band starts, takes its baby steps, and everything seems magical. they grow up, change, become themselves, use more production, write deeper songs, but a lot of that fire they had when they started is gone. it's OK. and to me, it's a good thing. i'm sure The Beatles had fans that wanted them to keep singing i wanna hold your hand instead of she said, she said or while my guitar gently weeps. same with bob dylan and all the people that wanted him to stick to his folk roots. music changes. and most of the time, in hindsight, we think the later stuff is better. the strokes are the same for me. i bought their first album when it came out, and all their albums upon release. seen them when they toured for each album, and all that. i love it all. i think if you do really love em you love whatever they make. you understand they are growing, and showing you their growth. thats an extra gift to the fans besides the music itself.<br /><br />angles reminds me of between the buttons, that stones album. made in the same way, meaning they were all in an out of recording it at different times. no real togetherness. still some great tracks on it but it just rubs you the wrong way at first being so outta left field

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a very neat he that you have to work to complete. It is not one that you just think about and know the answers right away. So if you are looking for a little challenge this is the game for you. Also there was NO in app purchases so what you buy is what you get. This is an amazing app with a little challenge that I highly recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever idc if its addicting. Everyone says its like a drug and yup it is! It keeps your mind going.
0062238868|5.0|Still reading but so far I love it! Dating a man who does work overseas, it was helpful to read Taya's account. I wish she would write a book (if she hasn't already).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it but now I'm hooked. I play this game when I wake up till I go to bed. Thanks.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|This sci-fi novel is a mock oral history of World War Z, the worldwide onslaught of zombies that in this alternative history takes place in the current era, and the world's effort to fight back.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie, but from blurbs I gather the story was changed  significantly to make Brad Pitt the central character. The novel doesn't have one.<br /><br />The historian interviews survivors in the aftermath, with most of the world pacified but a few tough-to-conquer zombie pockets remaining.<br /><br />The story is structured chronologically, with accounts first of the initial outbreak, then accounts of the chaos, and then allusions to nations' strategies to survive, and then finally to the counterattack. We are taken all over the world, from China, where this, like all epidemicsm starts, to Russia, the U.S., South America, South Africa, the Pacific, Europe, Canada - pretty much all over.<br /><br />And we meet plenty of memorable characters, from Everyman sorts witnessing unimaginably apocalyptic scenes, to really tragic victims - the now-grown, mentally stunted survivor of an incident where parents killed most of their children to keep them from the zombies - to unusual heroes, of which there are many.<br /><br />There's a blind Japanese gardener who takes to the wilds, learns how to fight zombies without sight, uses his nature smarts to survive, and doesn't join the general evacuation of Japan, instead teaching others how to fight back.<br /><br />There's the captain of a Chinese nuclear sub who disobeys orders, smuggles his crews' families on board, and takes the boat rogue both to survive and to avoid carrying out hideous government-ordered nuclear attacks on the zombies.<br /><br />There's an Indian general who pioneers efforts to fight back by adapting colonial-era infantry tactics.<br /><br />There's the pilot of an American air transport which crashes in zombie-infested Louisiana, and is talked through her trek to safety by a mysterious ham radio operator. And there are lots more.<br /><br />You keep turning the pages. The writing of the interviewed characters was better than the historian's voice. For the latter, Brooks has trouble finding an even tone. It's sometimes a historian's style, other times novelistic (and a little pompous), still other times cinematic, suggesting he was writing with a film in mind. (No fool he.)<br /><br />The inconsistencies of zombie world are annoying. They apparently can survive in the ocean  at depths that would crush submarines. But humans can drive a blade into their heads? Huh? You cannot change the laws of physics. They want to eat but can survive indefinitely without food.<br /><br />Zombie ecological catastrophe is sweeping. Cold-weather climes offer a respite during the winter, when zombies freeze solid, but they thaw and return to life during the spring, meaning efforts to wipe them out there are never quite complete. (Iceland - oy.) Nuclear winter comes from all the ash (I can't remember where it all comes from - uncontrolled fires burning? Or use of nuclear weapons?) so there's cold weather and darkness and haze. The whales are extincted. Feral cats evolve into vicious oversize hybrids that are a real problem.<br /><br />Brooks apparently hates religion, casting in the worst possible light religious groups including Orthodox Jewish Israelis (they start a civil war against secular Jews and non-Israeli refugees rather than fight zombies), the Russian Orthodox (they institute a dictatorship and give priests the power to kill), and religious U.S. Christians in general (they kill their own children).<br /><br />His future history on the U.S. presidency is foggy. I had trouble following a sequence including the president at the time of the outbreak, the VP who succeeds him, and the current president, or why that last one is called \\"the Whacko\\". Brooks buries 2006-era political references into his narrative, and there are a few hints  \\"the Whacko\\" may refer to HowardDean.<br /><br />He sexually degrades a prominent conservative female figure, although not by name, and you can of course count on evil corporate white guys to be foils. Without elements like these, of course, the script wouldn't have stood a chance in Hollywood. Brooks can't make up his mind whether macho-American-style militarism is something to ridicule (see previous sentence), or what, in the end, saves the day. He wants to have it both ways.<br /><br />But he generally develops the story with imagination, including all the chaos brought by the outbreak, the many survival approaches taken across the world, and the gear and tactics that gradually evolve to fight them: Bite resistant cloth for soldiers' uniforms, with Kevlar woven into it, a medieval style battle axe for driving into zombies' skulls and so on. Forming square, with their backs to each other, with alternate firing lines, like musket-era troops did.<br /><br />Shock and awe weapons don't work against zombies, which don't think and keep coming. Emerging leaders are those who can make hard choices about withdrawing to defensible redoubts, and logistics heads making cold calculations about which weapons deliver the most dead zombies for the dollar.<br /><br />And he does well seeing this imaginary, horrible world through many characters' eyes - even soldiers nostalgic for a long war to which normal life cannot compare. Some become postwar mercenaries to channel their own now-homicidal instincts.<br /><br />More common, though, are breakdowns of veterans when some memory of what they've lost breaks through their battle-induced toughness. Like one American sergeant who loses it, on the brink of victory, when he smells a truckload of cheap prewar mass-brand perfume. Or one who fights his way across the U.S. - and then kills himself in what used to be his own home after helping retake its neighborhood.<br /><br />I can't believe I just read a whole novel about zombies. But it was fun.Dean.<br /><br />He sexually degrades a prominent conservative female figure, although not by name, and you can of course count on evil corporate white guys to be foils.

He wants to have it both ways.<br /><br />But he generally develops the story with imagination, including all the chaos brought by the outbreak, the many survival approaches taken across the world, and the gear and tactics that gradually evolve to fight them: Bite resistant cloth for soldiers' uniforms, with Kevlar woven into it, a medieval style battle axe for driving into zombies' skulls and so on. Forming square, with their backs to each other, with alternate firing lines, like musket-era troops did.<br /><br />Shock and awe weapons don't work against zombies, which don't think and keep coming. Emerging leaders are those who can make hard choices about withdrawing to defensible redoubts, and logistics heads making cold calculations about which weapons deliver the most dead zombies for the dollar.<br /><br />And he does well seeing this imaginary, horrible world through many characters' eyes - even soldiers nostalgic for a long war to which normal life cannot compare. Some become postwar mercenaries to channel their own now-homicidal instincts.<br /><br />More common, though, are breakdowns of veterans when some memory of what they've lost breaks through their battle-induced toughness. Like one American sergeant who loses it, on the brink of victory, when he smells a truckload of cheap prewar mass-brand perfume. Or one who fights his way across the U.S. - and then kills himself in what used to be his own home after helping retake its neighborhood.<br /><br />I can't believe I just read a whole novel about zombies. But it was fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun in every way!!! The costumes, the running, the bananas and upgrades! I find myself so addicted to it that my score is unbelievable! Also the different locations and scenes are interesting! This game is worth it!
B00BX50UEC|4.0|Not every song is good of course, and the wrong song always seems to win but this is a good variety of music from a large group of countries mostly in Europe. Israel of course is not but still takes part. Many songs are in English but there are also some in the native language of the country. Some songs are fast, some are slow, some are solo performers and some are groups. There should be something for everyone on these 2 cd's. I couldn't give it a 5 because of course there are some songs that I dislike and don't listen too but overall the music on these 2 cd's is quite good.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one of the best free games to at. The only problem is it can drain the energy quickly so you should play while plugged in when you can.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Why are all the game apps so addictive?  This plays very easily but the instructions could be a little better.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I quite liked this Reacher  \\"gang\\".  I hope we see more of them. Maybe fill the characters out a little more. They seem like they could even stand o their own.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good book along the lines of 50 Shades of Grey. It is well written and the characters draw you in.
B009V0TV6O|4.0|Better than a straight metronome because it does some rhythms, not just straight time. It's a great little app for musicians and yes, this is the paid version. Thanks to other reviewers for pointing this out.<br /><br />I would like to see some instructions (or easier to find instructions) for putting settings into the intentionally blank presets, or more rhythms to choose from. It would be nice to have a simple way to enter some of the odder time signatures like 7/8, 9/8 etc. This might be there but I haven't found it yet. Other than that it's a welcome addition to my app library. I do not know what the alternatives are because I've never researched it but I'm enjoying this.<br /><br />If I can figure out how to set the presets with ease I'll upgrade it to five stars.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I have all the seasons. They are fun to watch if you like supernatural things. demons and angels. Hell and Heaven. Makes you wonder what and how people interpret these types of scenarios that do with each episode.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Though now that I finished the story I am sad that there aren't any more books in the series.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I have all the seasons and enjoy watching this show. It is exciting and sometimes you don't know who it is until the end and that is fun.
0316055433|5.0|Full disclosure:  I have not finished the book but yesterday when I received it I sat  down to read for a few minutes and when I looked up again I had read 200 pages.  I'm not the first to notice that there elements of Great Expectations in abundance and I look forward to more pleasure from within these pages.
B000067J1I|5.0|This movie is so cute. How he is a kid and then turns into an adult because of a his wish was granted by a machine at a carnival. In the beginning of being an adult he finds it fun but later he realizes how difficult it is to be an adult so he goes back and wishes to be a kid again. Very entertaining and fun.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|I have heard others say that they loved this movie.  I did not.  I found it tiresome and could not wait for it to end.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|This movie was not as good as I thought since The Rock was in it. He gets out of prison and focuses on hunting down people who murdered his brother. Was not one of his good movies. It was kind of boring.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A comforting reassuring scientific must read for both believer and non-believer. The answers are here. Change what you thought you knew.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and was hoping for another sequel as to how they left it. The polar bears voice is so cool. It is interesting how they have their pets as watchers over the children. This is for older children to watched.
1582701709|5.0|Even if you don't believe the methods taught in this book will generate positive occurrences in your life, just the act of thinking more positive thoughts will make you feel better and happier...and people like to hang around folks who are happy.
6305428271|5.0|I like this move because it shows how you can teach anyone even ones who have problems. She shows them how to be good students and that she cares for them.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addicting game, also very fun. I would recommend this game to everybody young old and in between. Even kids enjoy..
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I love this show. It is very interesting to watch because I like how they bring in the demons in each episode and it goes with the plot from start to finish. Angels are interesting too. Just how they portray each one. I didn't look at them like they do on the show and now it does make sense in maybe that is how it is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the challenge of that various levels. Bright cost and differences in combinations keep my interest. The sound is a bit repetitive however I just turn it off.
B000051Y0G|5.0|This was a replacement for my cd that got scratched. I love her music, back in the day she was so cool how she dressed and looked.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great, my niece loves it. Gives her tons to do on road trip.... also keeps her busy when I'm cleaning.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I don't think I have to say much about Elvis!!! What a great guy and great music. It is great that all his hits are on one cd. Makes it easy.
140053271X|1.0|Device froze on start page and is now unusable. Replaced with Kindle simple touch. Both my wife and I use Kindle and are very happy.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I like some of the songs on here. Maroon 5 has a good beat and lyrics. Adam's voice is unique and very high pitch for a man but it works. Good upbeat songs.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I bought this ebook for my iPad.  So it won't say \\"verified\\" :)  but I did read it.  I would like to say that I was not as enamored with the first two books as my sister is but I like them enough to be interested.  I seem to like more flawed characters.  They seem more relatable especially when sufficient backed by back story.  I am not a literary specialist either.<br />First I will agree with those that say the switching back an forth became a little confusing.  There were several times that I had to go back and check whose voice I was listening.  There was no pattern to go by which might have made it easier.<br /><br />Second I am not someone who will completely against a non happy ending.  I watch much Joss Whedon and even when the idea of Buffy ending with Season 5 it still made sense.  He built up to that sacrifice over several seasons even.  He also killed of many well loved characters on many of his different projects.  I still watch his stuff knowing that can happen.  (poor Fred)  I was horrified and sad when Dumbledore died, but I still wanted to finish the Harry Potter series even knowing that she could even kill off Harry Potter.  Everything was so well done and so well written and just made sense to me.<br /><br />{Contains Spoilers}<br /><br />That being said.  This book felt a little rushed.  As I was reading it, I was thinking that all the new information was setting up more books.  I have to agree the science behind the genetics was not explained.  Tris as \\"special\\" was not explained.  Then I got to the \\"end\\" of the Tris part and thought.  I don't understand why?  It was not a character development.  Why spend the time building up a \\"relationship\\" between two characters if this was the end all along?  The only reason to build a relationship up seems to be just to sell the book the teenage romantic set.  To build that kind of following then take the book into such a dark place as to just kill off Tris with no further explanation. Nothing felt complete to me.  It actually felt as if the author was just making sure that there was no pressure to write anymore books.  As many have expressed, I have no desire to go see Divergent now and no want to read this author anytime soon.  I am glad for VR to be able to tell her story as she wanted, but I don't think I am going to drink the good review Kool-Aide that is telling me that this book does represent hope.  It does not IMO.  Even Christ rose from the grave.  VR opened Pandora's box and forgot to make sure that Hope was placed in the bottom.<br /><br />Maybe it is my lack of literary knowledge prohibits me from being able to understand the B+ and 4 star rating from critics.  I don't feel the characters were well developed.  I don't feel like I understand what is truly the greater sin. I understand what the message was but that was because it was spelled out better then the whole GP and GN issue.  Not matter what out genetic make up is we are essentially human and all capable of evil and good.<br />At this point I don't even think I am ready to hear VR's explanation that she seems will come.  I will read it eventually, but it doesn't make up for poor and quick storytelling.<br /><br />I do wonder how the Studio that bought the rights to the story are feeling right now.  I don't think they knew what was going to happen or they would have ask to not release the book until after the movie or moved the movie up to a summer release.
0142004235|5.0|it's been a long time since i have read this book but i do recall that i thoroughly enjoyed it b/c i love Steinbeck's work.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I suddenly got addicted with this amazing series, so when I saw season 1, I thought it was perfection: it had a little bit of drama, horror and crazy twists. But now that I got to see season 2, I fell in love completely with this show! Season 2 (also known as \\"Asylum\\") delivers great storylines; there's always something happening with all the characters, amazing performances, and the factor that makes you want more when an episode ends! Also, there's more gore and insanity on this season, so if you can't stand blood or human organs, you may not enjoy this season as much as season 1, that was a little bit more psychological and less gory, but in my case, I don't mind.<br /><br />But the best part of this is the cast! I love the way they use most of the main actors on this show and they always find a perfect role for everyone, I think it shows their versatility; Jessica Lange (the best part of this show, she can play anything!), Lily Rabe (who thought that she could play a spiteful woman after playing the moaning Nora in season one?), Evan Peters (an actor with a great future waiting for him) and Sarah Paulson (who didn't had a really big role in season one, but she became my favorite character of this season, she's an amazing actress and you believe her acting when she cries, or when she's in pain), overall there's no bad actor in this show, everyone acts amazingly. You get to love characters when you're supposed to hate them (possessed Sister Mary Eunice, and Sister Jude), something that happens rarely, in my opinion, that's how awesome this show is.<br /><br />As I write this, I haven't finished season 2 (I have only seen 10 episodes of 13), but I can tell this is another great season for this show that is here to stay for a long time! \\"American Horror Story\\" is one of the best shows of this decade. I'm still watching Season 3 (Coven), which is being great too!
145210655X|4.0|my son read this book in like 15 minutes....i guess i didn't realize it was so short and basically just snip-its of funnies.  nonetheless, he enjoyed it as he does all Star Wars books.  it is cute and some of the shorts made me smile.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like that I can play on my kindlehd instead of trying to see it on my phone. I don not have a longer review
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Having seen the movie, I had to read the book. Great read.  It puts you there and everywhere. In the middle of it. Impressive. Not a book you want to easily put down.<br />Thanks Max Brooks.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Was enjoyable. I thought there could be more action. Reminds me of men In Black the very first one. Decent overall
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun.  It is free, so it is worth it.  A good way to fill some time.  Perfect time filler for a waiting room.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I really liked the book but it seemed to end to soon.  It left me wondering how he went from where he left off to how he decided to write the book.  How is Bob doing now?  What are they doing and how are they living now?  So many unanswered questions...
B00CL68NOG|1.0|It was really hard to finish watching this movie, I normally find seth rogen to be pretty funny, this movie was not.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I like that this organizer sits up so you can put drinks in it but it is a little hard to get them into the holders.  I love the open middle compartments and just toss my keys, cell phone, toys in there and it works much better than when I would just put them on top of the sun shade and then watch them go flying when my kids would open it.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I got this on sale for like 50% off, it was a no brainer, I would buy this for full price in a heartbeat, it is great quality.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Great movie with a all star cast of great actors. One of the best movies i ever saw.The movie has a little of everything action, comedy and suspense to say the least.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|If you like Jurassic park and you like extras, this is the item to buy. I love when stuff comes with digital copies too.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|While I enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's engaging writing style and story telling abilities, the book was ultimately a bit of a let down. I got a sense throughout the book that he was building up to an important piece of wisdom, but sadly none came. I was simply left to ponder the implications of the fables.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|If you thought knocked up was funny, skip this movie. This movie is depressing as hell and not funny at all.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|This game was fun but stopped after I opened the safe which only took a minute. It was free so can 't complain just very disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I was unexpectedly surprised by the depth of feeling experienced while reading this book. At first I was not impressed,however as I continued to read ,I became swept away with emotion. This book is like life, sad,happy,funny,and contemplative.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I think what i llike thee most about the movie is how much they the cast truly resemble those of thee original members of the series & movies (for us older folk) and the story line ties to the original movies
0142421715|5.0|Great book, definitely what I expected and more. love love love it. What more is there to say? Just excellent.
B00622B3MY|5.0|another cute movie. i actually purchased the movie rather than rented it and my kids watch it over and over.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like the game because it is very challenging.  Also it seems to be very involved. and. I happen to like hidden object games
B000I8G5NA|4.0|i like the movie. my boys have watched it 1 million times.  i would recommend the movie. i like all 3 of them. i think will smith and tommy lee jones are hilarious together.
006202406X|1.0|I loved the first two books but disliked this one for five reasons.<br /><br />1.  It is told in first person from Tris and Tobias. He is whiney and meek and she is angry the whole book, and the narration is monotone and flat making it a slow read.<br />2.  Because we were only in Tris and Tobias' heads we got no feel for the other characters. We didn't know what they were thinking or feeling or what motivated them.  They were window dressing and there was nothing in the narrative to make you care about what happens to them.<br />3.  Ms. Roth writes this book assuming we fininished Insurgent yesterday. She picks up like it was the next chapter and does not give us any backstory to help us remember what happened in the previous books. I don't even remember Cara. I read Insurgent the day it came out and have probably read at least 50 books since so I don't remember the smaller details, which other authors would have slipped in a reminder here and there.<br />4.  I think the author really dropped the ball regarding the world outside.  She had such potential to describe an interesting, compelling world, a world that matched the excitement she built up to and it was a huge disappointment. It was boring, useless.<br />5.  I'm not going to explain the final reason I disliked this book because I'm not going to spoil anything. If you read it you'll know, but I suggest you skip it and end with the enjoyment of the first two books.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|i am no critic but i love these action films. from iron man to the avengers i watch them all wi th my kids and enjoy them.
B0016KJKIG|5.0|What can I say, it's a sheath, made of nylon, the surge fits in. Has a little section at the back to store the Saw and File blade and maybe some spare drivers
006202406X|1.0|I disliked everything about this book (wish I could rate it 0/5 stars). The writing wasn't up to par, the POVs were not distinguishable between the main characters, and the plot just seemed overcomplicated. It was seriously a chore to finish the book. And of course, I wasn't a fan of the ending, though I knew it was coming (why else would Tobias be narrating?). I am very disappointed - what a waste of money and anticipation. Now I'm not sure I even want to see the first movie! Maybe they'll rewrite the story for the third movie... (one can hope!)
B000NMW6M0|1.0|I did not like the content.  I did not like the story line if there was one.  I did not like the quality.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|It was ok...it wad not as funny as the others, but good enough for a Friday night rental at home.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Just started watching Glee for Season 5 and am very happy that I can watch the previous seasons online.  Enjoying every minute of it!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Great actors, cute story but just not quite 5 star quality in my opinion.  Not sure what turned me off.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I like all of Grisham,s books some more than others. He is one of my favorites Keep it up John.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I bought my husband this book .. he's an introvert. He absolutely enjoyed reading it and shared portions of the book its helped me understand him and helped him understand himself. So many thanks for a great read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Awesome story! So happy I set aside the time to read this series, well worth the time. Would recommend it to anyone!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This app did not work well on my cell phone, and slowed down app by lots of running adds. Will be removing it from my Galaxy.
B000FA5QZO|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut is an amazing author. His language and story structure is unmatched. Although confusing at first this book grabs one's attention and doesn't let it go.
B007Q1GJA6|5.0|what can i say, this movie is hilarious. the shipping was fast and the video quality good. it was a lot cheaper than many of the other options, but the disc was in great condition.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Instructions unclear at times so you don't know which candy to click on. not bad ... average game to play
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|i have always loved indiana jones and when they came up on a lightening deal i couldnt resist. the quality is great. if you are an indiana jones fans this is a must have. great price too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this website!!!<br />Have really enjoyed looking at all the metal sculptures.<br />Haven't even gotten to the jewelry postings, there is so many beautiful and<br />interesting things to see!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Easy to learn and large keys and numbers are wonderful for me. The feature I like the best is the history. Just tap the history bar &amp;you can see all your calculations. If you come up with the wrong answer it's easy to see if it was because you used the wrong number or you didn't know how to work the problem. Worth the price!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super easy to install. It took 2 minutes to set up.  It works great. I select movies on my phone,  and they play in great quality in my TV.
B00BEIYMAG|2.0|i got duped. the buzz about this movie had me thinking this was a awesome movie...it was terrible. what a waste of amazing actors and beautiful scenery. the cinematography was awesome and the lighting was perfect...<br /><br />ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER.<br /><br />i had no idea about the amityville horror angle....but i quickly got it at the beginning of this movie. this movie rips off every. single. horror. movie. ever. made.<br /><br />Omen, Amityville, The Ring, ALL OF THEM. and blatantly so. really awful movie that could of been outstanding.<br /><br />two stars for the house itsself, and lily taylor's country, urban chic haircut. (very difficult to pull off, but she did so)<br /><br />the same people that 'investigated' amityville horror are the same re-re's who want you to buy this load.<br />i would buy it, however, if it wasnt so bad. cut it off early. i never do that.<br /><br />the conjuring....i can't go for that, no can do.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It kept me interested to where I did not want to stop reading it.
B00CTT9646|1.0|Too many things are quite different or missing.  If you know your Star Trek, you will be disappointed in the phaser.<br />Wish I had not ordered it.
B00BU18U82|2.0|While the idea is great...driving the tractor is a pain.  Plus knowing how to get the grain to market is tough...the map doesn't give a clear view of the route in my opinion.  Lost interest fast and removed it from the Kindle.  And me a former farm kid.
B00FI7XBIS|3.0|I got this app because it was the app of the day. The app is pretty simple to play and the objective is to simply get to the sleeping princess as fast as you can while taking out obstacles along the way. You have to try not to touch the lights. You'll be using rocks, bombs,  and other things to take them out.<br /><br />When you use rocks, bombs, or any other item to take the obstacles out sometimes you have to think before you act because, you only have a limited supply of amo and you might need to set off a chain reaction of events to take out the lights.<br /><br />PRO's:<br />+ Simple Controls.<br />+ Very simple UI.<br />+ Kills time when you're bored.<br />+ Funny animations.<br /><br />CON's:<br />- Could have more control options.<br />- They could've made it more challenging.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The game is simple and easy. Great game for this time of year. The graphics are good. Cartoon style so it doesn't scare the kids. To be honest though, if it wasn't the free app of the day I don't see myself actually buying it. That's up to you guys to decide. Give it a shot while it's the app of the day and let everyone know how you feel about it. Thanks for reading and hope you guys enjoy.<br /><br />~Bedjam El Patron
B005ZMUWWY|4.0|I feel like this movie Wall-e really shows what  the earth will look like if we continue to plunder and destroy it with our overuse, and consumerism. We already have our oceans going down hill. Fish is not safe to eat at all from the West coast. Then you have FDA who does't check and make and sure that our food supplies are properly checked. Next, kids toys are so toxic because they are still be testing positive for lead. You think that this a problem that should have gone away by now, but no. Back to Wall-e the movie, an extremely pointed film. Watch it and pay attention to all the small details. It is one of my top 10 favorite kids movies of all time.
B006H4DBA4|4.0|Lovely story about not paying attention and taking things for granted. Enjoyed the reading, but then again I love Sophie Kinsella's stories.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a pretty good way to pass the time, as long as you don't spend more money on it than you can afford.....be careful about using a card or billing it to your cell company, it adds up quickly!<br />Kathy Reyes de Villegas
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I REALLY LIKE TO PLAY ALL OF THE ANGRY BIRDS GAMES AND THIS ONE DID NOT DISAPPOINT.  IT IS A FUN GAME AND I REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING IT.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I epicly love this game! I was mad that I couldn't get this he at first but when it came out I went crazy!!! I love this game!!!
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|At first i wasn't this much into the book because a lot of people were reading it and felt like Star Trek or Lord of the Rings (just pick one). Then, i really close friend of mine told about the book, that it was sad but so great. And i thought that maybe i could read it in the near future. Well, it's been eight months and i've finally read it. It felt so close but i guess that's the thing about fiction. I got tell i wasn't all this concerned about the cancer issue all along. Not even in the end, i just think the book needed a really great issue and i guess cancer fits better. Well, this being it, i like to think the book it's about people interaction. And it really gets into it. Now i consider reading the other works of the author.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|contains spoilers:<br /><br />I thought this was a fantastic way to end the series. What else would you expect Tris to do at the end? It was completely obvious what was going to happen the second her brother volunteered for the mission. I cried at the end which shows how emotionally attached you get to these characters. This book is about a war, wars don't always have the happy fairy tale ending, this is reality, people die. Tris died for something she believed in. I think Veronica Roth did a great job wrapping the series up, it was suspenseful and emotional. I can't wait for the movies to come out.
B00FP1NNJY|5.0|Awesome to hear country inspiring today's hit music.. quality on this mp3 download is perfect!  Would love to see wav added though

Thank you so very much for this game, I have to say that this game is my absolute favorite not to mention most addictive!!  THANKS!:):)

B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Tiny Thief is part puzzle and part adventure game of the point and click type. It is surprisingly addicting, with a lovely art style and should appeal to everyone. Absolutely recommended. I downloaded it as the free app of the day and can't wait for more levels to be released.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|This should have lasted longer. The network ran the episodes out of order and did not give this show a chance. This could have become a long running popular series, but the network was short sighted on this one. I'm glad we at least have what we do. Sci-Fi is a better genre because Firefly exists.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bill Bryson has done it again.  He weaves and juggles a series of coincidences and sentinal events into a web of interesting and fascinating discoveries that truly do let us understand &#34;It's A Small World Afterall.&#34;  This is a fun read, a hoot of a book like all of Bryson's work.  But while there is wit amongst the facts, his discovery of the importance of these three months in the history of the United States is only to be outdone by his talent as a story teller.

B003O86FMW|4.0|After seeing the 1st movie, thought I would read the 2nd before it came out.  It was very entertaining & a fun fantasy tale & of course the ending left you hanging, so I have now started the 3rd book!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Here's another book you better go out and get now.  If you read, Mary Ann Schaffer and Annie Barrows - THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY - $8.99 on the Kindle, then you know you must, must read this. How do you read a book where the narrator is Death.  Slowly and steadily. The story that Death is telling revolves around a young girl, Liesel Meminger, living through World War II Germany during the Nazi's reign and how she endures though finding complete and utter pleasure in stealing and reading books, with the love and support of many.<br /><br />I cried, laughed, learned Germany language, screamed with anger and then fell in love with the perseverance of the young girl.  Liesel was taken from her mother, her brother was the first one Death tells of taking, to live in a middle class community with foster parents.  A neurotic and screaming expletives, mostly in German, foster mother; a loving foster father who teaches her how to read; Max, a jew who hides in the basement of her family's home; her best friend Rudy, a germany boy who sees himself as Jessie Owen (The African American who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics. He was also repulse by that evil Hitler); and many others, but especially the reclusive Mayor's wife, who in a strange way provides the book thief the books.<br /><br />Through all of that evilness surrounding them, Death is describing his &#34;takes&#34; through the colors of the rainbows. The sky is gray and cold with soft streaks of slim lights, when he picks up a pilot after his plane crashes. He also has a devilish sense of humor.<br /><br />I have never read a story that was narrated by Death.  Creepy.  I also know this book will haunt me for the rest of my life. I read many books on the Holocaust, Jews, slavery and World War II, but never from this end of the spectrum - Death.  Please get this book. Share it with friends and young adults.  It's a slow and hard read a few pages in, but you won't put it down until the end. You got to find out if Death wins.You got to find out if Death wins.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Even in Sci-Fi, where the impossible is possible, a good Sci-Fi movie retains some sense of realism; especially one such as this. The movie starts out with a grim tale to set up the plot and dares to make you believe you are in for a serious venture. 2 hours later you will discover you should have been set up for a rock-em sock-em power rangers movie instead.<br /><br />I won't get into it too much because of spoilers, but it is amazing how as the movie goes on the robot reveals more and more weapons and utilities that could have been used in all the fights before it. I guess the crew just liked the challenge? And the end....really? Just way too much logic is lost and there were a lot of \\"come on!!\\" moments. The movie seemed like it wanted to be taken serious, didn't work.<br /><br />The point is immersion is lost when things get too unbelievable. Yes I understand there were giant aliens and robots....what's to believe?<br /><br />The good ones make it happen, this one did not. If you just want to see giant things fight each other with some cool effects have at it, just don't take it seriously.

1250030951|3.0|Excellent New Adult book.<br /><br />Expect sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll.<br /><br />FANGIRL basically falls into the Romance category/modern setting. It is well plotted with solid characters that are easy to sympathize with. The story takes place on a college campus.  The main characters are Cather (goes by the name of Cath) and her sister Wren.<br /><br />Cath is the introspective geeky girl, who is such of fangrrl that she writes fan-fic.  And in fact, she's quite successful with the blog she produces.<br /><br />Her sister, Wren, on the other hand, is a wild-child in the making.  She's ready to take on the world (so she thinks), and to Cath's chagrin, she's ready for some separation.  Wren, in fact, insists on separate dorm rooms, and for the first time, they are living apart.<br /><br />You might think the story would follow Wren, but Rainbow keeps us in both girls' worlds by focusing more on Cath the worrier.  And it's a real ride of ups and downs as the girls explore campus life.<br /><br />FANGIRL is intelligent and funny, and alternately, serious and intelligent. Because it deals with adult-level problems it is not a book I'd suggest younger teens pick up.  There's a good story, but it doesn't wander too far from events that actually happen at schools.  There are drugs, swearing, alcohol poisoning... and you get the idea.  Fangirl is a sweet book, but as I said, it's not afraid to take on some adult-level problems.<br /><br />Totally not my genre. But there's no denying that it's well done.<br /><br />**Two Stars for me (it was such a slog.  I hate girlie books)<br />**Five or Four Stars for regular people.

B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I had read so many reviews that this movie was bad, that I didn't see it in the theaters and just recently decided to rent it.  I thought it was suspenseful, exciting and quite entertaining.  I don't know why the other reviewers were expecting Oscar Winning Performances - it's a movie about a kid and his father learning to evolve their relationship as father & son.  Jaden was ok - it is quite challenging to be in almost all of the scenes in a movie at such a young age - give the kid a break.  While I didn't like his performance in Karate Kid, I thought he did a good job here.  Will Smith was great in my opinion.  The accents (unknown if British or not?) do disappear and re-appear throughout the movie but it doesn't ruin anything.  The build-up of fear was done quite well and I was engrossed and unable to stop watching this film.  I recommend the film as I thoroughly enjoyed it and have already purchased it for my library.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is one of the best books my eyes have ever looked at. By the end I was in tears. Partly because it was ending, partly because of events, and partly because this is a phenomenal book. I hope that you get the chance to love it like I did.

B00005JMFQ|4.0|The 2003 British romantic comedy, \\"Love Actually,\\" is a compilation of about ten different storylines depicting various experiences with the emotion known as love.  The characters/various storylines cross paths at different points in the movie (generally somewhere in London) by a similar manner as that seen in \\"Crash,\\" \\"Alpha Dog,\\" \\"Valentine's Day,\\" and \\"New Year's Eve.\\"  Despite receiving mixed reviews, film is reported to have grossed about $247,272,278 in the worldwide box office (The-numbers.com).  The movie's soundtrack gained unique recognition in the top 40 of the U.S. \\"Billboard200,\\" reaching #2 on Top Soundtracks (some of the tracks vary between U.S. and U.K. editions).  Romantic comedies are not my favorite, but this movie is on my top-10 list for the genre because I think it shows a more \\"real\\" take on love.<br /><br />\\"Love Actually\\" was both written and directed by Richard Curtis.  Starring roles include:  Hugh Grant as David, Colin Firth as Jamie, Emma Thompson as Karen, Liam Neeson as Daniel, Alan Rickman as Harry, Keira Knightley as Juliet, Billy Bob Thorton as U.S. President, Laura Linney as Sarah, Martine McCutcheon as Natalie, Gregor Fisher as Joe, Martin Freeman as John, Olivia Olson as Joanna, January Jones as Jeannie, Bill Nighy as Billy Mack, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Peter, Andrew Lincoln as Mark, Lucia Moniz as Aurelia, and Thomas Sangster as Sam.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  The movie begins with an introduction from David, the British Prime Minister, commenting on the various forms of love and how in the direst of moments, we choose to express love and not hate.<br /><br />The \\"Old Friends\\" Kind of Love:  In the spirit of the season, past-his-prime rock star Billy Mack is recording a cover of \\"Love Is All Around\\" with the assistance of his longtime friend and producer, Joe.  Though the rendition gains instant popularity for Mack, he seems to realize the frivolousness of spending the rest of his life chasing the fame he once knew; Mack sets his ambitions aside in order to spend the holiday with Joe, his beloved friend.<br /><br />The \\"Forsaken\\" Kind of Love:  Harry, while married to Karen, attempts to play the game of secret girlfriend with his secretary, Mia.  Due the salesman's (Rufus) elaborate gift-wrapping, Harry confuses which Christmas present goes to Karen and which goes to Mia.  Because Karen is consumed with preparing her children, Bernard and Daisy, for their school's Christmas pageant, she initially believes the necklace intended for Mia is actually for her.  A combination of Harry's nervousness and Karen's insight lead to the truth.<br /><br />The \\"First Crush\\" Kind of Love:  Following the passing of Daniel's wife, Daniel becomes the sole parent to Sam.  Daniel, who often confides in his close friend, Karen) sets out to tighten his bond with his stepson and learns that Sam has developed a crush on his classmate, Joanna.  Daniel advises Sam on how to Joanna's affection by convincing him to accompany her performance in their school's nativity play.<br /><br />The \\"Dream-Come-True\\" Kind of Love:  Natalie, a member of the newly elected Prime Minister's household staff, is in charge of serving David's tea and biscuits.  Their regular exchanges result in a growing chemistry between the two, which is partly responsible for David's disgusted reaction after witnessing Natalie being sexually harassed by the visiting U.S. President.  Following this exchange, David and Natalie become distant.  When he reads her Christmas card, he sets out to find her and escorts her to his niece and nephew's (Daisy and Bernard) nativity play.  For a moment, the stars align to make David and Natalie into the play's grand finale.<br /><br />The \\"Broken Road\\" Kind of Love:  When Jamie discovers that his girlfriend has missed her cue as `plus-one' for Peter and Juliet's wedding because she is having an affair with his brother, Jamie retreats to a small villa in France to focus on his writing.  Though Aurelia (the housekeeper for thecottage) does not speak English, she and Jamie learn to communicate in other ways and form a friendship with an understanding for one another that requires few words. Upon his return to England, it dawns on Jamie that he has fallen in love with Aurelia so he takes it upon himself to study her primary language, Portuguese.  When Jamie goes back to propose to Aurelia, her answer lets him know it was meant to be.<br /><br />The \\"Unconditional\\" Kind of Love:  Sarah, a friend of Jamie, has long been infatuated with Karl, her coworker.  For a moment, Sarah seems to have a chance to act on her feelings for Karl, but she forgoes this opportunity so that she can be with her brother who needs her more.<br /><br />The \\"Adore From Afar\\" Kind of Love:  Mark, the Best Man for Peter and Juliet's wedding, gives Juliet the impression that he is unfond of her and her marriage to Peter.  When the wedding video doesn't meet Juliet's expectations, she seeks out Mark in hopes that the footage he took will be better.  While watching Mark's video, Juliet sees that his focus is entirely on her and realizes that she had misinterpreted Mark's disregard as distaste, but it is actually that he loves her.  Juliet is confused about why Mark had never told her his feelings.  Mark later answers this question in a scene that I believe to be the best of the movie, so I won't spoil it.<br /><br />The \\"Time To Fish A New Pond\\" Kind of Love:  Colin believes that his strikeouts with women (which seems to culminate at Peter and Juliet's wedding) are due to a `stuck-up' nature of British women.  Colin sets out for Milwaukee and finds love with new roommates Stacey, Carol-Ann, Jeannie, and Harriet, all of whom swoon for his exotic accent.<br /><br />The \\"Shy\\" Kind of Love:  Despite being comfortable as nude body doubles for a sex-themed movie, John and Judy are nervous with one another off-set.  They accompany one another to watch the school Christmas play with John's brother.cottage) does not speak English, she and Jamie learn to communicate in other ways and form a friendship with an understanding for one another that requires few words.

B004GJYROG|4.0|OVERVIEW:  1-disc /88-min./ASIN:  B004GJYR0G<br /><br />“Space Jam,” the famous 1996 live-action sports film, was directed by Joe Pytka.  The movie’s combination of NBA star Michael Jordan and Warner Bros.’s “Looney Tunes” led to a box-office smash, despite mixed reviews from critics.  As a child, “Space Jam” was one of my favorite movies.  I can, however, understand the dismal critical response as several of the original “Looney Tunes” directors were disappointed with the Tunes’ portrayal, stating that the script was misrepresentative of the classic “Looney Tunes” characters.  Nit-picking aside, I still think “Space Jam” is among the best sports films of all time; not only is it highly entertaining, humorous, and phenomenally paced, it’s also inspirational and carries the theme of following your own dreams without being burdened by the expectations of others.  As an adult, I must admit that I only rarely watch “Space Jam;” for me, it is really just important to have the movie among my DVD collection for nostalgic purposes and because it features both the “Looney Tunes” and Michael Jordan—two highly relevant entities from the 90s.<br /><br />STARRING ROLES:<br /><br />▪  Humans—Michael Jordan, Bill Murray, Del Harris, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley (Phoenix Suns), Patrick Ewing (New York Knicks), Shawn Bradley (Philadelphia 76ers), Larry Johnson (Charlotte Hornets), and Muggsy Bogues (Charlotte Hornets) as themselves, Wayne Knight as Jordan’s publicist Stan Poelolak, Thom Barry as Jordan’s father, Brandon Hammond as young Michael Jordan, Theresa Randle as Jordan’s wife Juanita, Manner Washington as Jordan’s son Jeffrey, Eric Gordon as Jordan’s son Marcus, and Penny Bae Bridges as Jordan’s daughter Jasmine.<br /><br />▪  Voices—Billy West as Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd, Bob Bergen as Porky Pig/Tweety/Marvin the Martian/Hubie/Bertie, Dee Bradley Baker as Daffy Duck/Taz/Toro, Bill Farmer as Yosemite Sam/Foghorn Leghorn/Sylvester, Kath Soucie as Lola Bunny, June Foray as Granny/Witch Hazel/ Maurice LaMarche as Pep&eacute; Le Pew, Danny DeVito as Mr. Swackhammer, Jocelyn Blue/Darnell Suttles as Pound, Charity James/Steve Kehela as Blanko, June Melby/Joey Camen as Bang, Catherine Reitman/Dorian Harewood as Bupkus, and Colleen Wainwright/T.K. Carter as Nawt.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />“Space Jam” opens with an alternative depiction of Michael Jordan’s 1993 retirement from the National Basketball Association; during the press-conference, Jordan announces that he is leaving the NBA to play baseball—the sport Michael’s father had always hoped he’d play—even though Michael isn’t very good at it.<br /><br />Mr. Swackhammer, alien and owner of the Moron Mountain amusement park, masterminds an evil scheme to increase revenue at his park.  He plans to enslave Earth’s “Looney Tunes” and make them his newest and most lucrative attraction.  Swackhammer’s henchmen, the Nerdlucks, are dispatched to the secret animated world of Looney Tune Land to capture the Tunes.  Bugs Bunny, taking note of the aliens’ small stature, devises one of his famous ruses; Bugs challenges the Nerdlucks to play a game of basketball for the Tunes’ freedom.  The Nerdlucks, with no intention of letting the Tunes win, set out to steal the ‘talent’ of the five greatest NBA players.  Once the “Looney Tunes” see that they’re no longer posed to play the pip-squeak Nerdlucks, but rather the big and bad team of Monstars, they realize that, if they want to retain their freedom, they’re going to need some help.<br /><br />Since the greatest ‘talents’ in the NBA are already commandeered, Bugs and Daffy abduct their only hope:  Michael Jordan.  Jordan is initially reluctant to join the team—explaining that he no longer plays basketball—but once he sees what bullies the Monstars are, he commits himself to the Tune Squad.  Even with Michael’s skills, the Monstars crush the Tunesin the first half.  During intermission, Bugs takes it upon himself to motivate his team in a way only Bugs Bunny can; he gives his teammates a “special drink” that turns the Tunes into an unstoppable force (it’s really just water).  With renewed morale, the Tune Squad comes back to trail the Monstars by only a single point.  After taking notice of Swackhammer’s frustration with the score, Michael proposes a new deal:  if the Tunes win, the Monstars will return the stolen ‘talents’ to their NBA players; if the Monstars win, Swackhammer will take Michael in place of the “Looney Tunes.”<br /><br />Now that the stakes have been raised, the Monstars play out the remainder of the game with every dirty trick in the book.  As the Tune Squad’s injured-list fills up, they are down to only four players and will likely have to forfeit… that is, until Jordan’s friend and NBA-wannabe, Bill Murray, steps onto the court.  Just before the final play, Michael learns that even a human’s physical limitations are different in Tune Land.  Just shy of the buzzer, Jordan leaps (in “air-Jordan” fashion) and extends his arm across the court to secure the winning basket.<br /><br />Even though the Monstars have done terrible things on their boss’s behalf, Michael feels empathy for the abuse they endure from Swackhammer.  Before returning their size and talent, the Monstars liberate themselves by stuffing Swackhammer in a rocket and send him screaming all the way to the Moon.  The movie closes with everything going back to normal; Michael returns the NBA players’ ‘talents’… and returns his own talent to the NBA as a member of the Chicago Bulls.first half.

This is the princess movie that makes girls want to be princesses.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|Game of Thrones is HBOs television series based on George R R Martin's series, The Song of Ice and Fire. The episodes take place on the fictional continent of Westeros, separated by the Narrow Sea. The season begins, for the most part, in Winterfell which is one of the seven kingdoms under the reign of King Robert Barrathian (current occupier of the iron throne), who resides in the capital, King's Landing, to the south.  Winterfell, the furthest north of the kingdoms, is under the command of Lord Ned Stark, the king's most trusted friend who fought by his side when he took the iron throne.<br /><br />The first few episodes are focused in Winterfell so that the large cast may be introduced slowly; several story lines branch from here and run parallel through the remainder of the series, often crossing paths. Ned Stark and his wife, familiarly known as Cat, have three sons and two daughters, though Ned also has a son named Jon Snow from an affair he had during the war for the iron throne. Jon joins his uncle, Ned's brother, in the Night's Watch on The Wall, a barrier between the kingdoms and what lies beyond. The Wall is north of Winterfell and beyond it is a wintery wasteland occupied by \\"wildlings\\" as well as legendary zombie-like beings. The Night's Watch serves to protect Westeros from the terrors north of The Wall.<br /><br />In Winterfell, the Starks soon learn of the death of Jon Arryn, the hand of the King and Lady Stark's brother-in-law. The King and his family inform the Starks they will be coming to Winterfell, but the Starks know the only reason for the trip is that Robert will ask Ned to fill the position of king's hand.  Upon the royal arrival, we are introduced to the queen and her brothers of the Lannister family; one is her twin, known as King slayer (because he was who stabbed the previous king when Robert took the throne), the other is called the imp because he is a dwarf. The Lannister family is the wealthiest in Westeros, but the Starks soon learn they are not to be trusted.<br /><br />The remainder of the season is split between dealings in Winterfell, King's Landing, The Vale, and the whereabouts of the two surviving Tarrgarians. The Tarrgarians are recognized by their silvery hair and were the previous holders of the iron throne, when it was taken, only two of the children survived and now plot their way home from their current position across the narrow sea. The girl, Danarys Tarrgarian, is forced to wed Khal Drogo, leader of the Dothraki, a savage clan. The marriage is forced by her brother in hope that the Dothraki will lend him the power to cross the narrow sea and take back his homeland. Danarys learns to love her new husband and his people; she is pregnant with Khal's son.<br /><br />I have chosen to end my synopsis here in effort not to spoil too much, but the series itself is essentially a fictional history set in somewhat medieval times, though far more glamorous. The plot and it's subplots do a remarkable job of engaging viewers as well as invoking suspense. I began watching the series because I had heard of its popularity, though I wasn't initially captivated. I soon, however, found myself constantly thinking about it and what would happen next and feel pretty empty when I run out of episodes.they are not to be trusted.<br /><br />The remainder of the season is split between dealings in Winterfell, King's Landing, The Vale, and the whereabouts of the two surviving Tarrgarians.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I was told this book was tedious and boring. NOT TRUE! If captivated me the entire time. Best one so far.
B00FFRAKRG|3.0|Huge KoRn fan back in the day (first album up through SYOTOS), but their last few albums I just haven't been feeling - this one is no exception. It does go back to a more stripped down sounding KoRn, but a lot of the choruses sound similar and it doesn't feel like there's anything new here.<br />It's not terrible, but overall it just felt boring and repetitive to me.<br /><br />Even having Brian &#34;Head&#34; Welch back in the band wasn't enough to bring KoRn back to their prime. I will always be a fan, but just not a fan of this album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun game. some levels are frusterating but overall it is a fun game to spend time playing. patience and no money needs to be spent
B005LAIIN0|5.0|To me this movie really is one of the best zombie films ever made. It tackles the genre in a different way by taking it global in a very real way. The storyline is interesting, the zombies are terrifying and seeing it from the eyes of a researcher and someone who is looking for the cure while time is running out, hopping around the globe, is a unique and satisfying take.<br /><br />The Unrated version is definitely more intense than the theatrical. More blood & guts and some extended scenes worth watching.<br />You may not care for fast-running zombies, but you can't deny that the zombies in WWZ are scary in the sense that they are overwhelming.<br /><br />I highly recommend the flick. Brad Pitt is good in it and I look forward to a sequel.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I am so glad for the convenience of this app. When you need a scripture in a pinch and you are not in possession of your Bible, this is great.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|We used to go to the old theater in San Lorenzo and watch it. We would dress up in wedding clothes and throw rice and toast at the screen. Too much fun!!
B003UESJH4|5.0|When I went to see the movie in a theatre with my adult daughter, I was expecting to see the King provide a notable talk before a throng!  Was I ever surprised.  It was also good to see English royalty that I know in this generation &#34;come to life&#34; as real human beings alive today!
B00G32OER4|3.0|Like too many movies the previews contain most of the best scenes and hyped up.  So then the movie is a bit of a let down, another amityville and exorcist combined.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The movie left me feeling traumatized.  A gut wrenching, heartwarming movie.  It made me grateful to be alive. A must see.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|I have read his previous books and liked them.  This one started out well but became disorganized and repetitive as it progressed.  He borrowed too much from his previous books.
B00ELU79ZO|5.0|This is a good deal if you happen to be at Best Buy and find this there. It's weird that they have the exclusive version that is really cheap compared to how much it is if you got it somewhere else online. If you pay more than $27.99 for it, it's too much. There's no extras on the Blu-Ray, but you do get the audio CD as a bonus. The performance is certainly top notch. There have been some complaints about the bass overpowering the mix, and the tuning being lower than usual. It makes it more interesting especially if you've heard the songs a thousand times. You wouldn't think that a performance of the whole Countdown To Extinction album would be anything above average especially with countless other full album performances that bands have been doing lately, but this has actually proven to be more than average.
B00E7RZEI0|3.0|Although the game is nice, I'ts like any other game I played before. This is all I have to say...
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Excellent tool to download video and even convert into audio formats with one touch.<br />I downloaded from amazon.com and it was easy.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton has returned to the quality of Forgotten Garden with this one. Loved it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a family mystery. A welcome relief from crime novels or romance.
6305428042|5.0|I was very pleased to see my package come in the mail in the appropriate estimated time frame. I know some sellers can have longer shipping periods than others, so to actually have it ship with in the 3-5 days was fabulous! I knew exactly what it was when I saw the mail man deliver it, I couldn't wait to open it and watch it. I recommend buying this classic Halloween movie, it comes brand new, still sealed, and just as pictured. It's everything that I expected!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|it  was fantastic it was very emotional at the end I can't wait to read catching fire it's going to be very interesting
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I found this book to be not only an insightful look at the lives of two teens (both of whom seem to view themselves as &#34;outsiders&#34;)  but also a tribute to how these teens manage to transcend their immediate environments, particularly Eleanor.  Rainbow Rowell captures beautifully the emotions involved in finding someone else to whom they can relate.  I loved the story,  loved the two main characters and hope there will be a sequel.  It is an honest look at not &#34;fitting in&#34; and told with compassion and hope.  While there is some profanity, it is integral to the story and is never used gratuitously and rarely by the two main characters.  Read the book and then pass it on as this is a story that deserves a large audience.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I wanted to see this movie when it first came out. My nephew saw it and said I would love the movie because of the monsters ( big fan of monsters ) and he was correct ! Even though I saw it I will buy it and have it anytime I want to watch it. It was the best ever!
B005NNVUBM|5.0|Classic Floyd at its best. Soundscapes, trippy tracks, Set The Controls, Careful with that Axe and Saucer full of Secrets.
B000002UWF|5.0|Friend had me track down this for her, and was ecstatic when I found it!  She'd been looking for years.<br />Thanks Amazon....Highly recommended ... older show tunes
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I had hoped to finish the book before I watched the movie.  I didn't manage to do that bit I definitely enjoyed the book more.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|By far the best book of the trilogy! It shows the ups and downs of tris and tobias' relationship and how tobias and christina mend together after the loss of their best friend and soul mate
B000KFB4PK|4.0|My grandson loved it.<br /><br />One thing that really disappointed everyone was not illustration on how to build the little toy.<br /><br />You should include one to make us all hapier
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this is finally on the kindle!!!I love this game!!! Great app and my teen daughter likes to play it too.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like it. I've always liked solitaire. You cant beat anything that's free plus it's great for long waits something fun to pass the time by.
B00E7RZEI0|1.0|Lame, this game is terrible, not worth the download, id rather poop in my pants and watch two broke girls than play this
B0007KTBIU|3.0|The price was fair. However the disc was scratched and wont work, didn't discover til on road trip. Probably to late to return.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Everything you could ever want in a King novel. I loved every bit! Personal demons and the evil threat of The True Knot gives a lot for the reader to ponder. I swear, I'll never look at an RV the same way again!
B008QYT7DI|5.0|Simply....awesome.  Adult or child, there are lines from this book that you'll want to remember and quote over and over.  It's a must read.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|THIS ALBUMS SLAYS... HARD. This album better debut with a 300k+ first week sales. This album makes me feel like I'm walking on air. I recommend this album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really love this game.  If you play this game you will get  addicted.  It is a great game to pass away time.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|\\"Greatest Poet Alive\\" (GPA) returns with a new collection of poetry entitled Revenge of the Orgasm: An Erotic Autobiography. Certainly not shy, and obviously confident, if not slightly arrogant, GPA holds nothing back in his passionate chapbook of poetry. This is not your typically shy, flowery love poetry. These are raw and straightforward descriptions of romantic encounters. These are poems of tumbled sheets, frenzied kisses, heat, breathless whispers, and the secret dances that lovers perform. These are poems designed to have you yearning for the arms of your own lover.<br />GPA's poetry is fun and entertaining. The poems are short and quick to read, but have much to say. The author's openness and honesty is also something to be admired. And, though the title Revenge of the Orgasm: An Erotic Autobiography might suggest otherwise, the poems are not gratuitously graphic in their sexuality and women are treated with respect, if not held in admiration.<br />My only concern with this collection is that as an avid fan and scholar of poetry, I expect very rigid standards from a poet proclaiming themselves as the \\"Greatest Poet Alive\\". The poems in this book are quite enjoyable. I have no complaints with the poet's word usage or storytelling abilities, but the flow and format of the poems could be tightened. I urge fans of romantic poetry to consider reading this book. It is quite good and delivers the passion and steaminess that it suggests. Next time you are in the mood for romance, pick up GPA's collection. I think it will please you.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Speaker for the dead is a great book that offers twists and turns that could not be foreseen. I recommend it highly.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|i had no problems downloading it for my kindle fire,  though i read others did have a problem.  best game i have played yet!
B00G32OER4|5.0|No blood - just ghosts - made everyone here scream out loud at least once. Liked all the characters, great sets, never slow.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Scam??  I send this app to my kindle for my son.  When I tried to oven it tried to charge me a second time to purchase the app.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|ASTONISHING! Amazing, wonderful, AWESOME and much much more! Cannot wait until I read the next book ! I can make my friends jealous!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|While I was a bit wary of the similarities to fallout at first, the story was so immersive that I forgot all about those ties and thoroughly enjoyed all the nuance put into life and politics in the silo. The pacing was fast and the book a real page turner. I'm looking forward to the next read by Howley!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! The numbers are large, so I can see them without having to get my glasses. It is simple to use, and does all of the things that I need a calculator to do. It is so convenient to have with me where ever I go. It is hard to believe that it was FREE!!!
B000YJ54DU|3.0|I continue to enjoy every Jack Reacher novel.  I found the ending of this particular novel too unrealistic.  One guys opinion.  I will continue to read all the novels.
B004LUS390|1.0|This is probably an OK app, if it is what you need and you knew how to use it. There are no clear instructions. I played with it for a while. It seemed OK, but I couldn't really get anywhere with it. ALSO, I really did not like the idea of it including the Flurry Analytics in the program. I have heard bad things about this. I tried to use the \\"opt out\\" option, but it wouldn't let me. I guess this app really just wasn't for me...I deleted this app.
B004LWZW24|1.0|I had such hopes for this.  What was I thinking?  It was nowhere near as good as \\"Sinister\\" which was mediocre to good (IMO).  This was far, far less than that..watch first before you buy.  Take it on faith and trust me. If you like it, great!  Then we have separate tastes.  If you see it the way I did, you will understand this critique.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|It was just what I was looking for to pass the time of day.  Not TOO hard...yet lots of fun!!
1451683405|5.0|The book is fabulous but misses a few points for me.  But I so admire Sam Harris for his gentle way of admonishing people to watch out for the fables and theological ideas that have been tossed at us so often that we need to take another look. We really are a naive, superstitious society of people.  He really is a brilliant man, and can make you see things from another perspective; from a more rational one.  He reminds me of a really good teacher. I've learned so much about thinking for myself by reading his books. And largely because of him, I am no longer afraid to die.  That's saying a LOT.  I used to have panic attacks over the thought.  Now, I just let it go...  We can't stay here forever, and none of us will.  So, what does free will have to do with anything?  I have the will to move my arms, but my thoughts that supposedly belong to a tyrannical thought policeman in the sky? No.  He's so spot on as he often is.. Read this and free yourself a bit. Don't fight it.  It's obviously true. Go with it and set your inner guilt free.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I looked at all of the notebook and journal apps that Amazon offered, before I finally tried this one.  I LOVE IT!! My life is filled with little scraps of paper (lists, notes, etc), that are always getting lost. Now I have ONE place to put everything! I can divide my lists by creating as many books as I want. Now, all of my notes can easily be found when I need them.  I have made books for everything from my \\"Medical History\\" to what I want to plant in next years garden! I have never been so organized...it is wonderful! The app is easy to use and FREE!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was looking for something to replace the BlackBerry keyboard I was used to and I have to say that this is the best alternative.<br />At first, while it is learning it won't be very efficient, but after some days of using it, you'll find it wonderful.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a very eye opening book about Wheat and how bad it is for you. Very informative. Its the wheat that causes heart disease. Following this book has lowered my cholesterol and my high blood pressure has come down to a normal range. Oh and I've lost 42 pounds so far. Thank you Dr. Davis
B008YU0AOE|3.0|This app has all the things that you night need in o e cal, sadly it is missing one major thing. There is no way to make a fraction. Luckily you can  get around this using division. The app is great non-the less. I mean, it has square and cube roots.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I am not sure why people rated this book so low.  I read a lot of books (2-3 per week).  And while this didn't blow my mind, it was still good. I think people may be opposed to some of the major characters who die. But if it's a revolution in a dystopian society, what did you expect?  Not everybody gets a happy ending.  I will agree with the comments that it was sometimes difficult to tell whose point of view the story was from. If it didn't tell me at the beginning of each chapter, I could have easily interchanged Tris and Tobias chapters.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|Awesome!!!! Totally different from other album, but really worth the dough. She is darker and deeper with her emotions which brings a new level of Katie Perry. She is really talent.
B001BANK32|5.0|I picked this up because of the new book doctor sleep. I can't say whether it was my first time reading this or not because I've read so much of his books and he's been a part of my life for more than two decades. Amazing detail as king is known for never did I find myself bored. Brilliant creativity, the darkness has its hold on kings creative side. I'm always at awe and always jealous....true talent lies within the pages of this story. Masterful skill with each character. Loved it.
B001FB5634|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that, with a few exceptions, I am not a fan of the post-apocalyptic setting.  That said, this movie, and the book upon which it was based, are brilliantly compelling.  The story follows a man and his son traveling south down the titular road.  They have no real destination, but they keep walking all the same.  No explaination of the disaster that caused the end of the world is ever given, leaving the reader/viewer to draw their own conclusions.<br /><br />Throughout the story, our unnamed characters meet with several hardships, and the main story follows their attempts at survival.  There are moments of fear, moments of sadness, and even moments of joy.  Throughout, the boy can be seen to serve as the father's moral compass.  While some may find him to be irritating or downright aggrivating, I find him to be an important foil to not only his father, but the world around him.<br /><br />This film captures the intensity and spirit of the original novel wonderfully, and the acting is amazing.  This film is not for everyone, though; moments of disturbing imagery abound, along with gruesome scenes and human cruelty might stand as a barrier to some.  The film is extremely intense, and really pulls you in by the collar.  If you can handle that sort of thing, please buy not only this film, but the book as well.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Brilliantly written with both angles examined.  The story slowly unfolds to reveal deficiencies of both the husband and wife.  Initially the book comes across as anti marriage but later it describes how the couple both get what they were after or not .....
B00COMLLX2|4.0|Love the graphics. Game has a cool story line and easy to play. Takes a little while to unlock the next levels or game table but I'm still working on it.
B003R50FRI|5.0|A long read and at times seemed like the author was a bit in love with his ideals and philosophies but he did it well with great descriptions of India, the mob, the slums, about addiction and coming down.  The book was so much about love and friendship and family.  Made me cry on more than one occasion.  I didn't particularly like the main character but I appreciated what he had to share.  His love of the Indian people was beautifully portrayed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A very awesome game. It's fun, but challenging at times. It's a great game that anyone can play. I love it!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|There are many levels to this book.  Basically about just one boy and his survival on a life boat.  The character is very deep and has a spirituality all of his own.  My daughter referred this to me after reading it when she was about twelve.  A book that can stand a couple of readings and way better than the movie although the movie is good too.
B00BC0JGCA|5.0|I bought this album based on the artists own description. It's exactly what they said &#34;hoe down black metal put to a polka beat&#34;, and then some in my opinion. Look them up on Pandora, there are some other really sick bands very similar to theses guys as well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome works perfectly exactly what I wanted in my room that I did not want a computer in thanks Google. Def needs more apps as well as update chrome on android to cast the tab
B00B7Y0206|1.0|First of all, search button crashes the app. Videos have to load in 720p and until it does you can't change the video quality which is a waste of time and bandwidth. In short, not a nice app.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|Great read. Takes you to Southern England as it was, very interesting. Be glad it's 2013 not 1320 and your not living there then.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a awesome game very fun and it is great for the hole family my little bro loves it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game. I would love to have more levels, other than that it's fantastic!<br />It's fun and the graphics are great.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|While there are some books out there that can read as not much more than hype, this book is all meat! It's practical, actionable, and it'll motivate you to take action in subtle, but powerful ways. The included exercises will give you added motivation as you see results appear right before your eyes. If you've ever doubted the law of attraction, this book will help you understand and, more importantly, use it in your life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE Candy Crush Saga. I play it all the time!! I just got it the other day and I'm already on level 30!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Musicians, music geeks, and those who just enjoy music will appreciate this movie. It's very \\"real\\", with an uncommon view to the sincerity and raw talent of those often thought to be \\"manufactured\\" by the music industry.  It's about appreciating music, not certain genres or specific artists. Well worth the investment of time - we've watched twice and will watch it again.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Game was fun but only ten levels only took me few mins to finish. Need more levels and maybe slightly more challenging puzzles.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|There is something incredibly gratifying in revisiting a character from another great story. While reading this book and mentioning it to a few people, I would ask &#34; guess who the main character is that's from another Stephen King story&#34;. Loved picking up from not too long after Overlook and unfolding  to the main timeframe of this story. Another great one to add to the King legacy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is digital crack! lots of fun. I especialy like the fact that you can see all your friends scores it adds to the fun
B00C8HC3KS|2.0|Why was Hemingway so famous? I really don't understand at all. The style of this book is crude and juvenile. The plot wanders without much of a point. It seems more like blogging than literature. I think that Hemingway's fame was accidental - he made the right friends and used his personality to catch people's interest.<br /><br />Decades after his death, we should be able to assess his literary legacy more objectively. He was a literary lightweight.<br /><br />Finishing this book was a chore. Unless you want to see for yourself what all the fuss is about, you should just read something else.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is such a cool game at first my mom had it but she talked me into having the first time I tried it I loved it sooooo awesome everybody needs to get this app
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have just reread the second and final books of the trilogy.Both books again kept me riveted and awake until way late.The lessons of Panem still are relevant, perhaps even more today than before.As humans we don't seem to learn what should be obvious.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this addiction. Thanks fir getting it in the kindle.  Now can we get words with friends without the annoying ads?
0385351399|5.0|I'm not really a social media person (the wrong generation, so to speak), so I didn't know whether this would suit me. But it opened up a different vista on the whole things. I enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone who would like to have a look inside the whole business. Excellent!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved th time period dress and language. The time of generational transition was done well. I can't wait for season 4
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive, but also very relaxing, makes you use your brain a little bit more. Way better than just sitting on the coach.
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|Bradbury never disappoints.An epic read. My fourth time reading this novel, and I guarantee there will be a fifth. Indeed
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the first book by Khaled Hosseini that I have read.  What an amazing writer, capturing the feel of so many different times, places and cultures.  I loved the book
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|I have already watched the DVD twice yesterday. I love the great production and the Ded Flatbird performance is really superb.<br /><br />Joe Elliot's voice it really great. I found he kept he preserved his high range voice really well. However, contrary to most aging artists, his lower range voice is somehow rougher. May that's why his voice on the Ded Flatbird sounds better .. to me at least.<br /><br />Anyway, do not hesitate this great CD/DVD set. At this price, it is also a steal.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Loved the book when it first came out. All though I rarely re-read a book, I wanted to go back and refresh my memory about Clanton and it's characters before reading Grishm's follow up Sycamore Row. It was as good as the first time, even though I knew the ending! Starting Sycamore Row right away after re-reading it makes for a great reading experience.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wish that there was a rating higher than 5 stars. This book completely blew me away!<br /><br />Warning: lots of gushing about to occur.<br /><br />After reading Slammed and Point of Retreat also by Colleen Hoover I knew I wanted to read Hopeless ASAP. As soon as I saw Losing Hope (book 2) on netgalley I knew that I wanted to dive into both books immediately.<br /><br />After seeing the kind of books that this author writes (emotionally draining/you will need lots of tissues) I was somewhat prepared for Hopeless. But really how can you possibly prepare yourself for such awesomeness?<br /><br />The book is New Adult and narrated by Sky who is almost 18. I was completely taken aback by her. She was likeable. But at the beginning of the book I was confused by her. I had never seen another character written this way before. She would let guys make out with her and yet she felt absolutely nothing. I needed to know more.<br /><br />Sky had led an extremely sheltered life. She was home-schooled. No tv. No cell phone. No internet. But she begged her mom Karen to let her do her senior year at the public high school. I was appalled by the behavior of some of the kids.<br /><br />I really liked Sky's best friend Six. And was sad that she was not in the book more.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the book Sky met Dean Holder at the grocery store. And everything changed.<br /><br />I liked their jogging together. I liked Sky's relationship with her best friend Six. I loved the tattoo. I loved how the story developed.<br /><br />This book had a lot of twists and turns. Truthfully a lot more than I was prepared for when I started this book. I was able to put some of the pieces together on my own. But I think the author did a great job at taking the book in some amazing directions. I really cannot say enough good things about this book. Colleen Hoover writes characters that are very well developed. But they are not typical characters. Then she tells relevant and touching storiesthat will emotionally devastate you and bring you to tears. I absolutely loved this book. Great job!
B002APU580|5.0|I have watched this over and over and I never get tire of it! Plus, the music is beautiful...I have the CD also.
B008PZZUF2|5.0|I read the book when it first came out and recently read it to my 9 year old and fell back in love with it. I also saw the movie (many times!) when it first came out and thereafter. Since I'd just read the book to my youngest, I thought we could watch the movie together (mostly appropriate, but there are a few scenes that should be &#34;eyes-closed&#34;). The movie does a great job of conveying Carl's intent and sentiment about SETI and science in general. It's not accurate to the book in terms of characters and plot-line, but the &#34;cinematic liberties&#34; taken are well done. Fantastic movie!
B006GLZTHQ|1.0|I bought all seasons up to season five for my Kindle and see that for a shortened season five the price point is the same as the first four?<br /><br />Then season six is what $29.99? Granted it is 20 episodes but still.. why not $14.99 for that one as well considering the previous season is so short.<br /><br />Let me know when the price is right.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. So glad it finally came to kindle! Now I can't wait for pet saga. Also like to say I have been very happy with a lot of the king games.

B001H4NXCK|4.0|As a fan of the original Maverick it is great to see Garner in the cast as Pappy. Giibson does a nice job as the younger Bret and is true to the character.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I went about reading Flynn's books backwards (this one last). I take pride in the fact that it is fairly hard to get one over on me, and Flynn kept me guessing up until the very end. Okay, I had an inkling, but I half fell for the signature twist. Definitely worth a read... Or three.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This series was up with Twilight for me until this third book. What a disappointment! VR has guaranteed I will never read her again. It was very hard to follow who you were following with alternating chapters. The love story fell flat and killing Tris off was arrogant and stupid decision. It didn't make sense and ruined the whole series for me. Dumb,dumb,dumb! I probably won't go to the movie now and if I would have read a review, I would not have read the book even though I pre ordered
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I wish I was allowed to give half stars. I don't necessarily think this book warrants a 3 star rating, but I don't understand what made Roth deviate from her previously successful series. I didn't get much from reading parts of the story from Tobias's POV. I thought the direction she took the story was very interesting and she could have gone down so many different paths. Ultimately, I think I'm just disappointed with her storytelling this time around.
