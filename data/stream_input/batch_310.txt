0790738074|5.0|I love this movie.  As silly as it is -- a goofy plot, absurd over-the-top characters, the wacky &quot;think system&quot; -- it is just a whole lot of fun.  Robert Preston sparkles as the fly-by-night con artist/salesman who just happens this time to get his foot caught in the door, and who better to catch that foot than Shirley Jones, who is as beautiful and talented a leading lady as has ever graced a big screen musical.  Ron Howard is as funny as a kid can be in the movies, and the music will stay with you long after the movie is over.<br />   The film also has a great cast of supporting character actors and comedians, not to mention the fabulous Buffalo Bills. I love the anvil salesman character (THAT'S a great line of merchandise for a traveling salesman!), and my favorite song has to be the pool hall song, &quot;There's trouble in River City.&quot; The movie, funny as it is, also has its touching moments, especially when Professor Harold Hill, standing on the footbridge, confronts the gap between his dreams and his life for the first time, and really realizes he is in love with the beautiful librarian. For pure fun and entertainment, it's hard to find a better movie than this lively but affectionate kidding of the Hawkeye State, and hard to find a more fun couple than the engaging Robert Preston and the lovely Shirley Jones.
0688163173|5.0|but difficult to review.  So much of Lehane's latest, &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, is tied up in the twists and turns of plot, that to write a review that summarizes the plot is tantalizing -- but will spoil the book for the next reader.<br /> Lehane apparently became an afficianado of old Sinatra, causing him to write the noir-ish &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, set in 1954.  The book is about the handling of psychiatric patients in those days, terrifying as THAT is.  Lehane's two main characters are U.S. Marshals, sent to investigate the disappearance of a woman &quot;patient&quot;, who'd been held in the Island hospital for the criminally insane.<br />Although Lehane truly develops only one character in the novel, Marshal Teddy Daniels, his deft ability to describe the motivations of others, and to electify with descriptive phrase of his setting leave you feeling that he just may be the best novelist in America today.<br />&quot;The lights went on above them in a series of liquid cracks that sounded like bones breaking underwater.  Electric charges hummed in the air and were followed by an explosion of yells<br />and catcalls and wailing....&quot; -- it'll be tough for you to get much sleep with Shutter Island in tow.  It was a fast read and I sat up far into the night to finish it...and then could not rest.  Like in his characters, Lehane sets up a momentum and a fear in you that won't let you forget this book for days.<br />I'm not surprised to see the wide variety of ratings given the book -- the best generally are controversial.  Read it and judge for yourself!!
B00008DDSC|4.0|This film is weird at times but it is really entertaining...<br />it's your usual love story between a secertary and her boss...how they meet and do very kinky things and how he dominates her...it's your usual love story..yeah right...it's subject matter might be weird to some people..but it's a very funny and entertaining film..i enjoyed it...
0385504209|1.0|I admit, I too saw this book on the bestseller list and was intrigued.  A relatively unknown author's book debuting in the top 10?  Had to check it out, and boy do I have buyer's remorse.<br />  The book is, in a word, lousy.<br />  Mr. Brown must have some serious Catholic school damage, because the entire book is a rant about how \\"the Church\\" has subverted our 'true spiritual nature' as Goddess-worshipping free-loving wood nypmhs. \\"The Church\\" is responsible for all the male-centered evils that have been and are being wreaked upon the world.  And \\"the Church\\" contains high officials who direct their acolytes to murder people in their attempt locate the Holy Grail.<br />  And of course, as pointed out by other readers, Brown heavily laces the book with the ridiculous theory that Jesus was not the Son of God but merely an important historical figure who married Mary Magdelene because it was politically advantageous (He was of the line of David, she of the Solomon line) and they produced offspring whose lineage survives today.  Of course they did.<br />  The characters are paper thin, the plot is obvious, and the ending is anticlimactic.  A big waste of time.
0887306667|5.0|After 10 years, this still remains a classic work in the marketing field, and perhaps a must-read for anyone in business. And no, unlike many reviewers I do not believe that Ries and Trout have ever managed to redo the glory of this book in their Laws of Branding, Laws of Internet Branding etc.<br />Don't expect an excruciating marketing treatise with elaborate case studies and What-If scenarios. Expect instead 22 capsules of business wisdom, or \\"laws\\" of common sense marketing with some brilliant examples from the real world to prove them. In this, the book excels and is to date the briefest and best argued work I have come across.<br />However, given the passion with which some reviewers comment about this book I am inclined to offer a caveat -- please don't base your career around it. Although I love thin, in-your-face books such as this (great reading, great examples to bounce off) they also have a fundamental flaw: the fact that they attempt to shove \\"laws\\" on to the ever-morphing scaffold of the business of  marketing that does not lend itself easily to codification, much less of an \\"immutable\\" nature.<br />It would be a cinch to come up with examples that go against each law in the book if you really wanted.<br />For instance,<br />(1) Law of Leadership (better to be first than to be best) can be argued against with the theory of disruptions and how first-mover advantages do not always materialize. Why is WebCrawler not more popular than Google? Because Google is (way) better.<br />(2) The Law of Sacrifice (that talks about focus, as do a couple of other similar if not redundant laws, including, well, the Law of Focus) would not hold much fizz in the case of many very successful conglomerates, especially in Asian countries. Imagine a company selling everything from oil to fruit juice to IT services, and still being a top brand in a country. Examples abound in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan.<br />(3) The Law of the Opposite that advocates the definition of your strategy by considering the leader's (also redundant with the Law of the Ladder, which essentially says the same thing) can be argued by giving umpteen examples of companies that shot from being No.2 to being No.1, some times because No.1 filed for Chapter 11. In such cases, emulating the leader could have in fact been detrimental.<br />Etc.<br />Anyway, despite redundancies across the laws, and the possiblity of counter-argument against most of them, this is a ripper of a read for the business intent that it was written for, and 10 years after its publication still as charming as it first was.<br />Highly recommended reading, but keep your discerning senses about you. Noteworthy: Law of Perception (also Law of the Mind), and Law of the Category.r strategy by considering the leader's (also redundant with the Law of the Ladder, which essentially says the same thing) can be argued by giving umpteen examples of companies that shot from being No.2 to being No.1, some times because No.1 filed for Chapter 11.

B00008NG5V|4.0|This CD is very pleasant to listen to, especially if you want to be in a relaxed mood (who doesn't). The songs are very laid-back, which is a good thing in this case. The songs are relatively short though. Jack Johnson has got his groove going.
0385504209|2.0|Awseome book. I loved the explantion of history and how there is a lot more to the christian religion then meets the eye. The story kept me on the edge of my seat and I will definetly look for more books that cover the subjects brought up in this story.
B000089RVX|5.0|If you have only listened to the two tracks from the Daredevil soundtrack, you probably have a little different perspective on what kind of music this is. I had only heard Wake Me Up because it was being played nonstop on radio/tv, so I went and previewed the whole album. The album goes from somewhat intense and heavy to slower and creepy, almost disturbing, towards the middle, back to harder edged in the end. Almost every track has some kind of religious implication/hint, but if you aren't really paying attention to the lyrics you wouldn't notice. Just a note on some of the other reveiws, why are they dissing on the \\"label placed male vocalist\\"? If he was not on the second track, it would have lacked something at least in my opinion. If decisions by labels/producers/whoever make a song or group lose something or make the music worse, then yeah, diss like mad, I know I do all the time. But this time, it worked, so stop complaining already. I like this album because it has the whole haunting thing going on, but its not to slow or to fast, you can still kind of relax to it. Go driving at night in the rain and crank it up :)
B00008NG5V|4.0|Jack's new alblum is with out a doubt his best to date. It's nice to see musician's as consistent as this guy. Best song is track #7, Wasting Time
B00005JLEU|4.0|Growing up, I used to religiously watch \\"Conan: The Future Boy\\" (Adnan Wa Leena) and \\"Heidi\\", both of which are directed by Miyazaki-the genius behind Spirited Away. Miyazaki vision and creativity have changed my life as it affected my childhood perception of aesthetics.<br />Now that I have seen Spirited Away, I have to say that Miyazaki has reached the acme of his creativity. The film is an inspiring fairytale of courage and loyalty. Disney did a good job dubbing this film.<br />It's a great movie experience for the whole family. I highly recommend it.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|This is an album that puts a smile on my face, right from the first few notes. Full of lovely synth textures and beats that are at once interesting and unobtrusive, it is great music for a rainy afternoon indoors, or for playing softly while you go to sleep.<br />I haven't found many albums of this particular electronica subcategory (&quot;ambient techno&quot; or whatever they're calling it these days) that retain my interest as much as this one does. It's much more interesting to me than &quot;Music Has the Rights to Children&quot; by Boards of Canada, for instance. I find the layering of ryhthms on this album to be of a better design, and I love humming along with the bass lines - they are often wonderful melodies in themselves.<br />One caveat: it's definitely not a challenging record. It's good and safe for folks who like their beats to be in 4/4 and their sandwiches built on Wonder white bread, but those Autechre fans looking for their next intellectual conquest will no doubt find it lacking.
B000059XY5|5.0|First of all the first Batman movie was so excellent.There were times I must admit that I liked the dark side a little more than the good side. Well with Jack Nicholson's excellent acting ability it was easy to pick him as the best actor in the movie.The movie is dark,complex and impossible not to like.<BR>  If there is actor that could come close to being as good as Jack Nicholson in the Batman series was Danny Devito.He is deliciously creepy throughout the movie.And Catwoman was to die for.<BR>   This is one of those movies that I can see again and again and never get sick of it.
B00005JKL8|3.0|I didnt really like this movies and I teeter back and forth from giving it 3 stars or the 2 that it probably is more deserving of.<br />First let me say that this is NOT really a WAR MOVIE. It's more an action movie that is set in a war zone and has some combat.<br />My first gripe is that I was really distracted by the use of the camera in this film. They tried to do too much fancy stufdf with the camera and it was disorientating to me. This is very noticable in the beggining when they are about to be shot down and I DID NOT LIKE IT! It was annoying... I mean just let me WATCH the movie.<br />My second problem is that the movie professed itself to be a war movie while it was not. This is no \\"saving private ryan\\" or \\"enemy at the gates\\". The plot isn't particularly intriguing and the action in the movie isn't terribley great either. There is a cool battle at the end, though a bit unbelievable and a bit over-dramatized (and plus how none of the americans died is beyond me). <br />I just didnt find very much to like about the movie and too many things to complain about. I rented it on PPV and am not in a rush to see it again. It wasnt completely bad, but it wouldnt be up for an oscar either. This is the kind of movie you rent when there is nothing else good at the video store or that you watch when you are really bored or dont plan to pay much attnetion to anyhow.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Rob Schneider is the best comedy actor, I`ve see.<BR> The movie is a very nice representation of what can happen if a man change of body with a woman, the true is The Hot Chick is the best comedy movie of the last 10 years, and anybody can say not, because There`s Something About Mary (I thinked this was the best comedy movie of all the times, but now, I don`t think it) won too much awards for be the most funny comedy movie, But now, I can say, The Hot Chick is the better movie of all the times.
B00006F2TV|3.0|I give it 3.75 or just under 4 stars. Spiderman was a decent and enjoyable movie, but still suffers from the curse of the superheroe movies. <br />First of all, I must say the fact that he had his webbing come directly out of his wrists bothered me. In the comics peter parker invented his webbing and used machines to shoot it, it wasn't one of the powers he got from being bitten by the radioactive spider. Also there are other inaccuracies. Stan Lee let the director and producers change things as they saw fit in both Spiderman AND Xmen (and probably will in daredevil and the hulk coming out soon too). I don't look kindly on to this. Why can't they stick to the original, perfectly good story? Every time a book or comic transitions into a movie people complain when they make changes... so why not listen for once??<br />Anyhow, some other things bugged me. Spiderman himself looked pretty good, in that he didnt look like a complete idiot in his spandex suit. But the green goblin's suit was just completely rediculous. I've also never been much of a fan of the old spiderman enemies (greengoblin being the main archvillain), Im a child of the 80's and early 90's so I always liked the newer characters like Venom, Carnage and such much more that the corny ones from the 60's. So I am a bit biassed. I also dont really like comics being made into movies because, well... come on... when a guy is running around with super spider powers in a cartoon or comic its dramatic, fun, and can even be taken seriously. But when you have a real guy running from roof to roof in tights in live action video... it's tough to not find it corny or silly.<br />Still this movie had many good points. It was generally an enjoyable experience. The special effects were great and it was much better all around than X-men was. The acting was ok, and while some points of the real comic story were altered many other details were kept in tact (at least sort of). <br />Overall this isn't a bad movie, but I don'tconsider it a GREAT movie either. It's a great choice to rent on a weekend or to put on at a get together though. And watching it once will probably be atleast somewhat enjoyable for most fans.<br /> I cant give it 4 stars but it gets a solid 3 stars for sure.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I put off buying &quot;The Beatles 1&quot; for several years because I already have all of the Beatles albums (that is to say, I have all of the CDs of the original UK albums, which, as every American my age and older can tell you were not the same albums that were released in the US; for example, the first album I ever owned was &quot;The Beatles Second Album,&quot; the songs of which are scattered over three of the CDs.  But I digress).  As a general rule my preference is to listen to an entire Beatles album rather than a hits collection, especially since my favorite Beatles songs never seem to be hits (e.g., &quot;If I Fell,&quot; &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;).  However, I have now added this CD to my music library for reasons that are more academic than anything else.<br />What &quot;The Beatles 1&quot; provides is the 27 songs that reached #1 on the Pop Charts; usually this happened on both sides of the pond but sometimes a song would make it to the top just in the UK (e.g., &quot;From Me to You,&quot; &quot;Day Tripper&quot;) or just in the US (e.g., &quot;Eight Days a Week,&quot; &quot;Come Together&quot;).  The 27 tracks are arranged chronologically, from 1962's &quot;Love Me Do&quot; to 1970's &quot;Let It Be.&quot;  Consequently, we have a sense of the evolution of the music of the Beatles, from the original Liverpool sound to the Psychedelic Progressive rock at the end.  This appeals to me because I can have the students in my Introduction to Popular Culture class pick up this CD for a unit on music and set up a major paper where they talk about stages in the music of the Beatles based on these 27 tracks.  Listening to their most popular songs in chronological order gives you a sense of exactly how much they changed.  Hopefully in their papers they will be able to articulate a sense of how the Beatles got from &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; to &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; and on to &quot;Hey Jude.&quot;<br />Yes, there are problems with &quot;The Beatles 1&quot; from this perspective as well.  We are talking about a collection that has nothing from the group's greatest album, &quot;Sgt. Pepper.&quot;  Beyond that there is only one track written by George Harrison; the rest are by John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney.  At least Ringo gets to sing a song (&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;).  But it is a lot easier to say, hey, these are the songs that made #1 on the charts and provide a quantitative rationale for the track selections rather than doing a qualitative approach and eventually offending everyone.  Yes, the &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; albums provide this same chronological approach, but that would be twice the number of songs at about four times the cost, and either consideration would be a deal breaker for students.  Yes, I could put together 27 tracks that would provide a better sense of the evolution of the Beatles' music, but what we have here all nice and pre-packaged for us is pretty good for providing a mini-lesson in rock 'n' roll music appreciation.<br />Final Note:  The accompanying booklet does not provide the lyrics for these songs.  Instead, what you will find are pages devoted to each song with some of the jacket covers for each single from around.  Also provided are information about when and where the song was recorded as well as the chart history in the UK and US.les 1&quot; from this perspective as well.

B00000G3AZ|5.0|What a wonderful and colorful movie! Gwyneth Paltrow is superb as Emma! It seems if I look closely, the actor who plays Mr. Knightley looks like Paul Rudd in Clueless.  Gwyneth plays a convincing role as vain and overconfident Emma.  This movie is a gem and should be watched with a lighthearted mind.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I first found out about the White Stripes from a music magazine article, just as \\"Elephant\\" was released. While a little hesitant, I let myself get drawn into an entirely new realm of music. (Well, new for me) \\"Elephant\\" is definitely a good album, with great vocals and fantastic songs. And the White Strips show an intensity that most bands don't have (certainly not after they make it big).<br />\\"Seven Nation Army\\" opens the album with a thumping rhythm that doesn't let up, while \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" is softer and more open, \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself\\" is a rock lament with haunting vocals from Jack (\\"And now that we're through/I don't know what to do/like a summer rose...\\"), openly sexy \\"Ball and Biscuit.\\" \\"Little Acorns\\" has a hilarious opener to the actual rock music, a guy telling an anecdote about squirrels; the short but fantastic \\"Hypnotize,\\" and the funny, mocking \\"It's True That We Love One Another\\" (where Meg sings \\"I love Jack White like a little brother\\" -- a brilliant line).<br />In the middle of the little lyrics is a three-paragraph description: \\"This album is dedicated to, and is for, and about the death of the sweetheart.\\" It's an intriguing bit of insight into the inspiration; even though the last parts don't really make sense to me, it's still weirdly compelling to read, sort of like a poem. (\\"... blind chance and forward stumble, scarlet mood, and white ivory shimmering laugh... and yet, may they wonder, with words and thought and thorn, this spirit and persona under.\\")<br />Jack White's voice is not the best I've heard, but there's a striking quality to it. It has a very haunting, memorable feel to it. Though Jack is the one to sing on most of the tracks, Meg is the one to shine vocally in \\"In the Cold Cold Night.\\" Her voice has an honest, simple sweetness that makes \\"Night\\" an especially memorable song. The songs are hard-hitting and fantastically-written, with common themes but little (if any) repetition. (And the last seconds of the CD are very, very funny)<br />Their music is raw, vibrant and wonderfully original, sometimes poignant, sometimes thoughtful, but always great to listen to. \\"Elephant\\" is definitely not one to miss.t seconds of the CD are very, very funny)<br />Their music is raw, vibrant and wonderfully original, sometimes poignant, sometimes thoughtful, but always great to listen to. \\"Elephant\\" is definitely not one to miss.
B0000640VO|5.0|The most witty ,smart,funny, and creative French film I've ever seen. It is also the only French film I've ever seen. Funny and mature. A great story and very beautiful.I JUST LOVE IT!
B00008J4P5|5.0|The album really speaks for itself.  Cool to hear Meg sing.  The fundamental blues core holds solid, but there's some truly excellent experimentation going on.  The final track with Holly Golightly is an absolute delight.  Rock on Jack, Rock on Meg.
0399230033|5.0|A funny little book, this. Its simple, quick, and humorous. The illustrations in it are of a nice, eye-pleasing quality, portraying the animals in a fun, happy light. No sharp edges, no nasty, nightmare inspiring images. Nothing that would force a parent to explain, in the dead of night, that no large, hairy creatures are sitting in the bedroom closet to eat them.<BR>The ideas of the book are fun, simple and enjoyable. The animals are nice, friendly, yes, even cuddly. Quite well and good.
B00005JKHN|5.0|1959: Disney's presence had already been established. \\"Snow White\\" was the first animated film ever to grace the big screen and Disney had dazzled audiences with the 1940 \\"Fantasia\\". But in 1959, \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" won the hearts of fairy tale lovers, romance lovers and the young at heart. Disney was back in the saddle. The animation to the Sleeping Beauty was taken from the greeting card designs and artwork of a 50's artist. Set in the medieval 14th century, at times resembling the beautiful tapestries and cathedrals of the day, Sleeping Beauty is embellished with cool hues of purple, blue, green and black. A magic romanticism fills the air from start to finish. The score to the film was taken from the ballet music of the Tchaikovsky ballet by the same name. \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\" ballet is in fact Tchaikovsky's greastet musical masterpiece, and Disney merely sliced up some of the melodies to fit certain moods and scenes in the film. He also put lyrics to the enchanting \\"Sleeping Beauty Waltz\\"- in the song \\"Once Upon A Dream\\" in which the Prince and the would-be Sleeping Beauty meet for the first time, waltz and fall in love.<br />True in many respects to the old fairy tale, which some claim originated in Germany, others in France, where it is known as \\"La Belle Au Bois Dormant\\"- the tale is brought back to life through classic Disney charm. Princess Aurora (named after the Roman goddess of the dawn) is born to King Stephen and his Queen (The March from the Tchaikovsky ballet plays) and all the inhabitants of the land come to her Christening in the great hall of the castle. Aurora's three fairy godmothers Flora, Fauna and Merryweather (later Disney animators said they based them on three actual little old ladies) bestow the baby princess with the gifts of song and grace. But the Gothic enchantress Maleficent, the rotten apple in the bunch, was not invited and naturally, she is outraged. She wears a purple-black robe, has Devil horns on her head and her constant companion on her shoulder is a black raven. \\"Sometimes I don't think she's very happy\\" Fauna says of her. Caught up in a nasty mood, the evil sorceress casts an evil spell on Aurora. She will prick her finger on a spinning wheel an die on her sixteenth birthday. To avoid this catostrophe, King Stephen orders all the spinning wheels burned. Merriweather, the fairy in blue, brings hope- only the kiss of a brave and noble prince will lift the curse of the death-like sleep.<br />That prince is Phillip, who was already engaged to wed Aurora as a boy, (in an obvious statement about political unions in European monarchies). The three fairies do their best to prevent the terrible fate on Aurora, so they hide with her in their cottage in the deep forest and change her name to Briar Rose, raising her as their own child. But.. luck would have it, she meets Prince Phillip as he is hunting, they waltz and fall in love and she is brought back to the castle where she was born. There, Maleficent makes her prick her finger on the spinning wheel in a hypnotic trance. The spell is cat Poor Aurora...<br />But you know the rest, don't you ? Fairy tale loves always have a happy ending. The Tchaikovsky music, the artistic animation, and the engaging story will delight audiences as far into the future as 2059. In 1959, children and young girls might have been captivated (they said that Aurora was based on either Leslie Caron or Audrey Hepburn) but in the future, the tale will still win hearts. Young girls will once again be gripped. Virtue will be rewarded. After all, \\"true love conquers all.\\"
B00008S2VF|5.0|I've been a fan since the days of \\"Like a virgin\\" (you do the math). I love the new album. Most definately a natural progression from where she left off. I was not too hot on the rap in the beginning, but now that I listen to it again... the tracks will not be complete without it.<br />Nice mix of electronica, guitar, rock, pop, and dance, etc. <br />If possible get the full version (explicit lyrics). The Clean version really cuts into it. Hear it the way it was meant to be heard.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I really thought that after the 1,000th time I had listened to &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; that Jack Johnson couldn't possibly put a better album together.  With incredible songs from the last album that never got radio airplay such as &quot;F Stop Blues&quot; and &quot;Fortunate Fool&quot;, one could only hope that the album to come would provide the same result.  The album came out just yesterday, and I am already on my 4th rotation of it!  I hate to say that it's better than the 1st album, time will only tell.  &quot;On and On&quot; continues with the same vibe as &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot;, sounding like the two may have even been recorded in the same session.  The most surprising thing about the new album is that even though there are 16 songs, very few are more than 2:30 long. Here is my review of the album, song by song:<br />1. &quot;Times Like These&quot; - not as good of an opener as &quot;Inaudible Melodies&quot;, but still a great way to get into the feel of the album.<br />2. &quot;The Horizon Has Been Defeated&quot; - standout song on the album, definitely has the most &quot;vibe&quot; to it.<br />3. &quot;Traffic in the Sky&quot; - Good song, not one of the better ones.<br />4. &quot;Taylor&quot; - the 2nd best song on the album.  Great instrumental opening, gives the listener a small glimpse as to what seeing the band is like in concert.<br />5. &quot;Gone&quot; - barely 2 minutes long, nice little diddy.<br />6. &quot;Cupid&quot; - similar in length and rhythm to &quot;Gone&quot;.<br />7. &quot;Wasting Time&quot; - BEST song on the album!  Incredible guitar riffs, sounds like it could be a continuation of &quot;Posters&quot; on the first album.<br />8. &quot;Holes to Heaven&quot; - nice groove, great lyrics.<br />9. &quot;Dreams Be Dreams&quot; - great song, enough said.<br />10.&quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot; - starts off sounding distant, then comes in, great bassline.<br />11.&quot;Fall Line&quot; - short but sweet.<br />12.&quot;Cookie Jar&quot; - one of the more minor sounding songs on the album, but still good.<br />13.&quot;Rodeo Clowns&quot; - remake of the original G-Love song, not quite as good, a little more mellow and left out the whistling part at the end.<br />14.&quot;Cocoon&quot; - most mellow song on the album, great to fall asleep to.  Reminiscent of &quot;The News&quot; from the 1st album.<br />15.&quot;Mediocre Bad Guys&quot; - very unique sounding, great chorus, and probably the 2nd best song on the album.  Saved the best for last.  These last two songs almost sound as one, run right together.<br />16.&quot;Symbol in my Driveway&quot; - great ending song, uses the basic blues progression.<br />Overall, this album HAS to receive 5/5 stars.  Again, at first listen, it might even be better than the 1st album.  Can't wait to see him live with Ben Harper in July.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|This CD got me started in cool jazz, and now I'm hooked.  I've heard many other CDs by comparable artists, but this one remains one of my favorites.  And I'm convinced it's not pure sentimentality on my part.  In fact, if someone were to say to me, &quot;I don't know anything about jazz, but I'd like to try it out,&quot; I would point them to this CD.  If you like music (and I mean music in general, not only jazz), how can you not find this CD tasty?
B00006GEXR|5.0|Hugh Grant is great! The actors sound so true and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever watched. It is so different from the insipid romantic comedies that have come to define the \\"comedy\\" genre in movies.
B000092Q4U|5.0|this is the future of american metal. forget that nu-metal fashion show, this is where metal is going. listen to the guitar work on Purify and tell me how many bands would even be able to cover Lamb of God's songs? One word describes this album...devastating, and if you think the album is good, see them live, if you think you will survive. support underground music.
B00005U18E|4.0|i recently saw the a&e adaptation of pride and prejudice and loved it. it made me realize how rare girls like liz bennett are, who are beautiful, smart, and virtuous. now we have p&p for real women. bridget jones is no liz bennett. she's not too smart, not too pretty, and virtuous???  well, whatever she's not, she is your typical woman of the 21st century. and what she lacks in bbv, she makes up for with a kind of open-hearted, scatterbrained charm. the story bears some resemblance to p&p, particularly the mark darcy character who is played by the same fellow who played fiztwilliam darcy, i mean colin firth, who by the way is still wearing the same long sideburns. it's lighthearted, improbable, sometimes sputters a bit, and is no p&p. but it's a good movie for a rental when you're tired of watching p&p for the 99th time.
B000002UAR|5.0|Some might vote for &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot;.  Some might choose &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, the White Album, or &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, but I have to say that &quot;Revolver&quot; is the Beatles best album.  &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; may well be the greatest album of all time, but Beatles albums are judged with slightly tougher standards.<br />This is, unquestionably, an outstanding album, one that incorporates just about everything rock music and the Beatles could and did stand for.  The songs feature Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison's most mature lyrics yet.  The music--the ensemble playing--is the tightest the pre-1968 Beatles ever got.  The studio wizardry is used effectively here: it embellishes the songs rather than overpowering them (as it sometimes does on &quot;Pepper&quot;).  In 1966, this album signaled a new direction for popular music, a direction that was brought into reality with 1967's &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.  But in 1966, the Beatles were still a live band, and as such, this album represents the middle ground between the live Beatles and studio Beatles.<br />Little more can be said about the songs that hasn't been said already, they are all fantastic pieces of work.  Most notably, few of them are love songs.  The albums deals with more philosophical concerns--the passage of life, communication, the individual in society, &quot;Western 'games'&quot;, peace of mind, escape--within the tight contstraints of a 3-minute pop song, making it very accessable.  The overall tone is a bit darker than &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, but it's the natural follow-up to that groundbreaking album.<br />Although all of the Beatles shine on &quot;Revolver&quot;, the top prize has to go to John Lennon.  His five tracks show the man's singing and songwriting talent, while putting the Beatles closer on the competitive map to more rock-oriented acts like Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and the Who.  Paul McCartney also contributes the best set of songs he's written so far; going beyondshallow pop songs to write mature pieces of work like &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; and &quot;For No One&quot;.<br />Although &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was released as a response to the Beach Boys' &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, the influence of that album can actually be felt more clearly on &quot;Revolver&quot;, particularly on McCartney's tracks.  &quot;Here, There, and Everywhere&quot; and &quot;For No One&quot; owe something to the beautiful sounds of Brian Wilson's masterpiece.<br />Overall, Revolver is a 5-star album with excellent songwriting, beautiful singing, and fantastic playing that is an absolute essential in any rock collection.  Highly recommended to anyone with ears.
B00008WG3U|5.0|Ok first off CDNOW is wrong, the track listing is way different I shall set this straight. Now onto my reveiw, this is a great album, shows how good NOFX can be and how diverse they could be. More of a political album though. <br />1.\\"Seperation of Church And Skate\\", is about the best sounding with a lead heavy guitar riff from El Hefe.<br />2.\\"Irrationality of Rationality\\", is one of the newer styles they been sounding like. <br />3.\\"Franco Un-American\\", this was on the \\"Regaining Unconsciousness EP\\" but is still good.<br />4.\\"Idiots Are Taking Over\\", this was on the \\"Regaining Unconsciousness EP\\" but is still good, nice bassline.<br />5.\\"She's Nubs\\", ok listen to the title this is the funniest song I've heard from NOFX, great too.<br />6.\\"Mattersville\\", this is the best song on the CD, its mostly clean guitar but that town sounds so great to live in.<br />7.\\"Decom-posuer\\", is cool starts out a little slow then bam it hits you when your least expecting it.<br />8.\\"Medio-Core\\", also on the \\"Regaining Unconsciousness EP\\" but still great to hear.<br />9.\\"Anarchy Camp\\", this is another one of the best, nice ska beat in this song.<br />10.\\"American Errorist (I Hate Hate Haters)\\", this is a good song here, If I'm correct there talking about George W. Bush, muahaha.<br />11.\\"We Got Two Jealous Agains\\", this is a good song fast paced beat.<br />12.\\"13 Stitches\\", this is one of the other best songs, weird sound though.<br />13.\\"Re-gaining Unconsciousness\\", ok this is a great song but wasn't on the \\"Regaining Unconsciousness EP\\" weird.<br />14.\\"Whoops I OD'd\\", this is more of an emotional song, if you don't like Emo-Punk, you probably wont like this song.<br />Also you get extras on it, so buy it.
B000089RVX|4.0|Fallen is an album of paradox -- it represents both what's wrong with rock and what's right with it today.<br />First, the bad news.  This album is as overproduced as most of its nu-metal counterparts.  Indeed, it seems to be saturated with effects and synthesizers.  Every note seems to be artificial.  There's no raw feel or quality to the music.  It's not hard to imagine the producers controling every single note from behind a console.  Of course, the signature song of the album, \\"Bring Me To Life\\" also features some rather horrible hip-hop from Paul McCoy of 12 Stones.  The producers no doubt felt that the only way to guarantee the success of the first single was to emulate Linkin Park's formulaic sound.  Thankfully, the rest of the album is devoid of wannabe hip-hop.<br />Now for the good news.  Amy Lee's vocals are astounding.  She is perhaps the best female talent in the genre.  Haunting, ethereal, her vocals and lyric ability is superior to those the band's producers would like to see them follow.  Musically, the songs are solid, but not spectacular.  The guitar work is very good, but it is derivitive.  It's not hard to find similar riffs from bands like Staind or Rammstein.  The drum work is very good.  Josh Freese, drummer of A Perfect Circle, did the drum work on this album, and it is superb.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the bass.  Did Evanescence even use a bass?  In terms of the overall package, the songs are solid, if predictable.  Evanescence is solid in what they do, but don't try to add unique anything to the art.<br />For a debut album, Fallen is a very strong effort.  While it falls prey to the mistakes made by Evanescence's contemporaries, it manages to rise above them through the strength of Amy Lee's vocal work, and the solid, if unoriginal, song writing.  Hopefully their future efforts will be a bit more subtle.
B00005JKZU|5.0|so at first I was infuriated by how far TTT deviated from the book. Many, many astounding changes, most apparently just for the sake of change.<BR>  But I went back and saw the movie again (and again) and eventually loved it for its own sake. <BR>   Nevertheless, for all of you who have seen the movies without ever reading the enchanting books on which they were (loosely) based, you owe it to yourself to see why these books deserved three long movies.
0812550706|5.0|In the near future, aliends named the Buggers have already attacked the Earth once and were narrowly beaten. The humans are now preparing for a second attack from them and their greatest hope lies in the mind of one Andrew(Ender) Wiggin. So is the plot of Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. <BR>Throughout the book Card shows his enormous understanding of the child mind and military history. Card also doesn't fall into the pit of many other authors of making their main character perfect in every way. In Ender's Game we see Ender as a brilliant strategic mind but also very scarred. It doesn't help that Col. Graff(the supervisor of the school) has taken a personal interest in making Ender's life miserable through isolation from other kids. Those expecting an action packed novel with alien blasting will sort of get what they wanted, while there is some fighting in it, you won't miss it because of all of Ender's little shenanigans(!) he pulls off and just how smart he is.<BR>Like the New York Times review above Ender is comparable to a young Napolean in short pants and as such, nobody should miss a great read like this.<BR>Also dont forget to read the sequels after this book.
B00008WG3U|4.0|NOFX is an undeniably fun band to listen to. Their raucous riffs coupled with guttural lyrics amount to nothing less than splendid musical mayhem. However, as non-fans are quick to point out, their lyrical content is generally unsubstantial & occasionally moronic. But wait a minute! As Mike declares in \\"Franco-Unamerican\\", he has perused the work of knowledgable political scientists like Zinn & Chomsky, & with this album, incorporated his subsequent geopolitical concern into songs like \\"The Idiots Are Taking Over\\", \\"Irrationality of Rationality\\", & \\"Regaining Unconsciousness\\", an inspired tune that attacks the passivity of Americans in witnessing the erosion of their own civil liberties. I don't feel that NOFX never had any worthwhile material before this album (I own them all plus most 7\\"'s). I just think they've never had quite as much to say as they do with \\"The War On Errorism\\". Buy it up, kids!
B000005IRG|5.0|The class of '77 introduced the new and exciting genre of punk to the music world. The origin of this new revolution was NYC, where the punk pioneers the Ramones, the artsy Talking Heads, and the poppy Blondie all shared the underground scene.<br /><br />And then there's Television, possibly the most unique out of the bunch. It was especially notable for having two very talented guitarists--Tom Verlaine and originally Richard Hell, later Richard Lloyd, and the extremely tight rhythm section of Ficca (drums) and Smith (bass). Television wasn't \\"punk\\" in the conventional sense of the word--compared to the \\"three chords and a lot of attitude\\" approach favored by the Ramones and Sex Pistols, Television was more akin to the AOR outfits of the day, minus the pseudo-intellectualism and instrumental overkill.<br /><br />Television combined progressive song lengths, obscure and arty lyrics, plenty of technical chops (though very little wanking), and plenty of energy. The result was this LP, one of the greatest musical efforts put out that year and definitely one of the finest albums ever.<br /><br />Almost all the songs are 4 minutes or longer. However, they never feel overlong, because the band never ceases to keep things interesting. Whether it be through the band's great yet understated performances or Verlaine's arty lyrics, Marquee Moon does not have a dull moment. Who else could've written a punk \\"ballad\\" like Guiding Light? Or a quirky pop song like Venus?<br /><br />And there's the 10-minute title track. It's so, so good. Opening with a twin guitar attack, and featuring a brilliant 5-minute improv by Verlaine, it feels epic without feeling forced. The band puts their all into the song, and Marquee Moon is worth the purchase for this track alone.<br /><br />VH1 was justified in including Marquee Moon in their list of 100 Best Rock Albums, at #85. This is great, great music. However, don't go by first impressions--this album is a sleeper. Give it a few listens and eventually Verlaine's odd vocals and complex, yet catchy music will win you over. Highly reccommended.complex, yet catchy music will win you over. Highly reccommended.

B00005RFVL|5.0|This guy needs to get together with Brian Evans!<br />He's awesome. Great cd!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Brushfire Fairytales was excellent, but On and On is in my opinion even better. This is an excellent one for fans of acoustic music. The only track on the album that I don't particularly care for is &quot;Mediocre Bad Guys&quot;. My favorites are &quot;Gone&quot;, &quot;Taylor&quot;, &quot;Traffic in the Sky&quot;, and &quot;Fall Line&quot;.<br />One thing I really like is that there is no attempt to stretch tracks so they're 3-4 minutes long. So instead of having a 1.5 hour album with 20 minutes worth listening to, you'll only be hearing quality music on this one.
0471413909|5.0|Since I'm not a nutritional anthropologist, I can't swear that the author's theories are solid science.  However, I can say for certain that the Paleo Diet works.  In the beginning, it's difficult to banish bread and pasta and dairy and potatoes from your diet ... and it seems like there's high-fructose corn syrup in everything.  However, it's worth the effort.  Six months later, I've shed almost 40 lbs and have taken on the lean and fit look mentioned in the book.  I'm in the best shape of my life, and I feel good all the time.  I neither need nor miss caffeine, anymore.  As a skeptic who is now a believer, I really can't recommend the Paleo Diet strongly enough.
B00005UKE0|5.0|Easily the best post-Beatles album by any of the Fab 4. I've listened to this album probably more than any album over the last 30+ years and it never gets old (just like Revolver). I think the remake of My Sweet Lord is one of the best songs Harrison has done. The first few times I heard it I thought that he had lost it. But I stuck with it and now I can hardly listen to the old version. I think it has some Harrison's best guitar - mature, understated and very spiritual.
B00004BZ16|5.0|There aren't many rock albums I listen to twenty years after release, but this is one of them. Part of the beauty of this album is its sprall - three glorious disks on the original vinyl! OK, that was probably going a bit over the top, and sure there was some filler, but what better way to follow up a two disk masterpiece like London Calling? Eliminate the &quot;filler&quot; on this album and you may have the tightest double-album ever made. The album has improved with age, and the pundits and punk purists that trashed it so quickly after its release (&quot;too ambitious......too musical&quot;) prove the maxim that genius is never recognized in its time.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I have heard the complaint that this album doesn't sound so much like a Fleetwood Mac album as much as a Stevie Nicks solo album and a Lindsey Buckingham solo album put together.  I disagree.  Lindsey Buckingham IS Fleetwood Mac and at all of their stellar moments has been.  Don't get mad Stevie fans - she is a great songwriter; but her songs come to life (as did Christine McVie's) with Lindsey's sound and amazing, but subtle guitar playing.  Play this album next to Out of the Cradle (which rivals Tusk as the best thing Lindsey has ever put out) and you will hear what I mean - a continuation of Lindsey's sound and stellar production.<br />I highly recommend this one.
B000068IEU|4.0|Hard to believe that Last House on the Left would come from the same guy who would create Freddy Kruger and direct the unsatisfying and overrated Scream trilogy, but before any of that happened Wes Craven made this his directorial debut, and it shows.  The picture, production, presentation, and acting are all pretty primitive, but the film still gets it's point across.  A couple finds themselves slowly transforming into methodical killers to exact revenge upon the men who brutally and pointlessly tortured and killed their daughter, and Craven's unflinching camera isn't afraid to show us the gritty and horrific detail.  The film's biggest flaw is the comic interludes involving the sheriff; these scenes take the dreadful atmosphere away from the film and are nothing more than a distraction from the film's underlying theme.  As if you can't tell allready, Last House on the Left isn't a film for everyone, but if you find you can stomach it than consider this essential viewing if your a horror or cult film fan.  Produced by Sean S. Cunningham who would later go on to produce and direct the original Friday the 13th.  MGM has assembled another fine DVD of an older horror film (check out their releases of Return of the Living Dead and The Fog on DVD to see what I mean) featuring a very insightful commentary by Craven and Cunningham, an outtakes and dailies section featuring the never before seen disembowlment scene, an insightful making of featurette, and the film's trailer which features the film's famous tagline.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I saw director Bryan Singer's (\\"The Usual Suspects\\", \\"X-Men\\") highly anticipated \\"X-Men\\" sequel \\"X2\\" at the theater twice and I just couldn't get enough of it! \\"X2\\" has more ground-pounding action and suspense, dynamic fighting scenes, more laugh-out-loud humor, and more awesome special effects than what the first \\"X-Men\\" film gave you back in 2000! Director Singer did a tremendous job in making this sequel and I see no reason why they should ever replace him in case there is a script for \\"X3\\"! The all-star cast from the first film, including Patrick Stewart (TV's \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\"), Hugh Jackman (\\"Swordfish\\"), Ian McKellen (\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy), Oscar winner Halle Berry (007: \\"Die Another Day\\"), Famke Janssen (007: \\"Goldeneye\\"), James Marsden (\\"Disturbing Behavior\\"), Anna Paquin (\\"Finding Forrester\\"), Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (\\"Femme Fatale\\"), and a brief appearance by Bruce Davison (\\"X-Men\\"), gave flawless performances all the way, which makes \\"X2\\" the best film in their careers! Joining the original cast are Alan Cumming (\\"Spy Kids\\"), Brian Cox (\\"The Ring\\"), Kelly Hu (\\"The Scorpion King\\"), Shawn Ashmore (seen briefly in \\"X-Men\\"), and Aaron Stanford (\\"Tadpole\\"), in which they too did an outstanding job with their performances.<br />\\"X2\\", in a nutshell, focuses on Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) and his team of X-Men: Storm (Berry), Cyclops (Marsden), Jean Grey (Janssen), Rogue (Paquin), and last, definitely not least, Wolverine (Jackman), as they and their enemies Magneto (McKellen) and Mystique (Romijn-Stamos) team up against a common enemy. The common enemy: General William Stryker (Cox), a renegade military leader with only one purpose in mind: mutant genocide by way of the Anti-Mutant Registration Act. During the film, \\"X2\\" also introduces us to some new characters, including Nightcrawler (Cumming), a.k.a. Kurt Wagner (pronounced \\"Vagner\\"), who has the ability to teleport through walls and other objects in no time flat, Iceman (Ashmore), a.k.a. Bobby Drake, who has the ability to freeze anyone or anything he touches, Pyro (Stanford), a.k.a. John, who has the ability to manipulate fire, and Deathstrike (Hu), a.k.a. Yuriko Oyama, who has the same amount of abilities as Wolverine has, but different. And you'll see what I mean when she and Wolverine go head-to-head against each other! The film also talks about Wolverine trying to piece together some answers about his shadowy past that made him what he is right now. And, as with any comic-based film adaptation, there will definitely be some surprises along the way!<br />In conclusion, \\"X2\\", without a doubt, will easily be one of the best summer films ever made (although \\"X2\\" will be in competition with \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\", \\"The Hulk\\", and \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\"), not to mention that it will be one of the best films of 2003! With powerful storytelling, top-notch performances, suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and special effects that will blow you away, \\"X2\\" will be among one of those films that reminds us as to why we go to the movies in the first place! \\"X2\\" is a film that you'll want to watch over and over again, and you'll see why when it is released on DVD! And all I have to say is...bring on \\"X3\\"!
0783226888|1.0|Here's another Hollywood remake of what was a great story (and a great movie as well). So far, this ranks as the worst remake of an action/spy movie that I can recall having seen. There's not one ounce of correlation between this movie and the origial \\"The day of the Jackal\\" (the book) other than the fact that the assasin in question has the same name! The suspense found in the book (and the movie with Edward Fox) has been replaced by cheap action scenes. Case in point: the killing of Jack Black, the creator of the \\"rifle\\" that Bruce Willis is using...<br />Even if you haven't read the book or seen the original movie, this only adds up to a mediocre action movie. And what is that accent that Richard Gere is attempting?
B00005JLRT|5.0|This was a great film!!! I loved every second of it. The acting was truly wonderful. I can't wait until it's out on DVD! Every one should own a copy of this movie.
B00003CXXM|1.0|This movie is only surpassed by \\"The Jackal\\" (with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere) as the worst remake of an action/spy movie. Apart from the fact that the main character is named \\"Jason Bourne\\", is found floating in water, and has a swiss bank account, this movie has nothing to do with the book on which it is based. The suspense in the book is replaced by Matt Damon ripping apart a US consulate and a cheap car chase scene where he outruns Paris' finest in a rusty old Mini Cooper ... <br />If you want to see the movie based on the book, get the made for TV version with Richard Chaimberlain instead. That movie is very true to the book, and infinately better than this. <br />Now, the movie is actually a decent action movie. I'd give it 3 stars if it hadn't been for the reasons above.
B0000024UX|5.0|First of all, I must admit that I've only recently become a Simon &amp; Garfunkel's fan . I mean,my dad has had albums by this fantastic duo since I was very little, but I only stopped to listen to them carefully in the last three years or so. However, S&amp;G have become, little by little, one of my trully favourite bands - and obviously my favourite duo. <BR>OK, now let's move to &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, then. I've bought it less than a week ago, but it was enough to discover that it's an amazing album. I've heard many people complaining about it not being very homogeneous, and I'm affraid they're right: it's not homogeneous at all. I wonder, though: does that really matter? Take the tittle track, for example: simply gorgeous, probably THE song about friendship, loyalty and self-sacrifice. It always gives me goose bumps, no matter how many times I listen to it. Take then &quot;The Boxer&quot; - it's just so moving. Take &quot;Cecilia&quot;, certainly not a &quot;calm&quot; song like the other two I mentioned above, but still great. Actually, take the entire album and you'll see - listen, actually - how great it is. And you'll regret deeply that after this Simon and Garfunkel went separate ways. This was their Grand Finale and I couldn't imagine anything better to close their short, yet powerful, career.
B00008S2VF|5.0|MADONNA'S AMERICAN LIFE, CLASSIC POP MUSIC AT ITS BEST!<br />Reviewer: madonnasworld from nyc, ny<br />Review of the American Life Album:<br />1. American Life- This song is very electro sounding and a definte continuation along th lines of Madonna's more experiemantal work. The stand out point is when Madonna raps about all the things she has and does but that in the end it does not bring her true happiness. There's a very important message in this song. But its a song you would not normally see released as a single. But Madonna, the risk taker made this the first video and single. Unfortuanly the video had to be pulled after shortly being released in Europe. It was never aired in the u.s. Now there is another version to the video, called the flag version.<br />2. Hollywood- this is a fun song. I esp. like the ending where she shouts, Push the button don't push the button. I just wish they wouldn't drown it out with a mans voice . I think Madonnas voice is too beautiful to be tweaked with.<br />3.I'm so stupid-This is madonnas song about her past mistakes and coming to terms with it..electric guitars, she vents out alot of anger.<br />4. Love profusion-I told Madonna that this should be her next single..its fun and very catchy. A definite stand out track.<br />Instant classic.<br />5. nobody knows me- This is a fun song pointed towards her critics!<br />6. Nothing Fails- Hands down my favorite track on the album. It has everything, its very inspirational and moving.<br />7. Intervention-I think this is her new 'crazy for you'. It has a folk rock quality to it. Very fun and uplifting tune.<br />8. X-static Process- Beautiful and touch love song. Alot of the songs on this album have alot of guitar....this one is mainly Madonnas voice and the guitar. A stunning track.<br />9. Mother and Father- Probably one of the best song on this album, Madona goes back inot her past as a child living without a mother and expresses to us her loneliness. Then in the lyrics' \\"I've got to let it go, I've got to give it up\\". Shes gives us another classic Madonna rap..the line that stands out the most is \\"I MADE A VOW THAT I WOULD NEVER NEED ANOTHER PERSON NEVER TURN MY HEART INTO A CAGE, A VICTIM OF A KIND OF RAGE\\". This rap reminded me of Madonna's earliest work prior to her first album.<br />10. Die another Day- is the song we are all familiar with before the album was released. It was the famous bond theme song from last year. I love this song so much, esp. the video was so fierce. I just would have rather have seen a new song instead this one on this album.<br />11. Easy Ride- It starts off slow but then in builds up into a fabulous song with strings and ends with a techno edge reminiscent of Mirwais \\"Paradise Not for Me\\" tune. A truly perfect ending to the album. The lyrics are very haunting and personal. We are invited on this track to really know what Madonna is thinking about in her mind. \\"I want to live forever\\" \\"Not to find my time and space, it's a lonely place\\". Probably the best lyrics are found on this track.<br />Overall, this is Madonna at her best. After hearing it once for the first time, I remember thinking how you can hear a much more wiser and adult Madonna here. Her voice is soft and full of feeling. Consistantly putting out her most personal lyrics to date. Inviting us to know what shes feeling and thinking at this current state in her life. You hear the joys and happieness that shes finally attained. I would recommend this album to anyone who amazing music that puts u in a good mood. You get her positive messages about what matters in life. Also, you hear her protecting herself from people who judge her , You listen to the most cutting edge beats and music from her collaborator mirwais giving us a taste of what music will sound like in the future only with Madonna you can experience it now!! Not one bad song. madonna always delivers quality music, never forget that!.t it go, I've got to give it up\\".

6302891272|4.0|I have read Macbeth by Shakespeare before and I was amazed how effectively the film Throne of Blood interpreted Macbeth. Kurosawa Akira conveyed the atmosphere and the feeling of the original Macbeth successfully. I am Japanese who has lived in Japan all my life, so maybe that$B!G(Bs why, but I personally thought that the movie is unique and has been well developed with Japanese modes of expression. All the setting, characters, and language are in Japanese, such as old-Japanese castles, the samurai with swords and old the Japanese language that even now-days Japanese will suffer from understanding.<BR>It is also interesting to see how Kurosawa interpret Macbeth differently from Shakespeare, especially at the end where Macbeth or Washizu dies. In Throne of Blood, Washizu is killed by the army on his side which makes it more dramatic, tragic, and striking. You can$B!G(Bt neglect this creative Japanese-style Macbeth which you will gain a lot of new ideas and thoughts. This movie might change your interpretation or understanding of Macbeth and you might feel differently from before. It will be a good opportunity to check this out and compare with other versions of Macbeth. I, myself felt it was worthwhile watching the movie Throne of Blood so I$B!G(Bm sure people can experience a different concept of Macbeth.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Review of the American Life Album:<br />1. American Life- This song is very electro sounding and a definte continuation along th lines of Madonna's more experiemantal work.  The stand out point is when Madonna raps about all the things she has and does but that in the end it does not bring her true happiness. There's a very important message in this song. But its a song you would not normally see released as a single.  But Madonna, the risk taker made this the first video and single. Unfortuanly the video had to be pulled after shortly being released in Europe. It was never aired in the u.s. Now there is another version to the video, called the flag version.<br />2. Hollywood- this is a fun song. I esp. like the ending where she shouts, Push the button dont push the button. I just wish they wouldnt drown it out with a mans voice . I think Madonnas voice is too beautiful to be tweaked with.<br />3.I'm so stupid-This is madonnas song about her past mistakes and coming to terms with it..electric guitars, she vents out alot of anger.<br />4. Love profusion-I told Madonna that this should be her next single..its fun and very catchy. A definite stand out track.<br />Instant classic.<br />5. nobody knows me- This is a fun song pointed towards her critics!<br />6. Nothing Fails- Hands down my favorite track on the album. It has everything, its very inspirational and moving.<br />7. Intervention-I think this is her new 'crazy for you'.  It has a folk rock quality to it. Very fun and uplifting tune.<br />8.  X-static Process- Beautiful and touch love song. Alot of the songs on this album have alot of guitar....this one is mainly Madonnas voice and the guitar. A stunning track.<br />9. Mother and Father- Probably one of the best song on this album, Madona goes back inot her past as a child living without a mother and expresses to us her loneliness.  Then in the lyrics \\"Ive got to let it go, Ive got to give it up\\". Shes gives us another classic Madonna rap..the line that stands out the most is \\"I MADE A VOW THAT I WOULD NEVER NEED ANOTHER PERSON NEVER TURN MY HEART INTO A CAGE, A VICTIM OF A KIND OF RAGE\\". This rap reminded me of Madonna's earliest work prior to her first album.<br />10. Die another Day- is the song we are all familiar with before the album was released. It was the famous bond theme song from last year.  I love this song so much, esp. the video was so fierce. I just would have rather have seen a new song instead this one on this album.<br />11. Easy Ride- It starts off slow but then in builds up into a fabulous song with strings and ends with a techno edge reminiscent of Mirwais Paradise Not for Me tune. A truly perfect ending to the album.  The lyrics are very haunting and personal. We are invited on this track to really know what Madonna is thinking about in her mind.  I want to live forever Not to find my time and space, its a lonely place. Probably the best lyrics are found on this track.<br />Overall, this is Madonna at her best. After hearing it once for the first time, I remember thinking how you can hear a much more wiser and adult Madonna here.  Her voice is soft and full of feeling.  Consistantly putting out her most personal lyrics to date. Inviting us to know what shes feeling and thinking at this current state in her life. You hear the joys and happieness that shes finally attained. I would recommend this album to anyone who amazing music that puts u in a good mood.  You get her positive messages about what matters in life. Also, you hear her protecting herself from people who judge her , You listen to the most cutting edge beats and music from her collaborator mirwais giving us a taste of what music will sound like in the future only with Madonna you can experience it now!! Not one bad song. madonna always delivers quality music, never forget that!.line that stands out the most is \\"I MADE A VOW THAT I WOULD NEVER NEED ANOTHER PERSON NEVER TURN MY HEART INTO A CAGE, A VICTIM OF A KIND OF RAGE\\".

B00006LLLN|5.0|What an album!  The musicianship brings tears to your eyes -- there are no better musicians to be found anywere in any genre!  This is due, in large part, to the quality of the recording which allows you to really hear each instrument and appreciate how well they are being played.  Other reviews here speak to the songs themselves but suffice it to say that they are wide-ranging in their styles and influences.  Enjoy!!<BR> <BR>p.s. -- this is a good price, too.<BR> <BR>Even a year later it's still my favorite album!  It just keeps getting better!

B00008LDPU|4.0|Normally not one to review an item that isn't out yet, I've seen half the shorts on here so my opinion is at least somewhat educated. You too can see four of the shorts by visiting the Animatrix website. Amazon doesn't usually allow URLs in their reviews but I'll give you one guess as to what it is.<br />The Animatrix was conceived by the brothers Wachoski (the guys who made the original films). Four of the nine shorts were also written by them. One unfluential medium for the movie The Matrix was comic books, and the brothers successfully used this medium to not only tell parts of the story but introduce the world of the Matrix to the world (you can find the free online-comics on the Matrix website). Now, another highly influential medium to the brothers, anime (or Japanese animation) is being used to tell other parts of the grand story (and introduce the second film).<br />For casual fans of the movies, it is not necessary to buy this DVD. It has extra, but not intregal, story material. It's more of a bonus for people who want more (three films isn't nearly enough for many fans). What you get in this are nine anime short films directed by top names in their field. For anime fans this alone makes it worth buying. For Matrix fans it means you're getting quality. All the films are supervised by the brothers and four were written by them to ensure their proper place in the Matrix continuity.<br />Since this review is for American audiences, it's important to note something. This is NOT for young children! The reason this is important to note is because Americans seem trained to associate animation equals kids. Some of the shorts portay gruesome violence (even more so than the films thus far). Indeed, much like the film, the stories are very intellectual and not written for a child's mindset anyway.<br />In all, if you are a fan of the films, you need to check this out. It's really well done, and gives a lot of insight into how the world as we know it developed into the future world that Morpheus describes. Don't expect it to be better than the films, but it is a worthy addition.future world that Morpheus describes. Don't expect it to be better than the films, but it is a worthy addition.
B00006RINF|2.0|I had high hopes for this album, but the mix is not very good.  The female vocals often come out as vague vowel sounds and the male vocals are lackluster.  The songs have simple setups and melodies and are uninventive.  The only song which shows promise is &quot;Aeon&quot; and they chop that one short.  Sorry, this band is mediocre.
0385504209|4.0|The da Vinci Code is an exciting race from the Louvre to French castles to England, dealing with bizarre current cults and the heirs of the Knights Templar, linking the last supper of Jesus, the Crusades, Renaissance art, and mean French people.  As an historical thriller, it's very well done.<br />The story sheds light on the Opus Dei sect of the Catholic Church, an actual group practicing aggressive psychological methods of recruiting, total salary donations, celibacy, and self-flagellation.  It also turns on an interesting interpretation of da Vinci's Last Supper in Milan.  For those less rooted in Renaissance iconography, don't be fooled by the theories stated to be commonly understood by art historians.  Without giving away the point of the story, for any Renaissance artist to depict a common sacred Christian theme with, say, eleven disciples rather than twelve, is pretty far fetched.  And, while Michaelangelo is famous for making his female figures look awfully male, da Vinci is equally noted for making many of his male figures look androgynous or angelic.  Different tastes.<br />For those interested in the actual character depicted in this important scene, da Vinci's own notes label the disciple as James; the same James that Jesus entrusted to care for his mother from the cross.  Peter was asked to build the church; James to support Mary.  In this context, the position and pose makes perfect sense - more sense than the conspiracy, however interesting the conspiracy theory is.

B00008J4P5|4.0|It's clear to me that if this album gets slammed in reviews it's out of spite do to the hype by many publications.....namely Rolling Stone.  But even the purest of rock nerds have to admit that this album definitely has something......and NO, it's not better than everything Zeppelin ever did, nor is it the best album in 30 years.......not even close.  <br />But it definitely brought up so many comparisons to other bands.....how many albums make you think of AC/DC, George Thorouhgood (sp?), Mamas and the Papas, Nirvana, and Black Sabbath to name a few?????<br />The 1st song (Seven Nation Army) is top notch.  The only thing bad about it is that the rest of the album doesn't get this good again.  But there are some purely raw, straight up rock moments (Ball and a Biscuit) that get you reved up.  Ozzy Osbourne is smiling somewhere about the nasty low-base killer guitar heard throughout (namely on 'Little Acorns').  And somewhere Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton are listening, waiting to hear a little more than 3 or for chords per song - really the only thing that holds this back from being a classic.  Simple is good, but too much of it and it becomes basic. But hearing Meg's voice is quite refreshing, and she makes this CD unique.  <br />Jack's voice is fantastic.  He picks up right where he left off (White Blood Cells) and coninues to belt out some mean vocals.  <br />This is a must buy, regardless.  It will be nominated for album of the year, I'm sure, and that's fine with me.
B00000JQFM|5.0|I have been playing guitar for about 10 years now. When i heard this album for the first time my mouth hit the floor. Satch's sound, technique, and talent make him get my vote for best guitarist period. Each song on his album has a unique sound and beat that makes you listen to it over and over again. I hope satch writes another album as good as this one.....rock on
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I'm a SMACK fan...a very loyal one at that...but I must say this album is a huge dissapointment! This album is mediocre...lacks creativity...has very few hard crunching riffs and is geared toward everyday radio play...YUCK!!! I don't think they did the best they could...and when they AWAKE from what hopefully is a terrible VOODOO spell...and they lose the GREED...they will truly STAND ALONE...but until then if your holding this CD in your hands at the checkout counter...I would jump STRAIGHT OUT OF LINE!!!
B00008S2VH|5.0|I'm tired of Madonna bashing and while I admit I'm not always her biggest fan, I find alot of merit in her work.<BR>This album is beautiful, loving, heartfelt, tragic and optimistic. She has reach another level in her life, has grown and has adapted musically to reflect that. She is an artist.<BR>And while I really love dance pop music without a heart or soul and Madonna has offered it up many times, I also love connecting to a great melody and lyric, which she has done here.<br />Bravo Madonna...you've definately elevated yourself as an artist and songwritter. This ablum is wonderful and I feel it will be timeless.<br />Brooke
B00006F83Y|5.0|This album is incredible. I just begun to listen to Queens of The Stone Age (QOTSA). From the beginning of the album you are slammed with adrenaline hitting fast sounds. Continuing through the album you're taken on a roller coaster of slow and fast beats with incredible vocals. QOTSA is here to stay. If you haven't listened yet, I suggest you pick up an album. Also, just for anyone interested in knowing the QOTSA tour with Red Hot Chili Peppers is coming to a close, but QOTSA with be playing at Lollapalooza. (I think I spelled it correct) Enjoy.
B00005JKPF|5.0|i think that the movie is really good for a comic book movie.  even if you have never herd of the x-men,  you will like this movie.  It is much better then the first.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Great epic film<BR>Its true there are some flaws in the structure of the screenplay and some scenes could use a little polish in the editing, but hey, gimme a break: its Martin Scorsese. And its a hell of a show. Its one of the most breathtaking and stunning epics ever made. The scenery is just overwhelming. The camerawork by Ballhaus portraits accordingly the mood and the atmosphere inherent to the story and time. Scorseses direction is, as usually, risk taking and in a brilliant way modern and classical at the same time. But above all: You will never forget the haunting performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher. I could watch this guy acting for hours. The voice, the body language, the awkward costume and the archaic characterization make it one of the great mythical characters of film history. This is great stuff. Its archaical and mythic. It deals with fatherhood, loyalty and betrayal and above all: the survival of the fittest. Its one of the quintessential American stories and Scorsese has the directorial power to film it in the most intense images. What a shame it did not get any Oscars. I would have deserved them all. Thanks for this film.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Well now... you have the directors of Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Akira, Ninja Scroll, the Final Fantasy Movie, and Aeon Flux all popped into one nice DVD. Out of the episodes I've seen, which are the 4 episodes on the official website and the Osiris short shown with Dreamcatcher, the Animatrix DVD is gonna be one of my \\"must buys\\" for June.<br />Each episode is not to go unnoticed each showing a particular side of the Matrix universe (including how it was created) making it an essential for any Matrix fan. Also one has to respect the amount of quality in detail and animation put into each short episode.<br />If you're not an Anime fan.. these episodes should show you why you should be :-b. If you are, you should know what to expect from these directors and in my opinion, i think you won't be disappointed.
B000001FNA|5.0|This album smells Southern Rock. Anyway,Idlewild is a place in  South America. What is Southern Rock? Well, as far as i know  country-rock and blues-rock mingled with South American lyrics(those about the life in the south). The album opens with 'Revival'(meaning of revival:to become alive again) my first Southern Rock experience[people can you hear it,love is everywhere]. Just like its title it is a refreshing song, makes the listener cheerful. 'Don't Keep Me Wondering' comes the second, 'Midnight Rider'-a very popular ABB song and 'In Memory of Elizabeth Reed' follow.These three are all enjoying to listen, the last one being instrumental. Maybe you have heard of Willie Dixon, he is the bluesman who before was a heavy-weight boxer, and then he learns to play the bass guitar. Dixon is the creator of 'Hoochie Coochie Man'(hooch=marijuana,cooch=a woman's genitals), their 5th song in the album. Drums here are unbelievable, make your blood boil. Also Berry Oakley is the singer in this song. It is supposed to be the best blues rock song sung by a white man. Gregg Allman sings the rest of the  songs. 'Please Call Home' is a slow blues rock example(i don't like this much). Album ends with 'Leave My Blues At Home'.Dickey Betts is the creator of 'Revival' and 'In Memory of Elizabeth  Reed', whereas all others by Gregg Allman.(of course except 'Hoochie Coochie Man' which is by Willie Dixon). Also on the album cover the black person may seem to be a woman he is a man.All Men.
B000066NW0|5.0|Why should you buy this CD? Good question. I love this CD because I'm really into rock/pop. About half the CD is rock and the other half is pop. Here's my break down of the tracks:<br />1. Losing Grip: This song gets a lot of radio play, but it still rocks. A little too punk for my taste, though- 3/5 stars<BR>2. Complicated: I have this song totally memorized! The energy in it always perks me up, but if you've heard it too much it gets old- 4/5 <BR>3. Sk8er Boi! The first time I heard this song I hated it, but now it's one of my favorite songs. It has a good message and tune-5/5 <BR>4. I'm with you: This is a beautiful song! 5/5 <BR>5. Mobile: Well, it's not my fave song, but it's starting to grow on me. A tiny bit annoying, though. 3/5 <BR>6. Unwanted: I really don't care for this song. The lyrics are powerful, but it's a little too punk. 2/5 <BR>7. Tomorrow: Another slow song, pretty and sweet. I luv it! 4/5 8. Anything but Ordinary: This is such a fab song! It describes me perfectly! =) 5/5<br />9. Things I'll never say: This is my favorite song on the CD! It's one of those songs you don't mind having stuck in your head! 6/5 stars!!<BR>10. My World: I don't get this song! It confuses me, but I still like it! 3/5<BR>11. Nobody's Fool: This song is part rap, part pop. This is among my fave rap songs because you can understand it!!! 5/5 <BR>12. Too Much to ask: I tried, but I still don't like this song.<BR>=( 2/5<BR>13. Naked: This isn't the horribly \\"risque\\" song I thought it would be! I don't really like it that much, though. 3/5
B00008NG5V|4.0|This CD hits it's highs with Traffic in the Sky and the last two songs Mediorce Bad Guy, and Symbol in My Driveway.  The songs are little less poppie (if that's even a word) than the first, and the songwriting is better to me.  I like the mood this album as taken as well over the first.  I can't wait to hear more out of Jack Johson.
B000006045|1.0|I don't pay much attention to pop music. But, sadly, when I do I find little reason to change my habits. The praise lavished on these recordists made me curious, though I was utterly befuddled by this praise when I heard them. Their sound  approximates a group of kids playing with casio keyboards in someone's basement. While certainly more creative than much of the drivel encountered on the pop scene, they are no more talented than a Britney Spears or N Sync--perhaps less so. Pardon me while I go back to listening to something that requires an ear for tone and rhythm.
B00008WG3U|4.0|I don't believe that an album can truely be rated after only hearing it ten times in two days, but this is my initial response to what I hear.  The album consists of many songs with the signiture NOFX sound, like \\"The Separation of Church and Skate,\\" \\"The Irrationality of Rationality,\\" \\"Decom-poseur,\\" \\"Re-gaining Unconsciousness,\\" and \\"Idiots are Taking Over.\\"  There is also the very pop sounding \\"Franco Unamerican,\\" which is by all means a very decent song.  NOFX has also revived their ska sounds in \\"Medio-core\\" and \\"Anarchy Camp.\\"  Overall, most of the songs have a new feel about them, with NOFX concentrating on their strengths unlike some of their previous releases.  They slow down the tempo on \\"Mattersville,\\" \\"Anarchy Camp,\\" and especially \\"Whoops, I OD'd,\\" but it's a much needed change of pace that sets this NOFX release apart from some of their others.  However, most of the songs sound like a continuation of \\"Pump up the Valuum,\\" which is not a bad thing, and \\"Shes Nubs\\" brings back memories of \\"Monosyllabic Girl\\" when I listen to it.  \\"The War on Errorism\\" is by no means a masterpiece, but it is definitely worthy of purchase.  Occasionally the political messages get driven into the ground, but at least someone is criticizing the current political regime with uncompromising harshness.  NOFX may not break much new ground, but they are changing direction slightly, which makes this album an interesting listen.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Wow! X-Men 2 did not lose any momentum from X-Men 1! If you haven't seen this movie yet, run, don't walk to your nearest theater and get in line! This movies continues the plot of Wolverine searching for clues to his past, which ties in directly to the bad guy of the month, Colonel Stryker, a human who is out to kill all the mutant aborrations.<br />The plot of Stryker is based on a comic book by Chris Claremont entitled, \\"God Loves, Man Kills\\" (buy it...), where a religious fanatic (Stryker) gets a \\"call by God\\" to kill all mutants, and has a paramilitary organization funded by his religious ministry to do such that. In the movie, he doesn't have religious ties, but rather he has a personal crusade because of... well I won't tell you!<br />Apart from headliners Prof. Xavier, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Storm, Ice Man, Rogue and Pyro, along with baddies Magneto and Mystique, there are mutant guest appareances in this movie include: Dr. Hank McCoy, Jubliee, Shadowcat, Colossus, Syrin, Mastermind (sort of), and Lady Deathstrike (sort of). The credits list \\"Remy Lebau / Gambit\\" as well, but I didn't spot him.<br />I'm wondering if Stan Lee found himself a cameo, too, like he had in the first X-Men movie and the Daredevil movie, but I didn't catch it if it was in there.<br />Of course, what's an X-Men movie with Magneto? The title and trailer both betray the plot fact that the forces who were in opposition in \\"X1\\" are working together in this one against their common foe, Stryker. But after the movie's over, where does it leave these two temporarily-allied camps? Well I guess we'll find out in X3, which mmmmust be made since it's terribly obvious in X2 that there is so much more story begging to be told (and wrapped up.)<br />Seeing these merry mutants on the big screen gave me goosebumps. As a long time (17 years!) reader of the X-Men comic books, it is very satisfying to see them bigger than life in a very well-made movie with top-notch special effects, acting, and most impotantly, a seamless plot!<br />If you love a good sci-fi action movie, or if you enjoyed the first X-Men movie, you should see this one while it is still on the big screen!s, acting, and most impotantly, a seamless plot!<br />If you love a good sci-fi action movie, or if you enjoyed the first X-Men movie, you should see this one while it is still on the big screen!

0385503954|2.0|&quot;Atonement&quot; is, in book-jacket terms, the panoramic story of a lie that profoundly alters the lives of those it touches.  It is divided into three parts.  The first tells the story of the lie: its background, why it was told, who told it.  The last two show the lie's unfolding consequences.<br />For all its careful planning, the book falls short.  The first part is excellent: well-written, engaging, full of vibrant characters and an interesting story.  The remainder, however, fails to live up to the beginning's promise.  The second part of the book is almost devoid of plot, leaving the third part to clumsily resume and conclude the story.  By then its emotion is diffused, and the book ends carelessly, trying to be powerful and succeeding only in being amusing and somewhat sad.<br />&quot;Atonement&quot; is worth reading only for the lush preparation of its first part.  The rest of the book in its meandering is - like the story itself - a lesson in waste.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|...with plenty of carnage....blood everywhere! way more complicated than the first, maybe even more interesting (however I loved the first one also) If you want a movie with a ton of gore, and a ton of action this is it!
B00005JKHP|5.0|This is the first DVD I've bought where all the extras were interesting and worth watching.  The modifications to the 1979 movie, including new special effects, and better editing provide a very good look at how the movie might have been if Paramount hadn't messed it up.<br />The new special effects alone would make this a valuable addition to ones DVD collection, but that only scratches the surface of what is here.  Wise has expertly edited the movie bring a much needed pace, and included scenes that had been deleted.<br />Another bonus is a feature on Phase II the Trek series that never happened; including some test scenes that were shot.<br />If you are a Trek fan then this is a must have DVD.  I cannot say enough about how thrilled I am about this version.
B00008NG5V|4.0|At last, my search has gone somewhere! Jack Johnsons On and On is a brilliant piece of music from start to end. Its amazing how at first one thinks &quot;oh, hes the male version of Norah Jones&quot;, but then quickly realizes were listening to some ORIGINAL music. Its like pop meets folk meets reggae. The mix is unique and his voice is very appropiate. Some of my favourites are the Hippie-hands-in-the-air &quot;Times Like These&quot;, the Bob Marley-esque &quot;Horizon...&quot;, the profound simpleness of &quot;Taylor&quot;, and the Im-cool &quot;Rodeo Clowns&quot;. Enjoy.
B00004WGAI|5.0|A few months ago I watched both this 4-hour BBC production and the more recent A&E version starring Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton in one sitting ... an Eyre-athon! And in my opinion, this version EASILY won hands-down as the best (I've already seen just about every other filmed version). I've since watched it many times and never tire of it. If you love the novel, what a glorious, breathtaking treat this is!!<br /><br />Yes, this production is long (good news for Bronte fans!) and it has a somewhat dated feel, but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won't want to watch any other version!<br /><br />Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester... it's that simple. I don't care that other reviewers claim he's too handsome. Dalton is attractive, certainly, but no pretty-boy. In fact he possesses a craggy, angular dark charm that, to my mind, is quite in keeping with the mysterious, very masculine Mr R. And he takes on Rochester's sad, tortured persona so poignantly. He portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it, but also displays Rochester's tender, passionate, emotional side as well. (IMO the A&E production suffers in that Ciaran Hinds - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout. I've read the book many times and I never felt that Rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast!)<br /><br />Whenever I reread the novel, I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Ms. Clarke, to me, resembles Jane as she describes herself (and is described by others). Small, childlike, fairy... though it's true the actress doesn't look 18, she portrays Jane's attributes so well. While other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional, one must remember that the character spent 8 years at Lowood being trained to hold her emotions and \\"passionate nature\\" in check. Her main inspiration was her childhood friend Helen, who was the picture of demure submission. Although her true nature was dissimilar, Jane learned to master her temper and appear docile, in keeping with the school's aims for its charity students who would go into 'service'. Jane became a governess in the household of the rich Mr. Rochester. She would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal (as Samantha Morton does in the A&E version). Even later on when she gave as well as she got, she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer. Nevertheless, if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles Zelah-as-Jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered.<br /><br />The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is just right, I think. No, it does not in the least resemble Hollywood (thank God! It's not a Hollywood sort of book) but theirs is a romance which is true, devoted and loyal. And for a woman like Jane, who never presumed to have *any* love come her way, it is a minor miracle.<br /><br />The rest of the casting is terrific, and I love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here. So, too, is much of the rich, evocative dialogue. This version is the only one that I know of to include the lovely, infamous 'gypsy scene' and in general, features more humor than other versions I've seen.

She would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal (as Samantha Morton does in the A&E version). Even later on when she gave as well as she got, she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer. Nevertheless, if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles Zelah-as-Jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered.     The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is just right, I think. No, it does not in the least resemble Hollywood (thank God! It's not a Hollywood sort of book) but theirs is a romance which is true, devoted and loyal. And for a woman like Jane, who never presumed to have *any* love come her way, it is a minor miracle.     The rest of the casting is terrific, and I love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here. So, too, is much of the rich, evocative dialogue. This version is the only one that I know of to include the lovely, infamous 'gypsy scene' and in general, features more humor than other versions I've seen. In particular, the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful!    Jane Eyre was, in many ways, one of the first novelized feminists. She finally accepted love on her own terms and independently, and, at last, as Rochester's true equal. Just beautiful!    Now, WHEN WILL THIS BE RELEASED ON DVD?

B00005JKPF|5.0|I don't know why, but it seems that in movies, the second part of a trilogy is usually better than the first (INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM withstanding). X-MEN gave a nice introduction to some of the basic characters and set the stage for what was to come later. X2 begins not long after X-MEN ended. Wolverine is searching for his past; Rogue and Iceman have started a relationship; Magneto is still in prison; and so on and so forth. The film steadily builds leading from one critical moment to the next, until we finally reach the film's climax at a Canadian dam.<br />X2 is a far superior film than X-MEN. The first movie was basically a live action cartoon, moved by action rather than character. X2 is the opposite, it is an action film, but one with substance, moved forward by character and motive rather than action and special effects. Watching the film, I felt as though I was watching a modern Shakespearean play set against the backdrop of a comic book. There aren't very many action films that can do that.<br />This is a movie that all people will enjoy, whether they know anything about the X-Men or not.

B00003CXCD|5.0|&quot;Roman Holiday&quot; hasn't remained an audience and critical favorite simply based on sentiment.  It remains a delightful and romantic tale (undoubtedly rooted in fantasy) that can be viewed repeatedly without losing any charm.  The usual synonym for Audrey Hepburn's performance (enchanting) is still true after 50 years.  The DVD transfer is one of the best I've seen; if you suspend reality for a while you would swear it was the print of a brand-new film.  The clarity and sound are excellent and the extras are a real treat for diehard fans of the movie.  <br />When my aunt finally relented and purchased a DVD player, this was the first movie I sent her to start her collection.  What better compliment can there be for this ageless classic?
0743455967|5.0|27. On Writing       by Stephen King<br />It is all about resonance and a paperclip instead of a staple. There wasn't that simple? Here is a master craftsman inviting you into his shop, letting you play with the tools, showing you how to do this work. How to enjoy it for itself.  I savored this book as it spoke to me. It was written for me and people like me that have discovered the joy of building with words. Most of what he says is in a personal way that allows you to know the man behind the curtain. He is no scary man, no pervert, not mad. He likes to tell stories. Keep you interested. And he has done a masters job. Thank you Mr. King for taking some mystery out of the process and inviting everyone to have a go.
B00005221L|3.0|Swirling shots of immersive jungles, a greasy Apollo Creed, and almost intelligable lines like, \\"You never did know when to quit, did you?\\" make this the High Chieftan of Arnold flicks.  And the Guy Movie among Guy Movies as well; the 2 minute sequence of huge guns spraying masses of lead into nothingness is sheer testosterone.<br />And no one smokes cigars like Ah-nold.<br />\\"Payback Time!\\"  \\"Ain't got time to bleed!\\"  \\"Buncha slack-jawed ... around here, this stuff'll make ya into a .... sexual tyrannosaurus!  Just like me.\\"  I mean, really, who WOULDN'T want Jesse Venture as their state's governor?<br />Sure this is generic action whatnot from McTiernan, but it's awesome at what it does.  And don't deny the great performance of what's-his-name, the guy who plays Ventura's best friend.  The \\"any time\\" guy.  That guy was awesome.  His freakouts are genuinely believable.<br />And seriously, every single line Arnold utters is immense entertainment.  He should play every part in every movie for the rest of time.<br />The reason I gave this DVD three stars is the unforgivable lack of extras, which is inexcusable in this day and age.  We want to see Stan Winston making the Predator's crab-claw mouth!  We want to see extra closeups of Arnie taking meaty drags from his phallic stogie!  And what about the famous behind-the-scenes thirteen-minute brawl between Ahhnold and Weathers, the one that gave Weathers the busted eye socket?  Rumor has it McTiernan caught the whole thing on film, including the smack that actually popped Weathers' eye out of the socket momentarily.  That stuff would be nice to see.<br />Criterion has done DVDs of The Rock and Armaggedon, so they shouldn't feel like it would be \\"low\\" of them to commit an extensive effort to McTiernan's \\"crass\\" bit of masculinity.<br />\\"It's been a long time, Colonel...\\"
B000002VCQ|3.0|It seems although Whitney is a fabulous singer she has never made great albums. She is more of a singles artist then an album artist. Her albums have always had some fillers in them and often most material are ballads or cheesy dance track. This album is by no means different. However vocally it is her best album. Whitneys vocals on this album sound fresh, her voice was also different. Whitney also does something else on these songs than the next. She does not oversing and though she sings loud sometimes it doesnt annoy you unlike what happened later were she began oversing so much that it made me wanna break the radio. As for the material on this album. The album is dated and there are only few stand out tracks on this. The singels are probably the best songs on this album. Whitney is a talented woman ( or was, she needs profesional help now) and it is sometimes sad to see that she never made a great album like Aretha who always made brilliant albums. 6/10.
B00003CXQY|5.0|Disney must not have had their collective claws too deep into the creative process of this flick, cause The Emperor's New Groove is so funny that David Lo Pan forgot about his fetish for green-eyed babes.  Wow.  It's not Spade or Goodman or whoever plays Kronk that's responsible for this epic work, it's just the animators and the writers.  Double Wow.  Everything from the sadistic squirrel to Kronk's guttural noises while pouring poisoned wine to Izma's belly-botton-level bosom is classic, sheer classic.<br />That squirrel is hiding some kind of revelatory cinematic secret, the kinds that are evident in the \\"Indeed!\\" sequence from Capenter's Big Trouble in Little China and the Lamp Dance Trip Out from Raimi's Evil Dead II.  Note that the squirrel looks into the camera FOR ONE FRAME just as the camera begins to pull back and just before he finishes his balloon llama.  He is sadistic and strangely omniscient.  And he knows I am telling you his secrets.<br />I must flee.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|How you relate to this film probably depends on your proximity to California, judging by the ten minutes of space cadet commentary I listened to in order to find out what on earth happened at the end of this DVD (still none the wiser.) The afore-mentioned state is either airhead central or the Zen capitol of the world (nay universe) but I'm keeping mum. Despite the fact she never cooks.<br />Kudos to the producers for fooling me into thinking this was a big budget disaster, rather than a small budget one. Down to the photography, I guess.
B000068MFS|5.0|I am NOT a hopeless romantic and I generally stay away from romanc-ey, \\"chick-flick\\" type films. But this one was entirely well done, with wonderful screen-play, directing, and acting. Of course, the outcome is easily predicatable (they get together) but the film held my interest so much that the predictability aspect was easily suspended.  In short, this film touched my soul, was thoroughly entertaining, and caused me to ponder fate more closely - long after the film was over.
0790731479|1.0|Embarrassing comedy that comes over like a child with 'attention deficit disorder' begging for your approval. Even the film's own internal logic is thrown away towards the end to no extra purpose. The girl floating in the air at the end is rather sweet though.
B00008S2VG|4.0|If you're looking for another song like \\"Music\\", \\"Ray of Light\\", or \\"Don't Tell me\\" look elsewhere. <br />At first listen, this album didn't do much for me. But as I always do, I listen to an album multiple times before passing judgement. <br />Acoustic guitars are dominant in this album and since Mirwais is back at the helm of production, there is more of his sound here. Lyrically it has a great message: \\"Life is not what is seems and there's more to life than selfish pleasure.\\" Coming from Madonna this is quite a revelation. The music is very interesting. I find that I have to listen to the album a whole, because it's an actual album with no fillers. Of course some radio hits would be great but that's not what Madonna wanted. I think for the first time, she wanted her message to take center state instead of the music. The music and lyrics work well here. <br />Many Madonna fan will pass on this, as seen by the most recent chart position of AMERICAN LIFE (tumbling from #1 to # 8 on the U.S. charts in only it's second week). Radio today is mostly trash which is why this album won't do well. Times have changed and so has Madonna. Madonna should breathe a sigh of relief not being welcomed as much in that medium. <br />Stand out tracks are: Love Profusion, Easy Ride, X-Tatic Process and American Life as well as others. Good Job.
B00008VGK0|5.0|This is the remixes for Madonna's newest single \\"American Life\\" and  it vastly improves on the original version. The mixes range from hip hop to trance/electronica to flat out house music. The best mixes of the song are by Missy Elliott,Paul Oakenfold and Part 2 of the Peter Rauhofer American Anthem mix. The Missy Elliott American Dream mix(4:49) is typical Missy and that is saying a lot becuase she is so much a genius. The Paul Oakenfold Downtempo mix(6:32) is the best mix here. It gives Madonna the chance like \\"Justify My Love\\" and  \\"Erotica\\" to get more r&b/rap influenced than normally done. It is very different from his normal type of mix but it works. The Felix Da Housecat Devin Dazzle Mix(6:10) is crap. It tries to move the vocals to a more upbeat type flow and makes her sound weird. The Peter Rauhofer part 1 American Anthem mix(10:41) is electro and does the same vocally as the Felix Da Housecat Mix with a tad better results. His part 2 Mix(9:06) is what will take this song to number one on the club charts. The vocals are at normal speed and she sounds aggressive. The weird thing though is that the original mix -the rap sounds out of place but on the remixes they are to me the highlight--weird ! Then you get the new mix by Richard Humpty Vission of \\"Die Another Day\\"(6:01) that takes the Bond theme into more electro type vibe. That said this is Madonna and is you love her or hate her this cd single is a good feel for what not only Madonna wants to do(She gets final say over all mixes done) but also what is the state of Club music in 2003.
B000002JS6|5.0|This CD is great.  I bought this CD with the belief that AC/DC had only three good songs (Back in Black, You Shook Me All Night Long, and Highway to Hell), but now, after listening to this CD, that's changed.  There are numerable memorable songs, and parts of songs, notably the intro to Hell's Bells, such a great intro to a pretty good song.  Others end up having a huge impact, Shoot to Thrill is a playbook 80's rock song, that turns out great through the screaming of the lead singer and Young's electrifying guitars.  Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution is a relatively simple song that manages to be great.  All the songs have good lyrics if you can decypher them, and the digital remastering really shows.  When I first previewed this new CD before buying it, I noticed right away the difference in You Shook Me All Night Long.  The intro has new depth I could never hear.  If you like this sort of music, this is a must buy, along with AC/DCs other great albums.
B00005JLEU|4.0|One-sentence description : a children's movie pumped with mythical steroids and top-rate animation. <br />From the king of animation, Hayao Miyazaki, comes this wonderful movie based around the story of a girl lost in a strange world of spirits. As she tries to save her parents from a terrible curse, she must work at the bathhouse of the spirits. She must befriend the odd spirits around her, and regain her identity, in order to be able to break the curse and leave. <br />While it follows the standard plot of children's movies (child must fend for him/herself in a strange world and befriend allies in order to achieve success), Spirited Away is about as far as you can get from a normal children's movie. It has haunting characters, a profound story, incredible animation and music, and Miyazaki's imagination and sense of how children feel is really set loose here. <br />The American version only has english dialogue, but since this is an animation, and Disney did the dubbing, there is little to complain about here. If you have a child and/or any sense of wonder at all, go see this movie : if you don't, I'm afraid you have more problems than I can help.
0316096199|5.0|I finished reading Alice Sebold's memoir \\"Lucky\\" last week on the recommendation of a friend. Alice has a great writing style that pulls you in from page one and creates a sense that you're there with her. She very articulatly explains her thoughts and story and leaves no questions left unanswered. I highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially survivors of rape or their family and friends. Alice Sebold is an amazing woman.

The young boy can share his worry and anxiety over his baby sister's serious illness through his interactions with the \\"creature\\" he finds in the garage.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I received this CD for my birthday and for the last month it has been the only one I have listened to.  Christina Aguilera has always been a fenomenal singer but this last album takes the cake.  Her voice is that of true beauty.  Her dynamics are fantastic and her voice is strong throught her songs.  Each and every song on the album has a different style and a lot of them have a truly deep and inspiring meaning.  Christina's outward appearance may be a little on the wild side, but why do we buy CD's anyway?  To look at the pictures?  No, we buy them because we enjoy the music and that is all that should count.  So don't be fooled by the cover of \\"Stripped\\" because the songs inside of that case are ones you will never get tired of.
0385504209|2.0|As an employee of one of the major chains, I had access to a preview copy of the book.  We were encouraged to handsell this book, so I thought I should read it.  I don't think I've been so disappointed in a book since \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\".<br />The writing style is mediocre at best.  At first I liked the short chapters that intercut between characters so that you feel you are reading the story in real time.  But this device became very tedious when a character, usually Sophie or Langdon, would go into long reveries about some detail in the past.<br />The plot device of following the clues wears thin rather quickly.  It becomes a cross between a roller coater ride & a scavenger hunt.<br />The anti-Catholic tone is strident & ridiculous.  Throughout the book we are led to believe that the Vatican (is the Vatican a person now?) is behind the conspiracy or involved in some way. Then Brown just drops the insinuation.  Vatican motives were not so evil after all.<br />I was willing to go along with the parts set in France, but when the scene moves to Britain, I began to notice the little niggling errors about places I have been.  The author describes people as \\"grave-rubbing\\" in Westminster Abbey.  The proper temr is brass-rubbing and it has been a very long time since anyone was permitted to do brass rubbings in the Abbey. This indicates that Mr Brown may not have done as much research as he should have.<br />Dan Brown chooses the most outlandish of interpretations and then presents them as facts.  This leads to wild deductions.<br />The characters are flat and cartoonish.  Am I the only reader who thinks he was a bit hard on the French police?<br />The only reason I give it two stars is because it kept my attention half way through the book.  I had to force myself to finish it.  I read Patterson's \\"The Jester\\" in the same month.  It may be a while before I can force myself to read another hyped thriller.<br />If you want to read this kind of thriller, Arturo Perez-Reverte is much better at it.  Try \\"The Flanders Panel\\", an amazing book that will not disappoint.is much better at it.  Try \\"The Flanders Panel\\", an amazing book that will not disappoint.
B000008DKG|4.0|There are guitars here that sound like U2 in Joshua Tree four years before U2 started sounding like that. There are songs here that rival Tears for Fears before that band became a band. I contend that in a deep undergroud somewhere and sometime in the early '80s, blokes from other bands got together, heard some songs off Walk Across the Rooftops, figured out which ones they could copy to make a career; then executed their plan. Almost every song on this CD is different and begins with a random modern art type song that seems fragmented, but integrates beautifully and keeps your interest. The second song is the one that sounds like Tears for Fears. It is so well done you'll want to play it over and over. This is not experimental music; it is art uniquely conveyed, each song its own entity ranging from pure pop modern art to blues, jazz and rock. If you are student of music, this will surely satisfy your thirst for the unique.
B000059QY3|5.0|First of all let me say that I can't think of anything that is bad about this DVD.  The performance is of a high quality, the production is fairly traditional and enjoyable, the video and sound quality are top notch (although it's not widescreen).  I gave it an extra fifth star for being as complete as it is.  Even Alfredo's second act cabaletta is repeated, when many performances cut the whole thing.  Gheorghiu is very attractive, which is important in this work, I think.  Why would Alfredo fall for a dog?  Lopardo is good and without as much of the tendency to sharp notes as I have heard from his other recordings and live performances.  Nucci is up to his usual standard, and if you like his timbre (somewhat on the nasal side) you will enjoy his portrayal.  Solti's conducting is solid.  A thouroughly enjoyable set.  I sold my CD set taken from these performances to get the DVD.  Totally worth it.

B00003CXE7|5.0|Ridley Scott did a great job casting Russell Crowe in this lushly scored and shot epic about a Roman General who is spurned by his childhood friend and captured as a slave.  The character is wonderfuly developed and a great pleasure to watch.  As far as family friendly this would be best enjoyed by families with older children.  Some of the scenes would be far to violent for little eyes.
B00008AY3L|5.0|This album gets five stars simply for having 'Picture of Jesus'. I am really impressed with where Ben Harper is going with his craft and music. He stays ever true to his roots of weaving beautifully simple and riveting songs.  His music really takes hold of me. It's like drinking from a cup of what's really in someone's heart. He really puts himself out there. Ben Harper's music will be around for a long time, and will be well remembered like other song writer's of his mold, Cat Stevens, James Taylor, Bob Marley, Paul Simon. He does it just as they did it, in his own unique way.  Check it out.If You like songs like &quot;Burn One down&quot;, &quot;Excuse me Mr.&quot; and &quot;Waiting for an Angel&quot; then you love this one. It's a good mix and I will enjoy all summer long, burning with me in the Sun.

What I appreciate most about this album is its fluid diversion from mainstream [stuff] - which they do a good job in condemning throughout - and the realisation that yes, it is still possible in this day and age to produce GOOD music that sounds \\"unique\\". Shame it couldn't endure the entire course of the album where it lulls a little from the middle.<br /> In short, it's a beautiful thorny peach of an album against a backdrop of pure pink, contrived, commercial [stuff]! It's tough going back to yer Blink 182s, Linkin' Parks, Sum 41s et al, without feeling a shudder down the spine. <br /> Great... but not quite as great as The Gechoes.
B00003CXD0|5.0|In 1982, Dustin Hoffman played one of his most memorable roles as Michael Dorsey in the hilarious comedy, \\"Tootsie\\".  As an out-of-work actor, Michael teaches acting classes because no director will hire him due to his somewhat peremptory attitude, or so says his agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack, who also directed the film).  Frustrated with being undesirable and wanting to prove himself, Michael dons a dress and high heels so that he can apply for a female role in a television soap opera.  Calling himself Dorothy Michaels, the soap opera director, Ron (Dabney Coleman), thinks that Dorothy is too ugly for the part, but Dorothy's dominance earns 'her' the right to a screen test and 'she' gets hired!  As the film progresses, Michael's pretense as a woman earns him the stardom and recognition that he longed for.  However, it also gets him into trouble not only with a woman that he's dating, Sandy (Teri Garr), but also with two of the regular stars from the soap opera, Julie (Jessica Lange) and John Van Horn (George Gaynes). <br />With an excellent script, superb acting and a hilarious story, it was completely unsurprising that \\"Tootsie\\" earned 10 Oscar nominations, including nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (Syndey Pollack), Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay.  Dustin Hoffman was nominated for Best Actor and both Teri Garr and Jessica Lange were nominated for Best Supporting Actress.  Of all the Oscar nominations, only Jessica Lange won the Oscar.  Dustin Hoffman won the Golden Globe for Best Actor, as did Jessica Lange for Best Supporting Actress.  The number of Oscar nominations that the film earned demonstrated the many strengths of the film, not to mention that the film will keep you laughing and fully engaged!<br />Other very memorable characters in the film include Julie's father Les (Charles Durning), Michael's roommate Jeff (Bill Murray), soap opera producer Rita (Doris Belack) and soap opera nurse April (a young Geena Davis).<br />If you enjoy films such as \\"Some Like It Hot\\" (1959) and \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\" (1993), you will more than likely enjoy \\"Tootsie\\" equally as well.  I rate \\"Tootsie\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and am very pleased to own it on DVD.
B00003CWN3|5.0|\\"Boys Don't Cry\\" has been cited for two major Academy Award nominations:  Chloe Sevigny for Best Supporting Actress and Hilary Swank for Best Actress.  The film is based on a multiple murder that occurred in a run down Nebraska farmhouse in 1993.  What appeared at the time to be an inexplicably brutal killing soon turned into something far more intriguing as the true story of the killers and one of the victims emerged.  Among the dead was a person who had been in town only a short while but had already become one of the town's most fascinating characters:  a rebel, a loyal friend, and an irresistible romancer of the ladies.<br /><br />That person was Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), not the boy he and everyone else wanted him to be.  Knowing him as a dashing boyfriend to many women, people were shocked to learn after his death that Brandon Teena was, in fact, a woman from Lincoln, Nebraska, named Teena Brandon.  While Teena was a young adult trapped in a world that did not accept her, Brandon Teena was a fun-loving fellow with beautiful girlfriends who publicly adored him.<br /><br />\\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is one of those bizarre true stories that cannot help but fascinate and intrigue.  For the film to succeed, the role of Teena as Brandon must be convincing.  If everyone who knew Brandon believed that she was a he, the audience has to be convinced as well, despite the explicit information given at the very beginning of the film.  Swank accomplishes this through her angular face, close-cropped hair, physical mannerisms, and lilting midwestern drawl. Though the viewer watches carefully to catch a moment in which her femininity comes through, it never does.<br /><br />It is virtually impossible not to be drawn to the film because of Swank's performance, which is captivating. The film is violent, often painfully so, as co-writer/director Kimberly Peirce recounts the odd events surrounding Brandon's ability to endear himself to people -- particularly female -- and to make friends easily.  In the few scenes in which Brandon's true sex is revealed, Swank transforms into an awkward, embarrassed, tense outcast, knowing full well she is perceived as a freak.  Gone is Brandon's winning smile, gone is Brandon's confidence, and gone is the very persona Teena has adopted.<br /><br />\\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is one of those films that simply must be seen.  It is unique among standard Hollywood fare.  Not for the squeamish, it is a look at a dark, unpleasant side of how differences in individuals are not tolerated, society often accepts the expedient lie rather than the difficult truth, and stupidity and bigotry can lead to tragedy.<br /><br />Swank elicits viewer compassion on several levels.  Clearly, she is emotionally troubled, yet has adjusted her persona to fit in and feel comfortable.  Her Brandon can flirt with attractive girls, become friends with them, and even carry the relationship to a sexual level.  In the latter part of the film, she is the object of violence simply because she has successfully fooled those around her -- primarily low-life types whose own sexuality is threatened and whose alcohol-clouded minds inspire them to a \\"payback\\" of humiliating brutality.<br /><br />The script, by Peirce and Andy Bienen, moves along briskly, seldom meandering.  There is no sense of padding, as each scene provides a new dimension to the story.  We learn that Brandon has a police record for petty crimes, but little else about Teena's/Brandon\\"s past is revealed. This gives the film a suitable mystery.  The viewer shares an off-balance feeling with the characters in the film.  The writers based their screenplay on an assortment of trial transcripts, media coverage, interviews with local kids, real-life participants, and their own imagination. The result is an intense look at events in the life of a misfit being the \\"perfect boyfriend\\" to lonely, innocent, and underprivileged young women.<br /><br />Rated R, \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" succeeds primarily because of Swank's unique, often startling performance. It transcends the ordinary and sweeps the viewer up into Brandon Teena's peculiar,<br />tragic life.
038572179X|4.0|This was my first taste Ian McEwan's body of work, and I will definitely be returning for seconds. His description of both scenery and the minutia of human relationships is deliciously rich. His eye for detail gives the reader not only a clear picture of the events being described, but borders on allowing you a window into physically feeling the atmosphere. <br />Now here comes the criticism....I found myself at times wanting the book to move a bit faster, but was also surprised at the abruptness with which it ends. There's a lack of closure on the story and a sense of disappointment that there is no resolution. While that may be the point, seeing as the book is entitled &quot;Atonement,&quot; it still didnt sit comfortably. Perhaps I'm more of a happy ending kind of person...naive as that may be. <br />So, overall....Loved the language and attention to detail, felt the ending dropped off a bit suddenly. Definitely worth a read.
B000089RVX|4.0|and dyed her hair dark colors and wore flowy dark clothes, she would be this bands singer.  Thats not to say that her voice isnt hauntingly beautiful.  The best cuts are when Amy is singing with just the piano- very gripping stuff.  File this CD under the Makeout music.  Or Makeout music for goths.  Gorgeous instrumenting  and a nice mix.  I would not say its one of those &quot;its got a beat and you can dance to it&quot; compilations, but its still a damn good cd.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I know for a fact that this dvd will top the charts over all of Zeps records and live material. I own all of their records and their unreleased songs. It kills me to wait for this movie because i am a diehard Led Zep fan and i play drums to all of their songs (exept Moby Dick, and Bonzos Montreaux). Led Zeppelin can top any band in any era and i know they will top themselves! I have faith and Jimmy you rock when it comes to developing new stuff. Thank you especially for letting my generation enjoy the Zeppelin fever (this is gregs son caleb). Peace out and God bless!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is by far the most best Madonna album.She did alot of work on this album.The tunes are just great. <BR>American Life:very popish-techno beat with really good lyrics.the public is really trashing her rap which i think is stupid.The rap is very serious.Its the most personal part of the song.<BR>Hollywood:a very catchy song.She shows how she is obsessed with thinkin why people think so much of hollywood.A very good song!<BR>Im So Stupid:this song drops a little bit from the trilogy.American life,Hollywood,and Im So Stupid are all one trilogy.But this song really doesnt have such a point.It really is just a part 2 of Hollywood.Not her best work.<BR>Love Profusion: This song is very acoustic.What i think is wrong with it though is that she repeats the lyrics to much and the beat is too 'the same'! But other wise it is a really good song.<BR>Nobody Knows Me: now this song should be released as a single.It is my personal favorite.She does lots of electronic work.Sure the vocoder is used a bit much but it is a cool song.She wrote a very personal club song that reflects on her life .And made it into a technoish pop beat song.Very nice!<BR>Nothing Fails: This is a very very good song.I just love the choir and lyrics.She just let her vocals out there.This song makes me just wanna be in a room by myself and just sing to the top of my lungs.I luv it absolutely!<BR>Intervention: this song is like another Im So Stupid. A lack of lyrics and the beat is not Madonna.She needs more funk in that song.<BR>X-static Process: A mid tempo song that is about another part of her life.Well actually its about her whole life until now.She shows how she has evolved and lived her life.I think it could be better but itz still a good song!<BR>Mother&Father: this song made me realize how people can turn out to be without their mother or father there.itz very personal and i can see other people relate to it.Its a very good song and it shows alot of hurt Madonna has been through.<BR>Die Another Day: The song that makes me dance and shout.I absolutely love it.It was named worst bond theme song.That is not true.Itz the best bond song.Very techno and lots of the vocoder.I like it alot because the movie is totally reflected to it.Usually artists make a video that doesnt even reflect to the movie that the song is related to.So this song has 5 stars in my judging!<BR>Easy Ride: a very country type song.she didnt have much to give on this song.But itz still great . It takes a sec to get into.<br />Once again Madonna made the best album.Everytime she makes an album it just gets better and better.Dont believe what people say.Buy the album itz garuanteed the best of her work..!
B00008NG5V|5.0|This CD is truly amazing. I am a big fan of Jack's debut release, Brushfire Fairytales. Yet his new CD, On and On, knocks it out of the water. The mellow &quot;surfer style&quot; music soothes the mind. Jack's style of folk blended with a splash reggae is unique. Of special note are &quot;times like these (track 1)&quot;, &quot;Taylor (track 4)&quot;, and &quot;wasting time (track 11).&quot; No matter what your taste in music, the lifestyle you lead, buy this CD and you WILL NOT be disappointed.
B00003CX5A|5.0|SLEEPY HOLLOW  (1999), starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, and Jeffrey Jones, combines horror, suspense, and comedy brilliantly.  This is a loosely adapted version of Washington Irving's &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.&quot;  Depp plays a bumbling constable who relies upon the latest scientific methods to figure out who is responsible for a series of beheadings in New York's Hudson valley.  Directed by Tim Burton, the film looks terrific with exquisite sets and evocative cinematography.  If Burton takes liberties with the Irving classic, he succeeds in creating a superior black comedy with his distinctive trademark.  And look for a surprise cameo in the role of the Headless Horseman.
0345404475|5.0|Most people at this stage have seen Blade Runner the excellent film adaptation of this book.  But it is important to remember that the movie is an adaptation, one which explores certain themes within the book.  But it does not explore all the issues raised in the book, and it is only one interpretation.<br />The book explores a number of important and universal themes.  One is the theme of love and care and empathy.  It contrasts the attitudes of various individuals in terms of how much they can love or empathise with other creatures.  Why is an electric sheep less deserving of love than a real one?  Why are androids less deserving of love than people?  Why do we objectivise some beings and empathise with others?  What does our love for other people or animals say about us as people?<br />Dick sharply contrasts the empathy of humans with the coldness of androids in the spider leg incident.  This scene is powerful and disturbing.<br />The book delves into the area of social status, as evinced by animal ownership.  Deckard is prepared to beggar himself to have a large animal.  Size matters, it is a statement of self worth, but in Dicks world it goes even further than this.  Animal ownership is equated with humanity.  To own an animal and care for it is not only a statement of career success, it is a statement of personal worth as an individual.<br />The book also explores themes such as intellectual discrimination (Chickenheads), future slavery and rights of synthetic life forms, spirituality and religion.  The interlacing of spiritual aspects into this book is done extremely well.  The appearance of Mercer and his interaction with the real world does not jar at all.  It is well handled by phasing in the spirituality at a time of extreme psychological stress.<br />All in all this is an intelligent and thoughtful book.  Dont think you know the story because you saw the film.  There is much more in here than ever made it onto the screen.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Well, I could review this movie, but odds are you've probably seen or at least know what the Python crew is capable of.  As for this DVD, the special features are both insightful and hilarious.  The commentary and the featurette of them returning to the differant shooting locations is really interesting.  While the Uses for coconuts featurette and the segments of the film as it was shown in other countries(subtitled) are just plain funny.  But my personal favorite is definately  The Holy Grail in LEGO(yes they have LEGO knights performing &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot;), I wish they had done a whole version of the film that way.<br />This DVD is a definate must have.  You won't be able to stop laughing.
B00006X06U|5.0|I believe you have to agree that Joni has had *some* kind of impact on every music listener through the years, some more profound than others. After having the honor to listen to this album for about three weeks, in my opinion, this is truly a &quot;Travelogue&quot; of her works.  I was hesitant at first to purchase this wonderous album due to the fact I understood an orchestra (horrors!?) was throughout this album.  But-- what a misconception and what an album.  Being a child of the 60s and hearing her *very* early materials, many of which I continue to listen to reguarly, this, in my opinion, has got to be a crowning work for her!  Of course, each song is unique in its &quot;new&quot; interpretation, and we will all will have our favorites. To me, &quot;Amelia&quot; is unbelievable. So beautiful.<BR>Frankly, others who hear me playing Travelogue go out and buy the album.  It simply grows on you. What else can you say, other than &quot;Thank you Joni!&quot;
B00004YW6I|5.0|This album is so dissimilar to Is This Desire? (another wonderful album) - if it weren't for PJ Harvey's voice, a person might not even recognize this music as being hers: it's fast, loud, even a little upbeat.  It is also awesome - it's catchy and just plain good Rock.  Thom Yorke sings quite a bit on this record, and sings most of &quot;This Mess We're In&quot; (also a good song).<br />I was kind of expecting to be put off by this drastic change in Harvey's style of music, but I loved it immediately while listening to it.  It's strange that this change of pace is also one of her best albums.  Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea isn't lacking in quieter moments - &quot;Beautiful Feeling,&quot; &quot;Horses in My Dreams&quot; and &quot;We Float&quot; provide those - and those last two songs are beautiful.  Other great songs on this album: &quot;Big Exit,&quot; &quot;Good Fortune,&quot; &quot;A Place Called Home,&quot; &quot;One Line,&quot; &quot;Kamikaze&quot; and &quot;This is Love.&quot;
B000002UB3|5.0|Many reviewers were obviously not around when the Beatles were.  I was.  OK, that only makes me middle-aged, but you gotta know that nothing NOTHING compares today to the thrill of that era.  <br />Gotta disagree with one reviewer: the Beatles were indeed great writers and musicians.  Hemmingway didn't write like Shakespeare and Picasso didn't paint like Monet who didn't paint like Caravaggio.  Hey, the Beatles were to Modern popular culture what Picasso was.  They were the true Modernists; listen to the Dadaist mind-expanding music on the new Yellow Submarine reissue.  Get really close to the music man.  Nah, you young folk don't understand the influences.  You take everything around you for granted.  Get real man; listen to Sgt. Pepper's and remember that this was made before you were in diapers.  No disrespect meant.  Honestly.  Turn on man.  These guys were a real revolution.  Don't pay mind to those uniformed critics.  They have no idea of the old world (pre-Beatles).  Peace and Love and Hare Krsna!!
0385504209|5.0|Growing up in church you are taught one story of Jesus.  Reading this book challenges that story and stretches your mind.  Even if you disagree with the premise, you have to admire the writing style and genius of the plot.  I would hope that Christians can not be threatened by the premise (see \\"Subliterate heresy\\"), but rather enjoy Mr. Brown's exceptional story telling ability and leave the religious aspects of the book for lively discussions with friends and family - of which their should be many!
B00008NG5V|5.0|This cd is all around great! If you've listened to his first album-Brushfire Fairytales, then you'll love On and On. They have pretty much the same kind of vibe. The album has multiple moods ranging from a little slow to some mellow reggae sounding tunes. It's a great cd for anyone who is a Jack Johnson fan.
B00008DDXC|4.0|THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is both better and worse than the original SORCERER'S STONE--better, for the young leads are more accomplished and the script need not spend time introducing us to the basic premise, and worse, for the story is not as tight or as cinematically interesting.  But the pros and cons balance out; when it comes to pure entertainment, the film is hard to beat.<br />In this particular installment, youthful wizard Harry Potter prepares for a return to Hogwarts for his second year--but is unexpectedly visited by an elf, who mysteriously warns Harry that an evil plot to destroy both him and the school are underway.  Harry is not put off, but once he is reunited with his friends at Hogwarts they confront a strange series of petrifications as various members of the student body--not to mention the ghostly Nearly Headless Nick and the diabolical Mr. Crabbe's malicious cat--are found turned to stone!<br />As in the original, the emphasis here is on bringing J.K. Rowland's detail to the screen, and by and large director Chris Columbus and his special effects staff are very successful: the flying car, the whomping willow, the spiders of the dark wood, and the deadly creature that has escaped from the Chamber of Secrets are all well visualized.  As noted earlier, the three juvenile leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) are much smoother in their performances, and they are solidly backed by a host of returning cast members including the late Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and Maggie Smith--and particularly sinister performances by Tom Feltman as Draco Malfoy and Jason Isaacs as Draco's truly evil father Lucius.<br />It's all a tremendous amount of fun, and I recommend it.  I do have to add a caution, however: if their children are very young or particularly fearful, parents may want to prescreen this one, for there are several scenes that might unnerve some children.  Like the original, the DVD is presented in a double disk set, with the film on disk one and numerous extras on disk two; this time around, however, the DVD producers have had the good sense not to make the entertaining extras (some of which require a computer system) so difficult to access.  Most kids and parents will love it.  Have fun!<br />--GFT (Amazon reviewer)--disk one and numerous extras on disk two; this time around, however, the DVD producers have had the good sense not to make the entertaining extras (some of which require a computer system) so difficult to access.

B00005V9HA|5.0|Rarely do great 80's horror movies get the DVD treatment they deserve. Sice the assumption that the market is limited, you can often only find mediocre transfers with little to no extras. But with &quot;Re-Animator&quot;, that paradigm is broken and we get a top quality and thoroughly entertaining version of the cult classic.<br />Stuart Gordon's gore-fest concerns a medical student named Herbert West, who's experiments with bringing the dead back to life are successful, but with grave consequences. Jeffrey Combs is first rate as the whacked out West, and he plays it both for shock and comedy value. It is criminal that he isn't more widely recognized outside of the horror and cult circles. The rest of the cast is exceptional, especially Robert Sampson as the re-animated headmaster. The special effects can best be described as gruesome, with plenty of decapitations, body parts flying, and other nasties. But what sets &quot;Re-Animator&quot; apart from other 80's  horror flicks is the story, the good acting, and the good production. This is a great movie that satisfies both the need for quality filmmaking and the need for gore.<br />The Millenium Edition DVD is packed with extras, all of them worthwhile. What initially pleased me most was the quality of the transfer, which makes the horrible VHS transfers seem like a different movie. The commentary, especially by the producer and the cast, is more like a high school reunion with everyone having a good time. The interviews also give valueable insight, and the deleted scenes are also nice goodies for fans.<br />This is the definative version of &quot;Re-Animator&quot;, and great value for anyone who loved the movie. The extras are quality, and the transfer is superb. In short, a DVD you must own (assuming you can stomach it).
B000002HPV|5.0|This CD is very enjoyable, although very dark.  As told in the Editorial Review, at this time in her career, there were a lot of things going on for her.  Fights, Break-Ups and such.  It shows here.  Her voice is now more competent and a little less all over the place.  There is an aire of sadness and upset.  Yet and still this is a genius album. there is a lot of great music to enjoy here.
B0000024SD|5.0|This is what happens when music is treated with the correct amount of honesty and playfullness. Dylan creates a record that is critic proof. You could try to rip it to shreads and point out flaws but you sure as hell aren't going to change a fans opinion. The songs on here can't be imitated by anyone because no one has it in them. Who could possibly create a song equal to &quot;it's alright ma (im only bleeding)&quot;, a song where everyline could be quoted and still holds up today. I dont know though its tough to give a legendary album a review because you have to start using cliches like perfect and amazeing and wonderful to the point where it would start sounding like an acceptance speech. But its just a perfect gateway into dylan if youve never heard him before because these songs are accessible. If you hate it because of his voice then you should just give up on music completly because its an honest voice and a sneeringly delicate one at that.All roads Lead to Dylan.
B000002LCB|5.0|The soundtrack is an integral part of a movie. Music helps intensify and brighten images and action that take place upon the screen. Many times purchasing the soundtrack turns into a disappointment because no connection was made between the music on the soundtrack and the movie. That is definitely not the case with Mark Knopfler's musical score for \\"The Princess Bride\\". Knopfler, as a composer, has an incredible knack of capturing images in his music. <br />The music in the movie is barely noticeable. It doesn't detract from the movie at all. You won't notice how much of an impact that it does have until you hear the music on its own without the movie playing over it. If you have seen the movie only once, the songs on this soundtrack will conjure the images from the movie. You can almost hear Fezzik and Inigo exchanging rhymes on \\"The Friend's Song\\", and the daring climb on \\"The Cliffs of Insanity\\". <br />As you listen to the soundtrack, you'll be seeing the movie in your mind. There are few soundtracks that are so intertwined with the movie that they can elicit such imagery. Knopfler is able to pull off that feat. If you liked the movie, the soundtrack is definitely worth it.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Likening Interpol to Joy Divison has become one of the laziest criticisms of a band I've heard in years. It's really only accurate on the surface; they might wear the same clothes and use the same reverb, but Turn On The Bright Lights is leagues better than much of the over-revered and pretentious JD/Cure/Smiths canon. (I'm setting myself up for pain here aren't I?) Paul Banks' voice is passionate yet controlled where Ian Curtis seemed merely detached and affected. True, no new ground is broken on this album, but this kind of rock has not been done so well in a while. If I would compare it to anything it would be early U2 or Mission Of Burma or the punkier side of '80s &quot;post-punk&quot;; before you vehemently disagree I am referring more to the songwriting than the sonics and production, which do owe an obvious debt to Joy Division. Anyway, this is one of my favourite albums of 2002: dark, wistful, driving, emotional and soaring.
B000002UAO|1.0|Rubber Soul marks the beginning of the Beatles' transition from the greatest rock n' roll band of the time to a pop band.<br />While their older songs like A Hard Day's Night, Can't Buy Me Love, She Loves You, Day Tripper and I Feel Fine were great songs with rock roots, the orchestral boring tracks such as Michelle, Girl, and In My Life found on Rubber Soul took the Beatles down the road of pop rather than rock.  As a result, we had to stand the release of albums like Revolver (Eleanor Rigby), Sgt. Pepper (When I'm 64), and Mystery Tour (Penny Lane)before the group even began to return to rock with the White Album.  These weren't exactly rock songs.<br />Rubber Soul is O.K., but not great.  Relative to the early Beatles' work, it's merely adequate.
B00005U2LM|5.0|Dis album is off da hook!  Returnin' to dey original Wu-warrin', Shaolin, funky-azz kung-fu shiz.  The Wu iz back!  Da clan comes back in a cohesive fusion, like a musical metaphor of da original 36 Chambers yo.  Dis IZ a return to da Chambers, dis IZ what Wu should be.  And, don't let no Atlanta native tell you dis ain't raw, know wut I'm sayin', sayin'?<br />Meth, Gza, Deck, Killah get da real air time, droppin' what iz da best battlin' flow.  Rza's on point, samplin' da Fu flix and mixin' obscure, hypnotic cuts into a maniacal blend of sonic assault.  ...  May da Staten island crew reign champion again.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Steer clear of equillibrium if you are looking for an intelligentsci-fi action movie, but if you're looking for something in the style of devil-may-cry type gun fighting put to live action, this is it. <br />Equillibrium suffers from plot holes and at times puzzling logic, but with unbelieveably awesome fight scenes. The fights however are few and far between, and really leave you wanting to see a great deal more.<br />If you really dig gun fights and matrix style action, this movie is definatley worth seeing.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This cd was just as good as his first attempt at a studio recording. As always musicans like this are better live, so go see him if you ever get the chance. Buy this cd if you have never heard Jack because this one might be better than the first. Song #4 Taylor was my fav... so buy it... you won't regret it.
B000002U82|3.0|Truthfully everyone, Dark Side of the Moon is NOT the best album ever made. It isn't even a concept album which everyone keeps on saying it is. It's a very good album with some great classic songs on it like Time and of course the climactic finish of Brain Damage and Eclipse, but overall the album is more addicting than great. I tend to enjoy The Wall a heck of a lot more and The Rolling Stones' Let It Bleed totally blows this one out of the water. Even Elton John's Madman across the Water is a better overall album than Dark Side. I've only owned it since April 9th, okay? And even though I have grown to love it more and more with each repeated listen, frankly this is still by far one of the most overrated albums I have ever heard but still is worth owning. And by the way, I strongly believe that The Wall is a concept album, but this one definitely is not. Sure the songs sorta bleed into one another, but no story is being told at all. It's just a collection of songs that don't really go together at all. I'd really like to know what story it tells and what the songs have to do with each other as a whole, because I for one can't figure it out. And again, this album is NOT the greatest album ever made--not even close--but is still highly enjoyable for what it is.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I must admit I awaited this release with some trepidation.... Pump Up The Valuum was somewhat lacklustre and Slatfats prior to that indicated a downslide in the quality of NOFX music - stale Ryan Greene production and a general fallout from the success of Punk In Drublic and the crossover of Heavy Petting Zoo.<br />However this is a remarkable release, pobably the most intereting musically since Heavy Petting Zoo and lyrically the most incisive since Punk In Drublic, couple that with the pace of Ribbed and at a push the occasional wry humour of White Trash....<br />Best tracks the scathing 'Irrationality Of Rationality' (a short accompaniment to the somewhat sprawling 'The Decline' and the twisted humour of 'She's Nubs' (with a similar feel but much faster - like a sister to Thank God Its Monday) and my personal favourite 'Now We've Got Two Jealous Agains' which is fair comment on the state of punk in 2003.<br />Well worth shelling out for and for those who abandoned the band back in 1995 be prepared to have all faith healed!  Theyre back on form - enjoy!
B00008DDXB|5.0|This Harry Potter movie is great!  My nephew loves it and he is 4!  He is not scared by the basilisk or the spiders, it is not a scary movie at all.  It goes along with the book pretty good.  If you haven't watched it yet then you must!  You won't be dissappointed, I promise!
B00008WG3U|1.0|If your a conservative, like I am, I suggest you stay clear away from this album. ...The cd has a couple music videos and a documentary on Bush...The cd has fast punk songs like they always do ...

B00008NG5V|5.0|If you like to chill by the beach (or in your front yard :)  ) and have drink, On and On is for you.  I loved it because it has revamps of older songs not released with Brushfire Fairytales.  Great disc!

6305308659|4.0|The tenets of 50s American sitcom mores, values, dress codes and the one-dimensional characters which symbolise and exemplify the socio/economic/political superstructure of 50's America with all their staid, repressed and reserved traits, are thoughtfully meditated on in this film, and contrasted with the tenets of more contemporary sitcoms. The film could be accused of obvious, linear plotting, leading to a woefully sacharine and 'manufactured' resolution, the characters ending up as nothing but vacuously machinated symbolic entities being conrolled by an aloof director. I beg to differ, however. Witherspoon and Maguire's characters represent the fresher faces of t.v. shows, like Beverly Hills 90210, etc etc. They, as with their sepia toned counterparts, are not meant to represent 'real' people 'sucked' through a television tube, but charcaters designed and conceptualised as they would be for a modern prime-time television show. This is the film's genius; as we all know, one of the tenets of any easily digestable sitcom, modern or archaic, is the proverbial happy ending. The Resoultion MUST bring the narrative and individual character arcs to their conclusion. If the ending to 'PLeasantiville' seems a little tough to take, it should be useful to remember hat the pandora's shmorgasboard (mixing metaphors, sorry) opened up must be neatly finished off within the context of the framing narrative and the core narrative. If one observes carefully, the ending is actually surprisingly ambiguous, and fulfills the ends required for it's status as a feature film as opposed to a television series. The FILM, as a function of its very nature, contains a wonderfully postmodern twist (the film's 'text' referring back to the obvious as well as the oblique process' of another set of general texts i.e. t.v sitcom 'texts' of the 50's and late 90's) from the television's medium's older sibling, quite a 'check mate', by way of the (implied) writer/director, of course.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I had heard about this show and I didn't have HBO so when this set came out I bought it and watched it ....WOW....it's so funny and real...I would highly recommend this set and well as the others in the series!<br />This tape introduces you to the ladies and their lives....And Big...of course....It's a great start to a wonderful series....I just wish it would have been a little longer....I would have loved to see more but then there is always season two!
B000066I6N|5.0|This by far is Percy's best work since Principle Of Moments. This CD is so beautiful, full of musical range, with Plant's little moans and ahhhhhh's. From covering Tim Rose to Dylan, Robert made it work with the passion he has carried since his first gig with Zeppelin. 'Funny In My Mind' begins the album rather uptempo but very precise. My personal favorite, 'Darkness Darkness' is flat out sultry. this song will light a fire under ya and at 7 and a half minutes the listener will just beg for more. Robert's band is fantastic, very tight and experienced. This is a must have for any Plant or Zeppelin collector.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Back in November 2002, I managed to catch Jack at DC's tiny 9:30 Club for a performance that blew the crowd away song by song by song -- even with new and unfamiliar material that Jack tested on the audience. Now, that new stuff comes to life with the release of &quot;On and On,&quot; -- a smooth and groovin' follow up to the stunning (and word-of-mouth gathering) &quot;Brushfire Fairytales.&quot; For an artist whose second album is almost as good as his first (but not quite), Jack Johnson is well on the way to becoming one of the music pioneers of this young century. Boosted by an addictive groove that sets a &quot;dance if you want to&quot; tempo, &quot;On and On&quot; will likely go down as one of the finest albums of 2003. The most compelling part of the story is that Johnson is so early in his music career that it begs the question: What's next?
B00008NG5V|5.0|So, i pre-ordered this album from the jack johnson website, and got it early last week, and i have been listening to it constantly since. today it finally comes out everywhere, and it is great. Great mellow songs, and four songs never heard before. if you have heard live shows, a few of those songs show up here, but it is cool to hear a studio version of those new songs, and they all have new spins on them. Cookie Jar is amazing, and Mediocre Bad guys is amazing as well. Go buy this album, you really won't be dissapointed. It is just as good if not better then BFFT and you'll be stoked on the artwork as well. Great, great album. best one this year.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I love the Harry Potter series, both the books and the movies. But I can't say that I rate Chamber of Secrets as highly as I did Sorcerer's Stone.<br />Why?<br />Quite frankly, the movie is a marvelous fairy tale to watch, with the action scenes (the duels are excellent!) and some of the key points displayed quite perfectly and loyally to the book. Yet is is lacking what really sucked me in and captivated me about the books. It's lacking the underlying themes, the hints, the layer of friendships and subplots that grow with importance as the books go on. I especially missed the character-development for Ginny who, even though she hardly appears in the book or movie, is fantastically important to the plot. (And yes, I am likely biased, as Ginny is my favorite character.)<br />Good points: Excellent effects, true to the book, covers the major plot points by and large. A good adaption for a movie from a book, and with what they could work with. Moaning Myrtle was particularly well done, as were the excellent duels.  <br />Bad points: Missing the character development and major subplots that are so important to the books, so the movie has little depth. <br />Overall, I definitely recommend seeing it. the acting is well done, it's filmed well, and it's one action shot after another, with good jokes and plenty of the magic of the first. but don't go into it expecting the same depth that was in the first movie. It's just not there, and what makes the books so magical is the subplots that wind through it, tying it all together. Movie adaptions will almost always leave you disappointed in this regard.<br />But if you're a fan of the books... go see it!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I LOVE John Mayer,I know your all thinking I'm another one of those crazy screaming girls (which I saw a lot of a riverstages this year)But that really is not it at all.I have a fairly high standard for my music and this album meets those standards.It has a great all around sound and groove.Johns sense of humor really shines through in his lyrics.And is not like every other album that has come out the few years.There is something really great about John and his music and I think everyone should give this album a listen.(I also suggest Caleb's Fear of Success)
B00008NG5V|5.0|This is the kind of music that makes me want to sit on the beach with the ocean breeze on my skin and an ice-cold bottle of beer in my hand, yet in addition to being extremely mellow, the lyrics have a social conscience.  &quot;On and On&quot; has a lot to say about materialism, societal complications, violence and shirking responsibility. <BR>Jack Johnson is an excellent writer and musician and I recommend this album to anyone who appreciates the singer/songwriter genre or who just wants a good album to chill to.
B000000993|4.0|This one is probably tool's 2nd best CD.  I'd recommend aenima before you get this one, but this should definitely be next on your list if you don't have it already.  Sober and swamp song are both pretty cool.  All the other stuff is pretty good too, but not as good as some of the songs from aenima.  All in all, it's definitely worth spending money on, so I would definitely recommend this one.
B00005JKCH|5.0|After watching the Superman and Batman movies I was thrilled to see Spiderman brought to the screen. This childhood hero of<BR>mine was brought to life by Stan Lee in the 1960's in comin book form.I started reading about the exploits of Spiderman when I was 12 years old. Now I am 50 and am still a fan. Spiderman(Peter Parker) is well played by Toby Maguire. He plays a social out cast who is bitten by a super spider.He obtains super powers<BR>akin to a spider.He is able to climb walls and obtains superhuman strength.He makes his debut in a wrestling ring by<BR>defeating Randy Savage.He rescues a lovely lady portrayed by<BR>Kirsten Dirst. The newspaper Jameisin looks and acts like the comic book character in the Spiderman comic book series.Another strong role in the movie is the character of the Green Goblin played by William Dafoe.He is the ultimate bad guy. The scenery and the special effects in this movie are beyond compare.The fight scenes between Spiderman and the Green Goblin are spectacular. An outstanding movie that I enjoyed. Buy this and watch it. You will not be dissapointed.
B000003BF1|5.0|Considering the greatest career achievements of music icons like the Stones is often an imposing task. No group has impacted the rock scene quite like these geezers, the Fab Four included. However, the very essence and pinnacle of their greatness can be summarized in four albums: Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main Street. Cases have been made for each of these releases as the Stones' best, and perhaps any of them could rightfully claim that distinction. As for me, the essential Stones album is Let it Bleed. In my opinion, it's the most consistent and enjoyable Stones there is. Every song is a perfect must listen. The breakdown:<br />Gimme Shelter- A great start to a great collection. All said, this song [is great]. It's one of their most well known tunes, and could almost be considered a signature piece. A top 5 Stones song for me.<br />Love in Vain- The Stones' cover of a great Robert Johnson blues tune. These guys got their start doing blues covers, so this is right in their territory.<br />Country Honk- Pretty much an alternate version to Honky Tonk Woman with a country flavor. Very fun to listen to.<br />Live With Me- A catchy rocker with some great sax work by frequent session musician Bobby Keys.<br />Let it Bleed- The title track is a definite keeper. Another foot tapping rocker that's sure to entertain.<br />Midnight Rambler- Not a song for all tastes, this gritty tune about a killer stalker still has some groovy moments.<br />You Got the Silver- Hey, Keith can sing after all! I love the musical melody of this pretty little number.<br />Monkey Man- Perhaps even grittier than Midnight Rambler, this warning about drug use may take a few listens to appreciate but it pays off.<br />You Can't Always Get What You Want- What a way to end an all-time great release. From the opening lines of the chorus to the thunderous finale, this is my very favorite Stones track. In a way, it's also the definitive end to the decade that was the 60s. Powerful, powerful stuff.<br />So there you have it. Nearly all hardcore Stones fans consider this to be among their best, and for good reason. I've thought about getting the remastered SACD version of Let it Bleed. But then I think, \\"Can this possibly be made any better?\\" As far as I'm concerned, no way. Take a listen and you'll see what I mean.Powerful, powerful stuff.<br />So there you have it. Nearly all hardcore Stones fans consider this to be among their best, and for good reason.

6303832563|5.0|This film has no dialogue, no recognizable characters, no plotline, but it is FABULOUS. Somehow the lack of structure doesn't bother me. This video might represent the perfect melding of images and sound - the cinematography enhances the music, which in turn enhances the sights on the screen, in a wonderful reciprocal sort of way. This film is a must-have for anyone who likes minimalism, loud music, bold new cinematic ideas, clever juxtaposition of images (the airplane on the freeway is my favorite), or just plain old good art. That's really all this is - art as beautiful as any Beethoven symphony or Rembrandt painting. And you don't have to buy into Reggio's culture-condemning worldview to appreciate the movie, either; as one critic said, the speed shots of hectic city life are almost exultant, celebratory.<br />So go out and buy this film. I've heard there are issues with the DVD version, so it might be wise to stick with VHS for now.
B00000099Y|5.0|I have to say,at first I wasn't really into tool.  That was then. This CD is absolutely awesome.  The lyrics are deep and harsh, and the guitar is incredibly cool.  Stinkfist and Hooker with a penis are awesome songs.  Get anyone who doesn't like tool to listen to this CD.  I guarantee that this will change anyone's mind.  Absolutely tool's best
B00008S2VG|5.0|As a Madonna fan since I was in-utero, I can honestly say this is the most REAL album she has EVER released. Several tracks stand out as some of her finest yet (&quot;Love Profusion,&quot; &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;) ... indeed, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; may just be THE quintessential Madonna song. Although &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is still my favorite album (with its deep, dreamy, drowned world essence), &quot;American Life&quot; comes pretty darn close. <br />Forget the critics --- have *ANY* of them done *ANYTHING* close to what Madonna has done in her life? If not, sit down and shut up! Everyone else, GET THIS ALBUM NOW!<br />Kuduos, Madonna ... you're still the brightest little star the world has ever seen!
B000003N8R|5.0|A Love Supreme is often said to be Trane's greatest album, but Wynton Marsalis chose Crescent as his only Trane pick for his ten examples of &quot;real jazz&quot; in Sweet Swing Blues on the Road (p 140).
B000089RVX|5.0|Wow. I hadn't even heard of them before this album but now they're my favourite band. Their music is simply amazing. I can't possibly write a general review for the whole thing, so I'll go song-by-song, with a mark for each one.<BR>Going Under: REALLY COOL. One of my favourites. Amy's voice in the first line is like a snake hissing (only with more substance). 10/10<BR>Bring Me to Life: Everybody loves this song. Nuff said. 10/10<BR>Everybody's Fool: About the falseness of today's celebrities. It's got a good tempo, good vocals, good lyrics.... 9.5/10<BR>My Immortal: Great. It's slow, but the piano and feeling are great and you'll really miss out if you don't hear it. 10/10<BR>Haunted: The name says it all--the melody, the vocals, the lyrics... Really cool. 10/10<BR>Tourniquet: AMAZING! I absolutely love this one. You can feel so much pain, so much loss, so much despair in Amy's voice... \\"I tried to kill the pain/But only brought more.\\" She does talk about God in this one, but even though I'm Jewish, I don't care. I too have experienced such feelings of loss. Anyone who's ever contemplated suicide will absolutely identify with this. (And I know that a lot of people have but won't admit it.) 20/10<BR>Imaginary: Some people say that this song is easily forgotten. I disagree. So it's not the best song on the album... I still think that the lyrics are great. Amy describes the chaos of daily life in the verse and in the chorus we are taken to her inner paradise. 10/10<BR>Taking Over Me: Love it! Anyone who has experienced loss and pain because of love should identify with the lyrics. 9.99999/10<BR>Hello: Really good. The subject is loneliness and the result: schizophrenia. 9/10<BR>My Last Breath: Yet another one where people say it isn't memorable. It may not be the kind you'll hum constantly, like some other songs on the album, but it's still good. 9/10<BR>Whisper: Despite the title, this song is loud, angry, bursting with pain... It'as great. 10/10<BR>So that's a wrap... This is a great album. It's bursting at the seams with passion, with  anger, with loss... Amy seems to really mean what she's saying. The other (male) singer, I'm sorry to say, doesn't have the same charisma, and is simply there to back her up. He is good in the chorus of \\"Bring Me to Life\\", breaking her vocals into pieces and making them more powerful than they are on their own. Overall, an amazing album.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Nuts to all you who said that this movie is anything short of a masterpiece.  Firstly, I am a student who has studied (both independently and formally) the work of Spielberg and Kubrick respectively.  <br />The cinematography of Janusz Kaminski reflects Kubrick's dark style perfectly (see: A Clockwork Orange for the best example).  Spielberg said himself that he tried to capture, to the best of his ability, Kubrick's complex and unique artistic direction.<br />The acting by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law was spectacular.  You liked the people you were supposed to like and hated the people you were supposed to hate.  A mark of good casting and good acting.      <br />As for the ending, thematically, it fit in with Spielberg's other movies (ET, Catch Me If You Can, Empire Of The Sun, and Schindler's List most notably).<BR>Would Kubrick have ended it differently?  Probably.  <BR>This movie is an exploration of what makes us human, correct?  Without Spielberg's (often referred to as) &quot;tacked on&quot; ending, it would have left us with a considerable plot hole.

B0000931OG|5.0|Blur guitarrist left , Damon flirted heavily with world music , the band seemed to be in crisis , Well fear no more Think Thank is actually is a great album.<BR>Guitars are missed but the void is filled with backing voices , the best drums and percussions this band has show in a long time and some jazzy experimentation that not always works ( ending solo in jets)<BR>You get the goofy but uplifting Crazy Beats which was produced by Fat Boy slim . The aching ambulance , the awesome caravan and which maybe the best track in the album Out of time ,how could you not love that track.<BR>Overall is a highly recommended album
B00008WG3U|5.0|Well.  Just what you'd expect.  As fine as punk rock gets, and this time, it gets political.  Bottom line is; NOFX rawks.  Hard.  Fat Mike has really come into his own lyrically, Hefe still plays the trumpet, they still ska it out sometimes, and if you liked any NOFX album ever, then you'll like this too, so go buy it!!!
B00005KB9R|5.0|Me hole family listents to dis cd. We all feel it tis Bob's best work. It does not do justice to put dis in words. His lyrics has influenced thousands aroud de world. This album is his best ever. Wit songs like Duppy Conqueror it carry a strong vibe. Bob's melody is de best.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson is an awsome artist who doesnt get the critical respect he deserves.  With artists like John Mayer who is very talented in his own right getting nominated for grammys. It is hard to see how they overlooked Jack, he has the kind of mellow bluesy vibe that Nora Jones wishes she could have.
0451197879|2.0|this is perhaps my least favorite of SK's horror/thriller. a guy lives where a road is planned. he has to move. his job and marriage gets endangered to, and he decides he wants the roadwork stopped. so he begins taking matters into his own hands. this book doesn't deliver. i got the feeling that the guy was an idiot who deserved what  was coming to him, and very little the feeling that the road was to blame. the guy has just sort of given up. i don't feel taht much sympathy for him. i mean: his job is not that great and he endagers it himself, as an example. in the end it all was too little tied up with the roadwork. no great descriptions or psychology either.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna's 1998 Ray of Light saw her rise like Venus reborn, awash in an undulating sea of pulsating electronica and melancholic undertow.  The mood was one of taking stock, redefining herself artistically for the future, but respectfully acknowledging the past.<BR>In the years since however, Madonna's marriage, motherhood and a semi-permanent move to culture capital London, have failed to provide the creative spur one might have expected.  Meantime her music has tilted toward an over-reliance on electronic special effects.<BR>American Life starkly exposes this worrying trend, as Madonna drifts further into the melodic doldrums that bedevilled her lacklustre (over-rated) 2000 album, Music.<BR>Of the 11 new songs, only the mid-album Nothing Fails delivers the sad beauty and pay-off chorus we associate with classic Madonna.  But even this song is lazily missing a second or third verse, a flaw thinly veiled by an over-wrought gospel choir.<BR>Intervention, with its understated New Orderish synths and tender love them, and Easy Ride, nicely orchestrated by Michel Colombier, are goodish tunes, and potential slow burners.   But most of the rest merely ploughs the furrow left by Music: full of promising hooks; invariably undermined by French boffin Mirwai Ahmadzai's endlessly stuttering electronics and fractured acoustic guitar schtick. <BR>The clunkiness is not helped by Madonna banging on (and on ...) about her spiritual awakening.  She traded fame for love without a second thought  - remember?  On American Life she just won't let the subject rest, neurotically jabbering platitudes through drivel like I'm So Stupid, Nobody Knows Me, and the naff title track (less said 'bout that one the better).<BR>A nasty, middle-class, limousine puritanism has set in  - nothing like the gentle reflectiveness of gems such as Substitute For Love and Nothing Really Matters.  On Hollywood (all sub-Sheryl Crow jangly guitars and preachiness) Madonna implies Tinseltown is not for her.  Whatever happened to the Joan Crawford of pop?<BR>Later a daffy folksiness takes over - as on the dreary, fretboard-acoustic X-Static Process, which evokes today's teeming junior Tori Amos types. Die Another Day, last year's disappointing Bond theme, arrives here like an espresso doppio.  Rejected by 007 fans as tuneless tosh, its tense Papa Don't Preach strings and digital sky rockets at least inject a much-needed dose of John Barry-esque energy and drama.<BR>Meantime Madonna's voice  - a supple instrument post-Evita - is sliced, filtered and autotuned to within an inch of its life.  At other times she sings in a strange high pitch, such as on Mother and Father, the fadeout to which sounds spookily like Sylvester and the Two Tons of Fun.<BR>The good news? Well, she might have plumped for garage rock!  And to be completely fair, several songs certainly have their moments.<BR>My humble advice: Jettison the French dweeb Mirwais and hotfoot it back to Hollywood and Pat Leonard's house.  That would be a very good place to start.
B00005JKCH|5.0|When I first went to see this movie, I was stunned!  I've experienced Superman, Batman, Blade and X-Men, all right, and those were all jolly good movies.  However, this one really stands out.  What's it got?  Well, there's some amazing action sequences, yes, plus a hero and a villain that are equally enjoyable to see.  That's all pretty good.  But there's also another side to the movie that really adds to the enjoyment.  Spider Man is a human story, dealing with serious issues of loyalty, growing up, identity, and conscience.  Taking that into account, Spider Man is rather moving, aside from being kick-*ss.<br />All in all, this is a well made movie.  It does have some flaws with the script and the CGI, but that doesn't take away from the fun.  It's got bawls AND heart!  Peace.
B00000F566|4.0|I just bought the movie on DVD and watched it for the first time in years and remembered all over again why I liked it so much.<BR>A musical love story, much like Grease, the movie follows three weeks in the life of Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman (Jennifer Grey) on vacation in the early 60's in the Catskills with her family.<BR>Early on she is attracted to Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the bad boy of the &quot;entertainment&quot; crew though to him she is just a nuisance. However, when his partner needs an abortion and has to drop out of an impotant dance, Baby sees the opportunity both to help and to get closer to Johnny. What follows is full of great dancing, lively songs and a feel good ending.<BR>There are no great surprises to the story, it's bad boy meets, loses and regains good girl and everyone learns a lesson. However the charm of this movie lies in the great performances and chemistry between the two leads and to the great acting in the smaller supporting roles. This is what Hollywood does best and I'm not ashamed to admit that I enjoyed it.
B0000931OG|3.0|This new cd by Blur I must say is their strangest disc yet.  Sounds like out of space music with some interesting rips.  If you like far out bizarre music its for you.  But I must add some of the songs do remind me of their older material.  I gave it three stars because its so different..I like different so I don't know if it deserves a fourth  star or not...but its definately strange too....
B00008NG5V|5.0|&quot;On and On&quot; is just as good as Brushfire Fairytales.  There are 16 great songs on the album (The Horizon has Been Defeated is my favorite so far) and it's nice to know that his mellow voice hasnt change at all during his transition between albums.  If you like Ben Harper, John Mayer, Pete Yorn or Ryan Adams, you will like Jack Johnson.
B00005JKPF|5.0|They did a fantastic job on X2. The action was much better than the first movie and the story was origional. The only thing I didn't like about it was it turned into one of those \\"end of the world\\" movies. It's a very old and tired scheme. Other than that I'd say anyone who has any interest in X-Men would love the movie.
B00008S2VG|3.0|The album is not bad, I have appreciated her growth,  but I certainly prefer to listen to her voice and to &quot;real&quot; instruments, instead of getting only electronic sounds. I don't like Mirwais style and I would prefer Madonna to let us appreciate her improved voice ability. <BR>I miss the warmth of her first albums. The new songs don't touch me inside, this makes me feel distant from Madonna... It's a pity!
B00008NG5V|5.0|After Brushfire Fairytales, Jack Johnson has rapidly integrated himself into a list of my favorite artists, which include Dave Matthews and other such performers.  I had been counting down the days until this Cd came out and I bought it the morning it came out.  The CD is great.  It is more mellow than his first release.  The music is great.  Jack is great ont he guitar and some of the beats the three performers create are fantastic.  The only place that it falls short in is the song-writing.  The lyrics aren't as great as they were on his first album.  Several songs, such as &quot;Cookie Jar&quot; stand out for lyrical meaning, but songs like &quot;The Horizon had been Defeated,&quot; while fun to listen to, lack mosr dpeth in the lyrics and it reaches a state of funkiness with lyrics like &quot;thingamajigsaw puzzle.&quot;  This isn't a bad thing though.  Th album is very enjoyable to listen to and I would reccomend it to anyone who wants a good CD to chill to.  Some standout songs include &quot;Taylor,&quot; &quot;Wasting Time,&quot; &quot;Rodeo Clowns&quot; and &quot;Mediocre Bad Guys.&quot;  In all, this CD is much more mellow than &quot;Brushfire fairytales&quot; and the music is much more intoxicating, but the lyrics don't pack as much of a punch as they did on &quot;Brushfire Fairytales.&quot;  It is still a great album by an artist who is sure to evolve into a favorite among many.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've always appreciated the quality of Christina Aguilera's voice and range; however, her public image made me want to shy away from buying her CDs. After I heard \\"Beautiful,\\" I thought I would give her CD a try. I'm glad I did. Her bad girl/temptress persona may suit how she wants people to see her in public, BUT her vulnerability shows in her music. This CD has a great mix of upbeat tunes plus heartfelt, emotional ballads. Each song is well-arranged and has a hip edge. Great work Christina! Lose the body piercings, be who you really are, and you'll get the appreciation you deserve.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I never counted myself among the fans of anime, and I still don't: but Spirited Away may have me looking into more quality anime titles as I try to locate outstanding films by Japan's reigning master director/animator, Miyazaki.<br />The plot rehash:  a 10 year old girl, Chihiro, and her parents stumble upon a portal between our world and the realm of spirits (which strongly resembles a Japanese town of about 100 years ago).  The parents make the mistake of eating the food there and then pay the price by turning into pigs immediately.  Chihiro has to navigate her way through this weird alternate universe and put herself into the employ of a powerful sorceress in order to find a way of getting herself and her parents back to their home.  Along the way she learns to be stronger and discovers new resources within herself.<br />Simply put, I believe this is the best animated film ever made.  Spirited Away not only has incredible visual detail and realism (with hardly any help from CGI), but takes the familiar plot of a fairytale-like story and transforms it into a journey enjoyable by kids and adults alike.  In fact, everything was so superbly and magically rendered that I was able to forget myself under its spell - as if I were re-entering childhood.  Yet on a note of caution to parents, there are some scenes that young children might find scary, involving spirits, monsters eating people and all sorts of strange beings.  Miyazaki never forgets his cultural roots in Animism even while creating a masterpiece that resonates with such universal power. This is no Disney film indeed (although Disney may have led many American consumers to believe that, Pixar was only responsible for the English dubbing and distribution within the U.S.A).<br />I will end up owning this dvd for my private collection to enjoy time and again with my (elementary school-age or older) children. I suggest you treat your family to Spirited Away as well.  It's just brilliant! <BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle.
0201626632|5.0|Just as the title said, a PhD is not enough! Getting a PhD is just the beginning of a scientific career. There are many important &quot;life&quot; skills to learn. This book is unique in that it tells you what you need to do after you have your PhD.<br />Another very precious thing that this book reveals is that going directly to academia after your PhD is probably not the best way to establish yourself as a scientist. There are too many duties (teaching, handling the students, departmental meetings, etc) that demand your time that you won't enough time to do the main tasks - bring in a grant, reseach and publish. A better way is to go to an industrial or govermental lab and establish your scientific reputation there. You won't have the distractions and can concentrate on getting grant, research and publish. After you are established, you can go to academia easily, if you so choose.<br />Finally, the author reveals another big secret - pursue your long term research goal by a sequence of small projects.<br />This book is an excellent and indispensible guide for budding scientists. Get this book if you are serious about becoming a scientist. Highly recommended.

B00008977N|2.0|I feel very qualified to speak out on the awful video of this embarrassing DVD. I have 300 DVDs, 150 laserdiscs, 3 TVs and 3 DVD players, and well over a decade of experience in professional digital imaging. I know the difference between a poor transfer and grainy film. I know what compression artifacts look like. I know when something has been oversharpened or otherwise fiddled with. So, beleive me when I say the video on this release is pathetic. It is inexcusable, easily the worst looking DVD I own or have seen. The sound is excellent, yes. But I can't bear to watch the terrible image, which effectively reduces it to a re-release of the Secret World Live CD.<br />The laserdisc of this title looks much better than this remastered release. Given gabriel's tight control of his material, I wondered if this was mastered on a home computer? It really looks like an amatuer job.<br />Bottom Line - great sound in a great concert by a great artist, but watching this on anything larger than a 17\\" is going to be disappointing for discerning collectors.

Well done, Jack, it just wouldn't be summer without ya', man!
B0000029DD|5.0|Really, this is the coolest album ever. It just overflows with freakish musical talent and creativity. Its got that phenomenal confidence of youth, and really its a celebration thereof. Jeff jumps all over the musical map, and every song shows that confident musical sophistication. Is there a more beautiful 5-6 minutes of recorded music than his version of Hallelujah? Its completely unreasonable that someone can sing and play guitar like that. Dream Brother is a vaguely Led Zep like foray into a rock epic with an Indian vibe, a very small genre that I am inordinately fond of :) Yes, there is variety.<BR> All the references to water and dying young are indeed very spooky in retrospect, but this is not depressing music. That shows up later, like We Could Be So Happy Baby, if We Wanted to Be. That is depressing music. I just try and put that to one side when I listen to Grace.

B00005JKZV|5.0|I was spellbound by the previous Lord Of The Rings film, \\"Fellowship Of The Ring\\". The previous is more like an introduction to the characters of the trilogy. However, that one, as powerful, riveting, and astounding as \\"Fellowship\\" is, it is eclipsed by this second installment film in the three part trilogy \\"The Two Towers\\". The cast of this movie is perfect. The same held true with the previous as well.The thing that I found vastly improved was the grouchy dwarf Gimli. I wasn't fond of him as he seemed selfish, pompous and having a too big of an ego in the first LOTR movie but in the second LOTR movie, he was vastly improved in this movie. Gimli was much funnier expressed much more humor, and showed a much more heroic attitude to become one of the highlight characters in my opinion.<br />The whole imaginative world that J. R. Tolkien built in his mind would've put anything that George Lucas or Steven Spielberg would've imagined to shame. No pun intended. He made up entire languages, entire language accents, entire worlds, it goes on. He would've been impressed by the movie screen adaptations. No other novel that I've read has been so well adapted to the big screen like 'Lord Of The Rings' has and I doubt it'll be surpassed for a long time if ever. What I find amazing about the LOTR movies so far is that things that make most other fantasy movies rather cheesy sometimes, they add so much to this movies power and emotion especially the talk treelike people, the Ents.<br />Just trying to be able to put even a drop of the creativity that Tolkien had, onto the big screen seemed impossible but with the help of Peter Jackson, doing so succeeded in every way. Ian McKellen was perfect to play Gandalf. I especially find it wonderful to see the husky voiced Christopher Lee play the renegade wizard Saruman. Saruman is even more evil than he was in the last movie. The visuals are amazing especially with the Sauron's Eye, and the lightning above Mt. Doom, as well as the bird's eye view of Saruman's Orthanc Tower and the Gates of Mordor and also the schizophrenic creature Gollum. Gollum is the spotlight character on this stunning masterpiece of a movie. First, he is a completely computer generated creature but the way they created his form on computer is cutting edge and groundbreaking computer generated imaging. To me, its this that makes Gollum the most intriguing character in the movie. Its also the dangerously conflicting personalities within him and no other computer generated character in any movie showed so much expression like Gollum does. Its hard not to show at least a little pity for his painful life with the Ring.<br />Picking up where \\"The Fellowship of The Ring\\" left off where Frodo and Samwise were when they saw the fiery Mount Doom, the two run into the alienish looking creature Gollum, a former Hobbit named SmÃ©agol, who found the Ring after it being lost and forgotten for thousands of years and being tormented by it's power for hundreds of years before Bilbo Baggins found it after Gollum lost it and Frodo now had the ring and is on his bid to destroy it in the fires of Mt. Doom but encounters Gollum, the one who found it after it was lost for thousands of years. Due to the permanent mental poisoning caused by the ring and his experience of the rings power, not to mention that he seems to suffer from schizophrenia, he guides Frodo & Samwise (who does not trust Gollum) towards the fiery Mt. Doom. At the same time, Aragorn, Legolas, & Gimli hunt down orcs that captured Pippin & Merry during the battle that claimed the life of Borimir in the last movie and involved the Fellowship being dispersed with Frodo going on his own. The two hobbits escape the orcs though and what lies ahead for them is well, let's just say, out of this world.<br />This movie isnt without its flaws though. There are a great deal of changes that were done to the storylines that made a small number of people disappointed. There are also alarge number of characters who arent even shown on the movie and it disappointed a small number of fans. Overall though, The Two Towers surpasses the first on almost all fronts and the flaws done to this movie are so overshadowed by the incredible dialog and emotions that its forgivable as there are so many books, events, and characters to play that its completely impossible to put everything from the book onto the big screen without making each individual movie at least 5 and a half hours long! Theres just no way that could happen. The same holds true with Fellowship Of The Ring. The books have a lot more scenes and images that the movies do but the movies absolutely succeeded in portraying the major battle scenes from the books.<br />There are quite a few scenes in the movie that will tug at your heart strings and make one feel bad but its a mere taste of the sadness that real life events cause when evil strikes home and societies. To me, that makes the Lord Of The Rings movies so incredibly moving and touching and parallels the dangers our world faces these days.<br />As for the DVD release, I would like to warn that whenever the DVD is first released, I would recommend holding off as possibly a gift set or extended edition might wind up surfacing later on so if the regular edition comes out, HOLD OFF, and wait until an extended or gift set edition comes out so you dont get duped by the marketing ploys. This is especially true of the first LOTR movie and it might become of this movie too so I just wanted to deliver a fair warning.<br />Anyhow, back to the movie, TTT is a spellbinding masterpiece and its a humongous crime that it only won one Academy Award!<br />All I can do now is try to keep myself entertained as I now begin the excruciating wait for the cataclysmic finale 'Return of the King' and witness the final battle to save Middle Earth from the evil clutches of Sauron. Ultimately, these three movies will become legendary classics as the years progress and become favorites for generations to come. Their legacy will last forever.so a large number of characters who arent even shown on the movie and it disappointed a small number of fans.

1573229725|5.0|Sarah Waters' third novel \\"Fingersmith\\" is both a critical and popular favourite. It has been shortlisted for several book awards including the Booker Prize. Waters herself has attracted much attention from literary circles since the publication of her first two novels \\"Tipping The Velvet\\" and \\"Affinity\\", both of which have won her many accolades. The former has even been made into a TV movie by the BBC. So what's the fuss about ? I'd say it's down to the fact that Waters has created a niche for herself writing fiction the way the old masters used to. Her style cannot be further away from the rabid excesses of many contemporary writers who try to pass off bad for inventive writing. Waters' eloquent and long flowing sentences recall the style of classical writers like Charles Dickens. Her craft lies in pure storytelling - about petty criminals, thiefs, pickpockets, damsels in distress, etc all in a Victorian setting - but with a strong dash of the new feminist sensibility that brings her story bang up-to-date.....and it works !<br />\\"Fingersmith\\" at more than 500 pages long may be overwritten but it is superbly crafted and a truly compelling read. Sure, there's drama, mystery, suspense and great characterisation but it isn't the fearsome mindbender the blurbs make it out to be. After you have recovered from the jaw dropping shock that Waters has laid in store for you at the close of the first segment, the other twists and turns that ensue aren't that difficult to follow. In fact, they're fairly predictable but that's a compliment, not a criticism, because it shows Waters cares more about her story's integrity than delivering cheap shocks. By the time you get to the end of it, our heroines, Sue and Maud, must seem like two peas in a pod or spiritual twins from opposite sides of the track. While Waters has been labelled a lesbian fiction writer, she's careful to keep her touch light in order not to alienate the general reading public.<br />\\"Fingersmith\\" is one of the best novels this season. It deserves and is destined for the widest readership possible. Highly recommended.

And the 3 bonus tracks are every bit as strong as the ones on the original LP release in 1970, if not stronger!  <br />So what are you waiting for?  For jazz fans and funk fans alike as well as music lovers in general, this disc is a must and an essential addition to any record collection worth the name!  <br />PS. &quot;Live at the Lighthouse&quot; comes strongly recommended too!
B000007T1M|4.0|I've never been in to Korn or the gimmicks of Slipknot, but there is something about System of a Down that interests me. Sure i like their views on politics and word issues even though i can't relate to some of them. But it is their diversity that they express through their music that puts them yards above the rest of the bands in this musical genre.<br />At times it is as though the band is on...with the machine gun style guitar and drums, but it is their ability to change as though they have just taken some downers that i like, into a form that resembles a ballard for a quick second!! The lead singer is extremely talented with his vocals. Sometimes when he is singing real fast i think that he sounds a little like Mark from Guttermouth.<br />The best songs on this disk would be Sugar and CUBErt. I like this cd better that there latest release Toxicity. But this cd you won't be dissapointed.

0385504209|1.0|Ok, let's not forget that this is a work of fiction, and that the author has the right to create a new world of alternate biblical history and religious sensibility.  Responses to the book that only express outrage and censoriousness are just making his point.<br />However, a piece of literature should have to earn the right to be taken seriously by creating a life-world with some plausibility.  This is particularly true in this case since its pages are suffused with condemnation of the church, orthodox Christianity, and the biblical canon.  But all that Brown gives us to establish his setting is a polemic that panders to every half-baked, crack-pot, sexually repressed spiritual fad currently in vogue.  Yes, it is his right to create such a work, but, if in the process he seeks to destroy belief, he also has the obligation to do a little homework and pursue a little greater consistency.<br />Did Constantine really select the New Testament canon?  Of course not.  Is there any reason to believe that no one prior to Constantine believed that Christ was God?  To the contrary! Ought we to blame \\"the church\\" for having brought into  the the world same devaluations of the female that manifest themselves  in Asian cultures?  That makes no sense. The list can go on--and I'm not even touching on the interpretations of art we have to deal with.<br />I was really looking forward to this book.  For the first half or so, I thought I could just ignore the non sequiturs and factual errors and not let them get in the way of spoiling a good story.  But after a while, the deceptions just got \\"in your face.\\"<br />The author gives every indication of being able to write an alternative religious history that neither offends people nor relies on a cartoon-like version of Christian history.  I would challenge him to do so.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This is by far the most politically motivated NOFX release to date... and this isn't a bad thing. The songs are all really good...if u like nofx you will like this cd, it sounds a little different to their other cd's but not in a bad way.<BR>the multimedia stuff on the cd is good too. their is a clip from unprecedented, and two song clips.<BR>well worth the money.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I notice that some people rated this convoluted mess of a movie highly. WHY&gt; Maby it is an age thing. I am an adult older american. Maby for some reason I could not fathom young people like this mess.It was a waste of money. A film that could have said everything it wanted to say in one half hour. The rest is puff.
B0000025GW|5.0|This CD although bashed by others for Biblical and Christian influence, is a great cd. What makes it great is not only the music, but also the Christian message.  For die hard Dylan fans to put this album down just because of the Christian message is self righteous ignorance.  And just because Dylan has Christian messages in this album does not mean he lost his \\"free-thinking genius.\\"  It just proves that he took the free thinking genius to the next intelligence level.  This album is also not bitter, but more open and expressive.  Try reviewing this album without a biased view against Christianity.  It's actually a great cd.  Christ love to all.
B000008JGJ|5.0|The sound is great and the packaging is the best yet - nice color booklet with all the lyrics, 5 cards that include the band, pyramids, and &quot;money&quot; and &quot;time&quot; cards.  All housed in a black box with the familiar prism (a little different this time).  You know the songs, and the remastered sound is the best yet.  Great reissue!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Once again Jack Johnson has suceeded my expectations.  This CD is just as good as &quot;Brushfire Fairytales.&quot;  A perfect mixture of mellow laid back rock.  His easy going lyrics and smooth surfer beat reminds me of the beach.  Some very good songs are &quot;Wasting Time&quot; &quot;Holes to Heaven&quot; and of course &quot;Rodeo Clowns.&quot;  &quot;Rodeo Clowns&quot; is on of my favortie songs, because he recorded it with G.Love.  A must have CD for everyone.
B00005JKPF|4.0|Expensive summer movies have now become so broad and bland that it's a real shock when you see one that actually doesn't stink.  And the second X-Men movie from Bryan Singer is pretty much everything a big summer movie should be and more.  It's got all the big effects and spectacle you want, but it doesn't serve it up in the typical vacuum familiar to most of these kinds of flicks.  It has a sensible (relatively speaking) and interesting plot.  It manages to establish interesting characters and give them all room to breathe.  And it has lots of fighting and stuff blowing up.  Sounds like easy accomplishments for a movie, but it's so rare to be somewhat of a miracle that X2 manages to pull it off.<br />Singer deserves the lion's share of credit.  Derided by the press prior to the movie's release (he was depicted as a tempermental control freak who alienated actress Halle Berry - whose mailed-in performance is one of the relatively few low points of the film), Singer proves that movies like X2 benefit from having a fanboy dictator at the helm.  X2 stays true to its comic roots without feeling slavish, and Singer manages to convey themes as dark as genocide, racism, homophobia, post-traumatic stress, and the Holocaust in X2 without having them weigh the whole experience down.  This is an action movie with a brain and style of its own.<br />It doesn't hurt that Singer has assembled perhaps the most attractive cast in the universe for his film, peppered with sharp character actors (Alan Cumming, Brian Cox) to provide a nice balance.  Vets Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen again give the Xmen storyline a dramatic flair that stops just short of taking itself too seriously.  Hugh Jackman also remains the film's centerpiece as Wolverine, the hero guys want to be and women swoon over.  He's Han Solo with a cooler haircut.<br />There are plenty of neat little surprises too.  A quick exchange between Iceman and Wolverine provides a poignant scene of male mutant binding.  Cameosfrom beloved Xmen characters sprout up here and there.  And there's a neat reference to Brian DePalma's Femme Fatale.  Those may seem like small pleasures, but it's that kind of attention to detail that makes X2 special.  It treats the small scenes with the same importance as the big scenes, and that's a critical element of its success.  Along, of course, with effects that make your eyes pop out of your head.<br />Overall, X2 is one of the best filmgoing experiences of the year.  Catch it on the biggest screen you can find.
0399226907|5.0|I was a teaching assistant for a preschool camp that focused on \\"bugs.\\"  Most of the children already knew the words by heart!  It was a lot of fun.  Each child drew a piece of food on a paperplate, and then we strung them all together with pipecleaners.  the end result was a very long caterpillar!
B00008NG5V|5.0|This cd is amazing.  If you like Brushfire Fairytales, you will LOVE On and On.  There is not a single song on this disc that I don't like, and that is very rare.  The mood of the album is very chill, it is great to listen to while doing homework or just relaxing.  If you like good music, do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B00005A1PR|5.0|Remember the Grammys when Acoustic Soul was nominated over Songs in A Minor for Album of the Year. YET Songs in A Minor won over Acoustic Soul for Best R&amp;B Album (how backwards is that!). Well forget the past and look at the album that should of took recognition for being what it was: The Best Cross-over R&amp;B/Soul/Folk album of the year. India deserves continued praise for giving R&amp;B and Soul a bright outlook. <BR>Video (the woman anthem of 2001) is original with thoughtful lyrics, but it doesnt stop there. Brown Skin is the most tasteful sensual song I've heard in a while. And Simple, as was said is anything but. There are so many standout tracks on this album, which is rare. This is not for everyone's taste but it definitely has my respect for being positive and beautiful. Highly recommended.
B000002L71|5.0|The \\"live\\" album--music recorded from a concert rather than the studio--is such a tricky creature. In rock and roll, there's a number of live albums that have achieved classic status (those that come to mind immediately include Frampton Comes Alive, Woodstock, Led Zeppelin's The Song Remains the Same, and The Last Waltz). Of those, the last three also had documentaries associated with the concerts being recorded. And yet, when it comes to favorites, I ignore all of those in favor of yet one more documentary cum live album: Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense.<br />I might be using the word documentary wrong here, because Stop Making Sense is not so much about Talking Heads as it simply shows why they were such a musical force. For example, there are no talking heads in the movie--the film begins with David Byrne simply walking on-stage with a tape recorder and his guitar, introducing himself and immediately going into a solo version of \\"Psycho Killer.\\" Each successive song adds a person or two, until about two-thirds through the show, the entire Speaking in Tongues era-Heads entourage are rocking out on stage. The film never breaks from the show, even as it documents how the show was put together. In true art school fashion, the show itself was organized to show how a live concert is created, piece-by-piece. Truly, this is a case of \\"show, don't tell.\\"<br />The album made from the movie/concert does the same. Unlike some live recordings, where the audience overwhelms the music, Stop Making Sense is clean. Even in the beginning and end of songs, when applause can be heard, the mixing mutes it, concentrating instead on the, for example, wavering synthesizer and infectious drumbeat that begins \\"Once in a Lifetime.\\" Within the songs, the distinctions between instruments and voices are clear as well.<br />And what great songs these are! I enjoy Talking Heads: 77 and More Songs about Buildings and Food, but the versions of \\"Psycho Killer\\" and \\"Take Me to the River\\" benefit from the live arrangements. \\"Psycho Killer,\\" sparse to begin with, becomes even more disturbing as a solo piece, stark in its rage and eccentricity. \\"Take Me to the River,\\" on the opposite side of the movie and album, equally benefits from the full-force production of fourteen people on stage, becoming a kind of New Wave gospel anthem. The other songs gain a lot from the energy of a live performance. Talking Heads was a cerebral band in the studio, especially under the helm of producer Brian Eno for Fear of Music and Remain in Light. Those albums, while wonderful, suffer somewhat from the layer-upon-layer of soundscapes favored by Eno at the time (similar to the problem of the Robert Fripp-produced Peter Gabriel album). Live, these same songs open up, becoming even more funky and weird, matching the stage antics of Byrne.<br />The only problem with this album was the fact that all of the songs from the movie weren't on it, including bright reworkings of \\"Thank You for Sending Me an Angel\\" and \\"Found a Job.\\" Someone must have been listening, however, and for its 20th anniversary, the album was rereleased in a special edition with four more songs. Thus a great album is made even greater.<br />As \\"Life During Wartime\\" goes, \\"This ain't no party/this ain't no disco/this ain't no fooling around.\\" Stop Making Sense shows that Talking Heads were a serious force, the true culmination of the New Wave spirit in the U.S.rom the live arrangements. \\"Psycho Killer,\\" sparse to begin with, becomes even more disturbing as a solo piece, stark in its rage and eccentricity. \\"Take Me to the River,\\" on the opposite side of the movie and album, equally benefits from the full-force production of fourteen people on stage, becoming a kind of New Wave gospel anthem.

0679735259|5.0|A warts-and-all account of the Vietnam War. Possibly the best book on this subject in the last thirty years, Michael Herr gives us an objective look into the horror of combat without looking through the eyes of rose-tainted patriotism. He invokes the dread and chaos of the battlefield and weighs out the whims of human behaviour, bravery and insanity, meekness and humanity, without the judgement or condemnation that might be meted out by a loftier author.<br />  Herr's use of brutal imagery absorbed me into his savage surroundings. From the soldier who can't stop drooling as a result of a particularly dreadful gun battle, to the scenes of the dead, American and Vietnamese, adult and infant, on eclectic battlefields and village streets.<br /> The characters are real people in a situation that most of them neither like nor understand. They are young men who invoke the same shortcomings we all have. But they are a step above the common reader. They are professional soldiers and act that way despite their misgivings. They push past the boundaries of fear and into the realms of heroism or insanity or death. Everyone that he introduces is individual. There are no carbon copy soldiers here. They are funny or musical or religious or delusional, whatever their idiosyncrasy may be. I felt as though I was being introduced to people I knew throughout the book.<br /> Most books on the topic of war that I have read tend to stay with one platoon. Herr constantly shifts places and battalions and makes the reader feel as though he/she is part of something bigger. There is no single climax in the book. An honest reflection of that war perhaps. Each chapter is as horrific and exhilarating as the next. <br />The length of it, in particular, displays an author who wants to show us the bare bones: no hyperbolic descriptions that eventually desensitise us to the events, no ivory-tower pensive soliloquies to the tragedy of war. Michael Herr gives us the facts and trusts the reader's intelligence to decide.
B00006G8G1|3.0|Man, I was going nuts watching this DVD. I bought it full of hope, I love Maiden, I knew Rock Rio had an attendance of 250000 people, I knew Bruce was in top form, and all of the band.<br />From the moment the show begins, we see this is truth. Their energy is blistering, their perfomance is fantastic, Bruce is singing like never.<br />But the edition..... My God, what was Steve Harris thinking???!! He destroyed the whole DVD, trying to put takes from all the cameras into every single minute of the songs! It's simply annoying! We all know Iron Maiden is your babe, Steve. So, as his Dad, you should look after it more properly and give the edition job to someone who knows how to do it...
B00008NG5V|5.0|If you are looking for some great music to compliment a lazy summer day by the beach, then you came to the right place.  Jack Johnson is the king of hammock music and if you loved his last cd then you are sure to enjoy this one.  Being a huge fan of Jack Johnson myself, i immediately had to have his new release and i wasn't dissapointed in the least. Gone, Taylor, and Rodeo Clowns are some of his best to date! Keep up the good work Mr. Johnson.
B000007MVX|3.0|Warning!  This CD is presented as one single long song (anyone who plans to listen on a standard Discman, etc. better take heed).  You cannot skip a song and move on to next.  God forbid you should hit stop accidently--you will have to start over from scratch.  I would wait and see if and when a new version arrives that gives you breaks between the songs.  If your player has a &quot;FF&quot; button, you can fast foward past the &quot;Hare&quot;.  Not many Discman-types have this button, though, just the &quot;Skip&quot; button.  And since you can't skip to the next song...kind of ridiculous in this day and age.
0066214122|3.0|Michael Chrichton is one of my favorite authors of all time - I have read most of his books - many times over in fact.  But I was disappointed with \\"Prey.\\"  I truly had a hard time getting through it - it didn't grab my attention, nor did I feel particularly involved in the plot.  Honestly, it felt like a chore to get through the first few chapters.  The book picks up a little steam mid-way, but not enough to make up for the lackluster beginning.  I give the book 3 stars, because on its own, compared to your typical book written by a typical author, it's not bad.  But if you are a die-hard Chrichton fan, you may find yourself disappointed.
B000028U0Y|4.0|Cash has is own beliefs and eccentricities. That's why he's here playing for these prisoners. Of course maybe the majority of the population of 'em in 65 wasn't as bad as the majority is now-then again maybe they are. Who knows? Cash just had a unique want to touch the hearts of some men that may have been truly rotten thinking it would change them to get that kind of attention. Maybe it did for all I know. Maybe at the very least he entertained a few guys that weren't so bad or maybe actually were innocent. One thing is for sure, Cash did his best to entertain and give them something; no less than he would have done for any other crowd. You can hear it, the touching ballads, the humour, the banter. The interaction. This is a heck of a man. Maybe I don't agree with his feelings on it, but I respect him alot. This album is great. The performance is true. You can hear his voice get hoarse and crack with laughter. Maybe nervoussness too. Cash performs three or four songs alone with his guitar and they are some funny songs. My favorite being a Jack Clement [goofy himself] song called flushed from the bathroom of your heart, which is effectively mocking of every once clever country title or one liner. The whole song is just one country song cleverism after another. And of course doing 25 minutes to go [song about the hangin of a man done in the first person] is a curiosity that says more about Cash's dark humour and Different personality than anything else on the album. He does a song or two written by actual inmates at the prison. June comes in for a few tunes and you can hear announcements over the loud speaker that don't pertain to Cash's visit there. This Includes a few tracks that weren't on the original including a very long narrative of John Henry in which the line about Henry not being able to rise with the sun gets a few misguided laughs that Johnny addresses in the middle of the song with ''dirty minds'' and a snicker. This is the real Johnny Cash. Album is 55minutes and 50 seconds. I believe there are three bonus tracks and some bonus curse words too.
B000002MQ9|5.0|quite simply wonderful in its depth and richness.  nothing in the music industry has produced anything since and quite doubt that anyone can even touch their insight and beauty in the way that they have.  some say morbid, i say real.
B00008S7ZW|2.0|Jennifer Aniston certainly proves she can act in this film, playing the Anti-Rachel. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to like her character, or most of the others. She plays a selfish and amoral woman, who seems to care nothing about the feelings or well-being of others. Other unlikeable characters included her illicit lover, \\"Holden\\", a self-absorbed, whiney twit, who idolizes Salinger, but is himself a rather talentless writer, and Bubba, her husband's sleazy and opportunistic friend. In fact, the only character in the film who comes off at all sympathetic is her dim-witted but well-meaning husband, who seems to actually care about her for some reason. She should have gotten her husband into drug-treatment, and herself into night classes. Instead, she continues to lie to him right up to the end, apparently having learned nothing from her experience. Neither does the audience.
0060007737|5.0|This book literally had my stomach turning as I read it. I could see clearly in my business where we'd gone wrong, and how to fix it. In a way, using the 80/20 principal (80% of profits typically come from 20% of products, etc) give you the first piece of the equation. Then using this book completes the circle. Find what works in your business, then market yourselves as the best supplier of that product or service. A real eye-opener!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson has done it again with his cd &quot;ON and On\\" His sophomore effort carries the same easy listening and great lyrical songs.  I would highly recommend this cd to anyone.
B0000931OG|1.0|The material on this disc isn't too bad.  Not up to the standard of the magnificent &quot;13&quot;, but pleasing all the same.  Tracks like 'Ambulance', 'Sweet Song' and 'Out of Time' are all worthy additions to the Blur songlist.<br />However, this album still only gets 1 star because of EMI's stunningly stupid copy protection system.  I tried playing this on no less than four CD players, and I had trouble with all of them.  Either I got a strange clicking in the left stereo channel, the first track would refuse to play, or the entire CD would refuse to play.  I guess that the guys at EMI were too busy (doing what?) to actually try playing this CD in a couple of CD players before they went and soiled it with their Copy Control scheme.<br />In summary, EMI has gone and ruined a perfectly good record.  I can't honestly recommend this, because everyone I know who got it has had serious problems playing it.  I know I'll be taking my copy back for a refund.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Jack Johnson's sophmore album is as suggested under a lot of pressure. His freshman release was so amazing it's a wonder he's been able to follow Brushfire Fairytales with another great conglomeration of cool music. On and On doesn't come out with a BANG like Fairytales, but it's an all around well-balanced, agile, mellow album. My favorite tracks: Wasting Time, Rodeo Clowns (woohoo!!!!), and Cocoon. I'm in love with his acoustic, his voice, his writing, his band members, geeeeez! So much to praise! What's not to love? Great job, Jack and Co.!!!
B000002LIX|5.0|I really like this album. It doesn't have the hold over me that Nothings Shocking does, but it is GREAT none the less. This album has some rock and some art and some rock on it. All the songs are good but don't flow from one to another well. With that said the greatest JA song is on this album &quot;Then She Did&quot;. If you're a fan of Jane's or just want something different just pick this album up it will not dissapoint.
B00005JLD4|5.0|If you watch this film, I highly recommend watching the &quot;making of&quot; documentary.  I thought the story as told in the movie was pretty interesting, but I thought that the documentary helped me appreciate the film infinitely more.  The director did a phenomenal job given the resources he had available, and I think the result was a beautiful film.
0789723107|5.0|If you're thinking of purchasing this book, your likely a seasoned veteran in web design.  However, it is also likely that you're going to learn some new tricks and make the world (wide-web) a better place in the meantime.  I highly recommend this book because you're not as good as you think you are.<br />I read this book in a few days, cover-to-cover.  It's a quick read because it's not full o' fluff.  Save the rest of us and read this, quick!
B00008WG3U|4.0|This is a pretty good album.  I am really digging their new style with getting more into politics and whatnot.  Highlight tracks include:  The Seperation of Church and State, The Irrationality of Rationality, Franco Un-American, Idiots Are Taking Over, American Errosist (I Hate Hate Haters), 13 Stitches, Re-gaining Unconsciousness and Whoops, I OD'd.  NOFX continues to deliver humor and I believe their lyrics have gotten a little more mature (i.e. The Irrationality of Rationality).  \\"War on Errorism\\"  is well worth one's money (the cover art alone is worth it--haha).  The CD includes enhanced features with 2 music videos and a trailer to an idependent film covering the 2000 Presidential election.  The inside jacket of the album includes a introduction from the band writing their views on their latest choice of expressing more political commentary.  Overall, very good.  Highly recommended for new and old fans.  If you're not a fan I still recommend it if you want some good, catchy music with social/political commentary lyrics.  Idiots are taking over...do something.
B00006RINF|5.0|This is Lacuna Coil's fourth major album and it shows an obvious improvement over this band's already tremendous talent.  I've been a fan since I heard Falling Again on In A Reverie a few years ago and I currently have all their albums.  Evanescance doesn't even come close to Lacuna Coil so I recommend you spare yourself the anguish and just buy this instead.  Newer Lacuna Coil fans will enjoy songs like Entwined and Aeon/Tightrope while it seems us old-timers prefer songs like Daylight Dancer, The Ghost Woman and the Hunter, and Unspoken.  In all their CDs, Lacuna Coil has NO bad songs.  Listen with pride in your musical tastes.
B000089RVX|5.0|I generally judge albums by how many songs on a given title I like - if an average album has 10 songs, I have to like 5 or 6 for it to be good. How does Evanescence rank? Every song on Fallen is a hit; I haven't taken it out of my CD player since I got it about a month ago. That this is a great album is one thing, but to be this good on their debut is just amazing. &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot; &amp; &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; are definite highlights, but even the weaker songs (&quot;My Immortal&quot; &amp; &quot;Whisper&quot;, in my opinion) are still good and very listenable. What makes this band is without question the vocals of Amy Lee. She sings with such force and passion, there's really no way to describe her voice with words. Just listen, and be in awe. If this is the way Evanescence begins their careers, I honestly can't wait to see how they follow this up. We're seeing the emergence of a great band.
B00005JKPF|4.0|While I didn't realy enjoy the 1st one, I liked it enough to see the sequel and let me tell you, it rocks. This is a MAJOR improvement from the previous. Better acting, better plot & story, better special effects and much better than the first. While this movie does get cheezy in parts (Like how each charcter knows jujitsu in one moment, but are completely helpless in another less threatening situation, and the fact that the powers they possess could not be the product of mutations, but w/out makebelive this wouldn't be fun). Yes it's theory's are incorrect and yes the characters break all the las of physics and [copy] the jedi and the matrix but who cares it is still an enjoyable film. If I helped you by making you wanna see it, click yes, if I convinced you not to see it click yes. Either way I've seen it and my recommendation is SEE IT NOW!
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator was the ultimate action/sci-fi explosion of the 80's.  It remains one of Arnolds best appearances under the brilliant writing/directing of James Cameron, who proved his protential to Hollywood with this film.  In fact almost everything was done well:  scripting, casting, editing, filmography, special effects.  You would never guess it was made on such a puny budget.  The Terminator launched the careers of it's cast and crew.  Arnold Schwarzenegger became an American movie icon.  Along with the incredible action story, the films human drama is touching and true to people.  The plots conclusion with the theme of predestination paradox works perfectly with the films level pacing.  Even if your not an action or sci-fi junkie, The Terminator is not to be missed.  (If you haven't seen it, see it soon before people start thinking you live in a cave.)  Don't miss the sequel.
B000001E18|5.0|Of all the tracks on the album Stay is my favourite. Shows Bono at his very best. The last track on the album by Cash should have been left out. Dirty Day is a wonderful tract to end this beautiful album.
0790729342|5.0|Before Riggs, before Braveheart, there was Max.  The Road Warrior is one of the best, if not the best action film in history, Austrailian or otherwise.  Sequel to the blockbuster Mad Max, this is the pivotal road rage flick.  Set in post-nuclear holocaust Austrailia, Max is a wandering survivalist who ends up defending a group of refiners from the savage Humongus.  The chase scenes are some of the best ever and the crashes make you want to walk to work for a week.  The characters are memorable and the story keeps you asking for more, and you get it.  Mel Gibson performes incredibly as the merciless Max, who's character has evolved into a cold, indifferent persona, thinking only of himself.  The film begins perfectly with the narrative opening and conlcudes in a race for survival in one of film history's most exiting chases.  Generally, The Road Warrior is a welcome treat for movie fans around the world.  Nothing quite like it has been made before or since.
B000001DTM|5.0|I rate this album as the best U2 album till date. Sorry Johsua Tree, step aside.
0345451325|5.0|Where do i get started on how good this book is? Any person that has played Halo for Xbox would love this book. They would understand what a grunt, hunter, elite, and jackel would look like when it came up in the book. Any non-halo players might be a little clueless about what they look like, but of course the story-line would make up for it. The brutal covenant forces were sent by their god to destroy all mankind throughout the universe, taking no prisoners. the humans are trying to make sure the covenant do not find any trace of the planet Earth and what it looks like, and where it is located. Outnumbered and outgunned, the humans seem to have little chance against the vicious beasts. But Reach holds a very guarded secret. It is the training ground for the \\"Super Soldiers\\" Code named SPARTANs. These Highly advanced warriors, specially bioengineered and technologically augmented, are the best in the universe - quiet, professional, and deadly. Now as the ferocious covenant attack begins, a handful of SPARTANs stand ready to wage the ultimate war. They will kill, they will be destroyed, but they will never surrender. And at least one of them - The SPARTAN known as the Master Chief - will live to fight another day on a mysterious artificial world called Halo...<br />I'm surely bad at using words but if that doesnt grab you then you should still buy this book. It is one of the greatest books i've ever read. This is like, bigger than the harry potter series.
B00006LFGD|1.0|I am tired of these artists putting out rehashed music.  It seems like all they do is put the titles of previously recorded music into a hat and pick out the order and put them on CD and then sell them to the public as &quot;new&quot; music.  I call it lazy.
0800141601|2.0|I usually enjoy the talents of Sean Connery and Richard Gere very much, but this movie needs more than their names on the marquee to make it good.  I know there are different versions of Arthurian Legend, but this story doesn't come close to telling the Arthur story.  Other than naming characters Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere, this movie bears very little resemblance to the known stories of King Arthur.  While I know screenwriters are allowed to be creative with their ideas, why name the characters Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere if they are going to completely change the story?  This movie is all right if you are in the mood to watch a romance set in medieval times (or if you are a HUGE fan of Sean Connery or Richard Gere).  But if you are wanting the story of King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, and Guinevere, this movie is absurd and not worth watching.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters about a month after it was released.  I have read the books extensively, and all I can say about the film is pure magnificence.  It may not follow the book to the letter, but so what.  Name me one movie, with the exception of the 1st LOTR, that even comes close.  I'll give you 5 minutes to come up with a response............actually, forget that, because I have already thought about it, and can't find a single one.  One question, are you the same people who hate Disney films, cause they don't follow the story....anyways back to the review.  The cinematography was nearly flawless.  The direction superb.  And when you realize that Peter Jackson did a movie this technically amazing, and with this much depth for around $33 million a movie, well it kind of puts Titanic at $200 million, and Harry Potter at over $100 million a movie into perspective.  Peter Jackson is showing every director who has ever been given a smaller budget to make a \\"Hollywood\\" film, how to do it.  And also showing up most other directors who in essence throw away $100 million dollar budgets to make their own \\"Hollywood\\" movie....not naming any names *cough* Michael Bay *cough* Pearl Harbor *cough*.  The acting was top notch, and not exactly what you would expect from a cadre of semi-unknowns.  Not that they are independant film actors, but I would not call this \\"Hollywoods\\" A-List.  When imagining Gandalf and Aragorn, I think I always have seen Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen's type of actor in either roll.  An amazing job of casting.  So to summarize, all of you who have given this movie a bad rating because it did not follow the book, give it a rest and just try to enjoy the movie for the masterpiece that it is.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|If you liked Godsmack's first two releases... then you'll like 2003's \\"Faceless\\" as well. While the rock & rolling is good; with Merrill's hard crunchy guitars and Sully's trademark vocals, this just seems to be \\"Part 3\\" of their familiar metal catalog. The song writing majority is down-right average... \\"I Stand Alone\\" and \\"Straight Out Of Line\\" have made it to the airwaves in Arizona (for good reason), but that's about it. I wish Godsmack and company would take some chances. I mean, their debut back in 1998 was awesome and was so different from anything else at the time. 3 albums to date and 35 songs later it seems that all the songs are written in the same vein. I must say that new-comer Shannon Larkin (drums) doesn't miss a beat. Larkin's playing is remniscent of an old Keith Moon from The Who in how he gets the whole drum kit involved in so many songs (not just the standard hi-hat and snare combo). All the tom-toms are used to their fullest and nothing in arm's reach is safe from being struck. Familiar themes in most of the featured Godsmack songs... anger, pity, being lied to, revengeful hate, [angry] in \\"...\\", loneliness in \\"I Stand Alone\\", and more of your basic self-inflicted misrey. A good album, but they need to change it up a bit (not on every song mind you)... the legendary bands are risk-takers and so far we haven't seen that from Boston's Godsmackers.
B00008NG5V|4.0|If you loved his first album, Brushfire Fairytales, this one will not disappoint. This guy's voice is pure sex. For the female audience, #10 makes this album a must have. I love his laidback style and catchy guitar - this guy is one cool cat.
B00000F5KH|5.0|I have forced friends and family to watch this film with me, people who offered varying degress of resistance to foreign film, road movies, and the consensus was unanimous: Centro do Brasil (Central Station) is a film of quiet power, rare genius and sensitivity. Ideologically, it falls midway between the extremes of the violent, gritty &quot;Cidade de Deus&quot; and the warm, romantic &quot;Bossa Nova,&quot; adding to these portraits its particular view of Brasilian daily life. Fernanda Montenegro (Dora) and Vincius de Oliveira (Josu) give completely honest and believable performances, and it is these performances, and the wonderful screenplay, which keeps the subject from deteriorating into melodrama. Each character has, for different reasons, been embittered and hardened by experience, and the film documents their emotional, intellectual, and spiritual breakthroughs in getting past their emotional crises. The characters' existential journey is mirrored in the geographical journey across Brasil, from gorgeous but scary Rio de Janeiro to rural central Brasil. There is no convenient &quot;fix&quot; to the characters' problems, and even religion is offered as but one possible diversion from life's problems, not a permanent solution to them. This makes sense, given the fact that Brasil's 185 million people are nominally Catholic but many are forced by poverty and other circumstances to live a more secular and pragmatic life (including the traditions and rituals of umbanda, candomble, Kardecism, etc). Ultimately, the film offers a message of hope that, if you can't completely turn your life around, you can at least try to change the things which prevent you from going any further. I find that perspective a lot more realistic, less patronizing than, say, a typical Hollywood &quot;on the road&quot; drama, where all the characters find their respective epiphanies en route to their destination, just before the final credits roll.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I'm a middled aged Disney animation lover who long ago gave up taking nieces and nephews to theatres as an excuse to see the new Disney...now I just go myself. I stayed away from Treasure Planet on the big screen because of the generally lukewarm reviews and mediocre box office. Big mistake.  <br />I don't understand why this one did so badly out there, but I think it marks a return to form for Disney after the disappointing (to me) Atlantis. Great characters and characterizations, and images that rival the best animés out there: dozens of inside jokes for film lovers, readers of Robert Louis Stevenson, or sci-fi fans; Emma Thompson as a sultry space-cat...jeez, what more do you need in a film?
B00004Z400|5.0|ok...first off, i am so sick of deftones being slumped in the whole rap metal/nu metal category! gosh! they are not metal! there is nothing metal about them, honestly! geez if old metal bands like Iron Maiden, etc... heard that,  i bet they'd laugh...gosh...deftones are also nothing like Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, or any other of those ...bands...Chino doesn't rap or sing for girls to take their shirts off and [stuff] like that like LB would...i hate that garbage. Chino has a sweet, emotional voice that can cut to a fierce shriek in a second. The band has a great post-hardcore sound that can be fast and hardcore or very mellow and emo and their drummer is awesome....you know all this Screamo stuff that's now getting popular? that's where i would classify these guys if i had to. they were just getting started a little earlier than the others.<BR>if you like Glassjaw, Finch, The Used, Thursday, The Beautiful Mistake, Poison the well, etc...listen to the deftones, especially this cd and Around The Fur...excellent...
B00003CXPD|5.0|Great character study of the human condition. One of the best movies ever made. Suitable for ages between 9 through 900!
B00008AWOD|4.0|I have to be honest, and say I wasn't overly impressed the first time I listened to this CD.  But the second listen made me prick up my ears.  There's a lot of soul bearing in the lyrics as well as some hard rocking music.  I keep hearing little bits of other bands in there - Radiohead and Bush come to mind immediately.  But this isn't, by any means, a rehash of those bands.  My favorite cuts are the title cut \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\", \\"The Bitter End\\" and \\"Plasticine\\".  These are angry young men, and they play their music that way.  And believe me, they do it very well indeed.
B00005JL78|5.0|Great flick. As good as Speilberg's AI.
B00008URYM|3.0|In my opinion American Life was the WEAKEST song on the new album. Included on here is an edit of that track, as well as a Calderone Remix of Die Another Day. Now, I for one despise EVERY SINGLE REMIX that CALDERONE has EVER done for Madonna...except this one! This one is actually good..really good in fact. It's easily one of the best DAD remixes. I find it kind of odd that they included a 9-minute remix on a 2 track single though...
B000092Q7O|5.0|I had to see this movie at a bizarre time of day and it was well worth the effort.  This is just a beautiful piece of work.  Adrien Brody's performance is wonderful.  He conveys such depths of emotion with a simple glance.  I usually do not like Holocaust movies but I really enjoyed this one.
B00004THAY|1.0|I was stunned to read so many positive reviews for this nearly horrible album. I recently had the misfortune to hear this album as I drove to a B.B King concert & me & my companions quickly had to take it out of the cd player & put in King's 'Live at the Regal,' a real, off-the-cuff, live, soulful blues album. My god, I think maybe there has to be a criteria for these reviews like if you don't know squat about blues music then you have no right to exclaim statements like 'This is as real as the blues get!' or 'A blues masterpiece!' concerning this overproduced, lifeless, soulless piece. I am admittedly a blues snob & prefer 1920's to 1950's blues but I am also a very open-minded person. All you first time blues listeners & Clapton fans here really REALLY need an education in blues history & quality. If this is the kind of blues music that is being embraced by the majority of people nowadays I say the battle has been lost. The only blues album worse than this one is possibly B.B King's late 1980's 'King of the Blues' disaster. Let me dumb it down for some of you: Saying 'Riding with the King' is a great, hell, even a 'Good' blues album is like saying Vanilla Ice really brought the rap artform to a higher level. Be patient! Give those old recordings by Charley Patton & Howlin' Wolf & Muddy Waters & Bessie Smith the effort in understanding they deserve. To me, the overproduced, layered, heartless sound of 'Riding with the King,' & some of your (fellow reviewers) ecstatic comments on it leaves a big old hole in my gut. If you only KNEW how good blues can get you'd all probably die realizing.
B00000DC10|5.0|I decided to download \\"The Shape Of Punk To Come\\" completely on a whim, based solely on the rave reviews I saw on this site.  To put it mildly, my decision was vindicated.  \\"The Shape Of Punk To Come\\" is one of those rare albums that both blow you away upon first listen and then get better with time.  It's loosely classifiable as punk, but you certainaly don't need to be a punk fan to enjoy it.  Nirvana, schmirvana: Kurt Cobain wouldn't have put out an album this diverse and genre-bending if he had lived to be a million.<br />I can't even put into words how powerful this album is, how much visceral impact it contains, how much utter steamrolling FORCE it hits you with.  Dennis Lyxzen's vocals are often pure venom, the guitars pummel you relentlessly, and David Sandstrom's drumming hits harder than a brick dropped from the top of the Empire State Building.  Listening to this album, it's obvious how much energy and conviction was put into each and every song.  This is music without rules, without reservations, and without apology.  I'd love to play it for the 98-pound, Good Charlotte T-shirt-wearing \\"punks\\" I see at the mall just to see the looks on their faces.<br />What's even more important than anything I've said above, though, is that Refused were intelligent and methodical about their sonic destruction.  As its title suggests, \\"The Shape Of Punk To Come\\" is a punk album in the truest sense of the word: it's harsh, it's abrasive, and it's rooted in a deep sense of antagonism toward the mainstream.  While all that's nice, it doesn't make for a classic album on its own.  Fortunately, there's a lot more to \\"The Shape Of Punk To Come\\" than stereotypical three-chord, two-minute testosterone fests.  Thanks to a level of creativity and musicianship high for any genre but stunning for punk, Refused showed a keen aptitude for composing memorable and interesting songs.<br />While suffering from no shortage of punkish aggression, this album is also filled to the brim with intense metallic heaviness, and Refused also threw in a few other genres just for good measure.  Songs like \\"Worms Of The Sense/Faculties Of The Skull,\\" \\"Protest Song '68,\\" and \\"Refused Are F***in Dead\\" boast jarring, angular structures that could make a guy with no neck bang his head, but that's not all.  The album is filled with melodic, ambient, and even jazzy interludes, providing a nice contrast from the mayhem that's often on display.  \\"Liberation Frequency,\\" my personal favorite, starts out with Dennis's subdued mantra of \\"We Want The Airwaves Back,\\" and then a barrage of paralyzing shrieks and piercing guitar noise comes out of nowhere.  The resulting dynamic is so dramatic you may well need a neck brace after hearing it for the first time.  In a strangely fitting move, the band decided to close out the album with an acoustic song, the oddly-titled \\"The Apollo Programme Was A Hoax.\\"  After the insane roller coaster ride preceding it, I kind of like hearing a calmer piece that ends everything on a mellow note.<br />Listening to these guys, I can't help but think about how tragic it is that they broke up so early, not to mention how tragic it is that I just discovered them about three months ago.  Unfortunately bands like Refused are too good to be on the radio, but this is what punk should be.  No, scratch that, this is what MUSIC should be: inventive, challenging, uncompromising, and unconcerned with the opinions of the masses.  The loss of a band like Refused truly is a loss for music.intense metallic heaviness, and Refused also threw in a few other genres just for good measure.

0345451325|5.0|Halo: the fall of reach was a great book.  If you liked the game halo you would love this book.  It goes into detail about the plot of the game.  Also this is a great book for anyone who loves action/fantasy/sci fi books.  I loved this book and i dont know anyone who didnt.
B000083E79|5.0|I love this CD, old and newer songs. I never get tired of listening to it, and highly recommend it.
0060278234|4.0|Sabriel was a gem-and Lirael is...not quite as good as Sabriel. It seemed to be me as if the whole book was tinged with predictability. Lirael's so-called secret birth isn't exactly so hush-hush and readers, if they have read Sabriel before, can easily guess at her true lineage. Everything from her looks to her abilities to her platonic relationship with Sam hints at--well, I don't want to spoil it yet! And although I haven't read Abhorsen yet, I can almost guarantee that Lirael will have fond feelings for Sam's friend Nick. The ending was also disappointing; it left me with a sense of incompleteness and dissatisfaction. I realize that this is where the third book comes in but the skill with which Lirael was rounded off was lacking. The only reason I give it 4 stars is to save Sabriel face.
B00008NG5V|4.0|I liked it a lot, but I'm not sure if I like it as much as the first album. This album is a bit too mellow in a way, it seems like Jack Johnson has gone a bit too far towards his surfing side.
B00005J4HH|5.0|This is one of the best albumns I've heard for a while. Every other review seems to compare with Radiohead, and yes there are some similarities, but I wonder why no-one has seen the simiarities with another great band .... the over the top rock operatics, extravagent chord changes, complex soft/heavy/soft song structures ... this could be early Queen! Put on A Night at the Opera or a Day at the Races, and you'll see the similarities.
B00008I8IF|5.0|I discovered the Jayhawks a couple of years ago, and own everything I've been able to get my hands on. Early Jayhawks music was influenced by fine musicians like the Byrds and Neil Young (in fact, the Neil Young guitar influence is occasionally glaringly obvious). For me, the greatest appeal is that here is a band that still writes *songs*, complete with melodies, harmonies and poetry. As I play \\"Rainy Day Music\\" over and over, I find more to love. Currently, the song \\"Will I See You In Heaven\\" has become my favorite; I think it may be the best song about the death of a friend that I've ever heard.
B000075BFK|4.0|This is a hot Pac cd, seeing that all but two to my knowledge are remixes.

0688163173|4.0|It is Hurricane Season 1954 and U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule have arrived on Shelter Island in Boston Harbor shortly before the arrival of a killer hurricane which is almost as menacing as the events which they are sent to investigate. The island houses a former civil war installation (and lighthouse important to the story) which has been transformed into Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. They are there to investigate the escape and disappearance of Rachel Solando, an inmate patient at Ashecliffe who murdered her three young children. There are cryptic codes to be unraveled and bizarre and unexplained happenings that are very unsettling to Teddy and Chuck. Furthermore, Teddy has a personal agenda to pursue while on the island and his own demons to confront.<br />The medical staff seems very secretive at times, and Teddy and Chuck soon conclude that they are being manipulated and that a substantial portion of the truth is being withheld from them. They also becomes concerned about the possibilty of secret experimentation being performed at the facility. The book is set at the time when controversy was rampant regarding the effectiveness of different treatment modalities for the mentally disturbed - traditional psychotherapy versus physical methodologies (lobotomies and electroshock) versus the newly emeging experimentation with psychotropic drugs - and discussion of these alternatives is an integral element of the plot. Unfortunately, this discusion was quite limited and superficial, probably in an attempt to maintain the fast pace of the action but at the expense of the possibility of a much richer and more nuanced although somewhat lengthier story.<br />The book is a very fast read, it contains a lot of dialogue and with the exception of Teddy most of the character development is limited to the minimum necssary to advance the narrative. Given the nature of the patients' and the staffs' personalties, often caricatures were sufficient in any event. Until the conclusion, I was wavering in my rating between two and three stars, but the shocking (althogh still depressing ) conclusion completely changed my view of the story and the author's technique. It also led me to believe that some of his storytelling methodology which I disliked was integral to the mood which he had been trying to create. (This is my first Dennis Lehane novel so I had no preconceptions.) In retrospect, the ending is foreshadowed, but as a reader caught up in the story the misdirection certainly worked on me. The closest analogy I can give is to the movie SIXTH SENSE, which you need to see again to reinterpret all the clues. This book is not nearly as well done, and the final chapters actually review a lot of the misdirection for you, but the impact for me was the same. Interestingly enough, a perusal of the thirty ... reviews available as I submit this review indicates that a clear majority of readers came to my conclusion but the reaction of a significant minority ranged from lukewarm to very disappointed. There are twenty-one five star ratings and in a real oddity no one until now has rated it four stars; the other nine reviewers came to the conclusion that it deserved only one to three stars. I definitely recommend the book but felt that the depressing nature of the subject matter and my desire for a more detailed story with more deeply drawn characters kept it from deserving the unqualified endorsement that five stars implies.sufficient in any event.

0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is a book that you will love or hate; there is no middle ground. The excellent use of dark humor will leave you rolling on the floor for quite some time if you are one that enjoys such humor. On the other hand, if you do not care for subtle ironic and dark humor then you will most likely find this to be one of the most painful reads in your life.<BR> The book revolves mainly around Ignatus. Ignatus is an obese man who lives with his mother in his thirties and has many strange ventures throughout the book. These ventures are absurd and he will basically leave turmoil wherever he goes. The people he meets then enter the story and you hear the outcome of what becomes of them after Ignatus has encountered them. Not all of the people he meets will come to a sticky end, but the book will touch on some issues using the characters to convey a message through some of the characters realizations.<BR> The book does not only hold excellent entertainment value but it is also a great piece of modernism that offers some of the characters as metaphors for issues or problems in our country that where apparent then, and some even today.<BR> I personally enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a dark outlook, and is able to laugh at dismal things. Also I believe that it is a good read because of all that it brings to light, and one should read it critically to see the points the book touches on.
B0000399WI|5.0|My fiance was turned on to the wonderful world of King with this movie. It knocked his opinion that Stephen King just wrote horror or gore right out of the water! From here we watched Stand By Me and this remains one of his all-time favorite movies. It features a star-studded cast and is a very poignant film. Definately breaks the Stephen King stereotype for those cynics that say he can't write anything good without a lot of blood and insanity (I like most of what he's written but that's not a blanket seal of approval!).
B00000GAIW|2.0|I really hate to give this a low rating because this is one of my all-time favorite albums.  So, I am rating the sound quality of this 1999 re-issue/remaster.  Quite frankly, it is terrible.  In an effort to remove the tape hiss they have sucked the life out of the music, in particular the edgy electric guitar work by Barre.  In addition, the recording volume is horribly low.  There is no chance of mixing any of these songs with songs from other CD's because of the low output volume.  Plus, the bonus tracks make no sense and have an irritating dialogue by Anderson himself that, believe me, you only want to hear once.    I bought this CD and kept my older 1984 version of \\"Aqualung\\" just for comparison.  While the 1984 surely has more tape hiss, I ended up keeping it and sold this lousy remaster.  What a shame.  I was so looking forward to a great remaster of this classic piece, especially to crank up \\"Aqualung\\", \\"Locomotive Breath\\" or \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\".    Please, please Mr. Anderson, read this and go to your producers and have them issue a decent remaster of this album before you are too old to give a hoot.  And only include bonus tracks that are alternate versions of songs ON THIS ALBUM!!!  And NO INTERVIEW!!!  I love this album.  I bought the vinyl LP when it first came out and I really would like to hear this pristine.  Leave a little tape hiss if you have to - just don't suck the life out of the music.  And beef up the rockers so they ROCK!!!  \\"Locomotive Breath\\" should not sound like you are listening to it coming from your neighbor's house across the street.    Until a new remaster comes out, my advice is to stick with the 1984 issue of this CD.
B00005V9HH|4.0|This was my first foray into Kevin Spacey's acting. What an initiation! This movie was thrilling from the first frame to the ironic, blood-chilling but makes-you-want-to-laugh because you didn't figure it out first end! Highly recommend. Great to watch more than once because you pick up hints subsequent viewings that you missed the first time around!
0385504209|4.0|While fundamentalists will find this book heresy, the rest of us who understand that history is written and re-written by those in power and seeking power will simply enjoy this book as a book. So, as a book, I must say it kept me reading until the wee hours of the night. It's not super complex and epic like \\"The Eight,\\" which is why I only gave it 4 stars, even though enjoyment wise it is definitely a 5, indeed, the action takes place over about two days total. It's a rollercoaster ride of action and intrigue that manages to impart tons of scholarly concepts and data in an interesting way at the same time.<br />The basic plot starts with a murder in The Louvre with a message given to a historian and cryptographer about a secret held in safe keeping for centuries. Because they're named by the dead man, the two main characters soon become fugitives on the run from the law as they go on a grail quest.<br />I really enjoyed the scavanger hunt aspect of the story, with the symbology historian character teaming up with a great female character who studied cryptology. As a team, they're as good or better than Mulder and Scully.<br />The bad guys are interesting, the facts are painstakingly researched, the author even gives a balanced view of the Catholic Church, which is finally trying to update its views and practices to remain relevant in the new milleneum.<br />While this is a great summer or airline trip read, it's not ultimately very fulfilling even though the concepts are enlightening. You forget most of it except for the fun facts such as why the Mona Lisa is smiling, as soon as you're done reading. Consequently, I wouldn't recommend that you pay the full hardback price. I'd advise you to wait until paperback or buy it used. Then, take it out to the pool and beware of getting a sunburn!
B00008H2LB|3.0|Linkin Park approach their sophomore album with a sure fire success plan - an exact replica of the massive selling &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; - so much for evolving your sound! Admittedly, Hybrid Theory was one of the better releases during the nu-metal boom, mainly due to LP's boundless energy and twin-vocalled attack. But that was 2000 but now, after the garage rock explosion and the return of metal, Mike Shinoda's monotone, dictionary rapping sounds VERY old hat, as do some of the recycled riffs on display. <BR>The saviour of this album, however, is Chester Bennington, his vocals switching from an angelic croon one second to a blood curdling scream the next, a truly wasted talent in this band of middle-of-the-road performers. <BR>There are a couple of stand-out moments on this album, namely the tracks &quot;Faint&quot; and &quot;Breaking The Habit&quot;, which strangely enough are the tracks which see LP straying most from their roots with a bit of sonic experimentation. The fast paced &quot;Faint&quot; enjoys, arguably, the most anthemic chorus you'll likley to hear this year while &quot;Breaking The Habit&quot; sees LP dropping the guitars and allowing to Chester to croon sweetly over a fast paced hip-hop beat. Excellent. <BR>All in all, the kids in hoodies who digged Hybrid Theory will be wetting themselves over LP's carbon copy remake, they rest of use will just shake our head in dismay at another soulless nu-metal album in an already saturated market.
B00006AW2G|5.0|\\"Let It Bleed\\" is quite possibly the Rolling Stones' best album; in any event it's one of their best. For a nine-track record, the disc shows all that the group can do by this point, while also serving as a look back on the sixties (it was made in '69) and a look forward to the seventies. Bookended by two of the group's best and biggest hits, \\"Let It Bleed\\" is a winner.<br />Structurally, the album can be looked at as going from reality into Stonesworld then back to reality. \\"Let It Bleed\\" starts off with \\"Gimmie Shelter\\", an eerie, spooky, drug-ladden look at the horrors of reality and the \\"dark side of the dream\\". There is more than love, Keith Richards is saying here: \\"Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away\\". This underside of flower power materialized when a fan was knifed at the infamous free concert at Altamont later that year.<br />\\"Love in Vain\\" serves a vehicle to take the album from reality into the familiar territory of Rolling Stones albums--there is still a melancholy, bitter twinge to this cover that keeps it from being in the same realm as the tracks that follow: \\"Country Honk\\", the countrified version of \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" that sounds OK once you get used to it, is pure Stones debaunchery. \\"Live With Me\\", which sports a great bassline, has Mick Jagger's familiar raunchiness and sexual innuendos; it's a standard Rolling Stones song about sex. \\"Let It Bleed\\", the title track, is of course a spoof on the Beatles' \\"Let It Be\\", which wasn't even released at the time of this album, so one wonders how the Stones knew about it. More typical, rudeness, crudeness, and a bit of tounge-in-cheek humor on this track, which is one of the album's highlights. (Good lyrics, too, I might add).<br />Side two of the original record is a bit closer to reality than side one, mainly because no songs deal with sex. \\"Midnight Rambler\\" is a piece of dangerous Stones, with Mick Jagger putting on another of his masks for a song about a violent outlaw. This issomething of a companion piece to \\"Gimmie Shelter\\" in that the idea of death and other horrors is the focus of attention, but in this case, Jagger is \\"in charge\\" wheras in the former song he needed shelter. The album's epic (until YCAGWYW), it doesn't measure up to \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" but is good nonetheless. <br />Out of the \\"Midnight Rambler\\"s wake comes Keith Richards' first solo vocal, the short and thoroughly enojyable \\"You Got The Silver\\". A bit ragged and start-and-stop, the song features some great guitar work, a confident vocal, and a good break in between \\"Rambler\\" and the songs that follow. It leads straight into:<br />\\"Monkey Man\\", a satrical self-portrait of the Stones' image by Mick Jagger, could well be the first truly self-conscious song penned by Mick and Keith. This song is, in my opinion, hands-down excellent. Great instrumental and ensemble work by the band, especially Keith Richards, and another superb vocal from Jagger (he tops it on the next song). \\"Monkey Man\\" also serves as the vehicle out of Stonesworld and back into the real world. It pokes fun at everything the band has done so far on this record, essentially shattering the illusions created thus far.<br />The last track on the album is the great \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", a true look at reality, and perhaps the mature conterpart to \\"Satisfaction\\". In essence, the song encaptualtes the more mature, worldly, and world-weary wisdom that people like Mick Jagger, John Lennon, and other sixties icons had gained by the end of the decade. It was 1969, there was war, rape, murder, love was not everything. Soon the Beatles would have broken up and the world would enter the seventies.  With the last two tracks, the Stones reflect on and satirize the masks they commonly put on in their songs.  \\"Let It Bleed\\" stands as not only a great album but a thought-provoking look at the decade (and group) that bore it. I recommend it.

B00006EXDM|5.0|Better than &quot;Forty Licks&quot; for the pacing and quality of the album, Hot Rocks is the best collection of the Stones at their peak.  Every song is a gem, the tracklist covers all the important songs, and you get what you need.  There's enough here to pique a new fan's interest and also serve as a handy set for the older Stones fan that wants the essentials for their car stereo, or whatever.  The remastered sound is excellent, for those who care.  My only complaint is that a few more songs--the best from &quot;More Hot Rocks&quot;, perhaps?--could fit on this set.  When I made a tape of my old 80's copy for the car (back before they had CD players in cars), I stuck &quot;She's a Rainbow&quot; on before &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot;, and it worked quite well.<br />For more information on the Stones' best albums, check out &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; and &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, which is where you should start your REAL Stones collection (please see my review of that album, entitled &quot;Stones Classic).
B00008S2VG|3.0|The first thing you really notice about this album is the strong use of guitar rifts - this gives mixed results. Often it generates some very spontaneously catchy songs, but all too often there is feeling of 'incompleteness'. <BR>Unfortunately the lyrics do not always match up to the rest of the song in question. However the media's destruction of the album is unfair and for a person of so many faces and changes this album does seem to be genuine and open in a way like none before it. It probably is better then music. But certainly not Ray of Light. The insparational creativeness of William Orbit worked so smoothly with the Madonna magic which makes her last. In my opinion working in that direction would be better as a sort of trance/dance feel. That i feel is much more madonnas thing and works alot better for her... she is trying to be something she isnt here and she just isnt rock. Instead of following the trends she should lead along with the help of budding fresh talents such as Orbit; and take her iconic status to new heights.

B00000GUZP|5.0|Yes, this album cover design by HR Giger is one of the greats that you will find featured in any book of album cover art. HR Giger came to New York around the time of his success with the movie 'Alien' and he met Blondie there, subsequently working with Debbie on this cover. I remember it being somewhat controversial when the album was first released, due to the alleged misogynistic qualities that some people saw in it. <br />It blew me away when I saw it there in the record store back in the early eighties, and I bought it unheard, just for the artwork. Much more effective on 12&quot; vinyl than on a CD of course. It still has a unique look, unlike any other cover I can think of. Giger also worked with Emerson, Lake and Palmer, but this remains easily his best album cover, perfectly conveying Debbie's timeless beauty, but also her slightly offbeat, punky persona.<br />Worth buying just for the art, which is why I have reviewed the cover. As for the music, it's ok, though I think Debbie Harry loses track a little. The later album 'Rockbird' is much better, and more in keeping with her Blondie sound. But anyway, like I said, get this one for the cover, or find a Giger book that has it.

0736041850|5.0|At first I thought this reference book wouldn't have everything I needed, because I routinely lift weights, with good knowledge of it.  But I was wrong.  This advisable book will strengthen your exercises involving your muscles, especially with weightlifting, and has helped me promote more growth instead of overtaxation of the muscles.  <br />First off, I must say that this book has mostly every effective exercise that will stimulate your muscles, and gives you an idea shown from VERY detailed drawings which muscles are being used.  They will also show you an idea of the type of range of motion, including the muscles being worked the most, and the secondary muscles being worked the least. <br />This book is also good for a lot of aerobic type exercises that you can perform with ease.  <br />The two aspects of this book that helped me out the most was the descriptions of the muscles being worked and the advice from the author that explained how to do the exercise in good form, and at the same time getting an intense workout.<br />Seeing the ultimate exercises can definitely motivate you to work at your best effort in working out, without overdoing it.  This is the number one way, with no doubt, to get more out of your workout.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie, the (deserving) winner of an Academy Award for Best Animated Film, got far less attention than it deserved in the fall of 2002 (when Disney famously botched its release--its peak theater count was somewhere around 151 at a time when even outright flops like \\"Extreme Ops\\" could muster up more screens for a week or two).  In fact, when it arrived in my town in the early part of November, there was almost no advertising, and the theater didn't even bother putting up a poster for it--and the place was packed.<br />And it was packed each time I went back to see it... and packed again when it returned to theaters at the end of March.<br />Make no mistake:  This is a movie that audiences love.  Don't be scared off by your preconceptions about anime, or comments like \\"it's too frightening for my kids.\\"  Every kid over the age of five I've seen watching this movie ends up loving it--including boys (one of them, an eight year old, ended up bouncing up and down in his seat at the end, telling his Dad, \\"I knew you'd like it!  I told you we should see it!\\"  How can you not like enthusiasm like that?).  This isn't some sort of hyper-violent pornography--it's a movie about people doing what people do, even when those people happen to be giant frogs begging for tips.  It's funny, smart, a little scary, and one of the few movies that can be called \\"sweet\\" without the added caveat \\"May induce severe diabetes and tooth rot.\\"<br />(As for you anime fans--well, doubtless you've all seen it, and you've got your opinions.  But I for one prefer this movie to \\"Princess Mononoke,\\" for the simple reason that \\"Mononoke\\" is an easier film to admire and be in awe of than to actually like.  \\"Mononoke\\" is more important, and definitely not a family film--but \\"Spirited Away\\" is more enjoyable.  Both are must-sees.)<br />The only complaints that I have is that, first, Disney stuffed so many ...trailers onto the first disc (of which only three, the ones for \\"Kiki's Delivery Service,\\" \\"Castle In The Sky,\\" and \\"Finding Nemo,\\" were of any interest to me) is that the video quality is somewhat impaired--it's a good transfer, but with some edge enhancement.  Secondly, apart from the making-of special that aired on Japanese television (which gives us the rare treat of seeing Miyazaki-san at work), the extras on Disc 2 are definitely not worthy of something Disney calls \\"a feature-packed deluxe special edition.\\"  Only in the dreams of Disney's marketing department.  There's barely more than ninety minutes of content on disc 2, and considering that 28 minutes of that is taken up entirely with trailers and commercials (which get very boring very quickly--like, say, after two or three minutes), and another 45 with the Japanese making-of special, what's left isn't really worth watching more than once.  Still, Disney did at least include subtitles and the original Japanese audio, if you prefer your animation subbed, and they also were nice enough to present the movie in anamorphic widescreen (where a lot of studios would have said, \\"family film,\\" and done a blah 4:3 transfer from flawed elements).  This film is a must-see and a must-own.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The Stones got into a beautiful rut from 1968-1972, creating their best known, and most revered works. Of Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, &amp; Exile On Main Street, I find Let It Bleed the superior. From the opening rocker 'Gimmie Shelter' to the perfect finale that is 'You Can't Always Get What You Want', Let It Bleed is a rock masterpiece. Love In Vain is THE perfect Robert Johnson cover. While I respect and immensly enjoy all of Robert Johnson's work, this is far superior to the original, because of the minor chords the Stones added to make the song more melodic. Country Hhonk is the only dispensible song on this record, and probably should have been Honky Tonk Woman. You Got The Silver is my favorite song done by Keith. Monkey Man is quite possibly on of THE BEST Stones songs ever recorded, and has my favorite breakdown of any song ever (the slide riff). YCAGWYW is a perfect ending song.
B00008CLOA|3.0|Not as sonically resonant as I was lead to believe from an NPR review.
B000002B35|5.0|What really burns me up are all these armchair critics that don't know their tailend from a hole in the ground.  For some of these know-it-alls it is very apparent that they just didn't get it.  First, to complain about the crowd noise is ludicrous since this is a LIVE CD!!!  WYSIWYG!!!  If you don't like crowds or live concerts, then DON'T go or buy it!  Second, the way that all of the performers clicked and complimented each other was fantastic.  They didn't get older, they got BETTER!  Third, to suggest that this was done entirely for money is totally absurd.  The main performers are so well off that they never have to play another concert or cut another CD EVER AGAIN!  They perform because they love their job.  The thrill and rushes one gets while performing live on-stage is beyond comprehension unless you have ever done it.  It is my humble opinion that most if not all of the band members would do it for a fraction of the money just because they achieve satisfaction by making people happy.  In conclusion, I first heard this CD while I was stationed in Germany from 1994-1996 and was fascinated not just by the packaging, but also the concert book complete with pictures from the concert as well as the credits.  When I saw that it had been released on VHS, I knew that this was without a doubt a must have for anyone's collection that enjoyed great music/concerts.  One point in my favor is that I was lucky enough to watch it on a 32\\" Widescreen 16:9 TV with surround sound and was totally blown away by not just the audio, but the video as well.  My only regret is that had I known that Pink Floyd was going to give this performance in England, I would have gone since I was not that far away.  A big thumbs up to Pink Floyd and the rest of the artists for giving us yet another special piece of their legacy.  Cheers!!!
B000001GAO|5.0|I'll keep this brief.  This performance of Mozart's K.V. 626 Requiem Mass is powerful, moving, uplifting and sombre at the same time.<br />I particularly love this version because of the &quot;Lacrimosa&quot; performance.  Most composers rush through this simple piece, but this orchestra plays it slowly, as it is meant to be, funereal.  Close to perfect!
B00008WG3U|4.0|NOFX is an undeniably fun band to listen to. Their raucous riffs coupled with guttural lyrics amount to nothing less than splendid musical mayhem. However, as non-fans are quick to point out, their lyrical content is generally unsubstantial & occasionally moronic. But wait a minute! As Mike declares in \\"Franco-Unamerican\\", he has perused the work of knowledgable political scientists like Zinn & Chomsky, & with this album, incorporated his subsequent geopolitical concern into songs like \\"The Idiots Are Taking Over\\", \\"Irrationality of Rationality\\", & \\"Regaining Unconsciousness\\", an inspired tune that attacks the passivity of Americans in witnessing the erosion of their own civil liberties. I don't feel that NOFX never had any worthwhile material before this album (I own them all plus most 7\\"'s). I just think they've never had quite as much to say as they do with \\"The War On Errorism\\". Buy it up, kids!
6305320802|5.0|I had never seen 'Oklahoma' before ordering the DVD recently.  I have since watched it many times.  Even though it was made about 10 years before 'The Sound of Music', Oklahoma is slightly more oriented towards an adult audience.  The music in Oklahoma is great and gets better to me the more I watch it.  I also liked it visually.  The acting and dancing do not disappoint.  A positive mood is definitely created and sustained.<br />The story is fair enough.  It primarily revolves around the rivalry Curly and Jud have for Laurey.  It is set in Oklahoma just before Oklahoma joined the Union.  The character of Jud Fry adds a more somber tone to the movie though it is dealt with alternatively both humorously and darkly.  Curly mocking Jud (and Jud unwittingly joining him) by singing 'Jud Fry is Dead' is classic.  Themes such as pornography, sexual promiscuity, and murder are subtley touched on giving it more of an adult air.  I consider it a kid friendly movie just not as innocent as some might suspect.<br />I wish the DVD had more 'extra' material (more background, etc.) in it but this is still a good one for people who like Rodgers and Hammerstein.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's new album is great!  All the songs are good, there's not a filler track in sight.  She has grown and matured into a great artist with this album.
B00000099Y|4.0|Check out the 1-star ratings between the 21st and 39th reviews for a good laugh.<br />Anyways, some people are just too stupid to figure music out.  Perhaps you should check genres before you buy new music so you know what the heck you're talking about.  There is a reason it shows the &quot;People who purchased &lt;this album&gt; also purchased the following&quot;... to show you what other bands with which this one is aligned.  People who complain on how &quot;Maynard doesn't sing,&quot; &quot;This music is chock-full of teenage angst,&quot; &quot;There's so much sound effects,&quot; have no clue on music, period.  Tool is industrial metal/rock.  Listen to other bands like Tool (NiN comes to mind) and you'll get an idea of what they're all about.<br />The review by Chris Pollard is by-far one of the best reviews on this album I've ever read.  It was posted 3/6/03.  Definitely check it out. For a great laugh, though, check out the review posted on 1/23/03... &quot;If you really love music, don't waste your time with 'Aenima', or as it should be called 'Enema'!&quot;  I can't help but feel this pitiful person doesn't understand Tool in any way, shape or form.  Why their review is up, I'll never understand.<br />I didn't give this CD 5 stars simply because of the fillers.  Although they add flavor to the cd, they may be used a little too much.  But putting &quot;Stinkfist&quot; as the first track was definitely a great idea; it gives the listener an idea of what they're in for.  My favorite Tool CD (with Lateralus and Opiate on its heals).
0808581945|4.0|A Clockwork Orange expresses the fears of Burgess in a way that the reader eventually comes to sympathize with the main character, Alex. Even though he dotes upon raping and stealing, the end leaves the reader wanting a better life for him. Afer he is taken to prison when his friends turn their backs on him, a certain attachment forms to Alex as he is subjected to Ludovico's Technique, one in which his free choice is taken away. Violence soon makes him want to vomit and commit suicide, along with the classical music he once loved. The moral questions raised in the story about the dreadfulness of having free will taken away from any person raises a bold emotion in anyone reading the story. The haunting emotions Alex feels when he leaves the prison gives an eerie feeling that can't be shaken. However, the ending leaves a satisfaction and a somewhat renewed confidence in those that were once thought to have been so horrible. <br />This is a perfect summer read for those long nights. It is nothing close to a bedtime story, but one that will keep you turning the pages for hours. Absolutly mind-catching.
B000068CNX|5.0|If you love &quot;Friends,&quot; you'll love this collection. Before I purchased Season 1 and Season 2 on DVD, I bought &quot;The Best of Friends.&quot; Some of the better episodes aren't on the &quot;Best&quot; but the complete season DVDs leave nothing out. <BR>The only improvement I would make is to add some better extras-perhaps with the cast and some deleted scenes. Otherwise, you know what you're getting if you are a fan of the show.
B0000931OG|3.0|It's difficult to review any album by Blur without any introduction to the band's history and amazing musical feat which becomes apparent in a chronological examination of its recent releases. Before Damon Albarn was 2-D of the Gorillaz, recording with African musicians in Mali, and trading his traditional pop sensibilities and social commentary and for dub reggae and hip-hop, he was the lead singer and gifted songwriter of Blur; Britain's era-defining pop band of the 90s.<BR> Abolishing the brit-pop movement, which they themselves invented and inspired with Parklife, the art-school boys from Cholchester embarked on a difficult journey of self-rediscovery with their eponymous album that explored American garage rock. Covering an amazing amount musical ground while retaining their superb musicianship and excellent song structure, they were able to successfully re-invent themselves and achieve some popularity in the states. That being said, the bar for any release by Blur was set pretty high. <BR> Albarn and Co. followed their self-titled release in 1999 with 13. Involving a personal relationship crisis and departure from their long-time producer and collaborator, the recording of 13 was marked by great effort, but difficult execution as tensions and musical difference between Albarn and the band's talented guitarist Graham Coxon began to tighten. In addition, the techno-inspired production didn't quite give the musical and emotional range 13 deserved and with a few misplaced tracks, it fell slightly short of becoming the affectionate masterpiece the band had the potential for. That not withstanding, when the differences in musical judgments were minimal and the production served up the songs' best interests, 13 shined and showed the band's ability to cope with difficulty and make some of the most gorgeously melancholic songs in years. The recording sessions were marked by such emotional burden that Albarn had to temporarily withdraw from Blur and direct his talents towards Gorillaz, a world-wide phenomenon that was a superb attempt at fusing different musical genres ranging from thrash-pop to dub and hip-hop. <BR> Recorded largely without the band's lead guitarist, Think Thank was to make up some of the unevenness on the previous release. Recorded in Morocco and Devon, the album promised to be \\"musically adventurous but more commercially potent than the band's difficult 1999 album, 13\\" according to the Britain's \\"Q\\" music magazine. It's hard to call the album adventurous since for the most part, the band isn't exploring any completely new territory here - other than managing to retain their sound without Coxon's guitar input - but nonetheless, this is a sound of a band happily moving on and getting through the turbulent time of 13. Highlights include \\"Ambulance\\", a rather dark and moody opener that's cleverly followed by \\"Out of Time\\", an earnest ballad that stands as one of the album's strongest, most clear moments. \\"Crazy Beat\\" and \\"We're Got a File On You\\" are upbeat, Song 2-esque thrash-pop that sound like \\"Chinese Bombs\\" from Blur and \\"5/4\\", \\"Punk\\" from Gorillaz. The stronger moments of the album, the fervent \\"Sweet Song\\" and \\"Out of Time\\" could also benefit from some musical collaboration and input from former guitarist Graham Coxon. The delightful closer \\"Battery In Your Leg\\" shows the dimension Coxon's splendid guitar work can add to these songs. In addition, \\"We've Got a File On You\\" and \\"Crazy Beat\\" don't seem to quite fit the album's overall mood and \\"Moroccan People's Revolutionary Bowles Club\\" and \\"Jets\\" would've probably worked better as B-sides albeit a fine saxophone coda by Mike Smith on the latter. <BR> Nevertheless, it's a solid effort marked by sober sincerity and some heartfelt ballads that could satisfy the fans who awaited some positive closure to 13. They might also enjoy the hidden track (placed before the opening track), which features a cameo by Phil Daniels, the star of Quadriopehia and the famous voice on Parklife title-track. The growing Gorillaz fan base might also find this release worthwhile. It's sad that Graham Coxon was politely told to leave the band though there is some hope to his return. Given the bands history, its musical diversity and how hard they constantly tried to re-invent themselves throughout their career, it's hand not to expect something more out of Blur that along with a handful of bands in the late 90s, made and hopefully will still make music that matteres...all Hail To The Thief!
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is a FANTASTIC read!...  A heartbreakingly dramatic yet hilariously funny satire on the simple ... ideas of scientists.  It's just as good as Slaughterhouse-five, if not better!  Jonah, the protagonist, and every other character in the book is not only memorable but realistic.  And you actually feel for them.  Bokonon is a brilliant religion!  It seriously makes you stop and think about the world around you.  Believe me, at the end of Cat's Cradle you'll be begging for more!!!  It's probably my favourite book.  And I guarantee you'll love it!!!

0671015206|3.0|This is a novel in which one can learn how to be successful and hopefully one day be their own millionaire. It's a quick read and a very informative book. It's full of typical millionaire stereotypes and how to spot a millionaire in your own neighborhood.
0060012358|5.0|The Amazing Maurice (a cat), some educated rats, and a stupid looking boy have been running a con involving plagues of rats and a kid who pipes them away for a price.<br />Sounds simple, but this is form the imagination of Terry Pratchett. The cat and rats can think and talk (the rats have been eating the garbage behind the wizardry school). The title characters have just arrived in a strange new town. There seems to already be a plague of rats although Maurice and company cannot find any.<br />If there are no rats, who is stealing all of the food? Where did the rat tails come from that the Rat Catchers have been turning in? What is really behind everything? Can the boy be as stupid as he looks?<br />All of these questions, and more, are answered in typical Pratchett style in this new tale of the Discworld.<br />A quick and entertaining read (with uncharacteristic chapters) that catches the reader at the start like a terrier catching a rat, and doesn't let go until it's all over (like a terrier with a rat). A must read for Pratchett fans.
B00003CXXM|4.0|To my surprise, the movie is much more entertaining than I expected. The plot is great, and so is the cast. Despite the relatively few action scenes (Matt is in no way an action star or a James Bond), I got connected to it real fast and enjoyed it very much. In short, recommended!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Finally there is something good to listen to.  It is hard to find music that is as chill and relaxed as this.  It is truly a breath of fresh air.
0393312836|3.0|A Clockwork Orange was a book like none of its kind. Since none of the characters are easy to relate with, we have look to the themes for it to make the most sense to us. The ideas of free will and revenge is what leads to the conclusion of A Clockwork Orange, a conclusion that might have been a surprise to most who have read it. I enjoyed reading it, yet would only want people with open minds to read such a novel. If you can see through all the violence and rape, you will understand the main idea that Burgess is trying to get across to those that dare to read it.
0671015206|3.0|This book has taught me so much about millionaires and their lifestyles.  I always thought they were the ones living in large homes and driving the expensive cars but I was wrong.  Most are self-made millionaires and are very intelligent.  They are frugal and know how to invest and use their money.  It's also not impossible to become one. You'd just have to be willing to work hard and learn to plan and build wealth.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Having never heard Jack Johnson before, I picked up his latest CD based on a glowing magazine review.  I was not disappointed!  This a is a mature and engaging piece of work.  The music is spare and the arrangements are simple - just guitar, bass and drums.  No blasting over-produced songs here.  Johnson's voice is understated and his lyrics are thoughtful and heartfelt.  Jack Johnson is the antidote to all those forgettable boy-bands and head-bangers dominating the charts today.
0767802624|4.0|Enjoyable movie with great performances from Tommy Lee Jones and even Will Smith
B0000931OK|5.0|Blur's getting less electric guitar-ey since Graham Coxon left and uses more varied instruments. This is a natural progression from 13 and is more mellow with Damon Albarn's vocals getting more attention.
B000059H99|1.0|I know many think this was a great movie but it's not for me
B000089RVX|3.0|Everyone keeps calling this a Christian record. I see nothing Christian about it. The songs are alright... I guess. This album is just a bunch of self pitty, &quot;I need money, I've had such a hard life, listen to my lyrics&quot; album. Its just a depressing album. Its not a Christian album... All I have to say.

She's hopelessly unorganised and forever getting herself into embarassing situations. Helen Fielding has produced a lovely book, that makes you feel better about your slip up as Bridget always manages to do it much worse.  Do look out for pages such as Bridget's attempt to get to work on time but hopelessly ending up late and her attempt at cooking. You'd laugh yourself silly.<BR>A definate must read for every girl.
B00008H2LB|5.0|One word to describe 'Meteora', WOW!<br />I bought this record a week ago and it's not left my CD player since. Every song is joy to listen to and being someone who normally destests the harsh sounds of rock and the thrashing vocals, that's saying something.<br />Linkin Park impressed me with Hybrid Theory, earned my respect with the visionary Reanimation and now with Meteora, they have solidifed my opinion of them as makers of incredible music; effortlessly and seamless blending different genres of music and making it into their own distinct and frankly amazing sound.<br />Thumbs up all the way!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|what threw me for a loop when i read the description on the dvd case was the demonic rabbit.  who came up with that idea?  i cant begin to understand the imagery in the film but i loved it.  this film is funny, no, hilarious.  but also dark and disturbing and sad.  the last sequence of the film was ... beautifully tragic and sad.  whoever did the cinematography on this film should've gotten some award for it.  and the director too, i thought his direction was brilliant also.  i was stunned by the beautiful images that floated across my screen and into my conscious and subconscious, b/c now i can't get it out of my head, like a good film should.  it would be a mistake to at least sit down and watch it.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I was in my friend's car, and the only cd's he had were SIx Degrees... and Megadeath.  I had never heard it, so I asked him to put in Six Degrees... and i was absolutely amazed.  I termed \\"The Glass Prison\\" as the ultimate song.  This album totally blew me away.<br />I now have almost all of their albums.  Yes, Scenes from a Memory is probably their best overall cd, but Six Degrees has, in my opinion, their best songs.  Blind faith truly is, the perfect song.  Perfectly put together, emotional, awesome riffage, soloing, interlude, the works.  The glass prison is probably my favorite metal song of all time.  Misunderstood is also very awesome, kinda wierd, but still incredible.  The great debate is also an awesome metal song, and disappear is probably the saddest song (melodically) that I've ever heard (thats a good thing). One bad thing, though, are some parts on disk 2.  Some parts sound kind of cheesy or lame, even though some other parts are really cool.  I guess thats just my taste in music though, some elements of \\"prog rock\\" i dont totally like.  But the good overwhelmingly makes up for the bad.  The opening to \\"the test that stumped them all\\" is crazy heaviness.  Also is \\"war inside my head.\\"  I definitely think that Dream Theater is making better and better music.<br />One of the main reasons why i think this album is so incredible is because it can appeal to the common music listener who tends to only like the more mainstream rock; it serves as a bridge between straight up good rock music and metal and progressive rock, and shows the layman that most music these days is made by some really mediocre musicians.  It has totally risen my standards in music, and i have definitely become a better musician from listening to Dream Theater.  This CD changed my perspective on music, and the music is so good that anyone who likes any kind of rock or prog rock should buy it.  5 stars.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Here you've got 27 #1 Beatles hits from &quot;Love me do&quot; to &quot;The long and winding road&quot;.<BR>You can hear how innovative were the Beatles and the fact they combined innovation with chart success is really rare.<BR>For example the electric guitar feedback in the &quot;I feel fine&quot; intro made the song.<BR>The first &quot;Hard day's night&quot; guitar chord made the song too.<BR>And &quot;Come together&quot; gets a very special intro too! No one could imagine that a song could start this way before.<BR>The Beatles are probably the only one group we can really call a GROUP and not a lead vocalist and others playing behind like most of ordinary groups.<BR>Then, John Lennon sings &quot;Come together&quot;, Paul McCartney: &quot;Yesterday&quot;, George Harrison: &quot;Something&quot; and Ringo Starr &quot;Yellow submarine&quot;.<BR>In every song you can hear a small different detail in each verse, and when you like it you will be surprised that you can listen to that song, waiting for that small detail in the 3rd verse for example.<BR>This CD has been digitally remastered and the sound is better and deeper than in the other CD's still not remastered.<BR>Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus is a great band i must say, but this album is very different than their older stuff.  It happens like clockwork in many bands; they start off hardcore, creative, and heavy, and slowly move towards less creative and more mainstream music.  If you were a fan of fungus amongus or S.C.I.E.N.C.E., you will be dissapointed with Morningview.  But, this album deserves four stars, because the songs are still good, and if you had never heard Incubus's older stuff, you will most likely like this.  The last song, even though very slow, has a mellowness and trippiness that is very cool.  There are songs on this that will please any rock fan, but its not their best work.  Go for S.C.I.E.N.C.E, an amazing hard rock album.
B000002H33|5.0|I really got started into Metallica with their newer stuff (\\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\"), both of which are decent, but when I heard this, I was hooked.  It's tied with \\"Ride The Lightning\\" as my (close) second favorite Metallica album (after the black album).  I have to say, every song except \\"Disposable Heroes\\" is top-notch.  The aforementioned track is great instrumentalism, but is just too fast for my tastes.  The rest is a little slower, which (in my opinion) displays the heaviness of the riffs and percussion to the fullest.  \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" is one of those songs that starts off kinda soft and gets heavier as it goes on, demonstrating the incredible versatility of this band.  \\"Orion\\" is void of any vocals, allowing one to totally focus on the brilliant instrumentalism.  All in all, this album is one hell of a triumph of Metallica.  After hearing albums like this and Lightning, I begin to understand why so many people are so disappointed with their newer stuff ...  My advice, in short:  get ...\\"Master of Puppets\\" today!  If you already have it, you know good musicianship.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Great work by Linkin Park. I bought 2 versions, one comes with the DVD and one doesn't. Both are for my friends, who are LP fans. They just love this album. I watched the DVD, the making of meteora, which is very entertaining. They explain how they got the album done. The enhanced CD itself is very good. If you're an LP fan, this is a must-buy.
B00006BXI0|5.0|Symphony X introduced me to progressive power metal, and thanks to them, I've began experimenting with other bands of the genre.  Of the three SX albums I own (this one, &quot;Odyssey,&quot; and &quot;Twilight In Olympus&quot;), this is my personal favorite, just slightly edging out &quot;Odyssey.&quot;  There are at least three songs that I'd categorize as timeless classics on here (&quot;The Accolade,&quot; &quot;The Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot; [the whole 20 minutes of it], and &quot;Candlelight Fantasia.&quot;  I've stated in another review that I'm not an authority on power metal, so this review could be directed at those like me just getting a foot in the door with this genre.  Buy this, you won't be disappointed.
B000089RVX|4.0|I bought this CD after listening to their songs on the radio, and on the soundtrack daredevil. This is a new group, and they have the potential to go further. Interesting enough. This wasn't a bad buy for me.
B000050IE6|5.0|I'm just getting into melodic death metal, so bear in mind this probably won't be the definitive review of this album.  Basically, there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before, except (this may have been said before) this is a great intro to Opeth and melodic death in general.  It's a fine mix of heavy stuff with brutal growling and light melancholic acoustic work.  There is a great deal of talent and versatility in this band, which is why I highly recommend this Swedish band to anyone.
B000002JEV|5.0|Enough people have written about this CD so I can't add much more.  I will however, ask the listener to imagine you've never heard Led Zeppelin before, and then listen to this disk.  I say this because the audience in these recordings have never heard many of these songs before, so it's all new to them.  Interestingly, &quot;Black Dog&quot; (the best version I've ever heard, btw) gets more enthusiastic audience response than &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;  I don't believe that would happen today.  <br />That little observation is my basis for why this is a great disc to own - you will have something special.  Also, the fact that most of the songs are live is a major bonus.  I gave 5 starts because if you love (or just like) this band, you need to have these recordings in the collection.
B00006L83N|5.0|Strangely enough, I first heard about Symphony X while looking for Opeth albums on this very site.  I picked up a copy of this album (ONLY Symphony X album in the store!!!) while waiting on delivery of \\"Divine Wings of Tragedy\\" from Amazon.com.  I was AMAZED.  The instrumentalism found on this masterpiece is simply incredible.  It's obvious that these New Jerseyans put a great deal of time and effort into these songs, and the result is absolutely fantastic.  The 24-minute epic \\"The Odyssey\\" is a triumph in its own right.  The song starts off with an instrumental overture that could have come right out of a film about Homer's tale.  Russell Allen's lyrics about Odysseus' journey are incredible; it really is difficult to tell a fantasy story like this over power metal riffs and still sound good, but if anyone can do it, it's Russell.  My overall favorite is \\"Accolade II\\" (fitting, as \\"The Accolade\\" was my favorite song on DWOT).  With the exception of the last song, I love them all.  This album has a special place in my collection, and I have no doubts that my Symphony X collection will grow very quickly from the three albums I possess currently.  I just wish these guys' CDs were easier to find in stores!!!
B00008WG3U|3.0|After the release of \\"Pump up the Valuum\\", I was wondering if my favorite band, NOFX, had started a decline of its own. The music sounded uninspired and wrote w/o much effort. <br />NOFX's new record, \\"War on Errorism\\", brought back that good ol' punk anger that is found in \\"Punk in Drublic\\". With the actions of presibutt Bush, Fat Mike now has somethin to complain about. He also comments on the state of the punk/music scene today. I couldn't agree more.<br /> The songs are fast, tight and original; with much better solos than the last record. Still, the album lacks inspiration, and aside from the opening track, I had a dejavu sort of feeling about it.  But I still listen...I reviewed this a five before, but i think i got ahead of myself on that.
B000089RVX|2.0|I find this CD extremely difficult to listen to because of the &quot;urgency&quot; (sorry, but that's the most descriptive word for it) of nearly every song.<br />That urgency makes it very fatiguing to listen to more than two songs.
B00005B36H|5.0|Although Tool has a [great] band ever sense their first realease (Opiate) this CD towers over the rest of them. The intensity of the grudge will have you sucked in within a few minutes. Even the more mellow song Parabol fits in great into the cd as it leaks into the song Parabola which shows you that you don't know what great stuff is waiting around the corner of this CD. By far this is the BEST CD ever made by any band anywhere. This is the CD that first got me into this band, and as soon as I heard what was on it I rushed out to get the rest of thier CDs. This album however was so good that I listened to it 2 or 3 times a day for six months. Thats no exageration.
B000003N7K|5.0|This album is just as good as everybody else (84 as of today) says it is. Johnny Hartman's obscurity in the non-jazz world is a crime. If you play this for your significant other and can't get some action before the 31 minutes is over, something's askew with one of you. This one can be addictive, so be careful. Read a dozen of the earlier reviews for song details and interesting musical explanations. I only declare &quot;It Works!&quot; and leave it to others to explain &quot;how.&quot;

B00005JLR2|4.0|I watch 'em all.  With a 4 year old kid, I've been buying every animated Disney film they put on dvd.  Hey, I like 'em myself.  Anyway, they hit a big dry spell a few years ago, so my expectations for Treasure Planet weren't very high.  Not including all the straight to video crud, their big budget features just hadn't done much for me lately.  Atlantis, the Tigger movie, Emperor's New Groove, Lilo & Stitch, that horrible Piglet movie I saw at the theater a few weeks ago....I mean, the BS was really stacking up.  It wasn't bad animation, but there's no magical feeling you get watching them.  Then here came Treasure Planet and opened up doors I thought Disney had closed for good.  There's a sense of adventure to it, it's not predictable, the characters don't feel written.  I've watched it several times and I still want to see it again.  To me, this is Disney's best work since Aladdin.  I can't give it 5 stars because it's not perfect, but only for a couple of reasons. B.E.N. is annoying, and I think that the climax on Treasure Planet just kind of lacked something.  But the buildup of the story and the first half the film is just flawless.  Check this one out.  It's well worth it.
B00005JKPF|4.0|The defining characteristic of \\"X2: X-Men United\\" is the approval bestowed upon it by fans of the origin comic books; whereas the original \\"X-Men\\" movie was seen as truncated and flat in parts, the sequel delivers the goods fans craved: a full half-hour more action, and a dazzling opening sequence that features a mutant attack on the U.S. President. The mutant is a newcomer: Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) a German circus runaway with blue skin that can bounce and teleport at alarming speeds. Director Bryan Singer watched his first \\"X-Men\\" effort start with a slow burn of introducing the setup and character; \\"X2\\" had the \\"geeks\\" bouncing out of their seats.<br />What follows is a superhero movie on par with \\"Spider-Man\\" and the best parts of the \\"Superman\\" and \\"Batman\\" series. \\"X2\\" is a too busy and farfetched, but it keeps twisting, and it features a great villain in Col. Styker (Brian Cox) a military scientist bent on erasing the mutants from the Earth. In theme and approach, \\"X2\\" is similar to the second and best installment of the \\"Star Trek\\" series, \\"Wrath of Khan\\" -- \\"X2\\" features a large sacrifice from a major character, and serves as a launching pad for future installments. Just about anything could happen in \\"X3,\\" and that's a testament to how well this movie is structured. Every important mutant is still on the playing field. <br />After the Nightcrawler attack -- a spectacular, dizzying assault through the hallways of the White House right to the president's desk -- \\"X2\\" sends its characters in various directions. Stryker, who has the president's ear, convinces the chief that the mysterious mutant school run by wheelchair-bound Xavier (Patrick Stewart) could be behind the attack. The real source is a nifty twist, but Stryker nonetheless storms the school while Xavier is away visiting his imprisoned enemy/friend Magneto (Ian McKellen). <br />Though human, Stryker is as formidable as either Xavier or Magneto -- he has methods of coercing mutants, putting him inposition to rid the world of them through Cerebro, a special tracking machine only Xavier can use; how Stryker tricks Xavier into using it is one of the movie's best secrets. Because Stryker means to destroy the mutants for good; Magneto sets aside his grudge match with Xavier to save both their hides, hence the title.<br /> Stryker also holds the key to the identity of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the steel-knuckled, mutton-chopped tough man of the mutant school. \\"X2\\" has a full plate of characters, but Jackman's the star; Wolverine does most of the fighting, and serves as a romantic possibility for X-woman Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), a telekinetic with growing strength and X-girl Rogue (Anna Paquin), whose powers were coveted in the original movie, but not worth much this time.<br />Also onboard is Storm (Halle Berry) who finds and connects with a confused Nightcrawler, and bad-girl Mystique (Rebecca Romejn-Stamos) whose shape-shifting gifts bust Magneto out of prison and hack into Stryker's computer for his master plan.<br /> Singer strains to offer every mutant decent screen time, which spreads \\"X2\\" a little too thin in the middle; one mutant that figured prominently in the first movie, Cyclops (James Marsden), mostly tags along in the sequel. Despite the generosity, Cox and Jackman return the forefront again and again as Stryker and Wolverine size each other up. Cox, actually, has played a similar role once before in the terrible Keanu Reeves vehicle \\"Chain Reaction;\\" what seemed cartoonish about his military monster in that movie works just about perfect here. Jackman  has a look about him that fits the part, and he's surprisingly funny to boot -- the throwaway lines of  David Hayter's script are one of \\"X2's\\" prime pleasures. <br /> There aren't as many action sequences as you'd expect -- the canvas is so big, a good part of the movie is spent just leaving and arriving -- and none match the opening Nightcrawler attack, but there is enough for a fight junkie to appreciate. And though there's a bit of social commentary mixed into the movie's fabric, \\"X2\\" is nothing less than a fantasy. There's a climax, so to speak, beyond the climax, and then another climax beyond that, which is annoying, but it sets the table for a major transformation of Jean's character. Singer obviously has his options wide open for the third installment, which will presumably pit good and bad mutants against one another again. \\"X2\\" ends with Magneto having gained a precious new weapon for round three. <br /> For what it does, \\"X2\\" does it very well. Singer is clearly serious about not letting the franchise descend into camp as \\"Batman\\" and \\"Superman\\" eventually did -- there are dumb moments, but they're quickly forgotten. It improves on the original and improves the chances of the series at the same time.
B000002HRE|4.0|In 1991, Metallica financially hit solid gold with their self-titled album (deemed \\"The Black Album\\" by most). The band did this by sacrificing the lightning quick riffs and gloom-laden lyrics of previous albums in favor of playful, radio friendly pop-metal songs such as Enter Sandman and Wherever I May Roam. While the album was certainly one of their weakest links, being neither original nor instrumentally mindblowing, it still managed to sell more than 12 million copies in the US thanks to its slew of radio hits, and time period of release (...). <br />Then in 1996, Metallica released Load, which truthfully was the most logical follow up possible. The album contained the same catchy, radio friendly tunes of the Black Album only with more creativity and better songwriting (I can see some heated debate over that last statement, but I don't care). ReLoad, consisting of songs Metallica never finished during the Load sessions, is actually quite a bit more different from Load than you would expect. While the album is made up of the same catchy, radio friendly pop-metal tracks, ReLoad is a decidedly darker album with a less happy-go-lucky tone than both Load and Black (the songs are a bit more serious for the most part, less commercial sounding, etc). Unfortunately, while still better than Black (another point of debate), ReLoad is ultimately a weaker album than Load.<br />On one hand, ReLoad is decidedly less mainstream and more metallic than Load. Once again, the songs are darker and sound almost Black Sabbath-esque compared to the more commercial, almost Green Day sounding Load. The album as a whole contains many great songs; such as Fuel (probably the closest Metallica's gotten to a metal song since Black's Struggle Within), Memory Remains (good riff and interesting lyrics), Unforgiven 2 (this is coming from somebody that actually didn't like the original Unforgiven!), Where The Wild Things Are (just an all around cool track), and the epic Fixxxer (probably Metallica's most creative song since And Justice For All's To Live Is To Die). Unfortunately, the songs just never grabbed me the way Load's did as many of them are not instantly memorable, and the song writing just doesn't quite seem as focused. And while I eventually grew to like all the songs on Load (yes, even Mama Said), there were a couple songs on ReLoad that I would deem as mediocre/weak, namely the redundant Devil's Dance and soulless Low Man's Lyric.<br />Still, when all is said and done, ReLoad is a good album. Whether you like it better than Load and Black is ultimately up to you. So my suggestion is to buy all three albums, give each a fair listen, and decide for yourself which is better.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Honest. Fun. Unique. Brilliant.  I thaught some of the songs were a little weird the first time around..but after the second time listening to it, I havn't been able to stop listening to it.  It's a very friendly album, and hard to get sick of.  <BR>I love it..and If you have an eclectic musical taste, you will love it also.
6305095566|5.0|this is a awesome movie i think any one who wants to see one of the best horror movies of all time should rent this or buy it is one of the goriest movies i have ever seen and its one of my favorites so go watch it!
B00008S2VG|4.0|Let's get one thing clear from the start:  Madonna's output in the studio from the early 80's to the mid-90's is enough to qualify her as the Queen of Pop for the forseeable future. Given this undeniable fact, she does not need to defend or add to her status as a pop icon. This gives her the freedom to \\"express herself\\" however she pleases.<br />A lot of the critics have lashed out at her for American Life, claiming that she is just acting self-absorbed, and not crafting decent music anymore.  The problem is that they aren't listening with an attentive ear.  They are so used to the easily digestible, pop-tart stuff that Britney and Pink and Christina and J-Lo are peddling these days.<br />Most of the others who gave this album a bad rating on this website point to the title track.  They are missing the point entirely.  Madonna is not acting like a spoiled child or a whiner.  Instead, she is putting things in perspective.  She's also stating how badly she has been misunderstood from the very start, from the very start. After all, \\"Material Girl\\" was meant to be tongue-in-cheek.  But even with a video that exemplifies that, she  still got stuck with the label.<br />About the music itself, it is not Madonna's best album.  But, there are enough good tracks on here to prevent it from being the total write-off that the naysayers would have you believe.  Here are my favorites:<br />1.  American Life-  A lot of people have made fun of that rap towards the end, but I think somehow Missy Elliot and Lil' Kim would approve.  At first, it may seem too spare to the ear, but it grows on you.<br />2.  Hollywood- More sonically dense than the title track.  It is a clever appropriation of the So-Cal style that the Red Hot Chili Peppers explored on Californication.  When she sings \\"Check it out, this bird has flown,\\" it feels so natural and fitting.  I like also the voice-morphing at the very end. <br />3.  Love Profusion-  A nice blend of guitars and an electronic beat.  The only aggravating part is the male voice that sings the harmony on the chorus.  It sounds awful, and mars an otherwise decent song.<br />4.  Nobody Knows Me-  A track that has great potential as far as a video and a live performance.  I have some ideas for how Madonna should approach it, but I'm  not telling...<br />5.  Nothing Fails-  It is a strong track, but I still can't quite get over a gospel chorus singing \\"I'm not religious...\\"  It's very postmodern, but it streches the song's credibility.<br />6.  X-Static Process-  Another song that has great video potential.  To my mind, it harks back to \\"Oh Father\\" from the Like a Prayer era.  She addresses her struggle with the Catholic Church and the loss of her mother and the effect it had on her growing up, all in one fell swoop.  <br />7.  Die Another Day-  Another point of reference for critics who deride this album.  They ask why Madonna put this \\"filler\\" on a studio proper.  I think that thematically it fits just fine.  The lyrics suggest contemplation, about pausing for a moment, and taking charge of your life.  At least, that's how I interpret it.<br />This album, of course, has some weak, and even bad, songs on it.  But, it does deserve a space in your Maddie collection.

B000094J5T|5.0|I loved this film and thought it was outstanding, however, I cried buckets of tears from beginning to end.  It is a true story and a shocking reminder of the horrors of World War II.  Brilliantly directed and authentic and nominated for several Oscars.  Adrien Brody deservingly won for Best Actor.
B000003C2U|5.0|This is amazing musicianship and lyricism. \\"Flattening of Emotions,\\" \\"Together As One,\\" and \\"Secret Face\\" collectively possess some of the most resonant and profound lyrics I've ever heard. Every Death album has left an idelible mark on metal history's landscape (even \\"Scream Bloody Gore,\\" which sometimes gets criticized unfairly as being too raw and ordinary). I need not go on about the genius of the late-Chuck Schuldiner. Everyone who has listened to this, \\"Individual Thought Patters,\\" \\"Symbolic,\\" or any other Death release already knows the man was an elite musician and master proseman. Rest In Piece, Chuck.
B00008H2LB|3.0|A fair question at an appropriate time.  It's almost mid-2003.  One may wonder where rock and roll will go after it's ripped from the clutches of the underground/punk/retro scene (Vines, Hives, et al).  I think Linkin Park probably has the right idea, whether that idea is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; in your all-too-opinionated minds, Art-rock is the movement that will probably see fruition.<br />&quot;How is this overly produced, rap-metal, pop record art-rock?&quot; you ask.  Well, listen to it carefully.  Very carefully.  Linkin Park is one of those bands that succeedes because they try really, really hard.  Those blips, beeps, scratches, and drum loops are all part of a painstaking process that typifies &quot;The journey is more important than the end or the start.&quot;  It's artistic in breathing a little bit of life into the near-dead nu-metal genus.  It's fun and stern.  It's anthematicly singable (&quot;Easier to Run&quot;) and difficult (&quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;).  It's self-loathing (&quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; and &quot;Faint&quot;) and self-healing (&quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;).  If Tool and the Deftones are art-rock, then Linkin Park is just the 80's pop-metal version of their prog-metal counterparts.  Like it or not, Linkin Park is what the future will perhaps sound like.  If not, (and as album sales will soon show), Linkin Park will still be around for a long while, engineering rock's outer limits.<br />Overall:  6 out of 10.
B00008S2VG|1.0|After Ray of Light and Music, I thought Madonna had finally found a new, solid direction for her music.  This album [is unacceptable].  I can't even say it's interesting.  Only two tracks grabbed my attention:  \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Mother, Father.\\"  And PUH-LEEZE!  Who is playing that AWFUL acoustic guitar?  I feel bad railing her like this, because I love Madonna and all that she stands for.  But this cd is one of the few that I regret buying.  Madonna needs something.  Like a Prayer.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album is is powerful, fast, hard, and just incredible. James voice sounds different, but in a good way. My favorite is still Master Of Puppets but this is really good! My favorite song on the cd is Harvester Of Sorrow, because it is probaly the hardest song on the cd, even if its not, songs dont have to be hard to be good. But every song on the cd is awesome. It opens up with Blackened, wich is the perfect song to open with. The title track is one of the best songs on the cd, next to Harvester Of Sorrow of course. All the songs on the cd are standouts. Their later realeases are awesome but I like older stuff better. St. Anger is going to be like older stuff. Because, i was watching Icon:Metallica on MTV the other night and they played a song off of St. Anger and it was one of the hardest songs i've ever heard by Metallica. So in conclusion this cd is awesome , so buy it now!!
0688163173|5.0|The reviewer who wrote that this story does not stay with you must have gotten their reviews mixed up. I have read 2 pretty good books since reading Shutter Island and I still cannot get the story out of my head. Not only is the story great, the ending is...well just read the book. I went out and picked up a few copies for some of my friends who do not read quite as much as I do just to have people to talk to about it. Lehane's 2 year publishing absence actually was disapointing, but man was this novel worth it. If I was to aspire to write like someone it would be Dennis Lehane. His command of the language is unsurpassed in the genre, and when you add this to everything else he does very well it puts him right near the top of the game. I think I will do something I rarely do, that is to go back and read it again just to see how he set this bad boy up.
B000002H97|5.0|This is the first new Metallica cd, and it rules. The old Metallica is better but the new Metallica is awesome too. There is not one song on the cd i dont like. I dont have a favorite song because all of them rule, so i can just choose one song. The Unforgiven is awesome. If i had to choose a favorite song it would probally be Dont Tread On Me. I have been listening to Maetallica for as long as i can remember and they are still my favorite band and they always will be.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Quite possibly one of the best action films made this side of the pacific.  Certainly a better action movie than 'The Matrix'.  With none of the slow-motion nonsense of that film, Equilibrium action scenes are all played out in realtime.  The plot is not great, but it still holds and if you like bleak visions of the future Equilibrium is defenitely on par with Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451.  A treat for any fan of dystopias or action movies.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album ROCKS!!! Not as good as Puppets but still awesome!! Fight Fire With Fire is one of the best songs on the cd. The title tracks kicks ... . I love For Whom The Bell Tolls is friggin incredible, Fade To Black, Oh My GOd, that is so incredible, its probaly my fave on the cd, Trapped Under Ice, awesome, What im trying to say is that the whole album is awesome and every Met fan should own!
B000002H72|5.0|Strangely accessible on the surface yet brimming with aggression at its core, Doolittle is perhaps the best example of The Pixies' mission in life, to make music that could frighten the devil himself yet somehow at the same time remain melodic. On Doolittle, The Pixies further refine this brand of hook laden hardcore by evening out the rough edges from Surfer Rosa and letting the much fuller production of Gil Norton take the place of Steve Albini's abrasive, lo-fi stylings. As a result, tracks like \\"Here Comes Your Man\\" or \\"Wave of Mutilation\\" incorporate a large amount of what could almost be called true pop, signaling an increasing maturity in the band's sound, but under Doolittle's mellow faade there still lies a tumultuous pool of intense energy that spreads to even the calmest of tracks. Frank Black's demonic voice and Joey Santiago's chaotic garage rock leanings immediately dispel any concerns that The Pixies may simply become another [bad] top 40 act, instead creating a totally revamped style that sounds like the premier pop music from hell. This unique genre fusion is therefore completely unrivaled in its absurdity, uniting two polar ends of the musical spectrum in a deceptively palatable marriage and creating an end product that sounds far too cohesive to be assembled from such radically unrelated parts. The album's balance is attained in part because of the fact that the Pixies' sound is so densely crafted and carefully perfected that Doolittle feels more like a genre all its own than a mere combination of subservient styles. Doolittle's immense variety therefore allows it to connect with at least one musical interest in every listener while still maintaining a distinct focus and clarity, easily making it one of the most immediately appealing or enticing album's ever to be made. The other secret to Doolittle's incredible musical success is the more obvious of the two; It's the fact that Frank Black is simply a genius songwriter. Instead of trying to fit into any sort or category or reach any type of specific audience, Black and company know the value of just playing straight-ahead rock and roll, free of any and all trendy agendas or obnoxious gimmicks that would only obscure their otherwise pure sound. In the plainest of terms, Doolittle is the pinnacle of intelligent, pop experimentalism from a band that is well versed in both fields, deeming it nothing short of an essential purchase for anyone who's interested in music.
B00008H2LB|4.0|This truthfully is my first Linkin Park cd. And  now that I have bought it, now I want to go and buy hybrid theory. This cd is one where you won't have to skip a track. All the songs are catchy and brilliant. The only down side I found was that the songs were a little short. After each song I was thinking \\"is that it?\\" But it's not so bad to not make you enjoy it. Here's my take on the songs:<br />1. Foreword-Nothing special, just some glass breaking for about 10 seconds. But it goes well with the next track...<BR>  <BR>2. Don't Stay-A great song that is one of the best on the cd. 4/5<BR>  <BR>3. Somewhere I Belong-The first single. Not bad at all.4/5<BR> <BR>4. Lying From You-For some reason everyone hates this track, but it's my favorite on the cd.5/5<BR>  <BR>5. Hit The Floor-Again another catchy song.4/5<BR>  <BR>6. Easier To Run-A slowed down song compared to others but still great!4/5<BR>        <BR>7. Faint-Good song with rapping and music.4/5<BR>        <BR>8. Figure.09-This one is one of my least favorites but still not terrible.2/5<BR>        <BR>9. Breaking The Habit-This is the most different on the cd but is really catchy.4/5<BR>        <BR>10. From The Inside-Just your average song, nothing really popped out to me about it.3/5<BR>        <BR>11. Nobody's Listening-This song is really good. A flute of some sort is the background and the singing is great.4/5<BR>        <BR>12. Session-This has no singing but is pretty good.3/5<BR>        <BR>13. Numb-This seems to be the favorite, but really it's one of my least favorite tracks.3/5<br />Before you get confused with the rating system here's how I rate it:<BR>5/5-Excellent<BR>4/5-Great<BR>3/5-Good<BR>2/5-Average<BR>1/5-Terrible  <br />There's my review hoped it helped.
B000002J09|5.0|Whether or not this is their best album is irrelevant, this should be considered one of the greatest albums of all time. As I read some of these other reviews I am astonished that people can say there are only 3 good songs on this album.  &quot;Going to California,&quot; in addition to being a personal favorite of mine, is extremely well written lyrically. In addition, you have &quot;stairway&quot; (one of the greatest songs ever written), &quot;Black Dog,&quot; &quot;Rock and Roll,&quot; and &quot;the battle of Evermore.&quot; There might be only eight songs on the album, but when half of them can be considered some of the greatest ever written, not much more needs to be said.  This is a must have album.
0802130208|4.0|I think that Confederacy of Dunces was a very interesting book. I had to read this book for one of my classes and I went into reading it thinking that I would not like the book. After a few chapters my mind had not changed- it was simply not a book that I was interested in. The main character, Ignatius, was disgusting and completely vulgar. I think that this is what John Kennedy Toole was trying to portray to the reader. In this case Kennedy did a great job of getting his main character across to the reader. I became less and less interested in Ignatius as the book continued. I fequently became fusterated with his antics. In my personal opinion I think that C of D could have been about 100 pages shorter- the middle dragged and then the ending was extremely rushed. I think that the author should have given up on the book the first time it was rejected- but then again it is a great story for English classes across the US. I almost felt inspired by Kennedy's personal story- but as for his story about Ignatius I was left with questions.
B000050XEI|4.0|I have to say that I've been a fan of Enya for many years now and &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is a welcome addition to my CD collection. <br />This album, while another winner musically, falls short of her previous albums because of it's ridiculously short playing time. This album has enough room for 45+ more minutes of songs to put on this album. In fact, this CD had B-Sides that failed to make it on this album. &quot;Isobella&quot; (A Crime that it wasn't included on this album, it's gorgeous) clocking in at 4:29 would've made this album clock in at 38:49, add &quot;The FIrst of Autumn: at 3:08, it would make the album at 41:57! I'm sure there are more tracks from the ADWR sessions that didn't make it on the American edition of ADWR but even with the two tracks I mentioned, they would've made this album much more complete. <br />Anyhow, back to the music, this CD is another amazing set of music from our beloved Celtic Chanteuse. &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; is fabulous. &quot;Flora's Secret&quot; is a wonderful upbeat theme. <br />Overall, aside from the unreasonably short lenght, ADWR is another winning effort from Enya, even if it doesn't cover new ground. A worthy buy. :)
B00004YX39|5.0|First of all, let me say &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot; is up there with &quot;Deacon Blues&quot; for me in contention as best Steely Dan tune. The groove is so simple, yet so DEEP!  I like it more every time I hear it. For several years after I first heard it, I didn't even like it.  Secondly, I would like to call your attention to Hugh McCracken's guitar work (I believe it's him) on &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot;.  It is extremely cool and inspired.  If you aren't already in love with this music, please give it about 10 additional close listenings.  There's much more going on here than meets the ear initially.  Part of what makes Donald Fagen such a genius is that these compositions do not sound complicated at all.  But try playing them!  Listen to the horn arrangements!  Listen to the grooves!  They are sublime. Fagan is an absolute fanatic for rhythms.  I read that on this album, and on others, the drums were originally recorded using human drummers, and then Fagan tweaked the rhythms obsessively using a special computer system until they were perfect. For those of you with DTS-compatible surround systems, I recommend you check out the DTS version of this album, which is really a crowd pleaser!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II is IMHO the high water mark of electric guitar based rock and roll.  The tones, the riffs, the feel, the drums, bass, vocals, solos.  I defy you to show me a better package.
B00005OAIE|4.0|The best thing about John Mayer is that he's what Dave Mathews would have been if he could write coherent lyrics.  If you like Dave Mathews's sound, but are constantly annoyed by the fact that his songs are either so abstract that they don't mean anything or are so open to interpretation that they're meaningless, then check out John Mayer's album.  No, it's not going to &quot;shake the foundations of your musical world&quot;, but it's not &quot;candy pop&quot; either.  With the pond sludge that's peddled as music these days, I'm just glad to hear someone play a good guitar and give me some lyrics I can actually understand and sing along to...  Personally, I like &quot;Why Georgia&quot;.  That song alone was worth the price of the album to me...
B00008NG5V|5.0|This album is excellent.  The simplicity of the music reflects Jack's simple outlook on life.  It's just good music that you can hum along with, sing with, or just relax with.  It reminds me that life's not all that bad.
B00005JLO2|1.0|WHEN I FIRST saw the previews for this, i was dying to see it, but i didnt get the chance to untill it came out on video. i rushed into the movie store, and hurried to find \\"the four feathers\\" starring Heath Ledger (The Patriot, A Knight's Tale).... this movie turned out to be the biggest waste of time ever. i blew off 2 hours and 10 minutes to watch something that calling \\"dirt\\" would be disgracing dirt itself. hollywood needs to learn that they cant put a war story and a love story in the same movie. it just doesnt work. they did it in Pearl Harbor, and ruined that too. I was hoping for some great action scenes to make up for the horrible story line, but again, i was dissapointed. i thought about stopping the movie with a half hour left, but i hoped that something would happen that would make me forget about everything that went wrong. NOPE. this movie was full of dissapointments. there were too many remakes, which killed the original. o no! a man was blinded because he rifle didnt fire correctly- that had to be the \\"bad\\" thing of the movie. although, hollywood did make an attempt to dig themselves out of the pit they were in- they showed dogs eating dead british soldiers. Hollywood fell into a bottomless pit.
B00005JKPF|5.0|There is no doubt about it, X2 clearly blows away the original.  I like the original, although I felt Iceman and Rouge, should have been older in the original, this sequel does a better job doing the comic series justice...
B00005MAM2|4.0|Let me begin by saying that Akira is an outstanding Movie! I first saw it back in the late 80's on VHS and was blown away. This movie is what got me interested in anime in the first place. It is like the godfather of anime (at least for the US). For some, I understand this is hard to believe but you have to realize that this movie was many many years ahead of its time when it was released (this being 2003). A testament to this fact can be seen in the awesome animation on the new DVD release. Believe me not much enhancement was needed. DVD just gave us better picture clarity and sound. Everything else was already there. All this being said, it is kind of unfair to us Akira fans who loved the original movie English soundtrack to have to experience a watered down politically correct new English dub version. The animation plus the original acting is what really made the movie the success it is thus creating the hype and fan following.<br />It's unfortunate, that the new fan base kind of gets the \\"wimpy\\" dialogue version of this film. I can see why some may not like it. The new dialogue tremendously disappointed me. (I went out and bought the tin cover version on the first day it was released) In my opinion, important scenes as well as the dialogue tone and pronunciation of key words & character names changed the movie dramatically. Don't get me wrong, many people will still like it just for the visuals, but the kick _ _ _ part is kind of gone now (everyone's character seems a weaker now). All Pioneer had to do was include the original dialogue along with the new one (for the new generation). Another audio track on a DVD? Wow, how hard could that have been (I know, too easy -Makes too much since and would make everyone happy)?<br />My advice is that if you really enjoy this movie and you haven't seen the original, then try to rent it somewhere. If you didn't like it the first time, then rent the original somewhere. (The difference is like night and day) If you haven't seen it yet, this good and bad since you have no standard to hold it up to but aren't really seeing the best version. Anyway rent the original at some point. I have honestly been searching for the original VHS. Personally, if I had a choice, I would take the original VHS dialogue vs. the DVD quality any day. Maybe someday in the future they will do another new release and will make everyone happy.<br />P.S. For all you newbies that did not understand the movie - it's because you have to watch it about 3 times to start catching all the subtle details. I lost count of the number of times I have watched it and each time I still seem to get a new perspective on it. Oh what, you wanted a movie where you didn't have to use your brain right? Watch it once and put it on the shelf for years to collect dust?  I can understand if you were turned off by the new dialogue, that's different, but if you can get past that, watch it again or rent the original. Who knows you may become a real fan too.
B000002J1U|4.0|Not their best but certainly their most overlooked.
B000084T18|4.0|This is a heavy album- noone can say 50 dont bring everything he's got 2 the plate. And now he is reaping the awards- just look at the mans paper. He is hip hop's new big cheese. <br />And so he should be. It's one of them cd's that can sit in your stereo 4 a long time- you aint gettin bored.  The beats r too catchy, 50's flow is too hot; the production is 1st class- what else would you expect from Dre?<br />And lets not forget Shady, who produced and rapped on 2 tracks; 'Patiently Waiting' and 'Don't Push Me'. Both tracks stand tall alongside Dre, where eminem shows us he can produce with the best, and rap with the best. (His flow on patiently waiting is too hot.) However, Shady would have done anything to have his name on the album's hit track, 'In Da Club'; probably the hottest tune in the clubs at the moment.<br />As for 50, he can definately spit. I wasnt totally convinced before i bought the album, but he can tear up the mic. Not in the same way as Biggie could. His style is his own, which is so refreshing in hip hop today. I'm gettin tired of rappers rippin off flows. How many rappers rip off Biggie's flow 4 example? Dam; Lil kim, B2K, JD, almost forgot Jay Z! As Nas said on Ether \\"How many of Biggie's rhymes gon' come out yo fat lips?\\" But that is beside the point. The point is that 50 is original, and aint fakin nothin. You know 50 would eat Jay Z for breakfast. And Ja Rule 4 that matter- who is definately in the forefront of 50's mind throughout the album. If you hate Ja, buy this!<br />His lyrics are good. I aint gonna go so far to say that his lyrics are incredible- he aint gonna be known as a writer, lets put it that way. Not in the same way that 2Pac was or Nas is. But his lyrics are mischievous, and quite funny, eg. P.I.M.P, where he raps bout his Pimp lifestyle. (Album could have included the remix with snoop on the bonus cuts- i wud hav given it 5 stars!)  <br />Some say the album is all about guns, and consequently aint all that. Come on- how muchhip hop do you listen to?! Most of rap is about guns, and has been for quite a while! Thats what you expect when you buy a rap record. Especially when its by a man who has been shot 9 times- i bet guns are in his thoughts all the time. And if not, they should be. <br />50 Cent is the hottest name on the scene. Just go 2 a club. As soon as anyone hears 'G-g-g-g-g unit!' The crowd goes crazy. Theres gon' be some jealous peeps out there waiting 2 get on his case. I just hope he keeps his mind on his paper and keeps makin music. I hope he doesnt get too caught up in the beef that always comes with this kind of success. <br />But it is this album that has brought him the exposure, and ascended him towards the hip hop elite. How can the album not be hot? Buy it and see for yourself.
0345423496|2.0|I've been a fan of 2001 (as a series) since I first saw the film when I was 13 years old. I was mesmerized by the images, haunted by the music, and in awe of a future which, in my young mind, was fully within the realm of possibility. When I was old enough to understand it, I read the book. The insights revealed by the text were no less profound than the fantastic sights and sounds inflicted upon me by that masterpiece in celluloid. But the works that came in subsequent years were disappointing at the very least. But more than that, they tarnished the memory, and hope that the first book, and the film instilled in me. If you have followed the entire series, this is a must read. If you have read 2001:A Space Odyssey, or have seen the film, and are merely thirsting for more by exploring these pages in the hopes of delving deeper into the promise made at the start of the saga, stop right here. Like some of the moon astronauts said after they came back from the moon, what do we do now? What can possibly top this? In respect to 2001, nothing has, yet.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|I can't believe there isn't more comment on this film, more outrage either way.  After having marched recently and heard accounts of  demonstrations from credible accounts (not corporate media), I believe demonstrations that turn violent often do because the police had been given carte blanche from leadership before the demonstration even starts.  Look at Oakland and the way the police showed up in full riot gear, gas masks, etc. and immediately began shooting all manner of 'non-lethal' bullets at protesters and dockworkers alike.  Jerry Brown gave directions to put fear into the crowd and anyone who might consider similar action. <br />As for this film and its content, I was quite impressed with the realistic portrayal.  I loved when one para corrected another para by calling them 'terrorists'.  They're in their home being shot on by an occupying army.  How relevant is that?  It was very easy for me to see oppressed people from around the world in the plight of the Irish.  It took the South Africans many, many bloody years to gain their freedom.  \\"Was there a need to kill civilians?\\"
0486282112|5.0|Forget the horror themes.  This book is timeless for all cultures because it forces us to ask the big questions:  What is our responsibility as a creator?  What is God's responsibility as a creator?  What is God's realm?  What is Man's realm?  If God is us, and we are God - are we evolving or are we going where we shouldn't go?  Are there ways that society should/shouldn't use or ignore their knowledge?  What do we do when our technology surpasses our humanity?  How should humanity proceed with technology?  Are we ready to know what we know?<br />The intrigue is endless, and can be revisited with new groups for discussions over and over.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD hasn't left my CD player since I got it.  It is such a strong debut album.  As a songwriter I find myself saying: &quot; Gosh darn it, I wish I wrote that song!&quot; Kudos to the songwriters!
B00006HBUC|2.0|I grew up watching Scooby-Doo, once every weekday afternoon and once every Saturday morning. I used to love watching Scooby and the gang. When I heard a few years ago that they were planning on making a live action film, I was excited. Then I heard that Sarah Michelle Gellar had been cast as Daphne and Freddie Prince, Jr. had been cast as Fred. I almost choked. I knew then that this movie was doomed from the start. And boy was it ever.<br /><br />Most of the casting was terrible. The story is garbage. Though this is marketed as a family film, SCOOBY-DOO is anything but family fare. The plot revolves around soul sucking monsters bent on taking over the world. The setting for this delightful concept is a horror theme park, including rides where a person could literally lose their head.The film is neither a parody nor remake of the original cartoon series and therefore it seriously flounders. Had it been a parody (ala THE BRADY BUNCH), it could have worked. Had it been a remake (ala THE ADDAMS FAMILY) it would probably have worked. However, the film does neither and totally strays from the spirit of the series.<br /><br />In fact, the movie has only one thing going for it: Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. It's either a tribute to his talent or a statement about how bad SCOOBY-DOO is, but Lillard gives one of the finest comic performances of the year. His portrayal of Shaggy is flawless and is the only reason to watch this film.<br /><br />True Scooby-Doo fans will be repulsed by this film and those who don't know better don't need to have their minds warped by seeing such a disgrace to a cartoon classic.
0321146530|5.0|This book has nothing in it that you don't know you should be doing. You know you should test your code. You know that you should make sure changes don't break things. I'll bet that you haven't actually taken the steps to make sure that you do this though.<br />Kent walks you through a good way to develop code: write the test code as you write the actual code. I've actually put this into practice and it's surprisingly easy to follow the recommendations. As you write a new function, write some code that calls it in a few different ways. When it comes time to give your code to someone else (check in to source control, deliver to customer, use on a bigger project), you have a fair sense that things will work.<br />Again, you already know that you should test things. This book presents one really great way to do that. It's worth taking a few hours and reading this one. Buy it so that you can re-read it once every year.
B00005QZWI|1.0|I was so impressed by the reviews and how everyone was telling me how this was the CD to buy.  I really wish I wouldn't have listened.  This track to me was a complete waste of money!  Nothing like the movie at all, I did fall asleep listening to it!!  They may try to make this look good with the preview songs that they have their, but don't be mislead like I was!  Save your money!  Please!!
0792838068|4.0|Well, Leaving Las Vegas is the best movie I've ever seen in my life. I couldn't sleep the night I watched the movie. I was so impressed by it. But I expected more to get from its DVD. I expected to see some Behind the scenes and additional features, but nothing is included in the DVD except the movie itself. And its qulity is not as good as it's expected. Well, I think MGM should plan to release a new special high quality version of this film which is one of the all time greatest movie in cinema history.
B00008H2LB|1.0|my title is not an exaggeration. i heard this song at my friend's house and i seriously thought it was hybrid theory. i have heard the whole hybrid theory album (it was a long painful process i would rather not discuss) and i told my friend that this song didnt sound familiar. then he told me, \\"its their new one\\" yes it makes sense. ... as for all you real music fans out there go buy a Godsmack's \\"Faceless\\", which is a GOOD release of 2003. ...
B00000K2SC|5.0|After watching THE MATRIX recently in preparation for seeing the upcoming sequel, I was amazed once again. THE MATRIX is a hallmark film; like JAWS, STAR WARS, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, it is a movie that has influenced almost every film made since its release and changed the way movies are made. The special effects are spectacular, the action intense, and the plot extremely well-written.<br />However, all that withstanding, what really makes THE MATRIX stand out from other sci-fi/action films is the philosophical and allegorical slant of the story. The film is immersed in the philosophy and religion of the West, embodying everything from Plato to the Bible. That fact makes this much more than a &quot;dumb movie about cyberspace&quot; or &quot;another movie about machines&quot;.  Instead, THE MATRIX is a thinking person's movie, a movie that is not only interesting to watch but that also raises questions and thoughts that a person thinks about long after the final credits have rolled across the screen.<br />Finally, THE MATRIX is the first film where Keneau Reeves acts. Until THE MATRIX, Reeves was such a poor actor that he could never quite leave behind his &quot;Bill and Ted&quot; persona (if you've ever seen MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, you'll know what I mean).
B000089RVX|5.0|Its about time a band came out with this kind of sound<br />Operatic vocals with a shock and awe assault sound to back it up<br />The vocals are simply stunning.  This is the best produced album<br />in a long time.  The rest of these \\"new metal bands\\" should take<br />the time and listen to this record and learn from it. This is the blueprint on how to make a new metal sound.<br />Five stars easily!!!
B00005YW4H|2.0|Jazz? Pop? Starbuck's background music? I don't know. Does it have to have some deeper meaning or \\"label\\" to like it? No, of course not. Norah has a very soothing voice, pretty songs...overall well done. *UPDATE* I'm so sick of this ...CD! So overplayed...I think it's the same song twelve times...I'm so tired of this CD! Yuck!
1565847873|3.0|The Berlin Wall has fallen and the East is opening up. An Inflatable dinghy drifts ashore in Sweden, and with it two dead men. It becomes Inspector Wallanders case. Who are these two men? Their dental work suggests east European origin; the dinghy was made in Yugoslavia. Wallander keeps digging, and his investigation leads him to Riga. <br />City and country of Intrigue, deception, corruption and murder. Willander is like the ivory ball on a billiard table, pushed in one direction and rebounding in an other. He solves the case, at great danger to himself.<br />Mankell has a habit of inserting his political convictions into his books  - be it the sorry welfare state of Sweden, be it the flowers of evil blooming in the newly liberated East. I do not believe that a mystery should be the dais for politics.
B00006FDCD|4.0|This is probably the best book to movie translation out there, however its still not exact, and the book is way too long to make it into a full movie. This movie is also one of the only movies that succesfully makes a clown scary. Most clown horror movies are stupid. Only reasons for not giving it 5 stars: it was too made for tv, and therefore, lacked gore. It was also slow and could have probably been made into a lot shorter of a movie. Some of this is alot of time killing if you ask me.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson is best friends with the Malloys, Kelly Slater, Rob Machado, and tons of other surfing greats. And being a wonderful surfer himself, he knows exactly the feeling that overwhelms you when you are surfing at a beautiful break, with a warm, clean breeze and setting sunlight brushing the surface of the glassy, clear, warm water, and every now and then the perfect swell comes, rising and tipping, barrelling. He knows that you can't be out there without friends, either. He's surfed with Ben Harper and many of the great surfers and he has made beautiful surfing films. Being a Hawaiian, he knows the great connection between the ocean, man, surfing, and friendships. In this cd his life-loving voice shines through resonating with his personal view of the meaning of life. They're all good, but Times Like These, The Horizon Has Been Defeated, Taylor, Wasting Time, and Mediocre Bad Guys (really, really good) are amazing.
B000066NW0|1.0|Avril is so fake! Yeah, she sounds good on the cd, but have you ever heard her live? It's horrible! Plus, she can't even skate (or at least get off the mini course)
0070511136|4.0|This was one of the better sales books I have read.  It brings up a new perspective of questioning the customer.  Rackham shows the reader how to take a seemingly small customer problem and develop it into a situation that needs immediate attention by the customer (i.e. he needs to buy your product).  It dispels a lot of the common myths about selling - don't use all of those stupid closes that only sometimes work with inexpensive commodity items, etc.  He also hammers home how to advance each sale by obtaining commitment of some sort - not necessarily a sale, but some commitment of furthering the sales process.  <br />The only possible drawbacks I noticed were that unless phrased carefully, the &quot;rubbing salt into the wound&quot; segment of the problem/implication questions can be taken the wrong way by some customers.  Further, a lot of customers (at least in my industry) are probably already acutely aware of the problems they have and their implications.  It is still a good read, though.  <br />The book is definitely aimed at sellers of high-dollar, high value-add items and not at booksellers or used car salespeople.  As the title of this review indicates, the book was great on the questioning tactics of a sales call, but it does not address the strategic aspects of which customers to target, how to get to know the players at each account, etc.  For the other half of the sales picture, I would highly recommend &quot;Strategic Selling&quot; and perhaps even &quot;Conceptual Selling&quot; by Miller and Heiman.  Those two books were the two best I have read on selling, but Spin Selling is definitely recommended as an addition to the complex product salesperson's library.
B0000931OG|1.0|Oh the humanity. Don't trust the Amazon review-\\"We've got a file on you\\" is brilliant? Sure, if Tenacious D's \\"One Note Song\\" is brilliant, too. There is exactly one good song on this album, \\"Out of Time,\\" and there are about 2 or 3 listenable ones, such as \\"Ambulance\\" and \\"Sweet Song,\\" but that's about it. The rest is trashy filler that goes pretty much nowhere. \\"Crazy Beat\\" is stupid and annoying, ditto \\"Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club\\"  and pretty much everything else. Not that I don't like change and evolution with bands, but this is regression, not evolution.
6305841861|5.0|gory, scary and funny. Not too many movies can pull that off. As a matter of fact, there has been alot of failed attempts at horror comedy, I think this succeeded!! The first time I seen this I was laughing so hard I couldnt stop. Although, it isnt non stop laughter, so dont get me wrong. If your new to the horror catagory of your video store, grab this, and hellraiser, and some popcorn, thats about all you need
0060512806|5.0|Neal Stephenson never ceases to amaze me. This book is a very compelling read. I was a bit intimidated by the size at first, I have to admit, but once i got about 100 pages in, I couldn't put it down. I don't want to say anything more. You should see for yourself. I also recommend reading &quot;In the beginning was the command line..&quot; by Neal Stephenson. It is a brilliant essay about Operating Systems, politics, business and life. :)
0316666343|5.0|This book, without a doubt, is the best book I have ever read. It's so inspriational and emotional. It's about a girl who was murdered who tells her story and watches her family grieve.I particulary like how she tells the story from heaven. I was in tears for most of the book. I loved it. The only part that wasnt great was the ending. But still, no ones perfect.
B0000931OG|4.0|I've heard some horrible things written about the seventh blur album.  I've heard that it's a piece of trash and that blur are nothing without the support of lead guitarist graham coxon.  I don't think that I have heard this out of the mouth of any blur fans.<BR>It is also not a radical departure.  It is not \\"Kid A\\" or \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" or whatever current album goes slightly against the grain.  Its more like a great blur album in the vein of \\"13\\" or \\"parklife.\\" <BR>  It is an album that takes the same path as 1999's 13.  The album adds a little druggy edge.  On such songs as the opener \\"Ambulence,\\" Damian Albarn is eerily supported by a chorus of gholish \\"oos.\\"  Elsewhere Albarn seems to have the blues- badly.  the album oozes with a doomed sense.  Instrumentation draws from a variety of sources including afro-pop percussion and snake-charmer guitar.  It creates a very good backdrop for Albarn's fantastic lyrical content.<BR>It ends with the only song in which Coxon's guitar is included: \\"Battery in Your Leg,\\" the albums optomistically bluesey closer.  the only one complaint that the listener will have is with the shortness of the album or so it seems.
B00008S2VG|4.0|\\"American Life\\", Madonna's 10th studio album is a great body of work.  A much different sound from 2000's \\"Music\\" and 1998's \\"Ray Of Light\\".  However, she still has to match the sound of greatness on the \\"Ray Of Light\\" release. Each song on that album sounded completely awesome, never knowing what to expect next. Not that \\"American Life\\" is predictable, but it is not as good to ear as \\"Ray Of Light\\". Lyrically, the album is not really a soul movement.  Outstanding songs are the title track \\"American Life\\", \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Nobody Knows Me\\".  All other songs are too slow, have slow intro's and it kinda makes you want to hit the forward button on your cd player.  Madonna is a great artist, but I have been a fan since I was 8 years old and I am now almost 30, and I can tell you that her new sound needs to go back to the \\"Ray Of Light\\" time. Granted, she is all about moving on, but she took hold of something grand and kind of let it slip.  I would suggest a die hard fan must have this album to keep up your collection, but if you are new to Madonna start off with the \\"Ray Of Light\\" album and you will definately hear the difference.
B000089A07|3.0|This did not live up to hype, I heard it was really gory. You remeber how the other two movies had a scene or two that made them really sick, this one doesnt have anything like that(even though some are claiming it does.) No scene in here topped the last sceen on hanibal, or the crossdressor in the silence. On top of this, my only other complaint is this is too much like the original, it trys way too hard to be, yet it is not even close.
B00006879E|5.0|This is a very good ablum. Every track has a reason for being on the ablum. The lead singer has a different yet fimiliar sound and the band compliments him well. Buy it. Even if you haven't heard it, it's worth it. Once you get home play it until every song is stuck in your head. Than play once more for some else and make them do the same.
B00008WG3U|3.0|No complaints. But I am certain each song will remind you of their previous songs. Each time I listen to this album I end up singing a song from Punk in Drublic or Heavy Petting Zoo. Same stuff. Good stuff.
B000002B35|5.0|This album will STUNN you and leave you wanting more, regardless if your a pink floyd fan or not. I am 18 years old and love this cd. Its an album for all ages and sounds spectacular. The first cd is a compilation of great floyd songs, spanning over 35 years. The second cd is amazing as its \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", in its entirety, with a special treat at the end \\"Wish you were here, Comfortably numb and Run like Hell\\". The fact that its live creates a whole new experience and gives off an amazing atmosphere. David Gilmour is spectacular as he plays the guitar like a man possesed.<br />If yourve never heard pink floyd then i suggest you get this album first, and let the music suck you in and never let you go. This is one concert i would've killed to see.<br />Overall this is a must for everyone. Pink Floyd are to me the best band in the world, and with albums like this one will be for years to come!!<br />P.S can't wait for the PULSE DVD.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM, you wont be dissapointed.
B00000612P|5.0|This Cd is probably one of Rod Stewart's best works.  Containing hits like the title track, Every Picture Tells A Story, Maggie May, and I know I'm Losing You, it is a must for every die hard Rod Stewart fan.  Of course, with it being digitally remastered, the songs are better than ever.  This also contains the song Amazing Grace as a hidden track.  <BR>All in all, this is a great album and the fold out of the cd contains a picture of Rod Stewart singing in concert.  <BR>Granted, the lights are obscuring his face a little bit, but the main focus of the picture is his back end.
B00005JLK1|4.0|Its about Ghosts, and it is gory, what more do you need? My only complaint, and the reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5, is it tends to be slow in spots, but the movie is far from boring and will hold your attention through till the end
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Listen, I have no great history of loving Fleetwood Mac...I like a lot of their songs and I own Rumours, Tango In The Night and their Greatest Hits...I listen to them on occasion.   <br />I bought this CD because I think Lindsey Buckingham is an enormous talent..his solo album \\"Out Of The Cradle\\" is one of my all-time favorites...so I figured...he produced it and wrote half the songs and it's on sale...so what the heck, I'll give it a shot...<br />Anyway, bottom line...this is a \\"double-LP size\\" collection of songs by Buckingham and Nicks and there is not a clinker in the bunch...the rhythm section (F&M) is better than ever...just a great CD.
B0000931OG|5.0|It takes one listen to get hooked! As usual, the vocals are great and the music is SPACE[y] (in an out-of-this-world kinda way... I'm not saying that their album sounds empty... far from it.) Au contraire! In fact, in some songs, it sounds like the \\"GORILLAZ\\" are in the background joining in on the beats! Cool eh? It's not only worth the listen... it's definately worth the BUY! There are a couple of versions of Think Tank in stores NEAR YOU... pick up a copy of one or more of them today (no pressure but if you do not purchase this, you'll miss out on great music from BLUR)... you won't regret it!
0312243022|1.0|Why do I hate this book so much?  Well, let's see...it opens with a dramatic reconstruction of Virginia Woolf's suicide.  That struck me as rather tasteless.  <br />If this was the only problem with the book I might have reserved judgment.  However, Cunningham continues the &quot;good work&quot; begun in his earlier novels of portraying women as flobby wandering half-souls whose emotions occasionally crop up, as warts or an ingrown hairs might, to further confuse them in their blind stumblings through the world.<br />Silly women, always getting in the way.  I'm probably not going to get very many &quot;helpful&quot; votes for this review but I strongly, strongly suggest that you read MRS. DALLOWAY, the novel that Cunningham's work is ostensibly based on, and never even consider picking up THE HOURS.
B000059XUO|5.0|I think most of it has already been said: its Brandon at his best, its dark, its gothic, and the replay value on this movie alone makes it worth buying. I watch it over and over again, usually around Halloween time. Has some of my favorite one liners, favorite bad guys. There are very few movies you never get sick of, and this be one of them
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna continues on her journey into higher consciousness...<BR>Her lyrics, though spare in some songs, are very deep.  She communicates a lot in few words.  Those who don't like it just don't understand what she is talking about, which is her path to her spirit and connection to all that is.  There are songs about love, songs about her childhood and growth, and songs criticizing our 'American Life' and society.  Madonna keeps changing.  After listening to this album a few times, it really grew on me.  I love her blend of rock/pop and electronica, it's great to dance to and complex to listen to.  I HIGHLY recommend this album, it's one of her best yet.
0783230710|1.0|Ahhhh, what a great movie.  I cry at the end every time.  I remember when I was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of Apollo 13.  However, I am SEVERELY dissappointed with the widescreen DVD.  Those who created it did not use the original film, but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen VHS version.  There are many instances when this is evident, but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the Lovell house after the walk on the moon when Jim says, &quot;I want to go back there&quot;.  When the scene opens, he is cut off at mid-thigh and you never see below his knees. On the fullscreen VHS you can see his shoes.  When I buy the widescreen, I want the WHOLE movie, not less than the fullscreen VHS tape.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  Buy the VHS.
B00008NG5V|3.0|I would like to preface this by saying that I like Jack Johnson and I love Brushfire Fairytales.  That being said, I am a bit disappointed by this record.  It sounds almost exactly the same as the last record, but it has less up-tempo songs.  The playing is fine.  The lyrics are fine, if not a bit simplistic at times.  The music pretty much always sounds the same thoughout the CD (with a couple of exceptions).  If you liked Brushfire, you'll probably enjoy this CD.  As long as you expect nothing different at all out of Jack except the words, and even they aren't that different.  Why did I need another studio recording of Rodeo Clowns?  I have a feeling that unless Jack grows a bit I'll tire of him pretty quickly.  I recommend Ben Harper instead.
6305922756|1.0|My best friend recommended this to me as the funniest movie ever. He said It would make me laugh. We ususally have the same sense of morbid humor, however I did not laugh once, I thought it was the dumbest movie I had seen in awhile. very dry humor, jay leno / carson jokes, not even close to funny or entertaining. My comedy recommendations: Friday, next friday, me myself and irene, scary movie...trying to think...anyway, you get the point, you were warned!
B000083E79|5.0|This collection is definitely a must have. I am so excited to get this cd. This is the CD not the dvd as mentioned above-although I would love to get the farewell concert tour on DVD when it comes out! <BR>Cher does deserve to be in the Hall of Fame-songs like &quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot; and &quot;I Found Someone&quot; not to mention more recent hits like &quot;Song for the Lonely&quot; and the fab &quot;Believe&quot; make this cd package just untoppable, go Cher!
B00006J9OT|5.0|I have been wondering for some time what the Hype about Diana Krall was all about.  I've bought a couple of her albums, and always thought yeah OK so what! As a Jazz collector, I felt that I was missing something. <BR>I wandered into a store the other day and saw the DVD playing on a BIG HD TV Flat screen in a surround sound room.  I walked across the street and bought it.  Here is Krall swinging the room, no fluff, no bubblegum, just GREAT jazz.  Hope the next album is as good, now I want to see her live!  This will be become one of those great Live Jazz albums up there with anything you want to name!<BR>Enjoy!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Just when you think you have problems that can't be mastered, or overcome, not to mention the belief that there are problems inside you that you would expect NO ONE to ever want to share a life with you due to them, this movie comes out to send a valuable message. A very special person wanted me to see this movie, to express that the love felt for me was as strong as the love in this movie, and in that, there are no obsticles, just an adventurous journey. I loved the movie for that main reason. I have had Songs dedicated to me when I have been down, but to have a movie dedicated was sweet. Based on a true story, I love their monumental commitment and love.
B00004RF8J|1.0|A musical is more like it, and the humor is jay leno kind of humor. Not funny, not gory, just annoying.
B00006AG5N|5.0|There's no question that anyone born after The King's time will find this CD most beneficial. That is of course if you like Elvis Presley's music. I'm only 19 years old, but have always enjoyed hearing popular Elvis songs on oldies radio stations and such. Songs like \\"Hound Dog\\" and \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", to name a few, are timeless classics that helped influence me in buying this record in the first place. But to be honest, I was even happier with some of the songs I didn't know. Especially \\"(Marie's The Name) His Latest Flame\\"; which has since become a favorite of mine. And that's what I have to say to anyone 'contemplating' buying this album... You may know a number of these songs; and on the other hand there's definitely some you won't know. Do NOT let that dissuade you. You won't be let down with any of the songs and you'll only end up wanting more.<br />Also, the sound quality of all these tracks is absolutely amazing! The 'original recording remastered' slogan doesn't even begin to prepare you for how perfect each song sounds. There is no variance between the tracks, and you won't have to turn up your volume five or six notches to get the full sound; which is something that is old hat with many other artist's 'remastered' albums. It really makes the experience a more meaningful, crisper one. Especially on the bonus track (if you can even call it that), \\"A Little Less Conversation (Remix)\\". The sound seems more modern and at times techno-like, which is something that works wonders for the song. They should've just entitled the album ELV1S 31 #1 Hits, because it's just that good. Really.<br />As my review title noted, this CD could've easily been worthy of six or possibly seven stars. And there is only two things that keep it from being just that. One... Amazon only allows you to give your reviews up to five stars. So I guess that's irrelevant anyways. But had they allowed us to extend our stars past five, the second (Two...) thing that would've keep this at 5 stars is the absence of, in my mind, two key tracks. The first is a not-so-popular Elvis track, \\"Such A Night\\". It was featured on the soundtrack to the Kevin Costner/Kurt Russell Elvis take-off film '3000 Miles To Graceland'; which was horribly overlooked and unloved amongst critics (though maybe not Elvis fans). Oddly enough, \\"Such A Night\\" is my favorite Elvis song of all-time. Call me naïve, but remember: I'm only 19 years old. Another song that might be missing is an Elvis Presley Christmas tune. I particularly enjoy the short, rockin' \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\"; but there are a number of classics to chose from (i.e. \\"White Christmas\\", \\"Blue Christmas\\", etc). Whatever the case may be, I was a bit disappointed to not find a Christmas song from a guy who (seemingly) rocked Christmas year after year after year.<br />In the end, this is still a perfect greatest hits collaboration. It's fit for the longtime, diehard Elvis fan who already owns every Elvis CD; in the sense that it's remastered and features the landmark newbie \\"A Little Less Conversation (Remix)\\". And it's even more worthwhile for people like me; who have grown up only hearing Elvis classics on the radio and hearing about him from our parents. Even if they still claim he stole the black man's music. And you know what? Even if he did \\"steal\\" it (which he really didn't, how does that work?), I still don't know anyone quite as admired and amazing as Elvis Presley. At least not 25 years after their death (that is still questioned, in jest, as we speak). Come on! If there's one greatest hits worth owning, it's this one. Everyone needs a little piece of Elvis in their life.is the absence of, in my mind, two key tracks. The first is a not-so-popular Elvis track, \\"Such A Night\\".

B00005JLXE|4.0|I really enjoyed Spiderman and all but after seeing Daredevil I have to say I liked it better. I was a real fan of it in the comics and loved the dark side of the character. Like I hear they are going to do with The Hulk later in 2003, the film-makers are bringing out the darker sides of these superheroes, which is where their hearts really are.<br />Daredevil is a great movie for a comics fan, buy it!
B000063CMK|5.0|I usually dont write reviews, but I had to say something here.  I have seen a few reviews saying many ignorant things such as Gildenlow being a weak vocalist, melodramatic lyrics, etc.  Well first of all, Gildenlow is simply the most amazing singer I have ever heard.  His emotion, feeling, control, and variety are unmatched by anyone I have heard.  Anyone who does not recognize his talent does not know very much about music.  Secondly, to the one who said that the lyrics to A Trace of Blood are &quot;melodramatic&quot;, his kid died, jackass.  The song is about his wife's miscarriage, and the other songs on the cd are all real as well; the &quot;storyline&quot; is the story of Gildenlow's life.  There's no melodrama here.  The music on this cd is astounding and deep.  The songs are so filled with emotion that you can feel it.  From sadness to love to anger to pain, you will feel it with full force.  It is impossible to describe the feelings associated with these songs unless you sit down with no distractions and give the cd a few spins.  I dont want to go into detail about the particular song styles, but trust me when I say that this is truly one of the most amazing musical journeys you could ever take.  The lyrics are a trip through the human psyche.  Another comment was made that they do not have the &quot;chops&quot; to compete with Dream Theater; Pain of Salvation never said that they were as technically talented as Dream Theater.  I don't see why this comparison should even be made.  Gildenlow has never said that PoS should be labeled &quot;prog metal&quot;; that is just the genre that it most fits in.  Don't listen to ignorant, unfounded comments that are directed at this album; give it a try yourself, see what you think.  It just may change your life.
B000002HRE|4.0|While yes, the better albums for Metallica remains Kill em ALl and the 80's thrash, the newer bluesier sound takes theband AND its listeners back to the band's youth.  In my opinion, Metallica isn't gone, some of the new tracks from ST. Anger have alreadyt shown us that, its just that LOAD and RELOAD were albums meant to take us to and show us into the youth and feelings of the band, how they expressed there feelings when all there was, was the blues and southern rock.  To those who claim that LOAD and RELOAD were filler albums, I say that you need to reevaluate your fanship and learn that softer isn't always \\"not heavy metal\\" it's attitude that counts.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I discovered the briallance of Rammstein and this great album through a friend who took me on a tour of his copy of Mutter. After only hearing a few songs, I had to have more! The music from this group, and especially this album is just awesome! Its like industrial, goth, pop, and progressive all in one. I liked the sound of their music when I first heard those notes, but as soon as I heard those first lyrics from their lead singer a smile etched across my face and an air of mystery clouded my thoughts. What was that singer saying? I couldn't understand him. He bellowed out something unintelligible in his baritone-like vocals. I thought this was a joke. It sounded satanic. But my friend made it clear to me that this was a German group and the singer was singing in German. I still didn't care though, because the music and the vocals sounded so good, i didn't care what language they were in. After hearing only a sample of this great album, I had to have my very own copy. And the next day I went out and bought one. I hadn't purchased a regular rock-band album in years, because I was so fed up with the alternative junk that was spewing around for so long. But here finally came along something different. After listening to the whole album in its entirety I knew this was a masterpiece. The first song is one of the best opening songs i've ever heard. There are plenty of pop songs through out this album to just chillback to, and there are lots of songs to turn up your stereo to and just rock out all night long. There's at least one beautiful soft-ballad in the form of the title track Mutter (Mother). All of the songs on this album are terrific. Through out the album soprano voices are used against the lead singer's baritone voice, and it just sounds great. As for the German language--I couldn't care less for what is being said in the songs. I'm the type of person who looks at the sound of the music before the lyrics. Besides that just adds to the mystery and discovery. Buythe album for the music, and then figure out what is being said later.<br />If the world ended tomorrow your only regret would be that you didn't get Rammstein's Mutter! That's how great this album is--get it now!
0385504209|5.0|An excellent book - it grabbed me within the first two pages, and kept me intrigued until the very last word! Not one to believe everything I read (especially in a work of fiction ;), I've done some researching on my own, and applaud the author on his incorporation of verifiable facts while still maintaining the reader's sense of wonder.  After finishing this one, I ran right out to buy his other books, and they are as fascinating as this one.  One of my new favorite authors - I can't wait to read his next offerings!
B00004XONN|5.0|theres nothing i can say that hasnt been said.<BR>if you want pop music, go elsewhere. then again if you wanted pop music, you wouldnt be here anyways.<BR>all i can do is make reccomendations.<BR>first, as with all recent radiohead music, give the album 3 or 4 chances before you blow it off. i have NEVER liked any radiohead on my first listen.<BR>someone made the point that if some unknown group had put out Kid A, it would have been shuffled aside and ignored... makes you wonder... maybe we should be paying more attention to those unkown groups.<br />Lastly, albums. If you like this album, check these out. some are fairly closely related, others are a bit more of a stretch:<BR>Aphex Twin - Richard D. James Album<BR>Aphex Twin - Selected Ambient Works Vol II<BR>Wolfshiem - Spectator<BR>VAST - VAST<BR>Tool - Lateralus<br />thats all i got. go forth and spread the good word. lol<BR>oh and check out the space ghost episode with Thom Yorke. its called &quot;knifin around&quot; but i dont remember the episode number.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I guess the people at Warner Brothers were listening. Not only have they given a solid, entertaining movie but the second disc  on the latest Harry Potter installment is much more user friendly. No more solving puzzles in order to get to deleted scenes. Kid's don't worry. There are plenty of riddles and games to be had. The feature that I liked was the snippets with the kids and the rest of the cast, sharing thier favorite memories of making the film. There is also a 20 minute sit-down with J.K. Rowling and TCOS screenwriter which I found informative.<br />Now to the movie. Fans of the book should not be disapointed. Special effects dominate the screen but do not take away from the characters and story. A word to parents though. Yes this movie is scarier than the first. Anyone that does not want there 6 year old sleeping in thier bed may want to reconsider. But on the small screen and the volume down, it should be okay for kids as low as the second grade. But for the teens and adults, this is a great addition for your DVD library. This version is much improved and after two weeks of owning it, I'm still having fun with the features. Highly recommended.
B00008VGK0|4.0|To be honest with you, \\"American Life\\" is one of my least favorite singles by Madonna.  Ms. Ciccone is most convincing when she delivers straightforward dance tunes in the vein of \\"Express Yourself,\\" \\"Deeper and Deeper,\\" and \\"Music.\\"  But when she tries to get introspective and turns into \\"Message Madonna,\\" the results come up a bit contrived.  Still, you can usually depend on her for good remixes, and they can be found on this single.  As it happens, the weakest of these versions is by Missy Elliot, who sets \\"American Life\\" to a generic, one-beat-fits-all hip hop groove.  Felix da Housecat, the reigning king of electro, fares way better in his new wave re-working, as does Paul Oakenford.  But the real treat comes from Peter Rauhofer, who breathes high energy disco into his \\"American Anthem Part 2.\\"  As a bonus, we get another electro remix, which comes in the form of Richard Vission's brash makeover of the 007 theme song \\"Die Another Day.\\"  Madonna has released better remixes, but these are good enough to satisy clubgoers, DJs, and diehard fans alike.
B000002UAO|1.0|There are so many Beatle albums better than this, and every album released previous to Rubber Soul is better - With The Beatles, Hard Day's Night, etc.<br />Also, regarding the production, listen to how abruptly the middle piano solo just ends in &quot;In My Life&quot;.  So obvious that it was a separate track just spliced in and halted when the next verse happened to start.  With stuff like Michelle, this album is just plain boring.  The best song on the whole thing is by George Harrison - &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;.
B00008VGL6|4.0|It's funny what happens when you listen to a CD repeatedly before its riches get under your skin.  When I first heard \\"Counterfit2,\\" the first solo long-player by DM's songwriter Martin Gore, I found it pleasing if somewhat underwhelming and uneven. But after revisiting this album a few times, I have to admit that I like it more now than ever.  Like his 1989 EP \\"Counterfit,\\" this album is a collection of covers which get electronically made over. Those looking for an album similar to a Depeche Mode release may be disappointed, for the atmosphere is even darker and more quirky this time around. Contrary to the savage reviews this CD has been getting in the press, the majority of the tracks work pretty well. It took a while for me to warm up to the album's first single, \\"Stardust,\\" but over time, the eerie keyboard touches and Gore's signature voice grew on me quickly. I instantly loved his version of \\"I Cast a Lonesome Shadow,\\" and his re-working of John Lennon's \\"Oh My Love\\" is pitch-perfect and recalls DMs albums from the early 1980s. While \\"Counterfit2\\" has indeed grown on me, it's still not perfect, as we find Gore handling some material that's out of his range, as evidenced on \\"Lost in the Stars\\" which he delivers straightfaced without an ounce of irony. Otherwise, this is a strikingly good release that gets even better with each listen.
B000001EGA|5.0|In my Elton John collection of Made In England on cassette and Tumbleweed Connection, Madman Across the Water, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, The Big Picture and Songs From the West Coast on CD, this is the only one that I originally did not care for much at all in the beginning but has now become my favorite and is the most enjoyable out of my collection. His other albums while great in their own special way have become somewhat dull and boring to me now and I just don't enjoy them as much as I once did. Maybe I need to buy some more of his albums but right now I tend to get the most enjoyment from this classic 1975 album that I honestly believe everyone should own.
B000001ESF|1.0|this album is terribly funny, but i would probably never listen to it.  rush is really an extremely mediocre band and this album is nothing other than tasteless plagiarism of bands like yes, king crimson, genesis, not to mention authors like ayn rand.  probably the most unintentionally funny album ever released.  but since it is made by rush, it is still quite unlistenable.  get something like \\"close to the edge\\", \\"the lamb lies down on broadway\\", or \\"trout mask replica\\"
B00000JCB2|5.0|This CD is better than Three Dollar Bill Y'all. I own all 3 of the Bizkit's albums. Here's My Review.<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>1)Intro - Electro talk by Lethal. Quite entertaining. 5/10<br />2)Just Like This - Well, John(Otto) brang that beat back for sure, while Fred makes a great spot of work on his vocals. Cool song. 10/10<br />3)Nookie - The hit of the CD, I'm just gonna say: \\"I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR THE NOOKIE!\\" After the song ends, there's this thing with Fred breaking stuff, heading into Break Stuff. 10/10<br />4)Break Stuff - I'd say that Break Stuff is one of the best songs on here. Surely great to listen to after a BAD day at work/school. My 3rd favourite. 10/10+<br />5)Re-Arranged - After Break Stuff, comes a calm song with vocals that don't quit, very well done turntable work throughout the entire song, not to mention this song has the best bass lines in the song. My favourite song without a doubt. 10/10+<br />6)I'm Broke - Did you think that this is kinda like Break Stuff? I do, only this is about giving people money and not getting paid back. Sam Rivers drives the bass very well at the beginning. The message machine at the end is entertaining aswell. 10/10<br />7)Nobody Like You - My 2nd favourite on the CD. Jon Davis of KoRn and Scott Weiland both helping Fred with the vocals, what could be better? 10/10+<br />8)Don't Go Off Wandering - I have to admit it isn't the best, but it's still cool for an emotion song. 8/10<br />9)9 Teen 90 Nine - Much like Don't Go Off Wandering, only at the end, Fred's mum(Anita Durst)sings a song called: \\"My Billygoat\\" which isn't very good, 9 Teen 90 Nine on the other hand, is a cool song. 8/10<br />10)N 2 Gether Now - DJ Premier did one good job producing this song, and Method Man helps Fred make a hit Hip-Hop song. 10/10<br />11)Trust? - Most people would consider this a combination of 9 Teen 90 Nine and Break Stuff, and so would I. Quite Vulgar, and I love it. 10/10<br />12)No Sex - Well, this is an emotion song, but not as good emotion song as Re-Arranged is. Still good though. 7/10<br />13)Show Me What You Got - Much like Three Dollar Bill's \\"Indigo Flow\\". Really cool. And the occasional chants of \\"Get The [heck] Up\\" are the best. 10/10<br />14)A Lesson Learned - This bit only has Fred singin' by himself in a sort of voice that he had in Three Dollar Bill's Everything, Not good at all. 4/10<br />15)Outro - Lethal's back with electro-talk again, only it's longer and more cool. After he's finished, Matt Pinfield has a discussion about how he hates the teeny-boping songs taking up space in the charts, and ends up going off and storming out and Fred comes walking after him, trying to calm him down. And Then comes The Mind Of Les Claypool. Les sure seems like he's gotten high, especially when he goes: \\"Once when I was afraid to speak.\\"etc. Funny And Cool. 10/10<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>My Favourites(Most to Least)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Re-Arranged(5 Stars)<BR>Nobody Like You(With Jon Davis and Scott Weiland)(5 Stars)<BR>Break Stuff(5 Stars)<BR>Outro(5 Stars)<BR>Nookie(5 Stars)<BR>I'm Broke(4 1/2 Stars)<BR>Just Like This(4 1/2 Stars)<BR>Show Me What You Got(4 1/2 Stars)<BR>Trust?(4 Stars)<BR>N 2 Gether Now(With Method Man)(4 Stars)<BR>Don't Go Off Wandering(3 Stars)<BR>9 Teen 90 Nine(2 1/2 Stars)<BR>No Sex(2 Stars)<BR>Intro(1 1/2 Stars)<BR>A Lesson Learned(1 Star)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>My favourites are definitely:<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>1.Re-Arranged(5:54)<BR>2.Nobody Like You(With Jon Davis and Scott Weiland)(4:20)<BR>3.Break Stuff(2:46)<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Goodbye Now<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------
B000005JA8|1.0|blistering.  daring.  explosive.  this is a large stride in the history of music.  an excellent example of vision and creativity.  kudos to b-fart for pushing the envelope and giving the world this work of incredible value.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Hey Y'all, just came by to review the Limp's CD.<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>1)Intro - Just an intro, but the best intro I've ever heard. 10/10<br />2)Hot Dog - You gotta hand it to Fred Durst for making a song that can have at least 45 to 50 f words. This song can get repetitive, but who cares? Great rock after the intro. 10/10<br />3)My Generation - Better than the last, it gets better towards the end. More swearing, but after hearing Hot Dog, Who really cares? At least they have more actual lyrics than just swear words. 10/10<br />4)Full Nelson - Man I think that this is like Significant Others's Break Stuff, only longer. When you're completely [upset], this, much like Break Stuff, can be great to listen to, It'll really cheer you up. 10/10<br />5)My Way - My favourite song on here. Only 3 swear words, plus the chorus is the heaviest part of the song surrounded by the turntable work and keyboards. That plus great work by the band makes this one the perfect song. 10/10+<br />6)Rollin'(Air Raid Vehicle) - Their hit song right now. And this is my 5th favourite on there. As far as it goes, this song is probably the song that's most likely to get on soundtracks, because it's one of the best. 10/10 <br />7)Livin' It Up - Much like Rollin', only that it's less repetitive(You know, Rollin' Rollin' Rollin', and this is like: Life in the Fast Lane, I'm a crazy [person], Livin' It Up.) Nice song if you want to listen to a song with a living touch. 10/10<br />8)The One - In this song, Fred proves that he isn't just some guy who just shouts swear words on a microphone. My 4th favourite song. And I really like the hidden track at the end too. 10/10<br />9)Getcha Groove On(With Xzibit) - Great song by Limp, but Xzibit's appearance really brang this song straight up to great heights. 10/10<br />10)Take A Look Around(Theme From MI:2) - My 3rd favourite, and another hit besides Rollin' and My Generation. Emotion, plus, a little metal into it. Much like My Way, only 2 swear words, which makes this another great song. 10/10+<br />11)It'll Be Okay - Many people consider this song as one of their best, and I have to agree. Because it is. An emotional song, with heavy work when it gets to the 3 minute mark. Great song. 10/10<br />12)Boiler - My 2nd favourite song. See what I said for My Way, only that this isn't surrounded by turntable work. Perhaps one of the heaviest songs here. The hidden track at the end, where Fred tells the listener to kickback and think about everything they've just heard, should be at the end of Outro really, never mind, still my 2nd favourite song, but unfortunately can't beat My Way. 10/10+<br />13)Hold On - The emotional song. At the beginning, Scott Weiland once again lends a hand on a track, and they sure did a great song, but when Fred came in on the scene, things really went insane. 10/10<br />14)Rollin'(Urban Assault Vehicle) - A rap version of the hit. Redman, Method Man, Swiss Beatz, DMX and the man himself, Fred Durst. Not as good as Air Raid, but still good. 10/10<br />15)Outro - Chocolate Starfish has completed his mission, and Ben Stiller and Fred are in a conversation about Limp Bizkit.

0749704454|5.0|This book is awesome. It's also sort of sad. It's about a sleek and beautiful horse get's sold from his mother. He go's to a boy named Albert, and stays there for two years. He is treated with creulty by Albert's father, but love from Alebert himself. They name the horse Joey. But war starts and Joey is sold by Albert's cruel father to the soldiers, to go into war. <BR> That's about all I can say. You gotta read the book! I like this book, mainly becuase it is about horses, and it is told by the horse, Joey. It's his point of view.

0688163173|5.0|&quot;Shutter Island&quot; is the first book by Dennis Lehane I've ever read. I heard about this book from a movie Website. Apparently Wolfgang Peterson (director of Air Force One, and In the Line of Fire) has optioned this book to be turned into a movie. Reading this book, I can say it would make a FANTASTIC movie. But I digress...<br />Dennis Lehane's prose is very well paced; secrets behind every corner. Plot twists abound, but I can't say the whole book surprised me because I thought of just about every scenario Marshals Daniels and Aule could get into. At first I thought the premise of two US Marshals looking for an insane, escaped murderess on an island during a hurricane was a little to zany to work, but man, I'll tell you, the whole book is so well done! And I was TOTALLY satisfied with the denouement.<br />The dialogue really grabs you. Its funny at times, heartbreaking at others and completely true to life. Kudos to Dennis Lehane! Now I'm gonna have to go back and read his previous works, and I can't wait!
B000031WD9|5.0|Teen movies. Teen sex movies. God love 'em. Up until now, these kinds of movies aren't exactly looked on with much praise or respect. \\"Porky's\\" made sure of that. That is the film that AP will probably be most referenced too. What a shame. This movie, while still raunchy and loaded with hormone crazed teens, is what a good teen sex comedy should be. It is very easy for the cynics to blast it and see it as nothing but a lame, unintelligible pile of trash that is just about horny kids wanting to have sex. How unfortunate for them. More on that a bit later. The plot for the film is pretty basic and has been served as a plot line for many a film over the years. We have a batch of kids, our nerdy hero Jim(Jason Biggs), cool jock Oz(Chris Klein), wild man Stifler(Sean William Scott), Intellectual dork Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas), and nice guy Kevin(Thomas Ian Nicholas), who make a pact with each other. They all plan to lose their virginity on prom night. They, among many other teens in real life, don't want to leave high school as virgins. And what better night to do it than on prom night?. It happens in real life, why not in the movie?. Each one has a potential female in their lives. Oz has Heather(Mena Suvari), Kevin has Vicky(Tara Reid), Finch has Mrs. Stifler(Jennifer Coolidge), and Jim, well, he has band geek Michelle(the perfect Alyson Hannigan). Eugene Levy is also on hand as Jim's dad. One of the best parts of the film. While some people, mostly parents, probably won't like the message that maybe it's better to leave high school not being a virgin anymore, it is something that is a real issue with high school teens. I think they are a lot smarter than to follow what a movie says. They can make decision on their own. The film is nicely written. It has, unlike most other teen comedies, an intelligent script with good dialogue and well developed characters. But, as usual, there are many reviews who say otherwise. Over their heads. It just depends on if you actually lookto see it. What makes the film most appealing, is that these characters can be you and your friends. Or, at the very least, people you know in high school. The friendships between the guys is nicely developed. You really get a sense that these guys are real friends. You can thank the actors for that. They really make their characters come alive and make them real and believeable. It doesn't need to be Shakespearean acting, because this is supposed to be about life. This is what these actors do with their roles, and they succeed. Lost on a lot of people. One of my favorite things about this film, an aspect that so many people didn't pick up on, is that this film really has a lot of heart. You really didn't expect a film like this to have a sweetness to it, but it does. Jim's speech about being sick of the whole sex thing at the prom was nice. The scenes with him and his dad were touching as well. This is what really made the film. The movie is really different because of it. Who would expect a movie filled with sexual innuendo and some crude humor, to be that way?. Unfortunatley, this part didn't get thru to a lot of bashers of this film. You may not like the aspects of this film, or the character's intentions, but that's life. I, for one, really enjoyed spending time in this zany, youthful world. AP is no cinematic treasure, but then again, it was never meant to be. Nor would it ever want to be. What it is, is a film that is hilarious, sweet, and a lot better than most people give it credit for.
B000063DGC|4.0|Right off the bat, this album definitely belongs in the collection of any metal head.  As the only official live recording to capture Ozzy, Randy, and co. on an album, it's an invaluable treasure trove of music.  However, I can't just plop 5 stars down on it, because it definitely has its flaws.<br />*There's some noticeable dead notes in the songs, as well as some generally sloppy playing from all four band members.<br />*The Sabbath covers: interesting new sound, but they sound a little spazzy, and there isn't a lot of thought behind Randy's noodling.  Eddie Van Halen (the Great) would be more at home in this idiom.  They might have worked better if he would have stuck a little closer to Iommi's originals.<br />*The track selection.  I love Blizzard of Ozz as much as the next guy, but throw some of the other tunes on there!  Of course, I fully understand that \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" (best Ozzy song of all time) is too complex to be done live.<br />I also feel the need to comment that Randy's unaccompanied guitar solo ...  It's almost a composition in itself, but retains a sense of spontaneity.  Also, unlike some of the other reviewers, I'm totally down with Tommy Aldridge's drum solo.  Put that one on the home stereo and feel your gut shake.<br />The Dee outtakes are probably the best part of this album.  You won't be blasting it out of the stereo, but it's really a treat to listen to it through headphones.  It feels like you're sitting right in front of Randy while he plays.
0688163173|1.0|That this book comes from the same pen as the charming and throughly enjoyable series starring Pat and the Gang is amazing...I found Shutter Island to be pretentious, boring, confusing; there were few, if any redeeming qualities. It was not the good story told well that i have come to expect from this author.  Bring back Pat and the gang in another excellent story told well.<br />C. Williams<br />Edgewater, NJ
B00005R2M3|4.0|I did this review for a school project and decided to share it to see what other people thought abour it.  Enjoy.<BR>     In the album Laundry Service, Shakira wrote, co-wrote, arranged, or co-arranged every song.  The 6-time platinum album is Shakira's first album in which she becomes a crossover artist by having almost the entire album in English.  There are many different genres and styles throughout the album.  The reason for this is that Shakira grew up listening to bands such as Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, and the Beatles, but her father was of Lebanese descent, which is why some of her songs are rock and others have an Arabic flavor.  <BR> The Columbian prodigy became a huge hit in North America when she released the single \\"Whenever, Wherever\\".  This song has a pop/Arabic sound to it.  The next song released was \\"Objection (Tango)\\".  This is one of my favorite songs on the CD.  In it Shakira talks about how she wants a man's attention, but he is giving it to others.  The tango style of the song makes many people (including me) want to get up and dance the tango.  The 12th and 13th tracks on the CD {\\"Suerte\\" and \\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\\"} are \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and \\"Objection (Tango)\\" in Spanish.  <BR> Shakira started writing songs when she was eight years old.  She is now regarded as one of the best poetic songwriters in Columbia.  You can best hear her poetic side in \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\", \\"Fool\\" and \\"Poem to a Horse\\".  \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" starts off with one of Shakira's most famous lines, \\"You're a song written by the hands of God.\\"  The song compliments Shakira's voice with trumpets, trombones, saxophones, percussion and an electric guitar.  \\"Poem to a Horse\\" talks about a person who is doing drugs.  She says, \\"I would rather eat soup with a fork or drive a cab in New York `cause to talk to you is harder work.\\"  Another line that I like is \\"So what's the point of wasting all of my words if it's just the same or even worse than reading poems to a horse.\\"  She tries to tell the person that what they are doing is bad and that she now wants nothing to do with them, but talking to them is useless.  The style is pop rock and has trumpets, saxophones and electric guitar.  \\"Fool\\" is a love song but not like most that are heard on the top forty.  It has a really creative line that goes \\"with my tears you'd make a sea a desert.\\"<BR> The songs with the most Arabic sounds are \\"Eyes like Yours (Ojos As)\\" and \\"Whenever, Wherever\\".  \\"Eyes like Yours (Ojos As)\\" is one of my top five favorite tracks on the CD.  Pan flutes and Brazilian drums make it sound mystical.  It is the type of song that takes you into another world when you close your eyes and listen to it.  Gloria Estefan translated this song when Shakira decided to make an English album.  <BR> Many fans enjoy listening to Shakira, whose name means the graceful one, in Spanish.  She has four tracks on the Laundry Service CD that are in Spanish.  They are \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\"; \\"Que Me Quedes Tu\\"; \\"Suerte (Whenever, Wherever)\\" and \\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\\".  I like the lively beat and rock style of \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\", even though I have no idea what she is singing.  It is a fun, upbeat song.  \\"Que Me Quedes Tu\\" sounds Arabic for the first few beats, but then turns into rock 'n' roll.  It is somewhat slow and one of my least favorite tracks on the CD.<BR> You can hear rock 'n' roll in \\"Rules\\", \\"The One\\", \\"Fool\\", \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\" and \\"Que Me Quedes Tu\\".  \\"Rules\\" focuses on the rules that Shakira has for her lover.  Some of these rules are \\"You can laugh only if you laugh with me.  You can cry only if you cry for me.  Don't forget that you're condemned to me.\\"  \\"The One\\" is about the one that Shakira loves.  Each of these songs has a true rock `n' roll sound to it.  <BR> Last but not least Shakira brings back disco in \\"Ready for the Good Times\\".  The song makes you want to get up and dance especially if you listen to the words, which talk about how Shakira is done with her hard work, and ready for the good times.<BR> I hope that this review has helped you decide if you want to buy the CD Laundry Service by Shakira.  She has a truly individual voice that can be at times powdery soft and the next second as strong as a lion. It can be compared with no one else's.  \\"Shakira's music has a personal stamp that doesn't look like anyone else's and no one can sing or dance like her, at whatever age, with such an innocent sensuality, one that seems to be of her own invention,\\" said Nobel Prize winner, Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
B00006BTCA|5.0|everyone that is saying that this is just a band trying to bring old bands back to life... i would have to disagree. i find interpols music to be some of the most refreshing music ive ever heard. and, ill admit it, i didn't hear joy division untill i heard the comparisons of them to interpol... and sorry if this is herresy, but i like interpol a lot better. the similarity is only in the voice.. and maybe the mood of the music. but the music in this album is complex and beautifully layered. every month or two i rediscover this album and am blown away by it every time. i cant wait for their second album. i suggest buying this album to anyone that likes good music. all of the songs on this album are wonderful. even my least favorite on the album, 'nyc', is still one of my favorite songs. just listen to it for what it is. not looking for petty comparisons.
B000060P79|1.0|You know it's a sad day for punk rock when 12 year old preppy girls flock to the NFG simple plan concerts. Why does punk rock suck so bad now? This cd is the epitomy of [bad] punk rock. If you want to listen to good punk/emo go buy Les Savy Fav ...
B000001DVD|4.0|I liked &quot;High 'n' Dry&quot; pretty well. It's got an earlier sound of Def Leppard, but you can still hear their melodies very well on it. My favorite track is &quot;Bringin' On the Heartbreak&quot; where you can REALLY hear their signature sound coming out. This isn't as complete an album as their later stuff, but it still has its moments of greatness. &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; is one of the best Def Leppard songs ever! I'd love to hear this one live. If you're a bass player like me, you'll love Sav's basslines on it. &quot;Hit and Run&quot; is another great one; love it too. But the true Def Leppard fan should buy this album for one song: &quot;Switch 625.&quot; It is Steve Clark's masterpiece. I could listen to Switch all day long just to love it even more. It's all built around a simple three note progression, but Steve makes it sound like a guitar orchestra. Miss you Steve.
B000002LKF|5.0|It literally took me a few years to really get properly into this album, and I was a definite Paul Simon fan.  Now I'm quite convinced that it's his very best work, and among the greatest recordings of the 20th century.  I've not too much to say about it, but for two things:<br />I. Spirit Voices: it's totally awesome that Paul Simon - my man - recorded a song about drinking ayahuasca.<br />II. The Cool, Cool River: my favorite song from the album, it features the most amazing, quiet bridges.  Oddly enough, I think this one sounds like it's describing Mohammed Atta and his crew.  Anger and no one can heal it slides through the metal detector...the cool, cool river sweeps the wild, wide ocean.  The entire song sound like the sentiment of a raging, disaffected man intent on destroying from the inside the &quot;wild wide ocean&quot; of forces much greater than him.  That's my .02.
0694517208|4.0|John Gray explains the differences between men and women.  He explains all of the different viewpoints that both men and women face.  Because I am a young lady and in a relationship, it helped me understand why men act some of the ways they do.  I also read the passages that were written about women, and I came to realize that it was a reflection of myself.  This is a very well written book that helps many couples come closer in a relationship because they can see the other's point of view.<br /> John Gray has a very interesting viewpoint on how men and women met long, long ago.  He states that men are from Mars and women are from Venus.  The Martians lived on their planet happily, alone.  As time went on, they began to feel as though a part of them was missing, something they had never known.  Being skillful the Martians built a telescope to see what else was out there, and they found the Venusians.  The Venusians were also lonely and feeling as though something was missing, so the Martians built a ship and went to Venus.  Together they moved to Earth and started life together.  Life was good until little arguments arose.  The Martians and the Venusians were realizing their differences, and could not find a way to get around them.<br /> This book helps us realize our differences and provides suggestions on how to work them out.  If you are in a relationship and are realizing that you argue over the little things, then this book is for you.  It will help you understand and respect each other's differences.
B000089RVX|5.0|Enough people have reviewed this CD beautifully that I don't feel the need to repeat the same kind of information.  But I wanted to get my two cents worth in and let everyone know what an amazing CD this is!  It's one where you'll listen to the whole thing over and over--all the songs are TOP quality!  Now THIS is the kind of CD worth paying the ridiculous CD prices for.  Amy Lee's voice is hauntingly powerful, and the piano melodies are amazing...they just linger with you.  My favorite songs (out of the entire CD, which I'm loving) are My Last Breath, Hello, Taking Over Me, Bring Me Life (current single), and Everybody's Fool.  Scratch that--I love them all!  Definitely buy this one--you won't be disappointed.  Hope Evanescence clears up at the Grammys.  They've really earned it.
B00004UQRF|4.0|I am a fan of early DM, especially from \\"A Broken Frame\\" To \\"Black Celebration\\" and the Additional tracks on \\"Catching Up With...\\" I can appreciate this version, but I wish they would have left \\" But Not Tonight\\" alone (track 13). I like the original version from the U.S. release. There is also a dub of \\"Stripped\\" (track 12). And Track 14, A Harmonica Dub version of \\"Black Celebration\\", I like it. None of these three tracks are listed as being present on this CD. Don't misunderstand I enjoy DM's newer releases, Just not wholly.
B00000IP2L|4.0|This album marks the beginning of my favorite band, Black label Society.  I bought this album when it came out in 1999 and I still play it regularly, however each time a new Black Label album comes out I tend to play the old ones less because the new ones get better each time.  This album is awesome and thoroughly demonstrates Zakk Wylde's jaw dropping soloing and skull crushing riffs from that thick sounding bulls eye les paul. The album is awesome, buy it now and then by Stronger than Death, 1919 Eternal, and The Blessed Hellride.  The reason i gave it four stars is because the production is a bit of a disapointment, but the all of the songs are worthy of five stars.<BR>Bleed Black Label
B00006IRJU|4.0|I first fell in love with Icehouse' music when I heard No Promises on the radio back in '85 or '86. I found the Measure for Measure album and then got to listen to earlier albums that were more alternative and less radio-friendly. But Man of Colors was a tour de force. It was what I wanted from Icehouse. First came the soaring love ballad, Crazy, then the follow-up Electric Blue, with its snazzy riffs, and finally I got the whole album on tape from an acquaintance in Australia. It was magic. Other songs I enjoy are Girl on the Moon and the epic story-song, Sunset and the Heartbreak Kid, which for me was a kind of sequel to the Eagles' New Kid in Town.<BR>This disc is kind of pricey but it's hard to find. I appreciate that they've got extras like extended versions of some songs, but I've heard most of these on other Icehouse albums.
B00005JKPF|5.0|As all the other X-Men fans I rushed to see X2 and was just amazed by what I saw. It truly is amazing what a little bit more money and a lot more time can do. You know a movie is special when the audience is just getting all involved. I haven't heard that much enthusiasm in a theatre since....well in a long time.<br />The main plot is the mutants vs Stryker, a military dude bent on ridding the earth of the \\"mutant problem\\". Surrounding that are all kinds of intriguing sub plots including the Wolverine origin story. <br />All in all, expect more of the same from the first film. Great acting, effects that don't upstage the story, and even humour. I would dare to say that this is one of the most re-watchable films I have ever seen. Bravo to Brian Singer and his team for kicking off the summer with an optic blast sized bang. Plus proving once and for all that when done correctly a comic book based film can be more than blue screen tricks and spandex. See this movie now and pray there is an X3 on the horizon.
0393312836|2.0|A Clockwork orange is a good choice for reading material if you have a lot of time and you feel like reading a book twice.  I was very confused all through this book.  It is not something that I would read again.  I didn't care for the language, I found that it made it very difficult to understand and follow.  The message of the book is sort of good.  The people really want to help Alex but the way they go about it can be debated. Some people i'm sure will love this book, but I have found that this book wasn't for me.
B000008LUN|4.0|This is the album that really made UFO a force to be reckon with, and it was the first one of the classic five studio albums that ended with \\"Obsession\\" in 1978. In the opening straight rocker \\"Oh My\\", Phil Mogg is singing \\"Oh my, oh how the times have changed\\", and the times sure did change for UFO as guitar wizard Michael Schenker joined the band. \\"Phenomenon\\" was released back in 1974, and the album features the well known and excellent \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" (maybe UFO's biggest hit ever) and the fan favourite \\"Rock Bottom\\", the album's hardest song which I personally don't fancy that much `cos of the quite boring chorus. Among the better tunes on this album are the beautiful semi ballad \\"Crystal Light\\" - a real highlight in UFO's long career - and the melodic and attractive \\"Too Young To Know\\". This is a classic rock album indeed, and if you want to be more familiar with  hard rock from the 1970's in general this is a very good album to invest in.
B000002IRL|5.0|Back in the day, thrash groups ruled the metal scene and they all put out a \\"classic\\" at one time;  an album that most agreed was their best.  These albums were required reading, and you HAD to have them in your collection if you were a metal fan.  Megadeth had Rust In Peace, Anthrax had Among The Living, Slayer had Reign In Blood, Metallica had Master Of Puppets(or Ride The Lightning, depending on who you asked), and so on.  Overkill had an album like that too: Horrorscope.  They reached their peak, but no one seemed to notice outside the metal circle.  They just didn't \\"make it\\" for some reason even though they are considered a classic thrash group.  Ironically enough, they're the only one of the aforementioned groups that's stayed true to their music and their fans.  This album is very fast, very heavy and rivals the best of what Slayer and Megadeth did in their prime.  Well, if you missed it the first time around(I'm guilty of that), it's not too late to treat yourself.  This album will take you back to when your booty was in high school drawing band logos on your notebooks;  When you were dabbling in skateboarding and thought Metallica were godlike, totally oblivious to what they would become.  And you yelled \\"SLAYER!\\" at every concert you went to.  Yes, pick up Horrorscope.  You'll thank me later
B000066NW0|1.0|Seriously, I don't know what all this &quot;Avril&quot; fuss is about. She says she doesn't want to be anything but ordinary, but she really is ordinary. Just another story of another &quot;rock star&quot; that will probably be long forgotten in a few years. Her music is nothing new. Completely typical for a &quot;punk rocker&quot; and to me, she is a complete poser. Sorry Avril, But your no differant than anyone else.
0066214122|5.0|Flavored of The Andromeda Strain, Sphere, Congo, and Jurassic Park, Prey is a choice morsel for Crichton fans who appreciate his realistic use of dialogue, the eerie not-quite-right feel he carefully cultivates even as things seem to be going the hero's way, and the swiftness of his storytelling overall. I found Prey extremely hard to set down, though it was plain to see where some of the intricacies were heading...some of them. The book starts off a little bland, like the hero himself, but once it gets moving the action is fast and nerve-wrackingly fun. The most refreshing thing about this particular piece is that Crichton doesn't eat up pages explaining technicalities to death or filling good story-space with graphics and such which are kind of neat, but not integral for the reader to have to take time to study. This tale is told simply, quickly, and honestly, and should sit proudly on the shelf where his other works are stored in your home. Nice job, Michael.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I like this band, there dark, different in a sense and are addictive. This band is a great indie rock band and remind me of a lot of bands like joy divison(i know everyone thinks it), echo &amp; the bunnymen, and the liars. But i also see a little of the velvet underground influencing these guys music. The album is full highlights like untitled, obstacle 1 + 2, PDA and of course NYc. I recommend it to anyone who is into indie rock.
0451196716|5.0|participants in a contest has to obey certain rule. a minimum speed limit, keeping straight a head, not hindering the others, etc.if you don't, you'll get shot. this is a story from the contest. 100 participants. during the walk they start talking, playing, etc. lurking is death. the main character, garraty, talks to some. observes the others and spectators. thinks. looks back. SK shows great psychology here. and there is something about the book that always grabs my interest. why would anypne participate in such a contest, you may ask. that's the book's real depth. there is no one reason. some want to die, one wants to see others die, some look for the meaning of life. the book tells something about humans. how we look for a meaning. how men try to become men. what life is about. the book is actually SK's deepest and most interesting. the one who works best on a human-to-human level too.
B00008NG5V|4.0|I just got this album a few days ago and I've been listening to it over and over again.  If you liked his first album, you are certainly will like his second one because he didn't change his style a bit...and that's what I think is very cool.  Again, his mellow acoustic mixed in with a few more poppy songs (a.k.a Bubble Toes off of BF) keep the record going all the way for 16 tracks.<BR>  My personal favorites on the album are &quot;Horizons Have Been Defeated&quot;, with it's reggaeish feel, &quot;Taylor&quot; and &quot;Wasting Time&quot;.  This CD puts you in the summer mood to just go cruising around with the top down or kicking it at the beach in your flipflops.  I definitely recommend it.
0451523938|4.0|this has been considered one of the real classics in horror. it's about a doctor going to far in his experimentations. he is actually good natured, but drinking a certain elixir he becomes pure evil, mr. hyde. one would perhaps think that jekyll was not ineterested in becoming mr. hyde, but it has certain advantages. desires can be satisfied, without distress for the doctor. so he adjusts to his new  two lifestyles life, supporting mr. hyde. ti his friend, it is only known that jekyll has some strange contact with hyde. how long will it take before hyde goes too far? can jekyll give hyde up? stevenson's style is good,, and the plot interesting, the suspence kept. although he sadly does not explore the plot's true potentiality. this is a very misunderstood book. it is interpreted as man being of good and evil (which is right) and that jekyll simply divides these two sides between his two lives (which is wrong). what people forget is that jekyll was a nice guy, doing nothing bad, before becoming mr. hyde. he wakes his evil side, which lures him and grow in him. the book is about the power of evil more than the duality of man. if we surrender to evil or awaken it, we are going on a path of no return.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This is by far the best album nofx has ever done. The lyrics are great and the music is awesome too. I think its great that nofx made this album more political than their other ones. I think they have great views on what the problems with this country are. Before i heard this album i didnt care about what was going on in the white house, but it really opened my eyes to the scandals and lies we are being told. well, im typing this in school and my teacher is coming over here so... BUY THIS ALBUM! later all
0805047905|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite book.  At 5 months old, she would yell and stare at the book until I read it to her.  She loves the bright, bold pictures and the rythm of the book.  We have read this book so often that I have it memorized.  When she is a bit cranky, I recite it and she quiets immediately.  I highly recommend this book.
6304806426|1.0|An exceptionally annoying movie detailing the inexplicable love lives of two self absorbed characters you absolutely cannot care for if you have any acquaintance with real human beings. <br />Unquestionably some nice photography and some good acting but what a dreadfullly boring movie about detestable people. <br />Avoid unless you have no life and enjoy emotional self flagellation.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I just picked up the new NoFx cd, the war on errorsim, yesterday and all I have to say is that I am impressed. NoFx still knows how to rock after years of doing it. The cd starts out with a mocking of what has become the scene, punk music, and the control of authority with the Seperation of chirch and skate. From there on it is excellent cd with NoFx's trademark funny songs like she's nubs. As you can see by the title is a more politcal cd, which shows the errors and just plain dumbness of W. Bush and his Administration. Pick this cd up, you won't be sorry.
B00005JL78|1.0|Where to start? How about an intelligently written plot? You won't find one in this movie. <br />Apparently the special effects (which were already dated when the movie was released), some decent photography and Tom Cruise were all this movie ever had going for it. But that's not enough. Stupidly written movie with major holes in the plot and a depressing story.<br />Bad bad bad movie.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I enjoyed this film \\"Chicago\\" it was very fun type of movie. I liked the cast they all did really well in there performances. The Music was excellent with very old fashion jazz type of beat. Much better then Moulin Rouge a very fun musical Chicago was.
B00005JKPF|5.0|In this, the second installment of the X-men series, the mutants find themselves up against something far more subtle and difficult to defeat than the first time:  humans who can manipulate them.  This movie was a tremendous follow-up to the first film, and (for me at least) surpassed it in nearly all aspects.  First of all, the characters from the first film are very nicely developed, especially those of Wolverine and Rogue.  Second, many mutants with small parts in the first one and even more who never made appearances at all are now part of the team, and get in on the action.  And finally, the action sequences, special effects, and storyline are absolutely amazing!<br />Nightcrawler, Colossus, Iceman--these are all familiar X-men to many, yet they had no role (or insignificant in Iceman's case) in the first film.  It was great to see the action with these and other new mutants.  Also, Wolverine's past is more fully explored, and the relationship between Magneto and Xavier is also developed (the fact that they have to work together, to some extent, to defeat a common enemy shows that they really are two men with the same purpose, but a different way of accomplishing their goals).  I was very impressed with the twists and turns taken in the relationships of the characters, and the development of the X-man saga.<br />The special effects for this film were absolutely breathtaking, as were the action sequences.  The film opens with a spectacular display by Nightcrawler, and is soon followed up by a berserker rage by Wolverine.  There are several great sequences in the film, and the sight of each mutant using his or her powers (Magneto breaking out of his cell comes to mind) makes you want to stand up and cheer.<br />With the colossal success of these movies and the Spider-Man film, Marvel movies seem to be riding high.  I would love to see a movie involving both Spidey and the X-men, but that's not likely to happen any time soon.  Still, for what it's worth, X2: X-menUnited is a wonderful new addition to the growing catalog of comic-book movies.
0380789035|1.0|I don't understand it. I loved Neverwhere. I love fantastical quests through small-town America. I love mythology. Yet I hate this book. I promised myself that I would read half of it before I put it down, but I think I'm going to welch. My major complaint is that the book is dull, dull, dull as dishwater. I liked the main character while he was in prison. I wish he'd stayed there. His wife died. Who cares? He plays chess for his life. Who cares? He helps rob a bank. Who cares? I'd rather watch a documentary on the Hoover dam. I was quite surprised to come here and see how many people loved this book. What am I missing?
B00005JLEU|4.0|I feel that I should let it be known that I am a fan of  Hayao Miyazaki's work and might be a little biased.  My friends were upset that disney is putting out his films, but hearing the director talk about the stipulations in their contract with DIsney I feel that these fears are mostly unwarrented.<br />    This film is very enjoyable.  It is visually captivating and the main characters are all intresting.  Many of the themes presented are similar to those disney includes in their films.  It is a story of growth on the part of the main character, who overcomes various obstacles in her quest to save her parents and go home.  It is  Hayao Miyazaki's imagination in presenting this tale that makes it a worthwhile watch.<br />THe DVD bonuses are also enjoyable.  It gives you insight into how and why DIsney brought these films to the US.  THe documentary of the making of the Japanese version is also worthwhile for the insight it gives you into the process of making such a film, but more importantly it gives you an insight into the culture and the cultural changes going on in Japan.  (when Miyazaki is trying to explain to his staff what he wants visually).  <br />It it worthwhile for those who are old enough and who can stand subtitles, to watch it in Japanese and then later to watch it again in english so you can absorb more of the visuals.
B00006JDS4|1.0|Much has been made of this movie for all it's violence and sadisam, but when all of the hype is out of the way this is just a bad film. <BR>     The movie is about a women who travels into the woods to stay at a house on a lake is attacked and brutally beaten and raped by four men. After they leave her for dead she recovers and comes back to get her revenge.<BR>     The movie is just a revenge movie plain and simple but that style of movie has been done befor and with much better results than this one.<BR>     One thing I will give the film is that the four men never at any time feel anything for the four men becouse we saw what awful things they did. However it's just an excuse to show sickness in all it's glory. Compared to some movies this sick film is not one of the worst in violence (remember though i'm talking about movies like Cannibal Holocaust, Zombie, and Dead Alive) but for it's time it must have been very shocking. <BR>     I Spit never lives up to the hype. Roger Ebert said this was the one film he hated and I must agree with him on that point.
B0000640VO|5.0|This film was enjoyable and that made it worth the money spent.  The Characters of Amelie and her true love were both figures I can relate to... being someone who frequently inhabbits the border between reality and imagination.  Some people complain about the way the film plays out... the predictability of it all... how it seems to drag forever until they finally hook up... these were grievences I had when i first started watching this movie... but I found that now I care not.<br />THe visions in this movie are amazing.  In the series of narrtives we get about Amelie's childhood are expecially funny, as are all the things she imagines.  I especially liked the insights that you got into characters lives.  Some of them were small and odd (like someone who only likes popping bubble wrapp) but made sense in a weird kind of way.  <br />Another comment frequently made is how unrealistic the portrayel of Paris is... my reponse... It's not supposed to be realistic... little is... the Main Character's world view is skewed by her nature.  Both her and the Male lead character saw the world through rose tinted lenses, and this is what we are shown.<br />Also of note is the score/soundtrack of the film which also plays an important role in creating the overall sense of feeling and emotion.  <br />Anyway... ONce again... if you can suspend your belief in reality and just let the movie sweep you up... You'll come down smiling..
B0000931OG|4.0|Admittedly, I am an incredibly huge Blur fan. I've been listening to them since their first CD came out, and have always been impressed with their ability to change with every album... until I heard Think Tank for the first time. When I first popped this one into the CD player, I was practically humming with excitement, at least until I started listening to it. As a fan of their more acoustic stuff (my favorite song is \\"This is a Low\\"), I must say that I was disappointed, but as I listened to the CD the second time through, it really started to grow on me. After the third, it hasn't left my CD player. For all those out there who aren't too fond of the \\"new\\" sound of Blur - try it, you might be surprised.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a powerful album that mixes soft and hard instrumentals with soft and hard vocals. There is intense rhgythmic and dynamic range among the haunting songs.<br />Amy Lee has succeeded in creating he own vocal sound - sultry yet packed with force. If Enya sang heavy metal - it would be something like this.<br />The mix of distorted guitar, piano, tribal persuccion and vocals is masterful.<br />Yes, Bring Me To Life also from the Daredevil soundtrack is a catchy single, but there are many other gems to be found here.<br />Give this album a listen and be drawn inside.
039472903X|5.0|It has often been said David Ogilvy was a genius in his own mind. Well, he was in many others as well. He built Ogilvy and Mather into the giant it is with simple beliefs. He wrote this Admans Guide to Advertising, but he went past it, umbuing it with his whit and charm. Instead of a dry how-to-book on advertising read only by people in the industy, he created a book anyone could enjoy. His writing is strong, sincere and straight from the heart. Why the book has earned millions and will continue to do so.<br />A man well missed, but his work lives on.
B00007G207|5.0|This film should reach straight into the heart of every man who has loved his father or who has loved the man who stood in for his biological father who, for whatever reasons, couldn't be there. There have been many films about father-son relationships and some of those films have been great. Cinema Paradiso is one of the great ones. It expresses in the most touching and beautiful images and with the most tender and powerfully moving music, the need of every man to find and cherish the love that lives in the deepest realms of his heart, of his soul. The final scene of this film expresses one man's discovery of this love.<br /><br />Along with the final scene in Alan J. Pakula's film, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", Cinema Paradsio's final scene is the most profoundly meaningful and touching visual metaphor found in any film I've ever seen. A treasure. Cinema Paradiso is a masterpiece of love and affection about - and for - the whole family of human souls.
B00008DDXB|1.0|the book was okay, but Chris columbus wrecked it, especially with the corny spider scene. the actors were mainly pretty wooden, especially radcliffe, who said his lines with no emotion, nothing to make it believable. The last one was made watchable only by Coltrane but in this one he plays a much smaller role. The comic relief void left by his absence is filled by Kenneth Branagh, who gives a fine preformance as harry's new teacher but nothing special. Finally, the worst thing about this film is the ending, a scene where everyone in hogwarts is happy and hagrid comes and gives them all a big hug. This sickly sweet scene is not in the book. if you must have this then save some money and rent it.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I had never heard of Jack Johnson before today but the cover just jumped out and said give me a listen and I am sure glad I did. I felt as if I was transported to a beautiful secluded beach somewhere. It is so beautifully mastered and the sound just took me away. I highly recommend this album for a soothing night sitting on the deck with an iced drink in the summer...

B000002JK2|5.0|Although more famous for rock operas, sarcastic sixties singles and smashing guitars, this fairly subdued LP is one of the more durable projects from Townshend's tumultuous career.  To begin with, it's not only Pete's triumph, for Ronnie Lane's songs are easily the equal to those of his temporary partner, and a good showcase for that understated and underrated songwriter who contributed many fine items to the catalogue of his raucous band of previous employ, The Faces.    Released in 1977, the opening year for punk in Great Britain, and doubly ironic in that it was not only a quiet album by members of two very loud bands, but a quiet album by members of two of the few 'old fart bands' still held in esteem by the punks.    In fact, this album shows again how much of the attack of even the hardest rock bands of the 1960s and 1970s was merely souped-up folk and blues music, and how much the punks missed by negating all the bluesy, funk and groove elements in rock and roll, at least until the Clash released London Calling, and Paul Weller quit The Jam to do Motown and Burt Bacharach.  \\"Street in the City,\\" \\"Misunderstood,\\" and \\"My Baby Gives It Away\\" are among the best songs Townshend would write in that entire decade, and Lane's \\"Annie\\" can stand with anything to come from the pen of those mining the vein the British retro-folk-rock uncovered in the wake of Fairport Convention's experimentation.  Both singer-songwriters shine on these inspired detours into older forms, and guests Eric Clapton (doesn't he guest on half the albums made in England during that time?), the late John Entwistle, and Charlie Watts lend their estimable talents to the project.    The mastering on this compact disc is fairly poor, however, and the cover is that of the budget reissue rather than the original from 1977.  Other albums from Townshend's back catalogue have seen better treatment than this overlooked gem; hopefully with the announced remastering project of Townshend solo albums for 2006, these oversights will be corrected, restoring dignity to this marvelous record.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Loved the books and the films really reflect the author's participation in the filmmaking process. My son and I have read all of the books together, and we both really enjoyed this film. However, certain parts of this film are a bit frightening and are NOT for small children.
B000002KDO|5.0|The boys third album might be their heaviest and their sludgiest album before they started to experiment more variety with there follow ups, Sweet Leaf is a track about marijuana abuse and this song is one of Black Sabbath's best and no Black Sabbath fan is complete without this song, 5/5. After Forever is another classic about theogical beliefs and this song has great riffs even though that it wasn't one of their better-known songs, 5/5 Embryo is a short instrumental which is the introduction to the classic track, 3/5 (5/5 if you take this and Children of the Grave as one song). Children of the Grave is one of Black Sabbath's best songs of all time and it became a blueprint for their live shows, even after Ozzy Osbourne was booted out of Sabbath, 5/5. Orchid is the first of the accoustic instrumentals, just not much to say about this one, 3/5. Lord of This World returns to the metal format and it's a great song, it should've been on Symptom of the Universe 1970-78, 5/5. Solitude is in the same vein as Planet Caravan and my question is, is that Ozzy singing in the background or what, 3.5/5. Into the Void became a blueprint for the grunge era of the 1990's and Soundgarden covered this song and this song is awesome, an excellent way to close the album, 5/5.<br />If you love Black Sabbath or heavy metal music, then add this CD to your music collection and you won't be dissapointed.
0375414053|5.0|If you have ever worked in corporate America (or the equivalent anywhere in the world) you will enjoy this book.  It's absolutely hysterical and full of references to the challenges of balancing an overly demanding job with the unique demands of parenting.  This book had my laughing the entire time.  A must read!
B00000AFWW|5.0|this is all one opinion<br />i have been a fan of courtney and hole from the beginning. pretty one the inside is masterpiece of spitcore youthism. everytime i slip that record in it reminds of what it is to have real rage and emotion in me ... live through this is probably my fave...for all the obvious reasons. i am a woman, and courtney struck every chord ive ever felt i wasnt liable to say (not saying i didnt) on that record.<BR>ive read almost every biography on courtney and nirvana...and i think that for those people that think courtney killed or was affiliated with kurts death should take their heads out of their butts and take it for what it is. i am as big a fan of nirvana as to hole, if not more, and that is saying a lot. and yes, it broke my heart when kurt died, and i of course realized one of the few humans to ever live that knew what it is to be alive (ironically) has killed himself...and my life was over, as it was to millions. think about that, and how many people were affected by this. think about the repurcutions. then think about courtney and frances bean, who by every right felt this the hardest. she did this facing angry fans, cruel media and ignorant people, all the while trying to understand what the hell just happened. its enough to make anyone want to cry. its also enough for someone to re-assess their life, because everything they thought they knew is now a lie. so after thinking about that, and then listening to celebrity skin, decide if you want to call courtney love a sell-out. its not her job to keep ignorant people out there happy, and its not her job to justify what you all think of her. she is human too, and celebrity skin proves just how human she is. if you think she has sold out, just remember that she doesnt care. sell your slow processed opinions people, and buy yourself a clue <BR>PEACE :)
B000001FDQ|5.0|To start off Yngwie Malmsteen is not for you pop kids out there. So when you say his music is heartless or empty emotion, you definitely don't know what your talking about, let alone that you can't see talent if it smacked you in the face. Don't like his style of music? There's over thousands of mainstream bands that all sound the same, so go back to them. Now that's out of the way, this album is great from beginning to end. The master virtuoso has no limitations to his skills. As he stands out the greatest guitar player of time (my opinion) Rising Force was another great addition to his collection. The three songs that stand out the most are Black Star, Evil Eye, and Icarus' Dream Suite. Great solo's in each song, definitely worth listening to, and you get your money's worth.<br />So don't let the know-it-all pop musicians that say he's only guitar deprive you into buying this. If you had enough of the punk bands that just keep playing back the same set of chords, or the rappers that all sound the same, let alone they all sing about violence, this belongs to you.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Vapid, self-absorbed, annoying, dressed up in last year's &quot;designer&quot; French fashions -- this is Madonna's WeHo/Chelsea Boy album!
B00005OM4N|4.0|In spite of common opinion (often stated by people who have founded theirs on a handful of overplayed Britney radio singles and negative media coverage), Britney is actually very _underrated_. Her showy sexuality and \\"bubblegum-pop\\" roots tend to deceive and make many people shove her off as a two-hit wonder, or a pretty face (and figure) with no talent.<BR>Actually, listening closely to her songs, you'll realize that Britney has a GOOD voice --- unique and expressive, not simply sweet-thin like most girl groups tend to favor these days. <BR>And she can dance, extremely well. Dance _is_ a form of talent. okay? <BR>In this light, Britney is a true artist, and deserves to get the respect an artist should receive.<BR>This CD is, both imagewise and musically, a big step up from her former \\"baby one more time\\" and \\"oops! i did it again\\" material. It experiments with more musical styles, genres, producers, and Britney collaborates more.<BR>1. I'm A Slave 4 U <BR>---If you don't like it at first, it'll grow on ya. One of the best club songs of the year, more of a hip-hop and rnb feel than anything Brit has done before. She shows a sexier side of her voice and pulls this song off well. Makes you wanna get up and dance.  <BR>2. Overprotected <BR>Another Max Martin song, returning to her pop roots, only not so bubblegum. Pretty good song.<BR>3. Lonely  <BR>Probably the \\"hardest\\" pop song on here, almost rock. A solid song with a few secs of Brit-'rap' in the middle.<BR>4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman <BR>Not too gooey a ballad, co-written by Dido. If you like ballads, you'll like this one, and if you don't, you probably won't. Brit's singing is good on the ears, you'll never get the 'screeching' that sometimes annoys on other artists' vocally-oriented tracks. <BR>5. Boys  <BR>Like Slave 4 U, another Neptunes-produced, clubbish song, but sultrier. A funky beat, edgier than most Britney music, also good for getting you into dance-mode.<BR>6. Anticipating<BR>Very poppy, sortof 80's music thing. Hit or miss; you either love it or hate it. Brit's voice very sweetish-light on this one.       <BR>7. I Love Rock 'n' Roll<BR>A cover of the Joan Jett song. Pretty good as a song in itself but when you listen to the original version you might like the feel of it better, as this version of ILRNR is more 'modernized'. Britney sings it all right, though.        <BR>8. Cinderella<BR>Max Martin. Pop song. note: All the pop on this album (except 'anticipating') is grittier than the pop she did before.       <BR>9. Let Me Be <BR>the beginning is almost like an acoustic track and you can hear her singing more clearly in this song than most. Here Brit's voice takes on a low, dry feel.        <BR>10. Bombastic Love <BR>Another Max Martin pop song; some people love it and some people hate it. Interesting arrangement.        <BR>11. That's Where You Take Me<BR>Light song; if you like pop and you're on the romantic side, you'll enjoy this one. Luvvy lyrics and easy listening, with Brit's voice sweeter and gentler than usual.         <BR>12. What It's Like To Be Me <BR>One of the best songs on the album. Co-written by Justin Timberlake and with some of his vocals in the background. Good beat and Britney does well on the vocals.
B0000931OG|3.0|But it was a great ride while it lasted.<br />Blur was at their worst over the top pop, at their best guitar driven Brit-Pop that defined a generation. \\"Think Tank\\" however has tanked, and there doesn't seem to be much thinking.<br />After an inauspicious start with \\"Leisure\\", Blur came back full steam with \\"Modern Life Is Rubbish\\" and continued shifting, sometimes losing their fan-base, but always defining themselves as the finely honed and well-crafted band they were. Parklife was a landmark, and few bands would have the chutzpah to evolve to the sounds of \\"Blur\\" shortly after that. But not content to continue on the same plane, Albarn and company did just that.<br />However, Damon Albarn, a gifted writer, definitely seems to need collaboration or some sort of guidance in the world of Blur. Frankly, I can see him sitting down with the demo tapes, playing them and going \\"well?\\" to an empty room. \\"Alright then, it's in the can!\\" This truly sounds as if nobody else gave any effort or input, and thus comes across sounding like a bunch of demos or outtakes from \\"Parklife\\" and \\"Blur\\", drum machine and all. What happened to Dave Rowntree? Out for a smoke?<br />You can tell that all the basics are there, from the strong opener of \\"Ambulance\\" to the oh-so familiar sounding \\"Crazy Beat\\", or the typical Albarn ballad styling of \\"Good Song\\". However the sound is more than stripped, it has an almost vacuous feeling. The band feels more than half empty with the absence of Graham Coxon, and it seems the rest have no say in the matter. Having heard \\"Gorillaz\\" I am at a bit of a loss, this is to me what I would have expected several years ago as a solo effort.<br />I think that Mr. Albarn should lay Blur to rest, and pursue the new musical and experimental directions I think he is now more comfortable with. As far as Blur, to the newcomers I'd recommend everything else except Leisure. To the die-hard fan, there are a few diamonds in the rough but nothing more.
B00008S2VG|2.0|For the most part I can't stand this disc.  The production is choppy to the point of sounding &quot;junky&quot;, the guitar playing sounds like noodling and the rapping is sophmoric.  Madonna needs to: #1 find a therapist to work out her &quot;issues&quot; and #2 find a new producer to give her a better sound.  People that like this, like it because it's Madonna...not because it's actually any good.  She's a great artist that should put out a better piece of work.  Definitely a disc you will pull out in 5 years and think &quot;what the......&quot;!  Sounds like a RUSH job to me and she should re-think her direction.
B000021XS0|3.0|When this album concentrates on the band's strengths, it is genuinely awesome to listen to. To my mind, this means when<BR>they really let rip on the instrumental front and when James Labrie gives it some oomph on the vocals. When they do this<BR>(Overture 1928, Fatal Tragedy, etc) then I love them. When they start writing ballads that sound like something from an<BR>Yngwie Malmsteen album then I don't like them at all. These guys CAN write ballads (Surrounded, Another Day, Wait for <BR>Sleep) but the ballads on this album are really rather weak and detract from the album. For this reason alone, I <BR>don't feel that this album should be mentioned alongside Operation Mindcrime(which was not only more coherent as a <BR>story, but the songs all served to further the story). If you want to hear DT successfully marrying technical <BR>brilliance with musical sensibility, listen to Images &amp; Words and Awake, both of which are 5-star albums <BR>all the way. At some point they will start realising the importance of accessibility as well as musicianship -and<BR>then you can start speaking about them in the same breath as Rush - but not until then.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago the film has been in years of planning and it was worth the wait , The whole cast were made for there roles all perfect every thing of the stage show is so perfectly adapted and it is really one of the best musical movies I have ever seen. In one word : Amazing
630460291X|5.0|This has to be the best Robin Hood movie ever made. Everything about it is awesome! It has everything to make the movie interesting and moving along. I've heard people make fun of Kevin Costner's accent but hey, nobody's perfect. Besides that doesn't even have an affect on the movie. The charaters are great and well performed. Everyone did a very convincing job on their roles. I really liked Marion, because she not only portrayed a damsel in distress but she also was a very strong willed woman who didn't scare too easily. I loved Azeem, I don't think the movie would have been the same without him. Morgan Freeman is just great in whatever movie he acts in and of course this is no exception. I forgot to mention, Christian Slater has a part in this movie that itself is a good reason to watch the movie. One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Will Scarlett (Christian Slater) is sent to [do away with] Robin and then he tells Robin why he hates him so much. I at least thought that was a very impacting part in the movie not only for the viewer but also for Robin.<br />Compared to the movies that are coming out now with the same rating I would say the sexual content in this movie is minor. If anything, the violence is a little extreme, lots of blood and arrows going through people's heads so parents should watch this movie before they allow thier kids to watch it. I remember the first time I watched this movie I was in seventh grade and we watched it during history class. Nobody fast forwarded through any of the movie so I guess it depends on how strict parents are on letting their kids watch violent movies. I've loved this movie ever since the first time I watched it and now own the dvd which is just as good. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is like me and like watching movies that are full of action and adventure. Oh and of course good looking talented actors!

B00008LDPU|5.0|I've seen a good chunk of this on the web and other places, and all I can say is WOW.<br />What is the Animatrix? In a nutshell, it is a collection of short Matrix stories that are animated. And the cool thing about it is that they're all mostly animated in different ways. (A few are done in anime, another in full CG, some just plain old animation, and others a mix of 2 or a mix of three of the above.)<br />The DVD will have nine (9) episodes to watch. Here's a quick overview of the ones I know a lot about and/or have seen:<br />1) THE SECOND RENNAISANCE, PARTS 1 and 2: This is a 2-parter that fills is all of the backstory that happened before the first Matrix film. It chronciles how the machines were made, how they took control, the war between the humans and the machines, and the creation of the Matrix. (Made in plain animation)<BR>2) PROGRAM: Most of this one is fashioned and made like an Akira Kurosawa film. It's basically a duel between two samuari-like warriors in a matrix program where the setting is ancient Japan. (Made in anime)<BR>3) WORLD RECORD: This one is basically about an extremely fast runner that can \\"run out of the Matrix and in to the real world\\" just because of pure strength/speed. <BR>4) DETECTIVE STORY: This story, animated in black and white, fills in the critical backstory of the Trinity character from the movies. Includes voice acting by actress Carrie-Anne Moss.<BR>5) FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS: Basically, this is a 9-minute completely CG animated story that serves as a prequel to \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" and \\"Enter the Matrix (GAME).\\" It begins as a blindfold sword duel and then escalates in to a ship chase with sentinels. This one has great action and great plotting, as well as convincing animation (Think \\"Final Fantasy,\\" except 10 times more realistic.) I saw this one in the theatre. WOW!!!<br />There are a few more, entitled KID'S STORY, MATRICULATED, and BEYOND. <br />JUDGING FROM THE TRAILER, MATRICULATED is an extremely wierd episode with a mix of CG animation and regular animation. <br />BEYOND follows a group of kids in to a \\"haunted\\" house. Agents find them and capture them because of they're too close to finding out something secret.<br />KID'S STORY is about a boy running from agents. (That's all I could gather from the trailer.)<br />For more information, watch the trailer on the web. Thanks for reading!
B00004TH7Z|2.0|Although that title is appropriate more to In Flames' ne album, it still a goog summarizer of what this particular album has to offer. <BR>A that would be - nothing. Just an old memory, a shadow of what was used to be one of the best, if not the best bands ever created by mankind - the difiners of heavy metal as an actual genre.  <BR>They indeed changed the style: simlified melodies that gives you the feeling that this comeback was just ment you to spend your money. Nothing left from their previous charm. <BR>And it just doesn't sound the same without Dickinson.<BR>It just doesn't worth the money.
B00005M91K|5.0|After watching this reaffirming film for the 5th. time...I've decided that if I am blessed to know the time and place of my death...I want to be watching \\"Baraka\\" as I leave this world. Never have I watched a more powerful and inspirational film. It speaks volumes about our world and ourselves and sums it all up in an incredible journey of emotions and soaring insight. To watch the faithful during prayer at Mecca..or bathing in the Ganges..or a holy aesthetic deep in meditation, brought surprising tears to my eyes. And keep an eye out for the oilfields of Kuwait...and the thunderous boom of drums and bagpipes; an incredible composition. Take this film home; leave the cell phones, the car insurance, the latest fashions and the nightly news by the wayside and sink into celebration.
0316666343|1.0|This is just a mediocre crime novel masquerading as high literature. If you like this genre, go for established crime writers - at least they write well researched books with interesting plots. The prose is patronizing, the characters are shallow, the big bang of the beginning is an inaudible invisible whimper by page 20. The lack of research may not be obvious to an American reader, but as an Indian let me assure you that no Indian can have a name like Ray Singh (they are both last names) or Ruana Singh. I cannot believe I wasted my time reading this through to the end...with all the hype about it I felt I had to!
B00005JLSE|5.0|I totally adore this movie from its fantastic fantasy musical world to its thrilling take on the american justice system a true movie musical masterpeice whoever says it is bad does not know fine film.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I was surprised at how great this album truly is. How could you expect Metallica to mix with a symphony? Truth is, it is either my favorite or second favorite album. The first two songs are mostly just the symphony, and are pretty good, but it gets better from there. The San Francisco symphony does a great job of highlighting Metallica. Before this album, I thought Metallica was pretty good, but after listening to it I went out and got the other albums that I didnt have. If there is one bad thing about this album, it would have to be Enter Sandman. It is one of my favorite songs, and I feel like S&amp;M made it worse. Overall though, this is a great CD.
B00004W221|5.0|Every time I watch this movie I cry because it reminds me of all the reasons why I love my alma mater.  The scenerey in this film is amazing and truly portrays just how heavenly my beloved campus truly is.  I LOVE NOTRE DAME!

B00006F7S4|5.0|This bluesy, folksy CD probably isn't what Beck fans brought up on \\"Loser\\" and \\"Where It's At\\" were expecting, but it's an amazingly mature and personal work that shows Beck's true talent. He doesn't need drum machines and dubs to create moving tunes. This mostly-unplugged album is full of embracing hooks and satisfying choruses, and holds up to repeated listening. It's Beck at his very best.
B00006C79E|4.0|Great pop CD, love the electronic beats and Sarah cracknell's voice but......whyyyyyyyyy? Why did they had to add that track called &quot;Soft like Me?&quot; It is a terrible and corny hip hop song that is barely listenable. For this I must take a star off. The rest of the music however is excellent.
B000068PQ0|5.0|If you don't like the Flaming Lips, you don't like music. Yoshimi's got it all, from airy, freewheeling rock to soul searching ballads. Not quite as solid as the Soft Bulliten, but it's still better than 99.99% of what's out there.
0060934913|4.0|at one point everyone i know in the restaurant business either had read or was reading this page-turner. several women found it understandably sexist in spots, but no one argued that 'kitchen confidential' wasn't on target. there are times when you have to remind yourself you're reading a taken-from-life narrative, not fiction. if you want to know what life at the back of the house is like, kick back and dig into a delicious read.
B00000JXVK|5.0|That's what I was thinking as I watched this movie.  Sure, the music is corny, but the footage is fantastic!  It had me itching to get my bikes out of the garage.  The movie awakens that urge to compete!  A really superb film-if you love motorcycles, then you'll love this!  (Just don't watch it when you can't ride, I did and had spring fever big time from it!)
0688170528|5.0|Jodi Picoult at age 35 has written 8 novels. Her books are mostly about love, family and relationships that she based on her own life.  She graduated from Princeton and got her masters degree at Harvard.  She mostly learned how to write at Princeton when she took creative writing with Mary Morris. <br />The Pact was one of the best books I have ever read. It's a book that keeps you reading, once you start you cant put it down.  Emily and Chris were friends ever since they were born; it later developed into a relationship. Emily was dealing with some issues that Chris never knew about. She felt that the only way out was suicide. Leaving Chris behind caused him to be charged with her murder. I also liked the set up of the book, the flashbacks in the particular. It explained a lot of the things that the readers would of missed out on if they weren't there. Once I got into the book I had a really hard time putting it down.  Hearing about Chris's time in jail was interesting because I had never imaged what people in jail feel like and it gave me a small glimpse of what it may be like. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes love stories.
B00008BXJG|5.0|\\"Highway To Hell\\" is a great rock & roll album. It has a famous 1-2-3-4 punch (\\"Highway To Hell\\", \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\", \\"Walk All Over You\\", \\"Touch Too Much\\"), not to mention the title song from their first live album \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\", as well as the blues classic \\"Night Prowler\\". The tiresome argument - as to whether this is the best AC/DC album, or 1980's \\"Back In Black\\" with Brian Johnson - is moot. They are BOTH classic and they sit on the same high pedestal. You can't say that Bon Scott is better or worse than Brian Johnson... they're simply different in their own right. It's like saying Sammy Hagar was better with Van Halen than David Lee Roth. Sure it's hard to replace an original, but the successors can grow to be classic rock Gods as well. Such is the case here with AC/DC. This delux digipak has fantastic remastered digital sound along with a 16-page booklet complete with original album artwork and various assorted photos (dig the picture of Angus standing in front of the band throwing the can full of paint). \\"Highway To Hell\\" is full of catchy hooks and driving intense songs for serious head bangers. Bon Scott's last album is a timeless piece of music that still sounds incredible today.
B00008S2VG|4.0|American Life - Not the best song, but nonetheless \\"catchy\\".  It caught the publics attention to make them go out and buy the new album, racking up enough sales to debut at #1 on Billboard's album chart.  Whether people say that she is playing on her own words or what not....  It may not sound sincere to us as the public , \\"because we CAN'T relate\\" to her life.  We have just been loyal throughout it's growth.  So who are we to say what she is saying is right or wrong, but if you listen to the words in all the songs you will definitely find some peace within yourself.  And also become a fan of the album.<br />The next single to be released is \\"Hollywood\\" if you have been there you can relate.  If you haven't enjoy the catchy tune and it's pop colorfulness.  It is a good song, and much more reasonable for the charts than \\"American Life\\" was.  Maybe people will get tired of the same Eminem and 50 cent crap that is overplayed and want to escape.  But if they don't Madonna has her following, and she is guaranteed multiplatinum success on every effort.<br />But the good thing is, this album is worthy of praise.  It is not like any other, and is definitely personal.  Maybe listeners should try finding something in themselves after listening instead of trying to live the facade of the hip hop life that is all self created and just a waste of energy.  The music is sometimes good, but come on already.  You can always leave the ghetto, unless you are paralyzed....STOP PLAYING VICTIM<br />Madonna YOU RULE
B000069HK2|1.0|okay:<br />1)  Bert McCraken.  What a name.  The poor guy.  He vomits on stage.  That's soooooooooo cool.<br />2)  Mr. McCraken used to date Kelly Osbourne, until she was stolen away by Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory.  He couldn't even keep the ugliest/stupidest girl in TV Land from running off to a pop-punk goofball.<br />3)  Guess what, &quot;emo&quot; kids...  The Used don't write their own music.  They are just as prefabricated as a boyband.<br />4)  The band Glassjaw did this about 3 years ago, and did it about 1000 times better.<br />5)  The Used are NOT a hardcore band.  They are a phase that lots of 14 year old kids will go through before they are ready to handle music with any real substance.  When you decide you are ready, go pick up a Planes Mistaken for Stars or Breaking Pangaea record.<br />6)  If the Used are a part of Rock's &quot;comeback,&quot; I hope Rock crawls back into the hole that it was supposedly hiding.
B00004VXF2|5.0|I had spent many years hearing about this album but when I finally got a chance to actually hear it, it was like I died and went to heaven. The sheer insane beauty of this album is absoultely breathtaking. I was completely blown away by its sheer artistry and classically-influenced melodies. The dramatic themes and intense strokes of genius are not to be missed. This is an album which one will want to play over and over again. Trust me, anyone who hears this one will not want to put it down. Forget all the other stuff that Lou Reed has done. THIS is the one to buy if you want to hear just how much of an artistic and creative genius he really is. If I could give this album six stars or even ten stars, I surely would. Highly recommended and worth every penny.
B00008NG5V|4.0|One would be hard pressed to find Jack Johnson interviewed in the pages of a music magazine going &quot;on and on&quot; about his music being innovative and ground breaking.  He knows it's not and, for the most part, his biggest fans know it's not.  The thing about Jack is he's good at what he does.  He's a passionate singer with a great range, a competent guitar player, and a gifted lyricist.  He keeps his melodies clear and simple which allows him to flex the emotions of his voice and allows the listener to explore the depth and weight of his lyrics.  Johnson serves as a model for what singer songwriters should be. Simply,  &quot;On and On&quot;  is a fantastic album. It's much more cohesive than &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; (which, to me, sounded like a collection of singles)and Johnson has finally become comfortable with his sound and mood.  Not every track on the album is brilliant, but there's also no throw-away material either.  The two songs that frame this album are &quot;Gone&quot; and &quot;On and On.&quot;  They both reveal Johnson's stoic acceptance of life's complications. Like every great artist, he asks his listener to sit back and ask him/herself what this all means.  That's what I like about Jack, his songs don't inspire me to change the world, they inspire me to change myself.
B0000026T4|5.0|This album of 1989, \\"TRASH\\" is ALICE COOPER'S GREATEST ALBUM EVER! I'm a HUGE Alice Cooper fan and I literally can't stop listening to this album. The album itself is addicting! Alice Cooper put his greatest efforts into this album. Together with hit song-writer Desmond Child (Aerosmith, KISS), the two wrote outstanding tunes and smashing hits. Alice also included several guest musicians to appear on the album to make it even more better. The special guests were: Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton and Joey Kramer of Aerosmith and Bon Jovi.<br />The opening track, \\"Poison\\" is one Alice's greatest hits ever. It opens with an evil guitar squeel and then Alice starts singing the opening lines, \\"Your cruel device. Your blood like ice. One look could kill my pain, your thrill,\\" in a low evil demon-like voice. The song is ADDICTING! It has an outstanding chorus line and excellent guitar riffs. The next track, \\"Spark In The Dark\\" is another excellent piece. It has a good riff and great lyrics. The chorus is very catchy and a is great Alice tune.<br />The next track, \\"House of Fire\\" is like an addition to \\"Poison.\\" Joe Perry did the lead guitar and background vocals on this tune. It's an excellently written song by Alice. The second chorus line goes like, \\"Building a house of fire, baby. Buildin'it with our love. We are building a house of fire every time we touch. We are building this house together, baby. Standing on solid ground. We are building a house of fire that you can't tear down.\\" Another addition to Alice Cooper's outstanding ballads is \\"Only My Heart Talkin'.\\" Alice and Steven Tyler did the vocals together on this MASTERPIECE! Of course we all know Steven is a great singer, especially for ballads. So now we know why Alice chose Steven to sing it with him. The song itself is so UNIFIED and EXTREMELY powerful. It's the perfect love song for any couple.<br />Another catchy tune is \\"This Maniac's In Love With You.\\" It's a solid tune with a somewhat catchy chorus. Alice did pretty well on writting this tune. The title track, \\"Trash\\" is a really good heavy metal hit. Alice had Tom Hamilton do the bass lines and Joey Kramer do the drum beats. Joey did an excellent job on the drum tracks. Alice sings this song is a really trashy voice which fits the song title perfectly.<br />An addition to the first ballad on the album, \\"Hell Is Living Without You\\" is another ballad classic of Alice. part of the chorus line goes like, \\"Hell is living without your love. Ain't nothing without your touch me. Heaven would be like hell, is living without you.\\" It an excellent tune. The last track \\"I'm Your Gun\\" is an awsome heavy metal tune with VERY LOUD guitar solos an drum beats. Part of the chorus line goes like, \\"Pull my trigger, I get bigger. Then I'm lots of fun. I'm your gun. I'm your gun, gun, gun.\\" It's a great way to end the album.<br />The album all-together turned out to be a MASTERPIECE which proved that Alice Cooper conquered Heavy Metal in the 1980's. Alice and Desmond Child did an excellent job writting the songs together. The guest stars of Aerosmith and Bon Jovi really did an EXCELLENT job with Alice helping the album come alive. This is one of Alice Cooper's GREATEST albums of all-time! Buy this album and you'll find out why Alice Cooper is the king of Heavy Metal.. Alice did pretty well on writting this tune.

0441003257|5.0|Beware! This book will have you laughing so hard, you will, on many occasions, be utterly incapable of either speech or sight. I have read this gem at least six or seven times, and it has formed the basis of my attatchment to both Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, both of whom are now favorite authors of mine. I have had to buy the book numerous times, as it has been passed on and on and on among friends and strangers. I too have read passages from the book to complete strangers, often as explination for paroxyms of laughter. I have never had a one not laugh along with me. In typical Pratchett fashion, footnotes are plentiful and hilarious. Read, enjoy, and pass it along. The world could use more laughter.
0671027344|4.0|Charlie does not anticipate having a good year as a high school freshman:  his best friend killed himself when he was in 8th grade, and he and his other friends have grown apart.  In order to get him through this \\"happy and sad\\" period, he writes frequent letters to an unidentified person whom he believes will neither pass judgment on him nor try to help him.  This rather unlikely device allows the reader of Chbosky's first novel access to his character's intimate thoughts in much the same way a journal would.  <BR> Charlie has the good luck to have an English teacher who sees his potential right away, and starts giving Charlie, one at a time, nearly every book from the classic high school reading list, including:  A Separate Peace, The Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird, and This Side of Paradise.  He also gains the friendship of high school seniors Patrick and Sam, a brother and sister hipster pair who bring Charlie into their circle of friends while drawing him out from his passive state.   Charlie is just happy to be part of their group, but by the end of the novel, his friends want him to be more active in his own life:  less like a sponge and more like a filter, in the words of his teacher.<BR> Although often compared to Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye, Charlie is a much sweeter character, though no less intelligent.  While Holden rails against the goddamned phonies in the world, Charlie doesn't pass judgment, but rather admits that there are a lot of things he just doesn't understand.  Indeed, Charlie occasionally reveals himself as innocent beyond his years<BR> A wide range of issues emerge in Perks, including date rape, teen pregnancy, homosexuality, racism, sexism, unrequited love, molestation, and drug and alcohol abuse, but to his credit Chbosky incorporates these into the lives of Charlie and his friends and family so skillfully that they seem like normal teen issues rather than fodder for an overwrought problem novel.  Charlie's letters from adolescence will draw readers into his closely examined life.  A darker novel on the effects of childhood molestation on a teen would be America by E.R. Frank (Atheneum, 2002).
B00005KB9T|4.0|Love that reggae beat man by the late Bob Marley.  The vocals are quite soothing and the guitar, keyboards, and percussion just completes a pleasing picture.<br />Songwise some tunes stand out more than others.  Suprisingly the first of the two bonus tracks, High Tide Low Tide wins my vote as the CD's best song.  A very well defined hook around the chorus combined with a very pleasing keyboard passage just captures my soul.  Kinky Reggae, Stop That Train, Concrete Jungle, and Rock It Baby are other stand out tracks.  Stir It Up has some nice effects as well even though it can drag a bit towards the end.<br />Whether you need to uplift your spirits or need some exotice party music, Catch A Fire is certainly appropriate for both occasions.  So just dig the good reggae sounds mon.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I paid under ten bucks at a mass chain and I'm glad I didn't pay the usual 16 or 17 dollars CD's usually fetch now as this is Madonna's weakest CD in a long while.  Ray of Light was a high point for me and still sends me to the dance floor when I hear it.  I don't really understand how this has gotten such good reviews on here except realizing that seldom do people really &quot;review&quot; anything but mainly use this as a forum to flame in or gush over their favorite star. <br />I really looked forward to this release when I overheard someone at a party wanting to go back to the record store and demand his money back.  Okay, it's not THAT bad, but this is Madonna and while some may dismiss her -- those of us who are fans have been happy the way she has constantly raised her game (movies notwithstanding.)<br />I'm not going to pick every song apart, but there is (as others have written) more than a passing similarity to Music but without the original feel that that one had.  Not really all that danceable and the only single I can foresee (American Life) is a really bitter and negative slam on this country from what I can interpret -- especially Los Angeles and New York women.  Again, just gleaning what I can but it ain't a rosy american life, ya'll.<br />Skip this CD, pick up Ray of Light if you don't have it, and wait calmly for her to find a new producer or go back to William Orbit.
B00000255X|2.0|Sorry, I just do not care for this Desire CD by Bob Dylan.  Whereas I have learned to aprpeciate some of his classic works and his recent gem Love and Theft, this one just leaves me cold.<br />Many of these songs have a way too similar sound.  Scarlet Rivera's violin is way too front and center in the mix throughout nearly every moment of the nine songs.  On a few songs the violin is  OK but after a while I would rather have a change of instrumental definition. Also Emylou Harris's vocals are overused.  She sings in the same style on each cut that she appears. More of an emphasis on the guitars or pianos would hae been appreciated.  Romance In Durango alters the sound slightly with the presence of accordions.  However melody wise, its nothing special.<br />Weak melodies also hamper such long winded tunes as Joey, Isis, and Black Diamond Bay.  Gosh, that Joey number is over eleven minutes long and drags at such a snail like pace.<br />One highlight of this CD is the last tune Sara.  I very beautiful song written about Dylan's ex-wife.  The melody is indeed very focused.  Mozambique is also a charming tune that clocks in at a reasonable three minutes.  Hurricane is fairly captivating in spite of its eight and half minute length.<br />In spite of a few good moments, Desire falls a bit short of several of Bob Dylan's better CD's.  Seek out Highway 61, Nashville Skyline, and Blonde On Blonde instead.
B00008VGL6|4.0|While Martin Gore's first solo release was very short and rather demo-like in sound quality, &quot;Counterfeit2&quot; is a full fledged album. I haven't heard of either of the two producers listed on the album but, they do a great job. The mood is very much like Depeche Mode's last album, Exciter. After the last ten years of Martin favoring his guitar over his synths, the lack of guitars is quite a surprise. Though Martin didn't write these songs he has chosen songs that flow together very well. This isn't your typical remake album; a fan can sit and listen to this cd and hear how these songs influenced Martin Gore and, for that reason I love them, too.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Peter Parker is a nerd barely accepted by the in crowd of his school, when he's bitten by a radioactive spider during a class trip.  Though he begins noticing changes immediately (whoa - I thought I was past that phase!!), he's too infatuated with the lovely Mary-Jane \\"MJ\\" Watson (Kirsten Dunst) to pay attention for long.  Soon he's planning on capitalizing on his new found post-puberty.  As Spider-fans know, Peter pays for his capitalist intentions, and learns the hard way how his new power brings new responsibilities.  Meanwhile, Norm Osborn, the embattled head of a high-tech defense contractor, goes slightly loony when subjecting himself to a chemical process designed to turn men into perfect killing machines.  Donning a mask and acquiring a split personality and an arsenal of high-tech, Osborn becomes the evil \\"Green Goblin\\".  As Peter remakes Spiderman into a crime-fighting hero, Osborn's Goblin eliminates his business rivals.  While not in disguise, Osborn is the somewhat off-center CEO and kind-hearted father of Peter's best friend - which fatefully brings him close enough to learn Parker's deepest secrets.  The movie works up to a climactic battle near Roosevelt Island where Peter must battle until their masks are stripped away.<br />Though I haven't bought an issue of \\"Spiderman\\" this century, this fast-moving flick brought the whole experience back.  Though a lot of \\"Spiderman\\" draws on the comic series (and also turns up the fun for Sam Raimi fans), and much of the rest is generic comic book-turned big flashy movie fodder (hero must learn that much power brings loads of responsibility; the bad guy must destroy the hero, but not before trying to turn him to the dark side in the standard \\"we've got a lot more in common than you think\\" spiel) there's more than enough fun left over for the rest of us.  Sam Raimi keeps the action pumping, while never losing sight of his main characters.  The script surrounds Parker with characters that figured heavily in Parker's comic-art life - and even if you won't recognize Betty Brant or Robbie Robertson's characters, or think that \\"Flash\\" Thompson is just a school bully tossed in for Peter to get the better of, you at least get the sense that Raimi has something in mind for them.  Not to nit-pick, but it's also that unending sense of imminent surprise that grounds this flick - especially in the second half.  It's a problem because, Raimi touches aside (Bruce Campbell in a small but pivotal cameo; Raimi's trademark power-zoom camera-work; that Oldsmobile from \\"Evil Dead\\" and \\"Army of Darkness\\") the story is more faithful to the superhero formula than the original comic was.  Willem Dafoe is good as Osborn, but the character is not - once he's split, he's less than the sum of two parts (if Goblin is his own persona, what's the point of having him give pointers to Osborn?).  Though the original Spiderman relied on some detective smarts, the script here doesn't even attempt to put Parker on Osborn's trail (you'd think he would have seen a connection between Goblin and his murder of Osborn's business rivals).  But, like I said, there's more than enough fun here even for those who never picked up a copy of \\"The Amazing Spiderman\\".  This is obviously the same movie Raimi wanted to make about a decade ago, when he helmed \\"Darkman\\" (the last few minutes of each film are essentially the same) and it was well worth the wait.
B00008LDPU|4.0|from an anime fan, overall a solid 4 stars out of 5. loved the animation.  my real only complaint is that they're short stories and not full features. for some of the better ones, i would have liked them to be longer.  here's my review of each part:<br />1. last flight of the osiris - this is from the makers of the final fantasy.  i didn't like FF but this had a really good story start to finish. also the animation is even more realistic than FF down to the pore.  not really pure anime but does have show its influence.<BR>2. the second renaissance - i loved this animation. the story was very compelling. first part was great, second part seemed more like a documentary.<BR>3. program - from the acclaimed artist of ninja scroll, i found the story interesting but the art seemed like a rush job. somewhat of a sour spot in ths set.<BR>4. world record - i found this one kinda boring.  didn't find anything compelling about the character or story.  the art was nice tho'.<BR>5. kids story - this was my favorite of the bunch in terms of story. the art direction was really good and a very riveting story.<BR>6. Detective Story - the pace and dialog seemed kinda off. nice mood and i like how trinity plays a role but an overall letdown.<BR>7. Beyond - this is 21st century anime art direction at its best and also one of my favorites. a nice cute little ghost story.<BR>8. Matriculate - by peter cheung of aeon flux, the art is eye candy. peter has come a long way. i really like the concept of this piece where humans try to manipulate the thoughts of robots and question the ethics of slavery.

B00005JKZV|5.0|The Lord of the Rings trilogy ranks up there with my all-time favorite books.  I have read it many times.  I have been waiting for a movie version since before computerized graphics were a reality, but have always understood the impossibility of reproducing the literature faithfully on screen.  Certain liberties were bound to be taken.  I am often disappointed with a director's chosen interpretation, but not so with The Two Towers, arguably the most difficult of the three books to film.  the story line is there, both continuing the thread from the first and existing on its own.  Excellent!
B00005AQGH|5.0|This haunting album is full of surprises. Released just two months after Tupac Shakur's death, this certainly gave a few fans a shock and perhaps a chill at times, a CD full of questionable statements and double meanings. This was the last album the slain rapper had his hands on, and in my opinion, his last great release since. <br />Recorded under the alias, Makaveli, The 7 Day Theory shows a different side to Tupac, darker, more mysterious then his laid back, partying \\"thuggin\\" attitude he had on All Eyez On Me, released in the February of 1996. The Intro for a start has some issues that raise many questions, with an unnamed news reporter targeting and mocking \\"ringleader\\" Nas, Jay-Z and the Notorious B.I.G. who apparently are conspiring to assassinate Tupac and Death Row Records. <br />Relationships have also turned tables on this LP as there is no feature of Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dogg Pound members Daz Dillinger and Kurupt or any of the Death Row Records crew. Most featured guests are Tupac's now defunct backing group, the Outlawz, who appear on the chilling \\"Hail Mary\\". They add something extra to the album providing a different lyrical sound, with clever rhymes and quick words. On top of the great production comes the soft whispers of R & B sounding Badass. The album tends to hit out at many people, not just the obvious, as it is an album full of anger and impatience, an implication of how restless the man Tupac Shakur really was.<br />The 7 Day Theory is not just about violence, it does get political at times, on such songs as \\"White Man'z World\\" and \\"Hold Ya Head\\". Production is at the hands of mostly unknown producers as there is no sign of Dr Dre (who had left Death Row earlier that year) who is also dissed in the party-type track \\"Toss It Up\\". The only indication of an executive producer on this album is \\"Simon\\". Strange.<br />The 7 Day Theory is a mix between political issues, emotional feelings of anger and hate, and Tupac's own restless attitude, which hewas. The album shows a very different side to Tupac, that it was not all about \\"thug life\\" and partying (much concentrated on All Eyez On Me). This album gave you an insight of what Tupac was trying to get across, but was cut down too soon at the age of 25.<br />One of 1996's finest releases.
B000002UB3|5.0|As always with the Beatles, Abbey Road is an ingenious work of art. The medleys (Sun King-Mean Mr. Mustard-Polythene Pam-She Came In Through The Bathroom Window and Golden Slumbers-Carry That Weight-The End) are pure genius. ALL of these songs are enjoyable to listen to. <BR>Come Together- basically a nonsense song<BR>Something- an excellent love song courtesy of George <BR>Maxwell's Silver Hammer- an upbeat, lighthearted tune despite its murderous content <BR>Oh! Darling- must have hurt Paul's voice; 50's style<BR>Octopus's Garden- a lighthearted children's tune written by Ringo<BR>I Want You- a love song from John to Yoko; long and repetitive<BR>Here Comes The Sun- an optimistic song by George<BR>Because- excellent harmonies<BR>You Never Give Me Your Money- blend of three songs; all good<BR>Sun King- features a blend of words from many different languages<BR>Mean Mr. Mustard- a song of a troubled man<BR>Polythene Pam- upbeat with a clever topic<BR>She Came In Through The Bathroom Window- great tune; possibly about a break-in at Paul's house<BR>Golden Slumbers- a beautiful lullaby<BR>Carry That Weight- good tune of its own with a reprise of You Never Give Me Your Money's opening<BR>The End- Abbey Road was meant to be the Beatles final album and The End was to wrap up their career; great guitar with a philisophical ending<BR>Her Majesty- a light hearted 23 second ditty about courting the Queen.<BR>A hands down 5 star rating!!
B00008BXJF|5.0|Fripp and co. serve up a wizard's brew of jarring, muscular progressive rock the likes of which we haven't seen in far, far too long. Three of the tracks are already among my favorites from KC. \\"Level Five\\" picks you up and throws you through a brick effing wall. \\"Electrik\\" is radiant, jagged, crystaline. \\"Dangerous Curves\\" builds and builds with inexorable, driving determination. After the [bad] title (which is the worst thing about the album), and listening to the tepid \\"preview\\" EP (\\"Happy with etc\\"), I wasn't expecting this album to be as good as it turned out to be. Five star stuff... BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B00006AL1I|4.0|Very informative and interesting video with a great soundtrack. My only complaint is that I bought it for Dj Krush, seeing as how his name was on the front cover, only to find that he was in the video for about 15 seconds. No interview with him, either. I was dissapointed in the 'false advertising', but the movie was entertaining anyway.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This is a great cd. I bought this the first day it came out and I haven't stopped listing to it.  I like the way bash on George W. Bush.  Plus the cd comes with videos to play on your computer.  BUY IT!!!!
B00000J7S8|4.0|Diana Krall wants desperately to be Julie London and she almost makes it. She is a better singer and her sense of phrase is on the money, but she lacks electricity. Now if there's work to be done and you ned a little musical narcotic to smooth out the edges then this will do the job. You can visit with friends, cook, build computers and almost anything else while Ms Krall throbs in the background. It won't break your concentration or mood. Only on Popsicle Toes does Ms Krall thaw. This playful tune is the highlight of the disc. In it Ms Krall offers both delight and the hint of potential. What a pity that this CD didn't find a way to let Ms Krall swing.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Great movie which already has some world-famous quotes in it! \\"Where's ze money Lebowski\\", \\"Give us the money or we will cut off your Johnsson\\", \\"That's right man, nobody f.x with the Jesus\\". Great acting by Jeff Bridges and John Torturro. Had to see the movie several times to get all(?) the funny little details. Many fan-sites were erected over this movie!
B00006JDU9|1.0|I will not be explaining how tortuous it was to watch a movie that took my childhood dreams and destroyed them in 180+ minutes of eye-gouging atrocities.  But I will go out on a limb and say that George Lucas should be killed by his own creation, i.e. a life sized granite statue of Jar Jar crushing him to death.  <br />I will not sleep until the rating of this movie is reduced to one star, since \\"no stars\\" is not available.  Brothers of the True Force unite in my crusade!<br />I will be rating this movie with one star every chance I get.<br />On a more serious note, I wasn't kidding, George Lucas should be killed for this abomination.<br />My only regret is that it took so long for me to vent my anger to the world.<br />George, wherever you are, I hope you are reading this.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I was so carried away by the first half of the CD, I posted my last review - some of the songs are kind of weak, and dwell too much on religion.. taking away a star.  Again, if you like Madonna in her synth mode, this is a good CD
B00006IX44|5.0|This romantic CD is the best I have bought in a long time - every song is good!  It's mellow music for a perfect dinner party or drive home from work.
B000002TYX|5.0|This album is well-described as a lot of historical recordings of the early gestation of the Beatles, along with a lot of demos or alternate takes of songs from their first few albums and singles.  If you're a fan, it's great stuff to hear every once in awhile. I especially enjoyed the tracks that show them building &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;--you hear the almost off-the-cuff musicality of the four lads as they work out the harmonic structure of the song.<br />But all that's not enough to recommend the album highly.  The reason to get this album is the presence of five tracks at the end of Disk One, live tracks recorded in 1963 before an enthusiastic, but not hysterical audience.  This is the best, maybe the only, good documentation of the greatness of the Beatles live, before Beatlemania destroyed their ability to perform.  True, their early songs were recorded &quot;live&quot; in the studio, and we have the BBC stuff, so you can hear them playing together on other recordings, but this stuff is really special.  Fiery, tight, powerful, s--t-hot, it just leaves you wanting more.  You get &quot;I Saw Her Standing There,&quot; &quot;From Me to You,&quot; &quot;Money (That's What I Want),&quot; &quot;You've Really Got a Hold on Me,&quot; and &quot;Roll over Beethoven.&quot;  The audio is rich and clean.<br />Supposedly, according to the liner notes, there were 7 songs recorded for this session, which was done for a Swedish radio broadcast.  Where are the other two?  Overall, I'm surprised that this rare documentation of the Beatles doing what made them famous initially, performing as the very best straight-ahead rock and roll band of its day and maybe any day, hasn't been culled into an &quot;Early Live Beatles&quot; CD of its own.  And, are we certain that no other live recordings of this quality exist?
B00007BHOE|5.0|Hi, this DVD is well worth your time.  I strongly encorage that no one overly young watches it.  I have been a fan of Slipknot since their first CD came out.  I had tickets for one of their shows, but they bailed out.  Anyways, this is the best footage you can possibly get of a Slipknot show.  When I bought this DVD I was mad that the inside of my case was cracked (purchased at a local store, not online), the only thing that could make this DVD better is a case with a latch.  The footage of this band is great, the have over 30 cameras filming them, not to mention being able to choose a camera angle when you watch on the second disk.  The first disk is of their entire live london show, as well as watching them put on their costumes (beware Sid's butt crack).  The concert is about one and a half hours long and includes about 15 songs.  I like it that they perform their unreleased song \\"purity\\" live.  The second disk includes all of their music videos: Spit it Out, My Plague, Wait and Bleed, Wait and Bleed (Claymation), and the audio track of Purity.  This equals about half an hour.  The entire concert is staged perfecly and heres a secret for you: During \\"Spit it Out\\" Corey has everyone in the arena get on the floor and then jump up at the same time, it is very cool to watch.  Just trust me, buy this DVD.  You will love it.
B000002JS6|5.0|Without A doubt my all time favourite hard rock/metal album.<BR>AC/DC were becoming really popular with their album Higway To Hell but suddenly in early 1980 their lead singer Bon Cott died. They had to find a new singer and found Brian Johnson whose vocals were very similar if not better than Bon´s. They went recording and released in the summer Back In Blac. The cover was simple just black and dedicated it to Bon. Produced by Mutt Lange Back In Black is a brilliant album. <br />Everything about it is good. The playing, the vocals, lyrically musically amazing. Such good tracks on this and it is also very accesable for people who are not big fans of heavy metal. <br />To date. Back In Black has sold over 35 million copies and still sells well all over the world. It is also proclaimed by many as one of the greatest rock n roll album of all time. No arguing about that. 5/5.
0060512806|5.0|A funny and facinating adventure yarn featuring both WW-II cryptology and modern Internet adventure.  This is a long, but rewarding read.  Give it your time and attention, it's worth it.
B000002MFN|4.0|Erotica is a good album by Madonna. Released in late 1992 in the sex-book scandal and the entire controversy surrounding that. The album was a bit overlooked. Critics disliked it and many fans of her previous album had also mixed feelings about it. <br />Madonna was obviously trying something different and she decided to team up again with Shep Pettibone who helped recording Justify My Love and co-wrote and produced Vouge. <br />Lyrically Madonna does not expose anything and sometimes just creates something that rymes. There are two explicit tracks on this album. The controversial title track and Where Life Begins. Although Erotica is not lyrically fantastic it does not overshadow the music. The music is a mixture of dance beats and house music and obviously Madonna was intriqued by it. Most of the songs stand out and the album is enjoyable and dancable. <br />Erotica is still widely regarded as Madonna´s worst album and not just by critics but by fans also. Even many of Madonna´s friends an were not impressed and the album was not just diapointing in sales but many felt that artistically Madonna was not doing the right thing. Indeed she has been more focuses on what she was doing and I doubt that she was a whole lot in the studio while making it and let the producers do all the work. <br />I don´t know whether Madonna likes this album and I think that she was very disapointed about the reaction. The album is good and unlike any of her albums it has no filler but indeed was perhaps a wrong direction for her at the time and she should have not released it at the time of the Sex-Book because it has hardly anything in common with it.
B00005K3OT|4.0|A far-fetched story is grounded by superior acting and emotion in this charming film. Johnny Depp was surprisingly good in this type of role, and Juliette Binoche makes her big movie debut a great one. I wouldn't reccommend it to wrestling fans, but anyone who can appreciate a sentimental story with light, airy humor will enjoy it!
B000002HJA|4.0|I could almost cry. I feel the tears in my eyes. why? Kyuss are no more. Yes, yes you may mock, but one listen of this and you'll need your hanky aswell. As I said in my &quot;Sky Valley&quot; review, this band are essential if you class yourself as a rock fan. Featuring queens of the stone age's Josh Homme on guitar, Kyuss are 100% better than their new incarnation. Anyways, this album rocks. Where the band left off on &quot;Sky Valley&quot; they follow up, only to shock and surprise with new styles and tricks. The old blistering Kyuss are in full effect (The sonic &quot;Hurricaine&quot; will knock you off your chair) this album sees the band experimenting with new rhythms and styles, such as funk (the dance-a-licious &quot;one inch man&quot;) and almost gypsy-folk (the quite brilliant, and stand out track &quot;El Rodeo&quot;.) However do not fear, as the intense and bruising drop-C guitars still crop up on every corner. I'd give &quot;Sky Valley&quot; and &quot;Blues for the red sun&quot; five out of five, and this one four and a half out of five. The reason being that the bands disintergration and fustration was beggining to surface, but more importantly the vocal mix on the first three tracks could've been better.<BR>Overall, I'd say that this is yet another astounding album from the Velvet Underground of stoner. Why this band weren't absolutly massive is way, way beyond me. Get it. Now.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I loved this movie when I was seven years old. I still watch it all the time, and my children are going to love it, too. It's so charming! How can you pass up having this classic in your collection? Anyone can enjoy this movie- young kids or adults. One of the DVD collector's must-haves, for sure.
B000002WUD|5.0|I have been an Elvis fan since the age of 5. My first exposure to the King was during the Aloha Concert. Here we are almost 30 years later &amp; no one compares. My little brother gave me the Walk a Miles  in My Shoes collection a few years ago for Chistmas. I have MANY EP  collections &amp; individual CDs. For me, this is the one I would want to have on a deserted island. This Is Elvis! This is all you need to know.
B00008WG3U|5.0|These guys kick [butt] in their first full length attack at the current state of affairs in the land of bliss. Poignant and thought provoking, and yet this CD kicks [butt] even if you don't speak English. Highly recommended to anyone, especially W, although it may confuse him.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Being a huge fan of avante garde film and film noir, I really looked forward to seeing this movie. I was not disappointed, let me tell you! As everyone has said before me, it's a film that defies categorization or simple description. You'll find yourself thinking about this movie for at least a week after viewing it. It's about so many things - time travel, choices, the nature of the universe, reality . . . . it's just an amazing film.<br />The cast is superb, especially Jake Gyllenhall (sp?), who is now forever etched in my mind as Donnie Darko. He was so natural in this role, I completely forgot he was acting. He *was* Donnie Darko! Now I for sure can't see \\"The Good Girl\\" because I know I'll keep thinking, \\"Why is Donnie Darko going out with Jennifer Aniston?\\" (Plus I don't really like her anyway - but that's another story. ;-)<br />I thought Drew Barrymore did a great job as the teacher, and the initial classroom scene with her is really interesting - I wish I'd had teachers like her in high school! The reactions of all the characters were quite realistic too - there were no pat answers or \\"movie magic wands\\" to take away from the real, human drama taking place on the screen. <br />If you find this film confusing, WATCH IT AGAIN, THEN make up your mind whether you like it or not. Even if you love it the first time out (like I did), you will want to watch it again. Every time, you will see something you missed the last time. It's really an amazing film, and rates right next to \\"Fight Club\\" (specifically, Tyler's \\"Middle children of history\\" speech) for defining the angst and confusion of our generation. <br />One final note: You MUST rent the DVD, NOT the VHS. I'm not sure if it's true for all copies, but the VHS I rented was missing a pivotal scene (!) near the end. I would never have known except I was watching the VHS with a friend who'd seen it on DVD and she mentioned it. And believe me, the scene is essential to fully understanding the ending. <br />One ofmy top 5 favorite movies of all time. Don't miss it!!!
B000066NW0|3.0|So she dresses \\"punk\\" and doesn't care about things. Big deal. Dressing a certain way doesn't guarantee your album is punk.<BR>What the album is, though, is kinda catchy. I love the first 6 or 7 songs, with the exception of skater boi (can that track PLEASE be thrown in the trash?) I haven't listened to the end of the album as much, but it's not as interesting as the first half in my opinion. There's nothing punk about this CD. If you want punk, listen to Rancid or Social D, because you won't find it here. Not even pop punk. I call her a more guitarish, easy to swallow, young Alanis. (Not because she's from Canada, but because she reminds me of it in her singing.)
B00005JLEX|5.0|I don't know about you, but I'm only 18 years old, and I grew up watching this show.  As far as I'm concerened, there will never, EVER, be a show quite like Seinfeld.  The people at \\"The Simpsons\\" try, but Jerry is a genius.<br />Moreover, just take a second and do the math.  Lets see...9 seasons, that makes 9 DVD sets, and even taking the low side of DVD sets prices today, that's (multiply the 5, carry the 1, add the three...ah who knows!) THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY!!! Jerry can cha-ching all the way to the bank, and he doesn't even need to do anything.  Not releasing this DVD would not only disappoint fans, but any network executive who passes up that much money should be fired or shot.<br />Anyways, I may be young, but I know what I'm talking about; and I may be wrong, but I highly doubt it.  If you like Seinfeld, good for you, and if you don't, you should watch the show again, and again, and again, and again, until you understand the genius of the writing.<br />RELEASE THIS DVD OR THERE WILL BE A HOLE IN THE LIFE OF A BRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHO, WITHOUT THIS COLLECTION, CANNOT HAVE A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Having read the book when I was a child, it never occured to me that anyone could make a movie worthy of the book.  What Mr. Jackson and the cast and crew involved in the making of the trilogy have done is nothing short of miraculous.  I have seen The Fellowship countless times and I will continue to watch it.  Some have said that this is the greatest movie of all times.  I fully agree. But, I must also add that The Two Towers is equal to The Fellowship.  I cannot wait for the Reteurn of the King.  Once the three movies are out, then we can truly say that this is the greatest work of all times.  There is no miscasting in the series.  I have tried to visualize other actors in these roles, it has been futile.  The cast is perfect, the settings are perfect, the music is perfect, and what can you say about the special effects. I cannot believe that the esteem Academy did see fit to give the Oscar to this effort.  The series seriously outclasses the competition not only visually but in every other aspect.  As a lifelong fan of the literary wonder of The Lord of the Ring, I cannot be less than that for Mr. Jackson's epic motion picture rendering.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the weirdest movies that I have seen in a long time, but was most entertaining.  It really made you think about things in an entirely different light.  This movie can change your whole world if you let it.
B00007J5VN|5.0|This new DVD release of SWEET CHARITY is a welcome addition to any classic movie collection.  Shirley MacLaine stars as Charity Hope Valentine in the celebrated film version of the Broadway hit.<br />Charity (Shirley MacLaine) works at the Fan Dango Ballroom, a dingy dime-a-dance hall where the girls give a lot more away than dances.  Charity runs her heart like a hotel, and gives her love to one undeserving man after another.  Her two best friends Nickie and Helene (Chita Rivera and Paula Kelly) are the ones who help Charity when she is ultimately betrayed by each boyfriend who comes into her life.  Ever-hopeful (sometimes impossibly-so), Charity goes through life with wide eyes and wide dreams...<br />When Charity meets the mild-mannered Oscar Linquist (John McMartin re-creating his Broadway performance), she believes that she will finally be able to leave her sordid past and profession behind her.  But will Oscar be as understanding?<br />Shirley MacLaine colors Charity more vividly than Broadway's Gwen Verdon did (or was permitted to do).  MacLaine is especially affecting and heartbreaking in the final 15 minutes of the movie, and sings a plaintive &quot;Where Am I Going?&quot;.<br />Bob Fosse's first big Hollywood film, SWEET CHARITY was a big, if not huge, success when it was first released.  The choppy editing and artistic touches that audiences failed to appreciate then make much more sense now, following the success of MOULIN ROUGE.  The impressive supporting cast includes Ricardo Montalban, Sammy Davis Jr. and Stubby Kaye.<br />This beautiful new Special Edition DVD presents the complete 'Road-Show' version of the film including Overture and Intermission.  There are also many extras including the trailer, the original 'Making-of' featurette, a featurette where designer Edith Head takes us through her colorful costumes, and the alternate ending that was never used.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).
B00003OSU4|4.0|Bert Stern was a still photographer who got the opportunity to take a film crew to the 1959 Newport Jazz festival. With limited time and film, Stern and his crew set out not just to record a musical event, but to record a social experience. <br />For the most part, he succeeds, although there is more than enough footage of a boat race on Chesapeake bay that day to last me for the rest of my life. <br />The film cuts from performances to reactions of the crowd, as any concert film would. It's interesting to see the wide difference in clothing styles that appealed to people in 1959. Everything from men in suits to greasers in denim can be seen dancing and grooving along with the music. <br />People living nearby the festival can be seen partying on their roofs and dancing, booze in hand, to the music. People of every age are shown bopping along with whoever is on stage at the time.<br />Highlights: Anita O'Day's spot-on performance, in spite of the fact that she's well into her much-ballyhooed drug and booze habit (in a recent radio interview she said she couldn't remember doing this gig after even watching the film); Louis Armstrong, Jerry Mulligan, and the rather out-of-place, clearly there-for-the-kids but dressed to the nines and behaving himself, Chuck Berry. Older jazz guys have no idea what to make of Chuck, and one guy, in an attempt to \\"jazz up\\" Berry's \\"Sweet Little Sixteen,\\" starts playing some rather odd clarinet runs. Think \\"Sweet Little Bar Mitzvah.\\" <br />There's a nice bunch of extras on here, too, including an interview with Stern that expalins a lot about what was going on.<BR>If you like jazz, or documentaries, or just good music, this is a keeper.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is simply amazing.  I could care less if it's geared towards a younger audience, the wonderful world in this movie is too good to miss out on.
B000002B35|5.0|I recently saw the Pulse the live recording on video for the first time at my friend's house and it shocked me to see this absolutely awesome performance.  The music was great, the effects were cool, and the whole atmosphere of the crowd was very &quot;down with it&quot;. This was the reason I had to go out and buy this album...<br />There are many &quot;ups&quot; and few &quot;downs&quot; in this album.  The only few &quot;downs&quot; were that it was not nearly as exciting as the video where you could actually see David Gilmore and the rest of the band go at it with full strength, playing each solo on the mark and making the music sound great.  Another downside to this album was how it had basically all of &quot;Darkside of the Moon&quot; and less of &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.  Wish you were here is by far my favorite album by Pink Floyd and it would have been just great to see &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; along with the rest of the songs.  Also, another song that should have been put in there is a very underrated song... &quot;Is there anybody Out There&quot;.  Although the begining of this song is not the best: only saying &quot;IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE&quot;.. but the guitar solo at the end rips my brain.  It is astounding.<br />But in all, the album is very good and is worth the price it is.  So if you have some extra money on you and you want to listen to some quality live music, buy this album.. your life depends on it :)
020530902X|5.0|This book is a treasure.  In a very few pages the authors taught me more about composition than any writing class I've ever taken.  Its wisdom has improved everything from my technical writing to my business and personal emails.  I wish I had read this while in high school and in fact purchased copies for any relatives still in school.  This book's greatest teaching is in how to turn sentences of every-day construction into powerful &quot;writing&quot;.  It is a quick, unlabored read.  I am a slow reader, but completed reading it in just three nights.  The results of the author's techniques were immediatly evident.  Read any of my previous reviews if you need proof.
6305609705|5.0|I'm a hardcore Apocalypse Now fanatic, and this, the original version of the film, is what made me one, several years ago.  Reviewers like to debate endlessly over which version is better, this or the Redux.  Personally, I like both, but I find this original version to be more surreal, relentless, and, to quote another reviewer, more \\"dangerous.\\"  The fact is, Coppola used different shots and edits in the Redux, in some cases diluting the surreal impact of the original.  Plus the characters Kilgore and Kurtz come off more strongly in the original; sure, we get to see more humanity from Kilgore in the Redux, but his exit in the original is much more memorable, much better than the \\"tossing megaphone into the air\\" antics as shown in the Redux.  And Kurtz is a more powerful Evil One in the original version, not much more than a shadow.<br /><br />What gets me is that, in the press releases that came out with Redux, Coppola claimed that he no longer considered the 1979 version of Apocalypse to be \\"unusual.\\"  He felt that, today, it comes off as a rather ordinary film.  So he integrated an extra 50 minutes into the movie, to make it more unusual.  The thing is, the Redux is, if anything, MORE normal than the original.  After all, you get more character development, a romantic subplot, etc; all the things the unusual (and unique), original version lacked.  The very lack of these things is what gives the original such a mysterious, dangerous edge.  There is no levity in the original, no stealing of surfboards, no Playmates for the PBR crew.  Only the dark jungle, and the mission.<br /><br />If it's true that Coppola wanted to make the original version even more unusual, then I wonder why he chose to add the Plantation sequence and the Playboy Bunnies escapade.  Having seen the Work Print, I know that there is a wealth of material Coppola could've used.  Bizarre?  Unusual?  How about a scene in which Martin Sheen's Willard, trapped in a bamboo cage, writhes in pain as the montangnards (and Kurtz's American soldiers) dance and chant around him, as they sacrifice a pig?  Or how about Willard, still in the cage, being questioned by Kurtz, who tells Willard that he's as weak as his \\"colleagues in Washington?\\"  Or how about possibly the most bizarre scene of all: Dennis Hopper's Photojournalist being shotgunned to death by Scott Glenn's character Colby?<br /><br />Coppola could have used any or all of these scenes to make a truly \\"unusual\\" film, one that would successfully create a darker film.  If anything, the extra scenes in Redux lighten the film's mood.  Coppola could have even improved on the end of the movie.  That's one thing that's always bothered me about Apocalypse Now.  Willard's hired to murder Kurtz; when he finally does, all he has to do is just walk into Kurtz's temple, take out one guard, and then get to hacking at Kurtz.  It comes off as so easy, you wonder why the Army even bothered hiring Willard.  This problem is solved in the Work Print, which features Willard taking on a host of guards, including one grisly scene in which he spears an American guard who cowers behind a young, Vietnamese boy.  Now, if you ask me, that's more \\"unusual\\" than a bunch of French people arguing politics at the dinner table!  But unfortunately, Coppola has chosen not to use these scenes, in either official version of the film.<br /><br />I don't intend to mislead, though.  I think the Redux is fine, a five-star movie.  It expands on the broader themes of Apocalypse Now, but at the same time lessens the impact of the movie itself.  After having watched the Redux a few times, I popped the original in for the first time in a few years.  I was amazed at how the film seemed so different than the Redux, so much more psychedelic and surreal.

1577311523|3.0|Aloha,I apologize for not getting this in one post!    Eckhart states essentially that the mind is always causing problems, is always tricking you, and that the heart and body are always telling you the truth. This is a very odd distinction to make given that the mind, heart and body are one entity. And in that oneness, each element has its share of truth and falseness. It's unbalanced to soley focus on the mind as the villian.    Also, Tolle states that in the years to come many women are going to experience full enlightenment during their menstration period. That whole section really left me scratching my head. In essence, if you follow his reasoning, gay women who are having their period have the greatest potential for enlightenment.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with being a gay women having their period. Yet Tolle's reasoning about how this relates to one's potential for spiritual advancement is nothing short of very, very, very bizarre.       The cover of the book contains a quote of endorsement by Deepak Chopra, one of the most prominent and blatant charlatans of the past century. Chopra passes himself off as a spiritual teacher, when in truth he is simply an editor of eastern esoteric texts. He reads them, and then reduces it down to a reader's digest version for a western audience. There's no great insight of his own.  On top of that, Chopra then has turned these cliff notes of eastern mysticism into a multi-million dollar greedy business which seeks to take advantage of the spiritual vacumn found in the west.  While such capitalism may be the American way, one certainly must question the sanctity of such a greedy movement as it relates to the spiritual.     Shouldn't we expect more out of spiritual leaders?    Also, there are numerous reports on the web about the blatant abuses by Chopra towards his staff written by ex staff members.The point being, why has Tolle featured Chopra on the cover of his book? Why feature an example of what a spiritual teacher should not become? Just to sell more copies of \\"The Power of Now\\"? One can only hope that Eckhart doesn't succomb to the greed that has toppled so many spiritual teachers. One can only hope.Ok, enough for now......

0684833395|5.0|This was the third time I read Catch-22 by Joseph Heller and everytime I read it I understand it better and better.  The first time I read it, I was about 17 years old living in Russia.  Anything American was good.  The book was translated into Russian but somehow was not very popular.  No one could really understand what it was all about.  If it was about the WWII, it was at least strange.  If it was an American humor, there was nothing to laugh about.  It was not funny to bomb your own planes.  And how could a captain walk around naked?  Tomatoes, prostitutes, the CID men, crazy officers and nurses... People did not like it.<BR>Than I came to America and a few years later, I saw this book used, somewhere, and just for 10 cents.  I could not resist.  I read it again.  I could speak some English back than but I guess it was not enough to understand the full depth of Catch-22.  I liked it better than before, in Russia, but still not enough.  It was just OK.<BR>A month ago, I was making more room for books in my house.  Books, I did not care much about were destined to end their lives in the local library, as my donation.  Catch-22 by Joseph Heller...  I opened it again.  What a mistake.  What a surprise.  I was stunned.  It was one of the best books ever written.  One has to know not only the language but the life in America and the Americans as well to understand this book completely.  This book is not about the war.  This book is about us and our lives and our regular affairs.  This book is perfect and has to be an American classic.  No, Catch-22 did not go to the local library.  It is destined now to end its life on my shelf.  I will have to read it again and, only than, again and again.  Have you read it?  You have to read it.

1563898586|5.0|Before you see the upcoming \\"summer blockbuster\\",filmed version......might I suggest a perusal of the roots of this confounding conundrum?<br />First let me say,I'm not one of those frothing at the jowls Alan Moore fans. I did enjoy \\"The Watchmen\\",but haven't actively sought out his works. So,I am a bit \\"selective\\",that being said....<br />\\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\",turned me into a frothing at the jowls Alan Moore fan!! ( Drat you,SIR!! )<br />To describe this volume is not an easy task! It's Victorian England....with a few moderne touchs....imagine the era as being H.G.Wells & Jules Verne's realitys,taken for actual reality,with historically acurate paraphrasings tossed into the soup for good measure. Now mix in as many obscure literary references as possible...and you've got quite a jolly deducedely brilliant tale indeed! ( with some very nice artistic scriblings by Kevin O'Neill.....who may or may not be boxing legend \\"Kid O'Neill\\" )<br />Now,imagine Victorian England in the grip of an evil superfiend,intent on controlling an amazing power source,and using any means to obtain it,and thus CONTROL THE WORLD! That's when Mr.Campion Bond and his boss \\"M\\",working for the British government,gather a group of covert operatives to save the world! Mina Harker ( now divorced from Vampire obsessor Jonathan Harker  ),must locate famed explorer Alan Quartermain....secretly aided by Captain Nemo....then these three seek out Dr.Henry Jekyll ( and the now gigantic and out of control Mr.Hyde ),and the transparent Mr.Hawley Griffin,( conveniently hiding in an all girls dormitory!),to form the super-squad of the 1800's! Sherlock Holmes is dead! Fu Manchu is advancing his troops! And the mastermind behind it all,will STOP AT NOTHING! London may soon lie in ruins,will no-one stop this MADNESS?!<br />It's a wonderful mish-mash of literary heroes and anti-heroes,as well as nod's o'plenty to Ian Fleming,Wells,Verne,Conan-Doyle,Carroll,and more! ( Who else,would incorporatesuch obscure characters as Miss Rosa Cootes? Or place Pollyanna in her care? ). Examine all panels carefully for clues!<br />And....if you were smart enough to collect this series as originally printed.....this volume has a few extras....such as the paint by numbers picture of Dorian Grey,the \\"Help Alan Quartemain find the Taduki\\" Game,a cover art gallery,and the collected back story from the original run.( As well as a cheery greeting from Scotty Smiles!! ). Sadly the original Victorian era adverts are gone,but that's a small loss.<br />Climb aboard the LOEG omnibus now,or live in fear of being a \\"johnny come lately\\"!

0345413377|1.0|The \\"Amber Spy Glass\\" is a bad book; it is even, an evil book.<br />This is a strong judgment; let me try to justify it.<br />A good story has a life of its own; the author is a sculptor who frees the story from the stone.  When the author imposes his own ideology on a book, the result is bad writing. At times, C.S. Lewis skated perilously close to this edge; Pullman has fallen off completely.<br />The \\"Amber Spy Glass\\" is an evil book.  If you doubt that look at the picture of the world Mr. Pullman presents. God is a monster; His Church an instrument of repression. Man's best hope is anihilation, for the after life is torment.  As other readers have noted, Mr. Pullman's agenda only gradually becomes clear in the series. To use his story telling gifts to lure children into the series in order to propagandize them in the last book is deceitful.<br />I consider myself a fairly sensitive reader, and I really enjoyed the first book in the series a lot; I felt let down and used by the third book.<br />If there are any teachers reading this review, please think carefully before using any of the books in this series in your classroom.  Most parents who believe in a God of Love, who hope for heaven will not want their children reading the third book in this series.
B00008H2LB|5.0|How does linkin park do it. meteora has excelled all my expectations as I could not believe they could match the brilliance of hybrid theory....But they did. <BR>Track overview.<BR>01.This is an awsome start to any album and blends perfectly with track 2.<br />02.Don't Stay- A great opener, fast and hard. The chourus grows on you but it is the brigde which stands out and you find yourself yelling with chester. 3.5/5<br />03.Somewhere I Belong- The single. The intro to this song is so addictive i find myself playing it over and over again. Good song, not the best. 4/5<br />04.Lying from you-Chester's voice in this song is so powerful and it is impossible not to yell with him. The chorus is again awesome but is let down by the rap. 3.5/5<br />05.Hit the floor- the major dissapointer of the album. The rap is to similar to previous efforts and the chourus offers very little. 2/5<br />06.Easier to Run- this chorus is one of the best in the album and blends perfectly with the brige at the end. One of my favourites. 4.5/5<br />07.Faint- The best song on the album. The intro is incredible and the rap blends so well with chester's chorus. A hard song with the best yelling bridge on the album. 5/5<br />08 Figure .09- Good song. the chorus isn't as catchy as others but the rap is a stand out. Not original enough. 3/5<br />09 Breaking the habit- An original an unlike any of their other songs. A quiet song in comparison and the opening scratch with the strings is awesome. Good for a change. 4/5<br />10.From the Inside- A major stand out. I love this chorus. It has awesome lyrics and is easy to sing with. The best mix of rap and singing to date with an awesome brige. 5/5<br />11.Nobody's Listening-Again very different.the intro with the pipes sounds sweet. Good rap. Good Chorus. 4/5<br />12.Session- Dissapointing. Nothing compared to track 11 on hybrid theory where Mr Hahn went off. 1/5<br />13.Numb- Another great song, easy flowing and again good to sing with. Great lyrics, another favourite, good closer. 4.5/5<br />*** An awsome album...linkin park has created another masterpeice with every intro being different from the next but being so effective. <br />Best songs- 03,06,07,10,13
B00005JKPF|5.0|When I first heard about the movie, I was disappointed that they weren't using a storyline involving more popular villains such as the Sentinels, Juggernaut, Mr. Sinister, etc. However, after watching the movie twice in the theater I can say I am more than satisfied with the outcome.  \\"X2\\" ups the antie with greater special effects, more mutants, and a far darker atmosphere.  Hugh Jackman was excellent in his portrayal of Wolverine, with a greater resemblence to his comic-book counterpart than in the first movie, particularly with his famous berserker-rage.  The cameo of Collossus was the most exciting in the movie; too bad he wasn't in there longer.  Other than a few subtle inaccuracies (Collossus wasn't Russian, Pyro wasn't Australian, etc.) the movie was flawless in continuing where the first left off.  The tie-in with Jean's struggling with the phoenix force was a nice addition as well, paying homage to perhaps the greatest storyline in X-Men history (too bad they weren't in outer space when it happened).  Perhaps the only disappointment in the movie was the lack of inclusion of Gambit, which was hinted at several times before the movie was released.  Ah well, maybe next time (along with Beast, Angel, etc.)...
B000089CKH|5.0|It's nice to hear a band evolve in a good way.  This is a great cd with a lot of emotion and intelligence.  It has a warm sound like Hum.  The highlights in my opinion are blizzard of 77, inside of love, hi-speed soul, treading water, and paper boats.  If you like the previous albums, or even if you didn't, give this cd a try.  I don't see how it could disappoint a music fan.

B000003TAW|5.0|I got this cd when it first came out, i was 13, and it was the first time I ever got that warm feeling in my stomach from listening to music.  I still get it listening to this album to this day.  It's full of beautiful warm progressions that are so opposite the lyrics.  This was a paragon of what Rivers is capable of as a songwriter.  If you don't own this cd, you're the only one.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is by far one of the best movies ever made. It rates right up there with The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring. In my 44 years I have only 1 other time actually paid out my very hard-earned money to go to the theater to see a movie more than once - even before the advent of video tapes - that was for Life is Beautiful. Mr. Jackson never claimed, nor even pretended, to make a completely faithful adaptation of the book. And I believe Mr. Tolkien would have thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation - by far more than the animated versions, but I guess that goes without saying!!!  I may not have read the books 37 times (YET) but I find that with each re-reading since watching the movies I so completely am engrossed with the literature that the movies serve only to aid my imaginations. I have to say a wholehearted THANK YOU to Mr. Jackson. I wish I could sit down with him and talk about these movies. THEY ARE SUPERB.

B0000028M7|5.0|THIS IS THE PERFECT RECORD. THIS RECORD IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES LIFE ALL THE MORE WORTH LIVING FOR.
B000024D4R|5.0|This album is simply amazing. When I first bought this, I wasnt real impressed because i was used to hearing the spacey-layed back sound of Dark Side, and the beautiful textures of WYWH. This is more of a fast-paced, complex album and it really works for the Floyd. I'll describe each song:<BR>  'Pigs on the wing (pt. 1)' - nice acoustic & vocal song from roger waters. Like a previous reviewer said, \\"the calm before the storm\\"<BR>  'Dogs' - awesome acoustic intro with some nice keyboard touches. Builds up into an amazing guitar solo, slows down, then goes into an even more amazing solo. The vocal melody is flawless and i must say, this is probably one of the best floyd tunes out there.<BR>  'Pigs (three different ones)' - cool intro with the pig and keyboards. Great lyrics to this one (roger waters basically bashing some british people). Got a really cool talkbox solo that sounds like pig grunts. This tune has an amazingly amazing outro solo that makes Dave Gilmour shine.<BR>  'Sheep' - The fastest (and probably heaviest) song on the album. Great keyboard work. Its awesome how when roger waters sings, he holds out those notes, and then they turn into synthesizers. Amazing production on this tune. cool outro with some nice guitar chords.<BR>  'Pigs on the wing (pt. 2) - basically the same as the first pigs on the wing, but with different lyrics and its at the end.<br />  Hope this was helpful. If you like this album try to download 'Gotta be Crazy' and 'Raving and Drooling', you'll be pleasantly surprised....
0688163173|5.0|Best way I can describe is mind bending and disturbing.  In Mystic River, Lehane dealt with a lot of moral ambiguity and gray areas.  In Shutter Island, the question is whose reality and set of facts to believe.  Any description of the plot would give too much away.  You won't be able to put this down but if you like nice, tidy endings this is not for you.  Lehane is simply a great, unique writer.
B000006OS2|1.0|This movie is (usually) a great way to spend a lighthearted evening.  However, the production quality of this disc is so abysmally bad that it is difficult to enjoy the movie.  I certainly wouldn't spend the money on it again.  I would rather watch it on AMC, bowflex and dietary supplement commercials, notwithstanding.
B000069KGM|5.0|I need not even close my eyes and I can hear Lee Loughnane's melodic trumpet solo from &quot;Introduction,&quot; Terry Kath's soulful guitaritstry on &quot;Liberation,&quot; and I can picture Robert Lamm reaching into his Steinway to pluck the piano strings for his adventurous Free-form intro to &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&quot;  This was Chicago at their finest hour- a group of young green boys from the Windy City getting their foot in the door of the LA music scene.  With every remastered note you can hear their hunger, their drive, their creativity, and their humble beginnings.  Whether it's the thick yet melodic bass chops of Peter Cetera reminding you that he was, once upon a time, not only a fantastic vocalist-- but also a phenomenal bass player; the symbiosis of the horns playing with such tight and raw energy they sound as though they are one instrument; or the precision drumming of Danny Seraphine-- THIS is the CD to listen to when one wants to be reminded of why Jann Wenner and the Nominating Committee of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame are tone deaf.  Chicago has a few other great albums in their catalog-- but on the merits of this masterpiece alone one can find plenty of reasons why Chicago belongs in the Hall of Fame.<br />After listening to this musical endeavour, it's sad to note that this fantastic group morphed into a band that played bubble-gum lover's lament prom songs and standard wedding fodder for the masses from the late seventies through the eighties.
B000002A3T|5.0|After the abysmal &quot;Final Cut&quot; in 1983, which had every song written by Roger Waters and the same Gentleman had already fired founder member and keyboard player Rick Wright. Pink Floyd was laid to rest as a band without even touring the album.<br />Fortunately Roger Waters was not allowed his way and after many court battles lead guitarist David Gilmour was allowed to legally own the name of Pink Floyd. In 1986 he reassembled Pink Floyd with Nick Mason, Floyd's original drummer;  re-instated Rick Wright behind the keyboards; and replaced Roger Waters with the bass playing skills of Rick Wright's son-in-law Guy Pratt, which immediately increased the musical ability of the band. In early 1987 &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" was released under the Pink Floyd banner, proving that Pink Floyd were no spent force, but still had a lot to offer. It would of been a travesty of justice if &quot;The Final Cut&quot; had been Pink Floyd's epitaph, as, by any band's standards, it is a bad album; by the standards set by 'The Floyd', appalling. Only selling on past glories.<br />But ''Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; was a huge commercial and critical success, (except in Roger Waters opinion). and was followed by a huge tour of the worlds biggest stadiums. To commemorate this 'The Floyd' released a double CD live recording called &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; (1988), featuring many supporting musicians giving fine renditions of songs from the last album and reworks of past classics, also to enormous sales.<br />After a couple of years recuperation the fifteenth and (probably) final `Pink Floyd' album was released in 1994, &quot;The Division Bell&quot;. How fitting that here, finally, should be their best and most complete work. Not bad value either at over sixty six minutes worth of music. In Mott's Fantasy Pink Floyd's Live set &quot;The Division Bell&quot; is the only album to showcase four songs, unless you count the ten different sections of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, or the six pieces in &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;. (You have to limit yourself to three and a half hours. You can't expect the guys to play all night.)<br />David Gilmour's vocals and guitar have never been more splendid; Nick Mason by his own confession has never had a better drum sound; and Rick Wright makes a mockery of Water's decision to fire him, his keyboard playing throughout is nothing short of breathe-taking, proving that he is the only keyboard player for Pink Floyd. He even takes lead vocals on one track, &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot;, his first solo vocal on a Pink Floyd album in over twenty years.<br />The music opens with the very spacey &quot;Cluster One'', where the solo efforts of Gilmour and Wright build together till sliding smoothly into first song proper &quot;What do you want from me\\". &quot;Cluster One&quot; was the only song from the album not to be played live on the &quot;Division Bell Tour&quot;, which is a shame as it is a marvelous opening to the album and would of made a very effective opener to the live show. (It also just happens to be one of the songs on Mott's Fantasy Live set list.)<br />''Marooned'' won a Grammy in 1995 for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Not bad for a bunch of old Dinosaurs.<br />\\"High Hopes\\", the album's closing song, and if you like a final goodbye from the band, encompasses all the glorious facets of &quot;The Floyd&quot; in its eight and a half minutes.

B00003CXBK|5.0|This was the first anime film I have seen, and I can honestly say...I AM HOOKED!  The animation is amazing.  But more importantly I loved the story.  It was fantasy and real life put together.  It wasn't a predictable movie and that is a good thing.  I absolutely loved those little white forest dwellers (forgive me for not knowing there name) and their clicking.  They are sooo cute and wonderfully constructed.  I could watch this movie on repeat all day.
B000001FDQ|4.0|I own Concerto Suite For Electric guitar and thought the playing was excellent. I did enjoy the music, but I was very interested in hearing some of Malmsteen's metal albums. When a friend asked if I wanted to see him live, I went along and was totally blown away. I'd been meaning to buy Rising Force (if not another one of his albums) but that gig was what made me.<br />And I have to say that impressed is not the word. I was absolutely amazed by what I heard. From the doomy Black Star (proof that slow and emotional is also heavy) and the fast guitar/keyboard duelling in the speedy Far Beyond The Sun through the epic Icarus Dream Suite to the closing piece, Malmsteen plays some of the most amazing guitar I've ever heard.<br />Overplays? Well he always has, he always will and he always should.<br />But, continuing on that, there is the age old \\"no emotion\\" thing that people criticise. Emotion is not a fact - some music can convey emotion to some people. My sister says that Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers (NOT the Gareth Gates version which she hates) sends shivers down her spine. But it does nothing for me. Similarly, she does not feel the same passion and intesity exude from Randy Rhoads' guitar solos in Ozzy Osbourne's Mr Crowley that I do. Yngwie Malmsteen DOES play with emotion. Maybe you don't see it and that is fair enough, but others do.<br />At the end of the day, 75% or so of this is guitar soloing (think Nicolo Pagninni's 24 Caprices played on a Fender Strat - Malmsteen cites this piece as a major influence in his playing) so it may not be for everyone. There are only 2 songs with vocals and even then guitar is still dominant. But if you like technical guitar music, like classical and like it indulgent (well it is, but for many that's a plus) then this is a highly recommended album.
0061040967|4.0|Let me be totally honest, you are unlikely to get an unbiased review of any Terry Pratchett book, from me, Quite simply I have read and re-read all 28 books in the Discworld series, and every time his subtlety of contextual humour, hits you like a brick in the funny centre of your brain.<br />Let me be honest. Pratchett is no poet laureate, no William Shakespeare, but he has probably mastered the art the of pun, and double entendre, mixed with a sardonic and typically British look at the world.<br />His humour is sophisticated, yet simple and can be understood at many levels. It has always amazed me, that it so understood in America, given that a lot of the puns, are very British in their source of parody.<br />So what can I say, buy this book, but not as the first discworld book you ever read, if your a fan, you don't need to read this review, and if your not a fan, I really would advise you to start at the source, and read book one in the Discworld series and move on from there book by book.<br />I guarantee you will love these books, although this writer accepts no legal responsibilty if you don't.<br />The man is funny, evilly wicked in his humour and a joy to read, put simply I would rather read his books than any other writer's.
B00005A0N5|4.0|Take a listen to Hammerfall. And Dragonforce. And Angra. What sets Nightwish apart from these bands? Originality. And while Oceanborn may not deliver the immediate punch that you would get from the likes of some of the bands mentioned above, in its place you get so much more.<br />That isn't to say that Nightwish aren't speedy or heavy when they want to be. Opener Stargazers is a crashing song full of double bass, as is Devil And The Deep Dark Ocean, Sacrement of Wilderness and Moondance (amongst others). But there are also slower more atmospheric songs such as Gethsemane (still quite heavy in the context of the album) or the ballads Swanheart or Sleeping Sun. But even on the faster heavier tracks there is still a sense of atmosphere and beauty.<br />Even if Nightwish were fronted by a male vocalist doing traditional power metal singing I'd still think that Nightwish possessed a quality of their own. But the fact that they are fronted by a female opera singer completely severs them from being classed as yet another clone. And while I had my doubts at first (Tarja's voice did take some time for me to get used to), I have to say it works. Her vocals add to (if not do much to create) the majestic beauty that this music possesses.<br />I have to say that while Oceanborn is not perfect (I can't put my finger on it - it just doesn't have that \\"classic\\" quality about it), it is still a great album with a lot of originality that other power metal bands lack. If you're new to power metal, then leave it for a while. But if you know you're metal and you have an open mind, you will find a great album.
B000002LE6|5.0|LOVESEXY was pure genius. And it was a shame that many people did not welcome LOVESEXY. I was 14, when this album came out. And, I was eager to hear songs on the radio, get the tape but, it was limited. Who but Prince could create the jam &quot;GLAM SLAM&quot; and bring new meaning to strings to a funk jam? To compare the music of Purple Rain to LoveSexy, there is tremendous growth..<BR>To think that this was his last great album is an understatement. Every album after LOVESEXY had something genius about them and that is what make his efforts great. For an artist such as Prince to be around for over two decades, its expected for critics making comparisons and rating which album is better than the other. LoveSexy was an impressive masterpiece of funk.
B000021XS0|5.0|OK, I wrote a positive review for this album but I only gave it four stars. And since Dream Theater have since developed into my favourite band and I like their music more than ever, I have come to decide that while Images And Words is my favourite, Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory is also an excellent piece of work.<br />Dream Theater are musically on full form here. Kevin Moore and Derek Sherinian were good, but the bands 3rd keyboard player Jordon Rudess is certainly superior to either. The speed at which he plays his keys and shreds is simply mind-boggling. John Petrucci is, as ever, brilliant. One of the best guitarists of this generation (alongside Zakk Wylde and Yngwie Malmsteen). Mike Portnoy is no doubt a great drummer, but I have to say he's less impressive here. Here seemed to put forward a better performance on Images &amp; Words and Awake. Nonetheless, he is sturdy and complements the music well, perhaps simply toning down the drums. John Myung is better on bass here than I've heard before, perhaps because his bass has far more definition and he seems to play as an equal rather than play along like he did before (he always seemed overshadowed by the other musicians on previous albums). Lastly there is LaBrie. Either you love him or hate him, but I've always been impressed with passion, power and range. He's less aggressive than on Awake, but then this is a less aggressive album, and his performance here is just great.<br />The music itself is sheer technical wizardry. The interlocking keyboard and guitar work mixed with the grandoisity of the music is something few bands have managed. Sonata Arctica and Children Of Bodom have almost matched with dueling, but haven't stuck with fairly ordinary structures in their song-writing, while Opeth and Tool have in places matched the song structures and sound (not that they sound LIKE Dream Theater) on some tracks but without the technical ability to truly pull it off. Overture and Strange Deja-Vu are great, The Dance Of Eternity is perhaps THE greatest instrumental I've EVER heard and Fatal Tragedy is just fierce.<br />The concept is also a great one, which really adds to the music. Some have criticised the story but while everyone is entitled to their own opinion it is deeper and less simplistic than I first realised. The story follows Nicholas who is having dreams about this girl called Victoria and living her life in his dreams. Suddenly he stops dreaming about her and has hypnotherapy to find out what happened. Turns out he is a reincarnation of Victoria. The rest of the story centres around her, but I'll leave that for you. Also, there is a damn cool ending.<br />All in all, while this does have a few flaws it is a truly amazing album. Go buy it, listen to it, watch the DVD. God I love Dream Theater..., The Dance Of Eternity is perhaps THE greatest instrumental I've EVER heard and Fatal Tragedy is just fierce.<br />The concept is also a great one, which really adds to the music.

B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie is along with The Fellowship of the Ring, the best movie EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!! It is just amazing and it keeps you in front of the screen from the very beginning to the end. It's just wonderful, and i'm just anxious to see The Return of the King, because it's the best of the books, and i'm really lookig forward to see how wonderful it'll be on screen. This is a MUST-BUY DVD. You won't regret it!!!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|I suppose its cliche to say now, but this was my first album.  Not the first album I bought, or heard, or loved.  This was the first album I felt real emotion when listening to.  I was a mere 12 years old when this album came out.  I had listened to some of the hard rock my older brother had listened to like Metallica's \\"Black Album\\" and AC/DC's \\"Live,\\" but I had never really feel in love with music until Nirvana.  So many albums have touched me since, none quite so good, or fey, or with such an impact, but no one was blood and sweat \\"Heart\\" (for me) like Nirvana.  This album was and still is the base upon which every album I loved thereafter was compared to and owed a little something to.<br />\\"Come as You Are\\" was the first music video I ever witnessed, and it just made my addiction louder.  \\"Lithium\\" and \\"Lounge Act\\" were my stand-outs and made me believe that music was more than just something to drive your car to work to.  It was art.  ANd that's exactly what Nirvana as a band, Kurt Cobain as a lyricist, and \\"Nevermind\\" as an album are; pure art. Dirty, confusing, emotional, and true.<br />Even today \\"In Bloom\\" sounds purer than near anything that was made ten years before it, anything today (ten years later), and I'm willing to bet, anything 10 years down the road.  \\"Polly\\" is as smearing and perplexing as a \\"ballad\\" should be.  And \\"Something in the Way\\" is as beautiful as it is esoteric.  Yes, Kurt loved and was inspired by the Pixies \\"Doolittle.\\"  Yes, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" started a music insurection that still stands today as a staple.  Yes, the album was much more polished than any of the band wanted.  And yes, the anti-rock-star approach to rock and roll was refreshing and exactly what everyone needed.  I don't think there's anything that can be said that critics, fans, the band, or anyone else has already said.  I'll still say it, for myself and what I owe to \\"Nirvana's \\"Nevermind.\\"  This is perfection.<br />Overall:  10 out of 10.
B000003TAW|2.0|yeah whatever. This album is not a classic by any means, and people are saying it's the group's best ever, so i don't think the group's that great either. Best song BY FAR: Say it ain't so. All the others are either sub-par or just bad. By the way, you should listen to Nirvana if you want real grunge.
B00004Z459|1.0|This ...is not metal even, though MTV sure thinks it is! These guys arent true to metal, they dont care about what music they play...There is a reveiwer saying thay are death metal,  They are as far from deth metal as you can get... THese guys are almost as [bad] as limp bizkit, mixing rap with their so-called metal...<BR>Stay away from these posers and listen to real metal like:<BR>Cannibal Corpse<BR>Metallica<BR>King Diamond<BR>Dying Fetus<BR>Carcass<BR>or any of the other great metal bands
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movi was great!!! I can't believe what Hollywood did with this movie. Some of the parts were a little boring, and they did not put much of a story behind one of the characters, but the action part was great. The battle part was so well done. I tink think this movie is awsome, so by it today!!!
B000002HMH|5.0|Man, this rules. I hate how people say that &quot;its barley even metal&quot; or &quot;they have sold out&quot;. My god i hate people. If they were real Metallica fans thay wouldnt be saying stuff like that! If they dont like it they dont have to tell everyone how much they hate it! This is still metal and it is still awesome! Now for the TRUE Metallica fans, this is one of their best without a doubt, i have to admit i do like their old stuff better, but no worry, i read on Metallicas website that St. Anger is their hardest release ever! But back to the cd, This rules. My favorite song is probaly House That Jack Built!
B00000JPH5|5.0|If you like fantasy movies then this is the movie for you!! This movie has the perfect blend of music and costumes and characters that you will find in a movie. This movie is at the top of my list of all time favorites and will remain there for a real long time.  David Bowie did an excellent job with the music and in his role as the Goblin King. Jennifer Connely is hot and does an excellent job as Sarah in this movie. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! and my favorite character in this movie is the large and fluffy LUDO! LUDO for President! HAHA!
B000089CJI|5.0|I've always liked DCFC but found them a bit morose. The album boasts intelligent, glittering detail and infectious melody.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This guy is so damn good...every song makes you feel like dancing &amp; singing along...this is happy (but still meaningful) music at it's best...personally I love the short song &quot;Fall Line&quot;...which sounds like a sequel to &quot;Posters&quot;, which is a personal fave from Brushfire Fairytales...thanks to Jack Johnson, Ben Harper &amp; David Gray the future of good music seems bright
B00008H2LB|2.0|I was duped into buying this album by two things.  The fact that I thought Hybrid Theory was an excellent album, and by their first single off this album.  I thought that it would be Hybrid Theory, only better, and I thought that it would at least be like Hybrid Theory, even if not better.  Well guess what, I barely got my second hope.  Yeah sure, the songs sound similar to all of their debuts songs, but that never makes songs better.  If you take a semi-original sounding work like Hybrid Theory, then remix the whole album(ala Reanimation), you end up with reguritated song matter, of little to no energy left.  However, it would seem that the LP boys know their physics, and that energy is never destroyes, only used up.  Well you can try to regather that energy and make a new album out of the same stuff, thats all good and fine(not), but if the product is vastly inferior to the original then all you do is make everyone sick, and a few bucks poorer.  Lets face the facts. There is no One Step closer, or Crawling, or Papercut, or In The End on this album.  And thats only naming their singles, let alone other awesome songs off their debut,like With You, or Run Away.  This album loses steam after three of four songs and that is never a good thing either.  Faint is about the only half decent song on this entire effort.  None of the songs on this album struck me as being truly amazing like In the End did the first time I heard it on their first CD, and it strikes me as funny that I could listen to In the End over and over again for the same amount of time that this album lasts for, and I would be ten times more entertained, and would not feel cheated.<br />My only recommendation to the band is to take some liberites with your sound.  Sure a buncha million records sold means lots, but so what.  All that means to me is that is that if you want to sell even more records next time, you're going to need to appeal to new fans, not turn your old ones off.  It strikes me as funny that one bands much anticipated sophmore album is a real dissapointment, while another bands debut is what Linkin Park's second album should have been.  And that band would be Dry Cell.  Sure they sound like Linkin Park, but only on a few songs.  They actually have songs over four minutes(which seems to be an idea that would cause the LP boys heads to explode), and some guitar work that isn't all power cords, and distortion.  Their album Disconnected is what Meteora should have been, and that makes me laugh all the way to the used rack to relieve myself of some garbage, and get myself some more money to but decent music.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\", I didn't know who sang it or what the title of the song was, all I knew was that the female vocalist BLEW ME AWAY.  WOW.  I got goosebumps throughout the whole song.  That started me on my quest to find out who she was...and now I am here. <br /> I have listened to all the songs on the Evanescence CD and was just amazed.  I already read the interview in Entertainment Weekly where they proclaimed they weren't a Christian band.  I can see where Christian music lovers would be confused...many of the lyrics do seem to be talking about some level of spirituality.  It is all very touching.<br />Usually when I get a cd, I will like 2-3 songs on it tops and all the rest suck.  Not so with Evanescence.  I would gladly listen to this CD completely through over and over again.  The music & the vocals all come together so nicely.<br />I was sitting here listening to Evanescence and I was just thinking...wow.  It's amazing that a band with this type of talent has been in hiding to the rest of the world so long.  Seriously, Evanescence makes Britany Spears and JLo look like cheap karaoke night club singers.  I know they aren't in the same musical categories together, but seriously when you hear Evanescence, read the lyrics you think this is how music should be...so the listener can HEAR the heart and soul put into the music.  <br />Not so with our current butt-wagging sexy teeny-boppers who sound like they wrote their lyrics while on the john 25 min before they had to record it.  Take away their pretty faces and tanned legs and they got nothing.  My Retriever has better vocal talent.   <br />Meanwhile, Evanescence is here to stay.  Sex appeal isn't a part of their act.  They have solid, obvious, talent and that makes them more permanent than any other phony talent out there.
0792842073|5.0|Dead Man Walking, directed by Tim Robbins, is a movie masterpiece.  It boasts a fabulous supporting cast, yet the real stars are Sean Penn, who plays Matthew Poncelot, a man convicted of two brutal murders, waiting for execution, and Susan Sarandon as Sisten Helen Prejean, who, in real life, wrote the book from which this film was adapted.  It follows the story of Matthew Poncelot, who, up until the day of his execution, denies commiting the murder he is convicted of.  Sister Helen Prejean follows his struggle for freedom from his execution, and helps him with several appeals, failing however.  She becomes his spiritual advisor, and his close (and only) friend.<br />This film is so wonderful not just because of its cast, but of it's non-predujiced way of looking at the Death Penalty.  It neither encourages you to support it or not support it; it just shows you the reality of life on the supposed 'Green Mile' in a mature, unbiased way.  <br />I first watched this in my high school English class.  We weren't really meant to see it, as we are I am in 11th grade, and this is an R rated film, however I am very pleased we did get the chance to see it.<br />This film is an excellant eye opener, and I would challenge anyone to sit throught the whole thing without shedding a single tear.  It is an emotional masterpiece, stirring every single kind of emoition.  Thanksfully, it does have a few light hearted moments of comedy, which stop the two hour film becoming too intense.<br />I would recommmend this film to anyone and everyone.  It is a little brutal for children under 13 years, but I would encourage any parent to sit down and watch it with their teenage children,a nd gather thoughts and views.<br />Buy this film...it is by far one of the best movies ever made.
B00003CWPL|5.0|The new dvd is available only from davidlynch.com. The film has been cleaned frame by frame. It was originally slated for year 2000 release but delayed for technical reasons. David Lynch doesn't record audio commentary for any of his dvds. This special release has Lynch describing the making of this movie in a small documentary....beautiful transfer...digitally remastered...the soundtrack (also restored) is also available on the website too.
B0000931OG|5.0|Blur's experimentation runs the gamut on Think Tank -- which is not only refreshing, but expected. This is the direction they've been heading since '97's \\"Blur\\" when they abandoned the formulaic approach of being a bouncy brit-pop band and started to make a sound that is unmistakably their own. While there is some Gorrilaz residue sprinkled over this album, the influence only makes for a more intriguing listen. Graham Coxen's departure is noted, but Blur's strongsuit has always been the percussion section of James and Roundtree, and their performance is top-notch here. Also, the inclusion of Mike Smith on sax only adds to a strong Roxy Music influence that Blur already exhibited. Oh, and sorry for the hypotheticals, but speaking of Roxy Music, this album would have been absolutely perfect if Eno had produced it. He could have filled in every nuance.
B00000DGUG|4.0|After the celebrated, but uneven and very angry &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, Alanis Morrissette in 1998 released her most diverse and, put simply, best record yet. On &quot;Junkie&quot;, teaming again with producer Glen Ballard, Alanis is more mature and less militant than on &quot;Pill&quot;, sophisticatedly improving her songwriting qualities, while providing more glimpses to her complicated personality.<br />Generous in offering 17 songs, some of this rock album's are outright gems (&quot;Unsent&quot;, &quot;Joining You&quot;), some show really eclectic taste (&quot;Thank You&quot;, &quot;So Pure&quot;). Failures can also be found, mainly &quot;Sympathetic Character&quot; with its meaningful message but, alas, with completely inadequate musical side. Guitars are dominating, often with impressive results (&quot;Baba&quot;, &quot;Can't Not&quot;, &quot;Would Not Come&quot;). Morissette's traditionally overlapping lyrics sometimes work out right (&quot;The Couch&quot;), sometimes not (&quot;Your Congratulations&quot;). &quot;One&quot; and &quot;UR&quot; are plain good songs, as is &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot;, which seems to be tapping from the roots of Alanis' great compatriot Sarah McLachlan.<br />Sophomore efforts seldom exceed the quality of debuts (&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is usually considered Morissette's real debut). &quot;Junkie&quot; did, although the sales did not indicate that. The problem was that &quot;Junkie&quot; lacked the hype of &quot;Pill&quot;, enhanced by the handful of Grammies. That's usual music irony.
630469797X|2.0|Maybe it is because I am not a horror film fan that I don't like this film. Though I must say that if this is the state of the art, then I have no desire to be a horror film fan. <br />I have noticed that old and specialized films always get high rates on Amazon, surely because only real fans buy them and rate them. This has the downside that some non-fans will be convinced that the film is really a classic and excellent film, and not just a fan cornerstone. <br />Dawn of the Dead starts without a beginning, there is no introduction to the setting, the story, or the characters. It is so confusing that I had to go back to see if I missed a chapter. It also has mediocre acting, mediocre make-up and effects, and a mediocre story. I strongly suspect that it has been so influential solely because it was *first* with something or other, not because of ultimate quality.

B000000H6D|5.0|Bloody Kisses was the album that took Type O Negative from being a misfit, mediocore industrial/thrash/sludge-rock band to a much more serious, melodic, dynamic goth-rock band.  This is the album where the boys from Brooklyn got serious (but not too serious, it's Type O Negative) about their craft as musicians, and the result was one of the most surprisingly beautiful, melodic, wide-ranging collection of songs the group would ever put out on a single album.  Yes, Type O's patented fuzzy, Black-Sabbath inspired sludge is here in all it's glory, but there's also shades of Beatlesesque pop in many of the songs, angelic female voices, druid chanting, acoustic guitar, cheesey keyboards, thrash-metal, odes to classic-rock, punk-rock, plenty of campy industrial flavored samples/skits, and some pretty damn catchy songs to boot, some of which could be described as, dare I say, poppy?  But make no mistake, this is not a cheery album.  On the contrary, it's actually quite depressing for the most part, as the majority of the album sounds like one long drawn-out funeral.  This largely has to do with frontman Peter Steele's low-baratone voice that sounds like it's coming straight out of Transylvania, coupled with Josh Silver's atmospheric organ contributions that definitely add a campy, Halloween-esq feel to the album.   And while this vibe can certainly be off-putting to some people, it is definitely hard to deny that there is not some original, compelling music on Bloody Kisses.  Take the first song on the album \\"Christian Woman\\".  An incredibly dark, beautiful, and dymanic number, it is essentially 3 songs combined into 1 epic masterpiece of a song.  I won't bother trying to describe it, as words simply cannot do it justice.  It's quite sprawling and a Type O classic.  For my money, it's the best song they've ever wrote.  Dark, beautiful, and it rocks.  Classic Type O indeed.  Another classic on the album, and a concert-staple of the band, is \\"Black No 1\\".  If you thought \\"Christian Woman\\" was a long song, wait till you soak in \\"Black No 1\\" which clocks in at over 11 minutes.  This song stands out for it's memorable, chant-along chorus and several campy twist and turns, but for my money, the best part of the song may be the drum-solo outro the last couple of minutes.  Very cool ending to another epic song.  After a campy skit that sounds like something from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Type O kicks it up a notch with the thrashy \\"Kill All The White People\\" which is a lot of fun.  Then the band's trademark sense of humor arises with their cover of Seals & Crofts's \\"Summer Breeze\\".  Once you get over the shock of Type O covering a Seals & Crofts song, you realize what a damn good job they do of making the song into one of their own.  Turning such a sunny, light-hearted song into a fantasticly dark and sludgy goth-rock song is not an easy task, but Type O executes it to near perfection.  And just when you start to think Type-O are a bunch of one-trick-pony's with the goth-rock thing, darkness quickly turns into light as \\"Summer Breeze\\" transitions to \\"Set Me On Fire\\" an incredibly breezy, guitar-pop song that recalls one of the band's main influences: The Beatles.  It's a beautiful song, and really shows how dynamic of a band Type really was.  After another skit that will make you never want to have sex again, the band launches into \\"We Hate Everyone\\" which at first sounds like a parody of punk-rock, then a guitar-tech session hijacked by satan, then a catchy as hell poppy 70s guitar driven section, then back to the punk-rock parody again.  What just happened there?  Type O just happened.  Another great song.  After you get through what I would consider to the worst song on the album, the droning title track, you're treated to the campiest skit of all \\"3.0.1.F\\" (which can send chills up your spine if you listen to it alone in the dark).  After that, the listener is treated to 2 more classic Type O songs \\"Too Late: Frozen\\" and \\"Blood and Fire\\", the latter a smooth number recalling some of the best elements of 70s guitar rock, and the prior being perhaps the most dymanic straight-forward hard-rock song on the album, with some beautiful melodies to boot, reminiscent of The Beatles.  Speaking of The Beatles, the last track on the album features a sitar and an enchanting mood to close out a stellar album.  Type O Negative really flexed their musical muscles here, showcasing a wide-range of influences and crafting a very original piece of material, effectively re-inventing themselves in the process.  Because this album is frequently pigeon-holed into the \\"goth-rock\\" category, it is often dismissed in critical circles due to it's perceived lack of accessibility or one-dimensionality as a result.  That is a shame, as there is a lot more going on here than just goth-rock (albeit that is the predominate theme).  This album is incredibly dymanic, and transcends the goth-rock genre as a whole because of it's ability to incorporate multiple influences and create something unique and original.  Their best album.
B00008S2VH|5.0|American Life, es un disco que expresa muchas cosas diferentes para cada uno, dependiendo como como las persivamos. Mi opinin personal es que Madonna sigue transformndose, como siempre lo ha hecho, pero cada vez mejor. American Life nos relata pensamientos y viviencias de ella, lo cual lo hace ms humano y no tan comercial; s se puede escuchar la influencia de hoy da en algunos arreglos (comercio) pero las letras son muy buenas y los que hemos seguido de cerca el desarrollo de Madonna (mujer, esposa y madre) notaremos que en cada disco ella quiere expresarnos sus emociones y sentimientos, notndose el cambio que ha tenido durante toda su carrera artstica. Yo considero que este disco es muy maduro por parte de Madonna y es muy diferente a lo que hemos escuchado anteriormente, yo me identifico con alguna de las letras y eso me hace sentir bien. Yo felicito a Madonna por hacer siempre lo que ella considera que es bueno para ella misma y querer compartirlo con su publico fiel y nuevos oyentes.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Alright, heres how it goes. When Brushfire Fairytales came out, it instantly became the best CD in my collection. Every song on that disk blew me away, and the same goes for On and On. I don't know how he does it, but every single song is perfect, the guitar, vocals, drums, bass, you name it and its absolutley beautiful. The songs that stick out in my mind though are &quot;Taylor&quot;, &quot;Cookie Jar&quot; and &quot;Mediocre Bad Guys&quot;. This CD is THE BEST that I have purchased in at least a year. It doesn't get better than this.
B000083E79|5.0|Well I have only seen the diva one time, but seeing her was one of the most memorable times in my life. This is because my Mom and myself went to go see her together. I am sure that we were not the only mom and son that went to go see her but, I can bet that we were the only son and mother that could relate to almost all of her songs...It's kinda funny that my family always called my mom a gypsy. Then when I got older I look back and I think we were..I remember we always moved around , I was the only child out of four that was always there through my moms gypsy days you could say...Well I just want to say my mom and I always loved Cher through all of her songs even if she thought they were flops...I thank whomever or whatever for giving me the experience to share (CHER) the exstavagansa that my mom and I will always remember.And thats just what it was.
B000063DI9|5.0|After this album, Maiden ditched the synth, which I thought worked out so well for them, and didn't write many long epics and thought-provoking songs, up until their recent Brave New World release and hopefully their new one coming in September. At least they had a decent reason for doing it. They were starting to become more mainstream and more publiclly accesible, and they felt that's not what they wanted, so they drastically changed their style to steer away from the public eye, which I respect them for doing. They were never, EVER about the fame, they only tried to pleases themselves and their fans. With that aside, let's get on to the album. It features the most complex and interesting song structures they've ever written. It is also their first semi-concept album. The reason I say semi is because some songs stay with the story of the Seventh Son, a person with supernatural powers that he cannot control, and dosen't know whether to use them for good or evil, but other songs don't really go with the story. Also if this was a concept album then the songs are all out of sequence in the events that the story takes place, which leads me to believe part of it has a running theme, and part of it does not. Interesting. Now I will rate each song one by one.<br /> Moonchild- Great beginning, which starts a running theme on this album with most of the songs starting off slow and building up. Great synth-use as well, dark verses and a great chorus. 5/5 <br /> Infinite Dreams- A beautiful song, awesome singing. Again builds up to become a faster song towards the end. So harmonious, so melodic. 5/5<br /> Can I Play With Madness?- Most radio friendly song, also the one that threatened to get them closer to the mainstream. Much, much lighter paced, pretty fast throughout, with an awesome chorus. Strangely, I enjoy it. 4/5<br /> The Evil That Men Do- Wonderful guitar work, touching lyrics as well. This song has so much feeling to it, so true as well. 5/5<br /> Seventh Son Of ASeventh Son- YEAH! This song is so incredible, it is a crime that this song is not included in this song is not included in the same breath as other epics of theirs. Some don't even call it an epic, let alone a good song! The guitar playing is the best on the album, a great long section in the middle that is very reminiscent to Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. Lyrics really start getting into the character, the Seventh Son. Has the most epic feel to it than any song Maiden's ever done before. If there has ever been an album worth getting for one song, this is the one. And i'll say it right now: MAIDEN'S MOST UNDERRATED SONG EVER!!! 5/5<br /> The Prophecy- Maiden comes back to earth with this one, but have not touched down. Lyrics are good, great melodies. More up-beat tempo. 4.5/5<br /> The Clairvoyant- The only problem with this one is that the music dosen't go with the lyrics. The lyrics are more dark and ominous, but the music stays light and and is bouncy, compared to the rest of the album. The only time the lyrics and music converge well is in the chorus.4/5<br /> Only The Good Die Young- As the title suggests, the lyrics are very true. Has a really cool beat, with great solos and an even better chorus. In fact, all of the songs on this album have great choruses! Great finish to a landmark album. 5/5<br /> This album is Maiden's most creative and moving piece of work yet, in my opinion. Please, if you don't already have it, JOIN IN THE MADNESS!
6304806426|2.0|The beautiful cinematography in this film is in sharp contrast to the violation of a basic principle of good story telling.  The characters are simply unlikable.  Asking an audience to feel empathy for the two lead characters or their situation stretches the bounds of verisimilitude to the breaking point.  By the end of the first fifteen minutes, you'll be praying for the two to be buried in a sandstorm.  They are insufferable.  The condolence hoped for the \\"heroine\\" left dying in some forgotten cave (she might still be out there!) is best reserved for anyone who successfully suffers through this disaster.
B000069AUI|5.0|The first four songs are amazing, especially &quot;Politik.&quot;  Coldplay reminds me a little of Radiohead's mellower moments, and R.E.M.'s softer accoustic albums, and also Manic Street Preachers.  I'd hesitate to call them Eternal Masters, but this CD does contain some beautiful moods and melodies, very little filler.  Evocative and lingering sounds...
B000067DNC|5.0|Okay, basic premise: we find an alien space portal that lets us dial up a gateway to travel to planets all around the galaxy. Once you're over that hump, it's pretty simple.  As Gene Roddenberry once commented, Star Trek was a western TV set in outer space.  The same can be said of Stargate SG-1.<br />This series does better than much of the Star Trek franchise in considering the ethics and morality of our decisions.  Plot lines raised in one episode may come back unexpectedly in others.  Kevin Dean Anderson manages to suffuse his character with less of a MacGyver - but more of the Joe Everyman quality that makes him appealing.  The writers clearly love writing their characters, and there are very few two-dimensional characters.  <br />Stargate may wind up as much a circus side show as Trekkers in the future.  But for now, this is an enjoyable romp with some hidden, if not too subtle, messages on morality and fairness.<br />Still, the series does feature a fair amount of violence and several series characters have been killed off, only to rise from the dead.  It's not a good choice for the small kids - but for us a big kids, this is definitely a great choice for late night and big bowl of popcorn.

0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi is an entrancing fable that links dazzling imagination to a magical realist story line. Pi, a 14 year old Indian boy in the process of transplantation to Canada with his family and a small scale menagerie fascinates even before his journey starts, through his hilarious attraction to multiple religions. Through this, Martel may be making the point that in the end, all religions are the same. Like much else in this novel, the writer's intention isn't entirely clear but his execution is so proficient, it doesn't much matter.<br />The climactic early event in the novel, much discussed in reviews and therefore not to be kept a secret from probable readers, is the shipwreck that lands Pi and some very unlikely companions in a lifeboat for a more than 200 day saga on the open ocean. How Pi survives this ordeal is, of course, the main theme of the novel. He is, by turns, inventive, cautious, defiant and, occasionally, dispirited (but not often).<br />It is to the writer's extraordinary credit that he is able to grip the reader while writing about a situation that, baldly explained, would seem absurd. Martel doesn't just make it credible, he makes it so engrossing that it is hard to put the book down. If at all possible, this book should be read at a sitting -- a transatlantic plane ride is ideal.<br />With the exception of the island sequence, where Pi and his remaining companion find land (or do they?) the novel works almost perfectly on multiple levels. Either as a straightforward story of survival, or as a complex allegory, or as a work of considerable humor, with an alternative storyline built in at the end that I, for one, hoped wasn't correct, this is a work of considerable power. There must be something about Canada that encourages expatriate authors -- Yann Martel is a keeper and his book is a well-written delight.
B00005JKPF|4.0|The defining characteristic of \\"X2: X-Men United\\" is the approval bestowed upon it by fans of the origin comic books; whereas the original \\"X-Men\\" movie was seen as truncated and flat in parts, the sequel delivers the goods fans craved: a full half-hour more action, and a dazzling opening sequence that features a mutant attack on the U.S. President. The mutant is a newcomer: Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) a German circus runaway with blue skin that can bounce off objects and teleport at alarming speeds. Director Bryan Singer watched his first \\"X-Men\\" effort start with the slow burn of introducing the setup and characters; \\"X2\\" had the \\"geeks\\" bouncing out of their seats.<br />What follows is a superhero movie on par with \\"Spider-Man\\" and the best parts of the \\"Superman\\" and \\"Batman\\" series. \\"X2\\" is a too busy and farfetched, but it keeps twisting, and it features a great villain in Col. Styker (Brian Cox) a military scientist bent on erasing the mutants from the Earth. In theme and approach, \\"X2\\" is similar to the second and best installment of the \\"Star Trek\\" series, \\"Wrath of Khan\\" -- \\"X2\\" features a large sacrifice from a major character, and serves as a launching pad for future installments. Just about anything could happen in \\"X3,\\" and that's a testament to how well this movie is structured. Every important mutant is still on the playing field. ... <br /> There aren't as many action sequences as you'd expect -- the canvas is so big, a good part of the movie is spent just leaving from and arriving to -- and none match the opening Nightcrawler attack, but there is enough for a fight junkie to appreciate. And though there's a bit of social commentary mixed into the movie's fabric, \\"X2\\" is nothing less than a fantasy. There's a climax, so to speak, beyond the climax, and then another climax beyond that, which is annoying, but it sets the table for a major transformation of Jean's character. Singer obviously has his options wide open for the third installment, which will presumably pit good and bad mutants against one another again. \\"X2\\" ends with Magneto having gained a precious new weapon for this round three. <br /> For what it does, \\"X2\\" does it very well. Singer is clearly serious about not letting the franchise descend into camp as \\"Batman\\" and \\"Superman\\" eventually did -- there are dumb moments, but they're quickly forgotten. It improves on the original and improves the chances of the series at the same time.
B00008H2LE|5.0|This album is incredible. Okay, it isn't Hybrid Theory but it's still amazing. Every song has great beats and well written lyrics. The songs are a little short but what they lack in length, they make up in quality. It's hard to pick a favorite song because they're all so good. I could go on and on about how great this album is, but I'll keep it short. This album isn't as good as Hybrid Theory but is still incredible for a sophmore album. The point I'm trying to make is IF YOU DON'T HAVE METEORA GO GET IT!!!

B0000931OG|5.0|Blur.  Not only one the greatest pop groups of the nineties, but perhaps ever.  \\"Modern Life is Rubbish\\", \\"Parklife\\", and \\"Great Escape\\" were all milestone pop albums, with Albarn narrating stories of British life and Coxon providing precise, chiming guitar work.  But something happened to Blur.  Their self-titled was an adventurous foray into a more sonic-focused direction.  They started to emphasize more on soundscapes, and  \\"13\\" proved this even more.  But \\"Think Tank\\" is Blur's new direction fully realized.  And it feels good.  Real good.  <BR>    Coxon's guitar work will be sorely missed, but Blur's new bass-and-drum focus is equally exciting.   \\"Ambulance\\" kicks things off with a locked-in groove, echoing the No-Wave funk groups of the early eighties like Liquid Liquid and ESG.  Similarly, the hidden track \\"Me, White Noise\\" (rewind on track one) has similar no-wave funk groove coupled with actor Phil Daniel's psychobabble.  The group's continuing focus on soundscapes is present, as their epic final track, \\"Battery in Your Leg\\",  uses atmospheric My Bloody Valentine-esque guitar work, while \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" recalls the electronic ambience of David Bowie's \\"Low\\".  Tracks like \\"Crazy Beat\\" and \\"We Got a File on You\\" prove that Blur have not completely abandoned their pop sensibilites, as they sound similar to something you would hear on their self-titled and \\"Parklife\\", respectively.  \\"Gene by Gene\\" combines old Blur with new, using unique, alien sounds to give new life to Blur's perfected pop formula.  With this new focus on more groove based, soundscape music, it's suprising that the best tracks on \\"Think Tank\\" are the personal, melodic ones.  \\"Good Song\\" is a simple in its instrumentation and premise yet is one of the most lasting tracks on the album.  \\"On the Way to the Club\\" is equally simple yet perhaps is the standout track, with Peter Gabriel-esque harmonies and warm synthesizers swelling to the point of blissful, gorgeous noise.  \\"Sweet Song\\" is heavenly in tone, with Albarn's voice and elegiac piano work providing it's beautiful backbone.  \\"Caravan\\" is a lo-fi masterpiece, with Albarn's distorted voice exposing him at his most personal on the album. Blur's Clash influence pops up with \\"Morrocan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club\\", a fun track that recalls \\"London Calling\\".  Free jazz even enters \\"Think Tank\\", with \\"Jets\\" coupling lo-fi production with free saxophone improvisation.<BR>    \\"Think Tank\\" is perhaps Blur's most mature work.  Albarn's work on \\"Mali Music\\" did Blur some good, as the world influences really give \\"Think Tank\\" color and character.  But with a greater focus on bass and drums and soundscapes, Blur are traveling down a new and foreign road that will, and already has, ravaged fans and critics universal acceptance of this ever-changing group.  The immediacy of Blur's previous pop masterpieces is definitely gone, but the mature, varied sound of \\"Think Tank\\" proves to the world that something more than Beatles-esque pop craftmanship is cooking in this  group's head.
B000006YYM|1.0|I was there dude! I love most prog rock, and back in 1975 I bought this record in its' original vinyl glory! I didn't like it then, but I kept it in my collection. And I've played the record occasionally through the years, trying to find something in it to like, but never have.  No melody, no hooks, the vocals are painfully awful and there is no instrumental virtuosity to make up for it.<br /><br />I think the band members (or their mothers) wrote the glowing reviews here.  Its a matter of taste, I prefer melody instead of dissonance.  This is an \\"okay\\" album, I'm giving it 1 star to balance the excess praise heaped on it by the other reviewers.
B00005JLR1|5.0|As a single mother, this movie really touches me.  It is the story of Jim Hawkins, a young man who desires to find himself amid the confusion that comes from watching his father leave and seeing his mother struggle to make ends meet.   Jim is a strong character filled with emotions that range from anger to understanding, disapointment to determination.  He has a passion for adventure, all the while hoping to accomplish something that will make his mother proud.  <br />In typical Disney fashion, the animation is stunning, the music is well done, and the story line remains strong through out the film.  The character of Morph, an adorible shape shifting pink blob, is especially creative adding humor and fun to the movie.  A Disney Classic for sure!!!

B00005JKPF|5.0|The X-Men are back, with 2003's first blockbuster X2 directed by Bryan Singer. What's more it is bigger (some $50million), better, darker, longer, more action-packed and generally more exciting, with a substantial increase in the sexual tension.<br />In this highly enjoyable sequel, the warring parties from the first instalment are forced into a partnership of necessity to battle against an army scientist, Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), who is determined to wipe all mutant life. To this end, in an excellent opening sequence, he coerces a teleporting mutant by the name of Nightcrawler into an attempt on the President's life with the purpose of turning both the public and the oval office against mutant kind.<br />All the favourite X-people from the first instalment including Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Storm (Halle Berry), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), Cyclops (James Marsden) and Famke Janssen (as Dr Jean Grey). In addition they are joined by three very noteable additions, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Pyro (Aaron Stamford) and Yuriko Oyama (Kelly Hu). Although Sabretooth and Toad are missing in action from the first movie they're not exactly missed (because lets face it they aren't the most exciting X-characters anyway)!<br />One of the things I most enjoyed about X2 is how much more there was than the first movie. More action, more humour, more X-Men (and X-children) a longer running time, and in particular, more Halle Berry, more Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Famke Janssen, looking even more glamorous, more alluring and displaying more X-powers (as Dr Jean Grey) than she did in the first movie.<br />That said, the film is still dominated by two actors; Brian Cox (one of Scotland's finest actors) who makes an excellent villain as Colonel Stryker and Australian actor Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. For it is their personal conflict and previous history that encapsulates the battle between good and evil that is at the heart of this sequel. However, they are ably supported by all the previously mentioned cast members and the addition of the excellent character Nightcrawler, played by another Scotsman, Alan Cumming.<br />Kudos must also go to scriptwriters Mike Dougherty and Dan Harris and Director Bryan Singer, who was much criticised for the lack of action in the opening movie of this very profitable franchise. Dougherty and Harris have injected some subtle humour mainly absent from X-Men and Singer (with help from Editors John Ottman & Elliot Graham) has done well to seamlessly cram it all into 130 minutes, whilst still managing to keep to his promise of a darker sequel. Although critics may argue that much of the intelligence and thought-provoking elements from the first movie are much diluted X2 is still one of the finest comic book movie to date and exactly what X-fans were looking for in a sequel. Not only does X2 pave the way for a summer of superheroes, with The Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk imminent, but it also sets us up for the inevitable X3, although this is going to be hard to top.n good and evil that is at the heart of this sequel.

B000002VCO|4.0|After \\"I Robot\\", 'Ammonia Avenue' is definitely their finest. Mind you, it's a close second. This is a very consistant and rewarding album, with so many great tracks that I can't really cite any specifics without pointing out another that is just as good, or better! Contrary to what another reviewer has said, \\"Don't Answer Me\\" is a great track. It has kind of a Roy Orbison thing going on with the music. If you ever get an oppurtunity to see the music video for this song, it is amazing. <br />\\"One Good Reason\\" is another great track. I love the way that the drums pan from left to right in the speakers, really takes advantage of the two-speaker spectrum, something that not many bands have really utilized. As opposed to most groups, AAP has used the studio as an instrument.<br />\\"Ammonia Avenue\\" the title track, is probably the highlight of the album. Eric Woolfson provides his usual wonderful and gentle voice to this ballad-ey mini epic. This is also probably one of the most musically complex tunes that AAP did, up until \\"Gaudi\\". In fact, i'd go as far to say that it's near-flawless, if not for the fact that it is so similar to the song \\"Silence and I\\" from the 'Eye in the Sky' album.<br />\\"Prime Time\\" is another great tune. I love the way that it builds up from the beginning. Not much else to say but that it is very satisfying. Also, \\"Pipeline\\" is a very fine instrumental, something that the band never really did much of, after their debut album. <br />I could go on, but I think you probably have a good idea of what it's all about. Musically, it's 80's pop, and the songs do have a dated sound, but I can't complain. Music belongs to the era it was made. Besides, AAP was and is much more sonically interesting than many bands that are around. This, however, was probably one of their last truly flawless-as-a-whole recordings. Regardless, it's a fine recording, and definetly one of those essential albums for any collection.
0393057658|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough. Not only is it the first look inside the most successful franchise - sure, there's the Yankees, but when historians look back, it will be Beane's A's that are remembered as the innovators. Even non-baseball fans will enjoy the crisp writing and phenomenal story-telling. Lewis' previous books are a high standard, but Moneyball may be even better. I'm still amazed that Beane allowed so much access - either Lewis is every bit as persuasive as Beane or Beane has something up his sleeve! The true star of the book may end up being Paul DePodesta, who will likely be the next great GM, following JP Ricciardi and Theo Epstein as \\"Beane Counters\\" and likely the men that saved baseball. I can't speak for the rest of Baseball Prospectus, but this has to be the best baseball book not written by us in the last decade.
B00003CXXP|5.0|When I first saw this in the theator I loved it. It was dark, deep, and cold. This somehow wasn't nominated for Best Picture and Cinematograhpy. Everything about this movie is great; the acting, direction, and cinematography. Spielberg really went out of his way in making this movie feel like Kubrick. For that I praise him. About the ending, I didn't like it when I first saw it, but i'm willing to watch the movie again to see if it changes my mind. Oh, and the &quot;aliens&quot; were robots.
0060977264|4.0|Maybe some of you who read before Coelho expect this book to be another fable. It is true, 'By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept' can be considered a fable, as well as a love story set in the present, having some similarities with 'The Alchemist'.<br />This is another journey (actually most of Coelho's books are journeys) to self dicovery and rediscovery of faith. Pilar, the main character, sets up for her journey to regain trust in God and fall in love again, no matter how much it may hurt.<br />However, nobody can deny the beauty of this book which is well worth reading, Coelho being here an artist at describing feelings, confusions, states of mind.<br />Full of deep meanings, warmth, joy and unexpected sorrow, the story is a celebration of the many possibilities life has to offer, and a fable about opening your heart to miracles.<br />It is also about searching for wisdom, in the French Pyrenees, and learning the wisdom inherent in loving. The `spiritual path can only be travelled through the daily experience of love', and that is why `sooner or later, we have to overcome our fears'. Pilar and her lover, make this journey together and finally get to understand its meaning. They are fictitious characters, `but they represent the many conflicts that beset us in our search for love'.<br />Coelho touches here upon another interesting point: the feminine face of God. We find out of God's feminine face, that all religions all over the world have a Goddess figure, a Virgin Mary, a Great Mother, though her presence, or importance, may seem to have been forgotten. And it is she who encourages us to love, for loving a partner, and marrying, is the only way of serving God. Coelho's parable reflects the interest and fascination with the feminine side of God. The other key to the story is expressed by the author in an introductory note: &quot;Spiritual experience is above all a practical experience of love. And with love, there are no rules.&quot;<br />I am sure this will be a very interesting and unforgettable experience for all of you who decide to read this book.be a very interesting and unforgettable experience for all of you who decide to read this book.
0439101352|5.0|It doesn't get better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a veryvehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf.
0156907399|5.0|if you do you'll miss out on an incredible and poetic book.  The genre of this book is stream of consciousness, which, when first reading, is very hard to focus on.  Basically, stream of consciousness is writing as if one is reading a person's thoughts.  Every thought, as disjointed as it may seem, is thrown in.  I found it very confusing in the beginning and wanted to throw the book against the wall.  I, however, ignored my inner feelings of frustration and kept reading.  To my surprise I fell in love with this book.  Woolf's analogies are not only beautifully exact and poetic, but in my opinion, pure genius.  Without ever being a mother herself, she captured a mothers fears, various feelings, and love for her children.  She also, quite eloquently and precisely, somehow manages to describe &quot;the dance&quot; known as marriage.  The ebbs and flows of relationships, the frailty of life....it's all in this amazing piece of literature.  Read it, don't give up on it, and you'll be glad you did.

0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi is an outstanding story: I think the greatest proof this is the wide variance in reviews here at Amazon.com.  Some people loved it, some people hated it, some people loved parts that other people hated and vice versa.  I personally loved it, but I think that some people are missing some of the main points of the story.  Just as Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea is not a simple adventure story about an old man catching and losing a fish, \\"Life of Pi\\" is not just a simple survival story about a boy and a tiger.  It's not about religion.  It's about spirituality and one's perspective on existence.<br />The book starts by fleshing out the character of Pi Patel and the impact that religion and spirituality (much to the confusion of the people around him) have on his life.  The reader is drawn in to Pi's world due to Yann's natural storytelling ability.  Chapter 21 is one of the key chapters to the story, where Yann/Pi first brings up the idea of the \\"better story.\\"  Chapter 22 is no less key, as Yann/Pi very briefly but powerfully discusses the very different interpretation of the \\"story\\" of life by an atheist and by an agnostic.<br />The middle of the story details Pi's shipwreck experience with a simple vividness that rivals Hemingway.  I was enthralled by this story as well, but others felt this part dragged on.  But the key is that, although it takes up the bulk of the text, Pi's adventure at sea is NOT the key to understanding this story.  Yes, it is a great example of physical and spiritual endurance, but it is not the true heart of this story.  The first clue is the fact that Yann/Pi tells us very early that Pi survives and there is a \\"happy ending.\\"  Why give this away unless Yann is trying to tell us that this is not the point of the story?  The true key to this story, which is not fully revealed until Chapter 99, is how you as the reader interpret this story.  Of the two stories that Pi tells to the Japanese investigators, which do YOU think is the \\"better story\\"? (this key term appears again here)<br />I would invite all of the people who did not enjoy this story or did not enjoy parts of it, to re-read the book with that question in mind.  This is a very personal story.  Life of Pi is an amazing tale of adventure, but an even more powerful agent of self-reflection.  If you haven't read it, go out and read it.  Life of Pi is an unforgettable ride.tter story\\"?

B000002JKA|5.0|This is the CD that got me hooked on modern progressive music. Not only do the tracks included on this CD offer a range of styles, from shred to blues to jam, but the lyrics on songs such as &quot;Voices&quot; show that DT can get away from the cliches they have been known to use (as every other band has from time to time).<br />The disc closer, &quot;Space Dye-Vest&quot; is perhaps the only weak spot, yet it is instantly recognizable as Kevin Moore's take on dealing with his personal challenges.<br />&quot;Lie&quot; and &quot;The Mirror&quot;, with their hardcore crunch and altered time signatures showcase Dream Theater at their best, and are perhaps the most accessible songs on this work. Why this disc never got much airplay is beyond me. The songs aren't long as on their newer releases, and the works that do tie together have enough quality to stand on their own.<br />My favorite DT album of all time.

The plot, even though thought there really is no plot, is infact the specific views that Vonnegut has about many things in life ranging from war to as far as love. While some of the topics that Vonnegut discusses have some importance, most of them are not really important at all.<BR>Throughout the book, Vonnegut shares his views on America with the reader. The theme of the book can arguably be how Vonnegut is dissatisfied with the different kind of things that people in America will do. There is a quote that expresses these views. He talks about the not-so-famous becoming famous, \\"Sometimes people would put holes in famous people so they could be at least fairly famous, too\\" (50). The quote shows just how fed up he is with the rest of civilization. Even though he is disgusted with majority of the problems, he talks about them and makes what is wrong in his mind, funny to others.<BR>In my opinion, this book is a must read. I don't like reading at all, and I actually liked this book. I liked it in particular for the humor aspect of it, the way he talks about things, and even adds his own little clip-art for things every now and then. The drawings are hand drawn, funny pictures, showing just exactly his views on the certain topic. Overall the book was a great choice for an independent reading project. If you have yet read Breakfast of Champions, and are looking for a good book to read, this should be on the top of your list.
0192833553|5.0|Meet the Bennet sisters: demure Jane, witty Elizabeth, bookish Mary, impressionable Kitty, and lusty Lydia.  It's the usual story: they don't have much in the way of dowries but need to marry upstanding English gentlemen...<br />Elizabeth Bennet quickly emerges as the heroine with her wry sense of humor and take-no-prisoners attitude to social life.  She puts all twentieth century heroines to shame when she tells off Mr. Darcy (while maintaining perfect decorum).  Unusual twists and turns spark up the &quot;marriage plot&quot; of the book.  There are some great villains, too.
0060207051|5.0|I'm not sure why exactly, but since my son was about six months old, Goodnight Moon is the only book that he has shown any interest in.  I've tried other books, including a ton of inherited Dr. Seuss books, however he won't sit still for any of them except Goodnight Moon.  It's amazing to witness how immediately happy and calm he becomes once he sees this book.  <br />True, it can be very boring for parents to read over and over, but the important thing is that my son loves it, so I'll gladly reread it if it makes him happy.  As soon as my son sees the book, he snuggles in my lap and waits for me to start.  And for that, I gladly give this book five stars.
0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller's novel \\"Catch-22\\" takes place during war.  American twentieth century literature that shares with its readers the truthful anecdotes of people's lives in the war.  I think that was the best part of the book was the humor and irony.  The book brought life in a time of death and war.  Even in the seriousness of war, this book manages to poke fun at the craziness of people's lives.  It showed how the people that we consider great war heroes are not always as they seem.<br />Here are these great war heroes doing various missions, trying to claim insanity so that they do not have to fly.  If it was not for the idea of catch-22, they would all have been landed.  Not to mention how many times Yossarian lied he was sick to go back into the hospital.  Then there is the great leader Cathcart who freely volunteers his men for missions all the time.  There is also the fact that the war heroes of this book are so flawed in their own character.  Or when we think of war heroes, we do not think of the trauma people go through in war.  Yossarian did not wear his clothes for the longest time bcause he could not handle the blood that was shed on his friends clothes that died during flihgt.<br />Another thing that stood out was the format of the book.  Every chapter seemed to have a new character with a new and exciting story.  \\"Catch-22\\" really jumped around a lot.  Even though it could be a little bit confusing at times, the book still managed to make sense and get its point across  It was nice to read to the end and see how everything had come together.  Joseph Heller really managed to make every section of the book connect and smooth over in the end.
B00005JL96|5.0|There are very few movies on which I am actually willing to spend money, and before this movie, I could easily have crossed Disney off the list without a thought.  &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; is a wonderful story in which the main conflict has very little to do with the climactic battle/chase scene (which all kids movies seem to require these days), but rather with the definition and the bonds of family.  It's nice to have a family movie with redemption and warm fuzzies without a mother, a father and two point three kids at the end so you know everything is OK.  To misquote the movie: &quot;This is my family.  It may be a little broken...&quot;  <br />Additionally, the art is phenomenal.  Finally, a movie in which the women do not resemble Barbie Dolls or super-skeletons... er supermodels.<br />Of course, my favorite line from the movie turns out to be in the deleted scenes section.  &quot;I'm worth twenty rabbits?&quot;  :-)  A movie that can bring tears to my eyes even on the third viewing is a rare gem.  I consider this movie to be the same calibur as &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Casablanca,&quot; although not neccessarily for the same audience.
0060537639|2.0|It has long been known that the Chinese had large ocean-going fleets in the early 1400s and used them in the eastern Pacific and Indian oceans.  Gavin Menzies proposes that in 1421 these fleets were sent out to explore the entire world.  His thesis is that the Chinese solved the problem of determining longitude and went on to map most of the worlds land masses.  It is an interesting idea, and there is strong evidence that Chinese fleets reached southeast Africa, and perhaps even western Africa,during this period.  The author weaves a speculative web showing how the Chinese could have crossed the Atlantic and Pacific, explored and colonized North and South America, and even sailed the Northeast Passage over the top of Russia in the early 1400s.  Unfortunately he is not able to offer any proof that this happened.  Most of his evidence is circumstantial and much of it is little more than statements that the early European navigators could not have navigated unknown waters without Chinese charts.<br />     Menzies' hypothesis is plausible, even though he is not able to present a convincing case.  The Chinese did have fleets capable of travelling long distances, and there was brief period of interest in expanding China's influence in the early 1400s.  It is possible that Chines ships did reach Australia and eastern South America looking for new trade opportunities in 1421.  However, the author stretches credibility when he claims that the only land mass that the Chinese did not visit was western Europe.  Why would the one area of the world where China knew that there was potential trade be overlooked?  Also, the author's claim that a Chinese fleet crossed the Arctic Ocean by going over northern Siberia is so far-fetched as to make me question all his other chains of reasoning.  The Northeast Passage is a difficult trip even for modern icebreakers.  The idea that a fleet of 15th century Chines junks could do it is absurd.<br />     Overall this book is worth looking at because it raises the interesting question of how much of the world China interacted with in the early 1400s.  However, an answer to that question will need serious scholarship, not the wishful thinking that Gavin Menzies exhibits in &quot;1421&quot;.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I really love this movie.  It is something entirely different than most of the movies being made today.  The story is quite captivating, and the actors do a very good job.
B00005JKZV|5.0|...When you look at the history of hollywood and consider all major studio movies that were adapted from books, changes have always been made. Even with such movies as Gone With the Wind and The Grapes of Wrath ...Changes are sometimes necessary for the following reasons:<br />1. Budget constraints. This is already one of the most expensive movies ever made, you have to expect that the studio would like to earn some money from it.<br />2. Attention span of the average moviegoer. The movie is already quite lengthy for the average moviegoer, any longer and vivarin would be required with every ticket purchased. Today's children are not going to wait for intermissions (not spelled with an E). <br />3. An adaption is exactly as it sounds. The director adapts the movie using \\"his creative direction\\" as what would be best for the flow of the movie. Tolkkien did not have a movie in mind when he wrote these books.<br />This was one of the BEST movies of the 21st century to date (2000 - 2003) plain and simple, and the critics agree. If you are looking for an exact replica of the book, read the book. If you looking for a great movie with plenty of action and great story line, watch this movie!
B00004YW6I|5.0|I bought this cd used without ever really hearing miss polly jean before and now I'm addicted to her voice. She just can wail with the best of them and the song with Thom Yorke from Radiohead sends shivers down my spine every time I listen to it. This is a must own for any music fan.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The genius that Eminem possess is the ability to [make you mad]and then make you happy again.  This album is the best example of this ability.  He is saying things that no other rapper ever dared to say. (But now all rappers are coming out and saying things that are shocking and claim they have always pushed the envelope) Eminem will always be regarded as a lyrical poet who put much emotion into his songs.  Now all the haters out there will say that Eminem [stinks] and he is just saying things to get attention.  This is true which makes him a lot richer than the rest of us.  Therein lies the genius.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I must first of all state that I love this show.  I truly do. I was hooked after only one episode.  It is so very addictive.  I have season 1,2, and 3 and I am impatiently awaiting season 4.  It is interesting to go back and look at how things started on the show.  I love the Carrie-Mr.Big episodes.  I love Mr. Big though.  Every one of these actresses bring something lovable and wonderful to this show with their characters.  Charlotte brings old-fashioned values such as marriage and children and loyalty.  Samantha, of course, is very sexual and all that, but she is a wonderful friend.  She is ambitious and in some episodes, we have witnessed little pieces of her persona that are romantic and vulnerable.  Miranda appears to be \\"tough as nails\\" most of the time, but she too falls victim to the same insecurities and problems all women have such as being single and lonely, etc...Carrie is the girl who brings them all together.  She wants love-that one true love who makes your knees weak, but the one she loves (Big)is unattainable or so it seems...The cast is wonderful.  The writing is amazing. You must watch this show and give it a chance.  You will not be disappointed.
B00006LSM3|4.0|I was born the year John Lennon was murdered, so I can't imagine how people felt when that happened.  But the Beatles' music is truly immortal, and it's certainly hard to believe that eventually one of them will pass on. When George Harrison died a year and a half ago from cancer, I truly felt like a close friend had passed away; not just because he was my favorite Beatle, but that like John, George was about to get back to making music again after a long hiatus. Too bad the fates weren't really on their side. But George certainly had plans to keep amazing us with music, as BRAINWASHED proves.<br /><br />A considerable amount of people have complained that George would have hated how his final album turned out, but one should be reminded that George's son Dhani was given specific instructions by his father on how the album should sound. By all accounts, he followed through, and this is probably how George would have approved had he lived. Granted, it's not a perfect piece of work, but on the best moments of BRAINWASHED, George came close to outdoing his fellow former Beatle Paul McCartney by still creating strong music as they reach the big 6-0.<br /><br />\\"Any Road\\" has been given the most favorable reviews, and for good reason because it is truly one of George's finest songs, especially from someone who's always had to take third place behind Lennon & McCartney (often unfairly). The song had been written years before & I believe was played by George on VH-1 when he was promoting the new Ravi Shankar album he had produced. George had not released any new music in years, and I'm sure had people wondering when, or if, a new album from him was coming along. \\"Any Road\\" was a good way to preface what became BRAINWASHED, and it's the kind of encouraging, upbeat number that always made George my favorite Beatle: even with the harsh, cruel world, he kept a forward-thinking attitude.<br /><br />\\"Pisces Fish\\", \\"Looking For My Life\\", \\"Rising Sun\\" & \\"Rocking Chair In Hawaii\\" are other serene pieces of uptempo country rock-tinged pop that truly make you feel good, even if George perhaps knew his time on Earth was limited. Jeff Lynne's polished, high-gloss approach to production has often been criticized (most prominently on his work with Tom Petty), but he seems to find a good balance on these songs, making them seem like a logical extension of 1987's CLOUD NINE (George's previous studio album, also produced by Lynne).<br /><br />Like his classic 1973 album LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, George had an equal amount of cynicism along with the good vibes, and BRAINWASHED is no different. Maybe it's old age talking, but George does indeed have some bones to pick on songs like \\"P2 Vatican Blues [Last Saturday Night]\\" and the title track. The first song is a little bit of an afterthought & kind of shocking coming from someone as deeply religious as George, but the latter is the sore thumb of the album, being a little too mean-spirited to truly appreciate. It's great to see someone else who believes the media controls how we live, but at least be a little more objective.<br /><br />Other songs have a feeling of George perhaps accepting his impending death, but not to the point where you need to dissect them to find hidden meanings. \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\", \\"Run So Far\\" (originally recorded by Eric Clapton), \\"Never Get Over You\\" & an old standard \\"Between The Devil & The Deep Blue Sea\\" are George's way of saying \\"I'm ready to leave this world for a better place\\". The best thing a listener could possibly say is \\"Godspeed, George\\". Even the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\" is just heavenly, and hopefully George will be making this kind of music up there.<br /><br />It took me a while to listen to this album for two reasons. One was that I'm a compulsive buyer & have literally a hundred or so CDs to listen to yet; the other is that I was afraid of getting emotional upon hearing what truly is the last music George Harrison will ever give us. While your heartwill no doubt get heavy listening to BRAINWASHED, it's comforting to know that George was maybe planning to return to music full-time and could have given us his best had he not passed. The music will not leave you brainwashed; in fact it the only thing to be washed & cleansed by it will be your soul.<br /><br />Rest in peace, George. Say hello to John for us.will no doubt get heavy listening to BRAINWASHED, it's comforting to know that George was maybe planning to return to music full-time and could have given us his best had he not passed.

B000003N7G|2.0|I like this title, but I do not understand why people is so excited about it. I mean, for the sixties it was really a breakthrough, I guess. But now there are many sax players that can play better than Coltrane, they are much polished and straight. I think about Kenny G., for instance. His rythmic session is much more regular, whereas Coltrane's session seems sometimes to loose the beat. And also Coltrane is not really precise... But the title is interesting at least as an historical recording, a first step towards the perfection of todays players.
B00005JKNF|3.0|Clive Owens playes \\"Robert Parks\\". Maggie Smith plays \\"Constance Trentham\\".  Maggie Smith is an actress I adore.  I loved her in CALIFORNIA SUITE (1978).  Bob Balaban plays \\"Morris Weissman\\".  I haven't seen him act since CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977).  Ryan Phillippe plays \\"Henry Denton\\"...  Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Alan Bates are also in the cast.  This film is alot of English...pip,pip,cherrio stuff until someone is murdered.  You might want to turn on the English subtitles (for the hearing-impaired) so you can catch a lot of dialouge when the scenes are too noisy or too thick of accent.  In the Special Features, 19 deleted scenes with the option of Dircetor's Commentary, Cast and Filmmaker Filmographies, a nearly 20-minute featurette of \\"The Making Of Gosford Park\\", Theatrical Trailer, an 8-minute featurette on \\"The Authenticity of Gosford Park\\" and Cast and Filmmakers Question & Answer session.  You may choose Director's Commentary with Robert Altman or the Screenwriter's Commentary.  Spanish subtitles available too.
B0000584V3|5.0|Well, to begin... Opeth is the greatest band i have ever heard.  They blend together the elements of Doom Metal, Black Metal, and Progressive Metal to create a sound that no one has seemed to harness except them.  And secondly, Blackwater Park is their best album, so its only logical.  This has the greatest feel that an album could possibly have.  They basically take you off of your feet and put you in the scenario they want just by the feeling of the music.  This is a must-own for every metal musician.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack's mellow &amp; uncomplicated music feels good to the ears but the issues raised in the lyrics really make you think about life &amp; our times in a tragic, romantic, melancholy way - Jack combines all this for the listeners without ever making you feel stressed or jaded out - I loved Brushfire but this is definitely a lot tighter &amp; it sounds a bit more SEAsoned... He's definitely the man, now if only the world could produce more talents like him maybe our civilization would be able to carry &quot;on &amp; on&quot;.....
B000089RVX|5.0|I must say, this album is surprisingly amazing!  I usually don't much care for new bands, but after hearing them on the Daredevil soundtrack, it struck my interest and I decided to check them out and bought Fallen.  Much to my surprise, the album was just beyond words.  Amy Lee has an amazing voice that sounds angelic and just works perfect this genre of music (kind of a life and death, heaven and earth feel gothic, vampiric sound) and it's just a perfect blend and combination.  It's one of those, \\"you can't go wrong and you won't regret it\\" CDs to own.
B000002UAC|5.0|This album is the best of the early Beatles albums. They were the greatest rock band of all time. They were the first band to take rock and fill it with the style of playing/singing/writing that classic rock of the latter 60's-'80s was all about. They were the first band to not compete for one hit wonder status, but to have a stable, everlasting fanbase. They started the &quot;classic rock&quot; era of the 60's through the 80's. Better then Led Zeppelin, better then The Eagles, The Beatles will always be the best. I don't understand why their early stuff is played on &quot;oldies&quot; stations, instead of &quot;classic rock&quot; channels. This is a superb album. They did have covers on their early albums, but they are normally the best version of those songs.
1573226521|4.0|I first picked up \\"The Beach\\" during the brief moment in my life when I briefly indulged my escapist fantasies.  It was winter in New York and I was studying for the bar exam, so that was when the backpacking idea hit me.  Never mind that I'd never spent so much as a single night of my life sleeping outdoors, and I'd never been to Asia.  The idea just seemed really neat.  So I got myself a movie-tie-in edition of \\"The Beach\\" (with Leo DiCaprio on the cover, but at least I had a temporary insanity defense) the Saturday before the exam, and wasted most of my remaining study time reading the book instead of my test prep.<br />I was very impressed with Alex Garland's writing style at the time.  His British backpacker Richard is distant and sardonic.  He doesn't get any romance in the book, although he starts receiving all-too-corporeal visitations from a dead man he hardly knows, and quite possibly sets a record for most drugs consumed in one novel.  The pop culture references fly fast and furious, and even in a world where pop culture \\"generations\\" pass every two to three years, the 1996 of \\"The Beach\\" -- and its protagonist born in '74, a year after me -- still seems famliar one.<br />Obviously, \\"The Beach\\" presents no paradise.  Richard risks his life three times just to get there, and quickly discovers several dark secrets at the heart of his island idyll.  The other commune dwellers are also backpackers -- vague, non-demoninational left-wing travellers, running away not so much from the world as from middle-class tourists.  Soon, some members of the by-invitation-only community are dead, others have food poisoning, and the batteries are dead in the island's one GameBoy.  Richard is banished to the island's cliffs, where he loses his mind and witnesses a moment of unspeakable horror.  Things do turn out all right for the 4 or 5 characters we actually care about, and Garland pulls no punches in the end.<br />My backpacker fantasy ended 2 weeks after it started, and remained unfulfilled.  This book certainly didn't help prolong it, mostly 'cause Garland never provided a satisfactory answer as to what backpackers use in lieu of toilet paper.  I wasn't quite as enthralled after a second reading, with the surprise factor gone.  I still recommend this book as superior to the movie, which curiously eliminates one of the book's more interesting characters (Jed) and alters two very creepy moments at the end to something less than scary.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm usually the type of person who like pop music for the dancing. I'm not into a lot of heavy bands with loud drums, etc. When I first heard Bring Me to Life I was hooked. The whole entire CD is amazing and I'm definately waiting for new or old music from them. Her voice is so incredible and then with the sound of a bad with her voice just gives me chills it is so great. How someone ever came up with such a great combination surprises me I would never imagine a group this great. If you've even looked at the CD I know you are thinking about purchasing it, just do it.
0792839730|5.0|A Bridge Too Far<br />In 1962, Darryl Zanuck and 20th Century Fox released The Longest Day, a three hour recreation of the Normandy invasion on June 6, 1944.  With a screenplay by Cornelius Ryan (author of the book on which the film is based) and boasting an all-star cast from four different countries, The Longest Day was one of the first of several major film reenactments of major battles of World War II to be released over the next decade or so.<br />Whenever a successful movie of any genre starts a trend (witness, for instance, the variations of quality in science fiction films released after Star Wars premiered in 1977), the results range from good (1970's Tora! Tora! Tora!) to fair (The Battle of Britain, released a year earlier) to bad (1965's Battle of the Bulge) to ridiculously awful (1976's Midway).  The basic format first presented by The Longest Day and carried on to A Bridge Too Far is:<br />1. Choose a major battle of World War II, i.e. Pearl Harbor, the Ardennes, etc.<br />2. Cast sure-fire A- or B-list actors (Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Sean Connery, etc.)<br />3. Make a reasonably accurate movie about the battle.<br />Now, The Longest Day, for all its flaws (and it does have them) is still a good movie and it was a big hit in 1962-3, so it was only natural that Joseph E. Levine would want to bring Cornelius Ryan's best-selling account of Operation Market-Garden to the silver screen.  In some ways, because Ryan's three major books on World War II dealt with some of the same personalities (Eisenhower, Montgomery, Hitler, even PFC Arthur \\"Dutch\\" Schultz), they are a trilogy (the third book is The Last Battle, about the fall of Berlin in 1945).  Thus A Bridge Too Far is a sequel to The Longest Day.<br />Set in September 1944, Richard Attenborough's film depicts the failed attempt by the Western Allies to vault over the Rhine River in a daring combined arms assault on a series of bridges in German-occupied Holland.  Market, the airborne half of the operation, involved 35,000 British and American paratroopers and the largest air armada ever, while Garden, the ground phase, was a supposedly speedy drive up a single highway by a British armored corps, the 30th.  Initially successful, Market-Garden failed because of several factors, including overconfidence approaching arrogance on the part of the Allied High Command, a skillful German defense, and sheer bad luck.<br />As a film, A Bridge Too Far is just as good as The Longest Day.  The screenplay by William Goldman, cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth (who died a year later after completing Richard Donner's Superman: The Movie), musical score by the late John Addison, and Attenborough's firm directing make this film a truly spectacular account of a historic event.  The international cast is stellar: here you'll see major stars of the 1970s, such as Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Elliot Gould, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins (later of Hannibal Lecter fame), Hardy Kruger, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, Maximilian Schell, and Liv Ullman (and these are only the major cast members, mind!).<br />For all that, though, A Bridge Too Far was not a major success. It got good reviews (Judith Crist, a major film critic of the time, called it one of the most accurate World War II movies she had seen), but it was released at a time when movie audiences were shying away from war movies.  Saigon had fallen only two years before, and the public was still in its anti-military, anti-war post-Vietnam mindset.  Furthermore, while its combat footage is tame by Saving Private Ryan standards and its message underscores the futility of war, A Bridge Too Far is a movie about an Allied defeat ( although the same could possibly be argued about Tora! Tora! Tora!), and this, too, kept audiences away in droves.<br />But the biggest reason for A Bridge Too Far's death at the box office was its biggest competitor for viewers in that summer of 1977: GeorgeLucas' Star Wars.<br />The DVD, by MGM, boasts very few extras (only the theatrical trailer and a little booklet of behind-the-scenes factoids), but the movie is presented on wide-screen format and the subtitles are spelled correctly. (In the full-screen VHS version the subtitles contain misspellings: in one scene a German officer refers to Patton as \\"Patten\\".  Also, in  the theatrical release, Attenborough often had to identify places with titles [as the battle took place on a considerable slice of Holland]; these were deleted on the full-screen VHS version but restored on the DVD.)cas' Star Wars.<br />The DVD, by MGM, boasts very few extras (only the theatrical trailer and a little booklet of behind-the-scenes factoids), but the movie is presented on wide-screen format and the subtitles are spelled correctly.

0345440900|5.0|If you love your baby and you want to have some sanity in your life, read this book.<br />My baby is a classic easy baby, but when my baby and I came down with a cold in his third month, things got desperate and I practiced what the author calls 'accidental parenting' which is to say that I wasn't responding properly to his needs when my little boy awoke in the middle of the night. I was exhausted and my baby who had been sleeping 6-7 hours straight began waking up to nurse every 3-4 hours. Why? Because I was feeding him every time he awoke, so I could quickly get back to bed. With the advice from this book I began to get up, listen to his cries, determine whether he was actually hungry and if not, comfort him and calm him to get him back to sleep. The first night of this was terrible--he awoke every 20 minutes, all night, I fed him once. The next night he was nearly back to normal. By the third night I had my little angel back, sleeping peacefully through the whole night. <br />The author provides a nice middle ground between strict scheduling and complete on-demand feedings. She provides encouragement to new parents and she tries to educate parents in how to really respond to their child's true needs, whether they be for food, comfort or a decrease in stimulation. <br />Of course you needn't follow every word of advice to the 't.' As with any baby book you must apply some common sense and figure out what works for you. <br />If you'd like to have some sanity in your babycare, read this book.
1582432678|5.0|Shriver's brilliant novel explores the depth of a couple's journey into parenthood through letters written by Eva Khatchadourian to her husband.  Such a limited form could prove tiresome in lesser hands, but Shriver excells by giving life to Eva in uncompromisingly full dimension, revealing her faults and virtues in full measure. <BR>While the themes of reluctant motherhood and high school mass murder and their possible relationship are central to the plot and handled masterfully, the author has a rare gift of understanding of the inner self that literally puts the reader inside Eva's mind.<BR>This level of insight extends to illuminate the dark side in the person of Eva's son Kevin while at the same time offering no easy explanation of what may have contributed decisively to the creation of his utterly evil persona. <BR>There are many layers in Shriver's writing and each sentence is packed tightly with content and resonant truth.  So compelling are the moment to moment revelations that one is temporarily suspended from the story. But when things really heat up in the last third of the book it becomes impossible to put it down.<BR>One of the finest writers I've come across.
B000000WCA|5.0|Cleaning out my CD's one day I uncovered the album of my middle school days, Spice Girls Spice and Spiceworld. When putting in my CD player I was overcome with those old school memories and wondered, \\"Why can't I go back?\\" Spice Girls was one of the most popular things during 1996-1998, when music at that time was on an all time low (umm...can you say Hanson?) and most of the popular artist (like Boyz II Men and All 4 One) were cooling down. Spice Girls were the remedy for this. Now that I listen to this CD older and wiser in my knowledge of music I can say that this is not a bad album. It had it's ever so catchy mega, super-duper hit, \\"Wannabe\\" which is still fresh and the hip-hop flavored \\"Last Time Lover\\" the album covered loads of genres and the girls had talented voices but I guess the fact they dressed as a \\"character\\" turned everyone off but not me and my friends, who even went as far as dressing up like them, every day and especially Halloween, and proclaiming that we had \\"Girl Power!\\" (I swear I thought I was Mel. B!) \\"Say You'll Be There\\" (my fave track) is upbeat and sassy while \\"2 Become 1\\" is sultry (my 3rd fave track)while \\"Last Time Lover\\" is sharp as \\"Who Do You Think You Are?\\" is witty and disco flavored. \\"If U Can't Dance\\" is gritty and raw and my 2nd fave track (I just love the line \\"Never is a Keanu but a dweeb looking at me\\"! Creative!)while \\"Somethin' Kinda Funny\\" has a jazzy, laid back feel to it. They have a place in my heart nonetheless [...]because the girls were talented and had an awesome debut record and they helped me and my friends grow up. All in all Spice Girls will always be remembered not just for there outfits but for their music as well.
068485743X|5.0|As an aspiring writer, I took a writing course and read many books about writing. Noah Lukeman's The First Five Pages tackles problems not evident and gives solutions. I found it a big help, although some of the bad exemples are too simplistic. It is difficult to believe that any aspiring writer would write so badly. Analyzed exemples from great writers make a bigger impact on &quot;how to&quot;. I would like to see more of those as corrective solutions.
0783229526|4.0|This movie is not for the faint of mind.  It is from start to finish a whirlwind of drug-frenzies, immorality, and illegal activity in the city that makes these things a virtue.  The outstanding camera work, special effects, and directing make Fear and Loathing a wonderful journey into the mind of Rauol Duke (Thompson) and his sidekick Dr. Gonzo.  The superb acting done by Johnny Depp, one of the best actors of our time, helps to create a character that is easily understood in his complexity but not so one-dimensional that he detracts from the film's overall narrative flow.  I would say that this movie is not for the majority of mainstream movie audiences, but is more targeted towards audiences that have open minds and imagination to spare.

0807205567|5.0|Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen, a name which denotes a title (a hereditary title charged with the fullfillment of a task) -  The Abhorsen is a necromancer. In other words, the Abhorsen can bring back the newly dead, and also send those undead farther away to the final gate of death. Sabriel must try to find and save her father, who has sent his necromancers' tools of the trade (bells and sword) to Sabriel at her school in the New World. Sabriel travels to the Old World to find her father and encounters many pitfalls on the way.<br />This audio book is an excellent example of how the right narrator/reader can enhance a book. Tim Curry is a very masterful storyteller. His voices are varied and he does not falter when switching back and forth between characters. It does not matter whether Mr. Curry is in female character or male character. With his talents either sex are believeable. I can still hear his voice in my mind! Mr. Curry makes Sabriel real and transports the reader to this amazing world.
B00008S2VG|5.0|As with most media reviews of Madonna's cds, they speak about everything else but the music.  I will do the same, but in her defense.  As a previous reviewer noted, the media for some reason is having a hate on Madonna field day.  Unfortunately, the music gets pushed to the background.  As a two decade fan, I can honestly say that 'American Life' ranks with her finest work and can't understand the bashing along with radio not playing the first single and the lukewarm two-week sales of the album.<br />But since sales and merit are two different creatures, once again Madonna takes risk in her music while her peers continue to play it safe.  This cd contains at least two songs(Nothing Fails &amp; Hollywood) that can be added to her list of amazing songs.  Hopefully, radio won't ignore them as singles.<br />I don't feel it's necessary to really &quot;review&quot; an album that has over 400 previous opinions, but I wanted to add my voice in defense of her music and career.  True fans understand...and we can't wait for the box set at the end of the year.
B000005JA8|1.0|this guy is completely insane, and not in a good way that suggests artistic genius ala thom yorke or something. my friend once told me that he locked people up at a commune and forced them to learn to play instruments for this guy, and that he frequently abused them in the endeavors to record his music. morbidly curious, i checked it out and the torture certainly comes through in the music
B00008NG5V|4.0|Jack Johnson has managed to better his debut effort, Brushfire Fairytales.  The reason he is so successful on this album is because he stays true to who he is as a person as well as who he is as a songwriter and musician.  His love of the Hawaiian beach scene and laid back reflection of love makes for an album full on contemplation, and short on gimmick.  Simple acoustic guitar. Mellow soothing voice.  Delivered with a constant postiive outlook.  The music of Jack Johnson, and more specifically, On and On, is music that you can listen to on any occasion.  Even better, it's music that you can listen to and feel better about the world around you.
B0000931OL|4.0|I have already written about the record, I still like it overall and I think the high points far outway the low ones. For a Blur fan, it's ace.<br />This is basically a review of the limited edition packaging. Which if you haven't figured it out by now, isn't all that great. <br />It comes as a 6x6 red cloth bound book with Think Tank and a very small printing of the divers art on the front, in gold. Inside there are just pages of lyrics. No Photos, no great Banksy art, no design at all really. I liken it to the Kid A limited edition which, in my opinion, wasn't as good as the regular version either. Both regular versions (Kid A and Think Tank) have a ton more art work, bigger, brighter, and cheaper. I expected a lot more out of Think Tank's packaging, esp. with Banksy on board doing his great stencil art. I instead got a \\"rushed job\\" that was a bit more expensive. Hey, at least the music is still good.<br />So just a little FYI, in case you can't make up your mind about going for this edition of Think Tank, hope this helped.
B000005DQR|5.0|Simply put, this is one of those hypothetical deserted island albums.  With all the music that fights and pushes for space inside your brain, the haunting melodies and definitive breakbeats from Endtroducing will often emerge the champion.  Even to the neophyte listener, this album has both the sound of something familiar and comfortable and yet also paradoxically something foreign and disturbing.  I don't think it is hyperbole to say that Shadow, by infusing hip-hop with a distinctive and beautiful voice, has simulanteously created a music that is both light years ahead of its time and an old school throwback love letter to the deep-seated origins of hip-hop: Endtroducing is both the genesis and the end of days.  Those who have heard it know what I'm talking about.  Those who haven't need to hear it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna &quot;the diva&quot; has added another classic to her line. The album as a whole is very good but some songs are very very catchy. American Life definitely grows on you, I'm so stupid provokes you, and love profusion certainly takes you away. She's amazing as usual. This album will give you the good vibes, the positive energy you seek. And most importantly make you think too... Way to go Madonna!
B000002LVB|5.0|Words and terms I often use to describe how I feel about music these days are usually these: bland, uninspired, derivative, empty, unfeeling and homogenically subversive to the point of unironic conformity.  Compounding these problems facing the creation of rock are the two antitheses of musical theory (those filled with eltitist highbrows, who in looking down from ivory towers may even be more concerned with genres and buzzwords than songs) and musical practice (those who, in a libertarian manner, provide only the bare amount of sustenance for a musical appetite to be satiated, leaving listeners who are inquisitive for more than what they are simply given behind).  This exclusionary attitude portrays rock as either an imagistic, crystallized art or a simple, sentimental way to enjoy oneself, but very rarely is rock seen as both these things.  Add into this mix an amblivolous television media concerned with only rock's periphery and rarely rock music ITSELF, I am finding it harder and harder to believe that the supposed juggernaut that pretends it is rock, that social instigater, the residency of poets and dreamers and the unifier of peoples can maintain its dwindling relevancy.  Basically, rock music sounds like it is becoming scared.  In this environment, the modern listener is invariably jaded and alienated to the point of cliche (under which I probably fall).  Whenever I feel like this, that rock is an anarchic musical fossil devoid of any gifts to offer, I listen to &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;.  With the very first angelic chimes leading into Lou Reed's cocky strut to the final hallowed refrain, all of rock's putrid crass commercial sins are absolved, its dogmas destroyed, its alienating walls crumble and rock and roll, encapsulated in four beautiful, transecendent, perfect minutes, is fully redeemed.  And for that I will always be grateful.  That is what Loaded means to me.
B0000011P7|2.0|Considering that Tulls from \\"Stand Up\\" through \\"Passion Play\\" were great (and I'd always been fond of \\"This Was\\" as well), and that every Tull after \\"Passion Play\\" was fairly dismal--yet Ian Anderson was undeniably talented--, I'd long hoped Mr. Anderson would disband Jethro Tull and put his talent to use. Thus I happily snapped up \\"Walk Into Light\\", his first solo album. <br />Alas, too little, too late. Mr. Anderson didn't seem really to exert himself here, and Jethro Tull didn't disband after all. <br />Certainly \\"Walk Into Light\\" is significantly better than pretty much the entire post-Passion Play catalog, but it suffers from many of the same problems. As on \\"Heavy Horses\\", the vocal lines--I'm not going to call them \\"melodies\\"--are mostly reiterations of a single pitch, literally monotonous. As on \\"Heavy Horses\\" (the album that knocked Jethro Tull off the top-ten charts permanently), Mr. Anderson doesn't so much sing as rasp. The lyrics appear dashed off, and most of their settings (particularly \\"Different Germany\\"'s) are very obvious and trite. Although there are three songs in all I sometimes listen to (\\"Fly By Night\\", \\"Made in England\\", and \\"Trains\\"), the only song I can really recommend is \\"Trains\\".

B00003CXAY|4.0|Koyaanisqatsi is one of those movies that changes your life. Set to the rythmic music of Philip Glass we see images of empty spaces and the natural environment highlighted beautifully with time lapse photography. The images of man start to be included and increased over time until we see life in cities flashing past - the people become like ants. We also see images of mans destruction of the earth. Powaqqatsi follows with more images from around the world although I think that it is lesser in its ability to move the watcher.<br />Watching these DVD's will make you re think your life and your place in it and I can highly recommend them.
0802130208|5.0|I had to read this novel for my American Literature class and all I can say is that....THIS IS THE MOST WICKED TIGHT BOOK I'VE EVER BEEN FORCED TO READ.  Don't judge this book by the cover (or by the title at that matter) this is a very good read. This is the funniest book I've read since The Grandissimes. For those who don't know what this story is about, think  if Oliver Hardy (from the classic  Laurel and Hardy film shorts) ate Don Quixote and you get the books \\"hero,\\" Ignatius J Reilly.<br /> Ignatius is a big fat slob who lives still lives with his mother despite the fact that he is in his thirty's and is a college grad.  As I learned in my Lit. class, this is a picaresque story, it focuses on the main characters interior human psyche.  Since the entire book follows Ignatius's episodic adventures there is no itinerary.  The entire novel is full of parody's of social norms.  But it's not just about stuff I learned in class, this book is all about laughter.  Throughout all of the chapters I was laughing my head off, the library literally had to throw me out because of scene I was making.  This book has it all; a fat person who eats and complains all the time, New Orleans, a policeman who dresses in funny outfits and hangs out in a mens room, flaming gay people, hot dogs, everything!  It's a rollercoaster of a ride that will make your valve open and your moustache smile and your eyes water with tears of joy.  So stop waisting your time reading what other people thought of this book, go out and read it.  Develope your own opinon for crying out loud!
B00006JDVV|2.0|Has anyone noticed that there's a curse with dragons in movies? Every movie that's had a dragon in it has bombed. DRAGONSLAYER, DRAGON HEART, DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS... Now add REIGN OF FIRE to the list even though someone cleverly left the word \\"Dragon\\" out of the title.<br />Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey star in this ROAD WARRIOR meets DRAGON SLAYER meets ALIENS movie directed by X-FILES director, Rob Bowman. What should have been a smart sci-fi fantasy movie ends up lost in the dragon movie curse - too much money spent on SPFX - not enough on the script where biology and logic have been thrown out the window to accommodate action movie formula. There are lots of problems with scale and with the supposed biology of the dragons - to say anymore would be to give away the movie's weak ending.<br />McConaughey is a lot of fun as the skinhead American dragonslayer with a Marine bad attitude. Covered with tattoos and looking very buff, he's like a cartoon superhero a little on the crazy side - he should have played Wolverwine in the X-MEN!<br />Bale, on the other hand, is unrecognizable in a beard - actually he looks more like John Lindh Walker of the Taliban! Too bad so does every other survivor in his castle. Bale, who used to be 'the next big thing', seems happy now just grimacing and looking pissed off. (Word to Bale - see what happened to fellow Brit Julian Sands). And did I say curse of the dragon? With Bale's abysmal box office track record (Newsies, Swing Kids, Corelli's Mandolin and most recently, Equilibrium), perhaps throwing him in a dragon movie was just the last nail in the coffin! The movie didn't stand a chance.  Rent a Mad Max movie or ALIENS instead!
B00004Y6NT|3.0|Communique is a classic \\"difficult second album\\". No question in my mind that Mark Knopfler felt impelled to repeat the formula of the band's debut LP - witness the reverb-drenched solo guitar intro to opener, \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\", which  bears more than a passing resemblance to \\"Down to the Waterline\\", which opened the first record.<br />While the Dire Straits line-up, production values, and intrumentation are the same (it would be another two records before Mark Knopfler flipped the switch on his stratocaster out of the out-of-phase pickup position) there is a distinctive, and altogether pleasant, London-in-the-summertime feel to this record. If, like me, you're lucky enough to live in this great city, you'll know exactly what I mean.<br />It's best exemplified by the lovely \\"Portobello Belle\\" and the opener \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\", which despite its title has as much in common with a Spaghetti Western as the Swindon Cowboy, but cruises along with an almost top-down, reggae feel to it. It's almost - and this comes as a massive surprise from Dire Staits - groovy.<br />\\"Where do you think you're going\\" is a nice tune - perhaps the first act of the melodrama/tragedy which culminates in Making Movies' \\"Romeo & Juliet\\", and \\"Follow Me Home\\" is a nice, brooding closer, picking up on the slaughter theme set out at the beginning of the record.<br />\\"Portobello Belle\\" is the real single of the album, though I don't think it was ever released. The trusty National Guitar gets an outing, and I think it's fair to say no-one's ever made a resonator sound quite so Notting Hill before. It's a lovely tune, lovely wistful lyrics, and makes up for a number of dud songs on the record.<br />And this is where I start subtracting stars. The dross count really is too high - \\"News\\", \\"Lady Writer\\" (a lame attempt to reprise Sultans of Swing, if ever there was one), title track \\"Communique\\" and \\"Single-Handed Sailor\\" aren't up to scratch as songs at all, and some of those that are have simply AWFUL lyrics. Knopfler is heavily influenced in his writing and singing by Bob Dylan, but - especially on this record - plainly lacks Dylan's gift for a crisp metaphor. The opening verse of \\"Once Upon a Time...\\" ruminates thematically on people who \\"get a cheap laugh breaking up the speed limit\\", and couples that line with \\"scaring the pedestrians for a minute\\", which is not very Rock 'n' Roll at all.<br />Communique is probably the weakest record of Dire Straits' oeuvre.  That's not to say it isn't worth checking out, but it's an understated rather than a guilty pleasure to be found here.that are have simply AWFUL lyrics.

0385504209|5.0|I just finished reading this unbelievably entertaining and meticulously researched story...all I could say was WOW!  It was definitely a page-turner to the point where, I must admit, I was beginning to wonder if the climax and resolution would live up to my expectations!  Without giving anything away, I'll say this...you will be glued until the last page. Any negative reviews of this book seem to be from people offended by some of the ideas presented by Mr. Brown as he does deal with two VERY taboo subjects, namely, religion and politics. Having knowledge of many different religions, however, some of the theories did make a lot of sense to me. I think they struck a chord with my own personal beliefs about the Bible. Whatever your religious stance, this book is definitely not for the close-minded! Loved it!
B000006045|5.0|The nearest this I can liken this record to is the goal that David Beckham scored against Greece to enable England to qualify for the 2002 World Cup finals.<br />Indulge me a while, ok?<br />The game - which England needed to draw to qualify for the finals - had not been going well, and quite against form and expectation, Greece were (deservedly) leading 2-1.<br />In the 93rd minute - three minutes into injury time, if you will - England are awarded a free-kick ten yards outside the penalty box, a good 30 yards from goal. For the non-footballers among you, that is, as direct free kicks go, fairly unthreatening. The defence composes a salutary \\"wall\\" to block a direct shot and the attacking players assemble in the penalty box to receive a crossed kick.<br />Dead-ball specialist Beckham trots up - this is genuinely the last chance saloon, remember - and languidly strikes the ball, aiming outside and over the wall. It seems to be heading harmlessly into touch, thinks the goalkeeper, who watches in horror and awe, rooted to the spot, as the football defies the known laws of physics, prescribes a ridiculously tight arc, curling vicously and dipping at the last minute and sneaks into the top left hand corner of the goal. Utterly sublime.<br />That is how good this record is, and it was created out of just such an unlikely situation. Late 90s Britain believed, vainly, that \\"Cool Britannia\\" - a hastily thrown together political slogan - was the answer to everything. All the while pop music became more vacuous, more manufactured and less appealing. \\"Alternative\\" music had developed into hackneyed synth-fests of any interest to those (and there were many) blitzed out of their eyeballs on e, and nobody had much musically or artistically to say. Massive Attack, which had scored a number of well attended but not earth shattering albums through the '90s released this.<br />Not just cleverly sampled breakbeats - but melodies. Not just melodies, but haunting melodies. Not just haunting melodies, but menace. Not just menace, but grinding, howling guitars (long a taboo on \\"dance\\" records).

B0000062FJ|5.0|Santana's self-titled album is an excellent debut and arguably their best album. Their first hits, \\"Evil Ways\\" and \\"Soul Sacrifice\\", are the most well-known tracks. But there's much, much more excellence to be found. Gregg Rolie's vocals and organ playing on the bluesy \\"You Just Don't Care\\" and \\"Persuasion\\" are absoultely killer. If you like your percussion, it's all over this album, particularly on the instrumentals, \\"Jingo\\" and \\"Savor.\\" A very powerful piece of music, the newly remastered album also contains 3 tracks recorded of their at the original Woodstock, including \\"Soul Sacrifice\\", which was one of the biggest highlights of the festival. It absolutely blows the original version, which was already good, right out of the water. This is timeless music that would be a welcome addition to any music fan's collection.
B00000JPHF|4.0|*** Contains mild/vague spoilers ***<BR> Mary Shelley's Gothic novel, Frankenstein, was transformed into a black and white motion picture in 1931, but the book still provides us with a better \\"cautionary tale against overweening presumption\\" (Shelley iii). Although James Whale's adaptation of Shelley's masterpiece is, as 1930's movies go, a wonderful specimen it could never eclipse the brilliance and talent of the author's original story.<BR> The first of the many inconsistancies begins almost immediately. The picture's introduction, by the renowned \\"Dracula\\" actor, Bela Lugosi, was mysterious and ominous. The book's introduction, written by Mary Shelley, is calm and realistic. Shelley's tale of a \\"hideous phantasm of a man\\" (viii) is written in a way that can almost be believed, where as the movie is quite the opposite. To be led by the hand into a world that Lugosi openly admits to being fictional, and as he implies, impossible is one thing. To have the door thrown wide open to a horrible premonition of what might be, what very well could be... Ah, blissful terror.<BR> Whale's \\"Frankenstein\\" includes minute changes that are often bemusing. The change of names for example, Shelley's Victor Frankenstein becomes Henry Frankenstein and Victor's best friend Henry, now called Victor, recieves its own share of blinks and blank stares but does not altogether ruin the experience. However, adding tedious and unnecessary details where once there were only obscure hints dims the allure and quiets the terror one feels when confronted with the mystery of the novel and the creature's unknown origins. Whale unvieled the secrets that the audience did not want to hear and spoiled the delicious bite of fear, the tingle that comes when something goes, \\"Bump!\\" in the dark of night.<BR> There are a few more changes which will inevitably bring ire to the forefront. In James Whale's own \\"Frankenstein\\" little can be said of the ending, except that it is typically trite in true Hollywood form. If Whale's \\"Frankenstein\\" were as interesting in body, had been as full and complex as the real Frankenstein is then maybe the final product would be a little less miserably happy. <BR> Something else to irritate a critic would be the lack of secrecy, the missing solitude of our tragic heros, that we find in Mary Sheley's Modern Prometheus, but which is absent from Whale's \\"Frankenstein.\\" From the very beginning of the motion picture Victor \\"Henry\\" Frankenstein is not alone in he knowledge that such an abomination exists, or even that this abomination is own own first son. James Whale brings to the laboratory the professor, the best friend, and the fiance. It is with their help that Victor bears tragedies that follow his Monster's abnormal birth, but these tragedies do not touch so close to our main character's heart as the did previously. <BR> In the end it lies with the critic, with the reader, with the viewer. The question is not which piece is the better work, or even which artist is better creator, the question is for those who pick up the book and play the movie. The question is yours to answer. Are you more suited to Hollywood's happy endings and rose colored glasses? Or are you willing - nay, eager, to walk into Mary Shelley's sorrow, her grief, her wild terror and mind numbing horror? Watch the movie, then read the book. It it my personal opinion that proceeding in the opposite order would be unwise, you would spoil the movie.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album is unlike any Madonna album!  That's what makes her talented and on top of music artistry.  Too many critics (and close-minded fans alike) are writing this album off as meaningless but what Madonna accomplished here is a collection of straight-from-the-heart musings on love (Nothing Fails, Intervention) and spirituality (X-Static Process).  Like Ray of Light and it's focus on the awakening thoughts of Hinduism and Budhism, this record brings forth the simple yet powerful principles of the Kabbalah (Love Profusion, Nobody Knows Me, Die Another Day).  There's no fluff here and that's evident with the pop stylings and deep rooted lyrical review of parental failings (Mother & Father).  On top of it all, Madonna emphasises what we will all come to know at some point in life (American Life, Hollywood, I'm So Stupid, Easy Ride)...that the material life the human race is so fond of will ultimately mean nothing!  Stop the comparisons to other albums as this record stands alone as a subtle yet masterful work.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Wow. Oh, my God. Just... wow. Find a way to watch this, even if it means taking on an Agent. This is no mere peripheral, this is nine animes showing us not only how DEEP the Rabbit Hole goes, but where it leads, who dug it, and why. And then some.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Madonna manages to be both introspective and relevant to world events in this CD.  The CD bounces between tehno and acoustical guitar and does a great job of both.  I found that the lyrics were relevant to my life and gave an interesting perspective on Madonna's life.  I liked this one better than the last two CDs of Madonna.  Every track is worth hearing and the CD gets even better as I listen to it again.  Well worth adding to your CD collection.
B000089CJI|5.0|The best thing I've heard so far in 2002. Tamborello's delicate glitchy beats and catchy hooks mesh perfectly with Gibbard's lyrics and vocal style. What is there to say that hasn't already been said? This is the new New Wave. No cheese. No shlock. This is the real thing. &quot;Nothing Better&quot; is the best song I've heard in quite a while and might beat &quot;Don't You Want Me&quot; for the best male / female vocal exchange in a synthpop song. The boys go New Order style all over &quot;Clark Gable,&quot; another great song. There's only ten songs in all. You'll wish there was more.
B00000JNNY|5.0|What can I say from gravel to heaven. Etta James' album 'At Last&quot; lives up to it's name. Every track is an exercise in ecstasy. 'As good as it gets'.
B00008PW3O|2.0|I should have read the reviews on this CD. What a disappointment. It's all true. The band without Christina McVie is shallow, of poor quality; and a poor attempt of Fleetwood Mac to enters the Pop genre. I bought concert tickets before I realized that she was not with the band anymore. Woe is me. They have lost a lot of depth relying on electronic wizardry to make much of their music acceptable. The cover is a good one. However, they should have remained laying on the floor rather than trying to revive thier previous wonderful sounds.
B00005JKG7|3.0|John Carpenter surprised me in the fog, although it was a entertaining film, it could have been so much better. It's about some creatures that want their gold back, after 100 years, and they come back to get it, they only kill like four people, out of a whole town, and the ending was disappointing, especially how fast it came. No deep story, just these creatures knocking on people's doors, which does give an errie feeling, and a women on a late night radio talk show, just babbling on and on. I jumped maybe one time through the whole film.
B000088E6D|4.0|This was wonderful listening! I never knew, til he sang it,<BR>that &quot;How can you mend a broken heart&quot; was such a beautiful tender love song.(it used to sound like Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street singing to eachother.) &quot;Moondance&quot; is pretty good, though Van Morrison does it best. &quot;That's All&quot; is just exquisite and sweet,and he turns Put Your Head on my shoulder into a gentle serenade. If one is in need of good first dance/kiss songs, this is the way to go.<br />I'd have given this 5 stars except for the syrupy over produced version of &quot;you'll never find another love like mine.&quot;<BR>and the cheesy crazy little thing called love.
B00003CXI0|5.0|For a lot of reasons, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is probably a tempting movie to criticize.  After all, there is almost nothing a critic hates more than a film that is practically - baring some unforgivable act of gross incompetence - a guaranteed success, despite anything he or she might happen to write about it.<br />At any rate, while some may quibble with the notion that Sorcerer's Stone is too much like the book that inspired it, the upside for moviegoers is that neither Rowling nor director Christopher Columbus have forgotten the film's primary audience: young readers between the ages of 12 - 16.  For those whose parents read the book to them, the age may actually drop a bit below that.  <br />For the most part, as every parent knows, it is an audience frequently patronized with the worst sort of infantile pap imaginable, inundated with coarse language and gratuitous violence, or simply ignored altogether.  Columbus, to his credit, does none of the above.  In remaining true to his audience, Columbus has, in fact, delivered a film for all of us.<BR> <BR>It is obvious Columbus knows, for instance, that a young audience wants to see on the screen what it read in the book.  In pursuit of this goal, Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves have fashioned characters and settings true to the letter and the spirit of the novel. The characters, especially, strike just the right chord of familiarity.  Certainly, we all know that familiarity can wander over the line into disinterested comfort. Remarkably, the characters in Sorcerer's Stone never do.  Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid, for instance, looks just as we expect him to.  More important, he radiates a warmth and trust that serves as a secure anchor in those moments when events seem to be spinning out of control.  As good as Hagrid is in the book, Coltrane's Hagrid is more vivid on the screen.<BR> <BR>Which brings us to the performance of Daniel Radcliffe in the role of Harry Potter.  At first glance, Radcliffe seems reticent and withdrawn, hidden behind a gauze curtain, an uncertain hero. Yet we cannot forget that Harry Potter is an eleven year-old orphan whose parents have been murdered. He is a foundling whose caretakers resent his existence and actively disapprove of everything he is and, worse, in their own eyes, everything he will become. He is forced to sleep in a closet under the stairs and absorb a constant stream of verbal and physical abuse from his malevolent aunt and uncle and their overindulged son, Dudley.  <br />Yes, of course Harry is withdrawn.  Small wonder. Or, as my daughter would say, \\"Duh!\\"  <br />In fact, Radcliffe's performance is entirely consistent with Harry's history and upbringing, and Columbus has wisely ensured that, as the chronicle of films progresses, the character of Harry has somewhere to go. There are, after all, six movies still to come. Columbus has clearly determined that, unlike some other celluloid heroes of recent memory (Indiana Jones springs to mind), the character of Harry Potter should have some room to develop, otherwise both the young wizard and his friends would grow quickly stagnant.<br />Another notable attribute of the film is that the atmosphere and setting, through the more subtle elements of special effects, are beautifully realized. As the first-years are journeying across the lake, their - and our - first view of Hogwarts Castle is absolutely breathtaking, a spectacular, gothic memory from a medieval dream.  Inside the castle are stairways that move, pictures that talk and go about their daily routines, and a splendid dining hall that evokes the grandeur of a cathedral.  When the Sorting Hat pronounces \\"GRIFFINDORE\\" on this opulent stage, Harry's adventures officially begin.<br />Yes, the adventure has its obvious, special effects masterpieces. The Quidditch match is a high-flying, fast-paced extravaganza of soccer, polo, and basketball on broomsticks. The chess match is the high point of the film.  At the same time, there are special effects so well done that they don't draw attention to themselves. The messenger owls flying gracefully into the dining hall to deliver envelopes and parcels is a brief, finely structured, aerial ballet that is easy to take for granted because we are momentarily suspended in the world of Hogwarts and have willingly cast aside our powers of disbelief.  When Hedwig flies above Hogwarts Castle, our spirits and our sense of wonder soar with him. It is an impressive accomplishment.   <br />Because it is true to itself and never panders to its audience, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is both exciting and entertaining, an escape to a world where magical things can still happen. It is, in short, a film for the child in all of us.
B00000IPAX|3.0|Now let me start off by saying that this music isn't bad, its actually got some pretty cool songs and music for pop-punk, like for instance &quot;What's My Age Again&quot; is just beautiful, I have to admit.  But if you want some true punk-rock, go with some bands that put out songs that are more hardcore, and most importantly, more true to the tradition punk-rock form.  <BR>     So if you getting sick of these guys whining about their girl friends and conforming to pop like lyrics, though it ain't bad, go with true punk bands like The Used, Thrice, and the best punk rock band, AFI. AFI's best albums are &quot;Close Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes&quot;, and &quot;The at of Drowning&quot; by the way. Peace.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|As I listened (and continue to listen) to the soundtrack more--and now have enjoyed the soundtrack to the Two Towers, I am happy to say that this music never leaves you and you never tire of hearing it.<br /><br />My two-year-old daughter also loves this \\"Hobbit music.\\"
B00005JLSE|5.0|A total triumph , one of the best adaptations of a musical in history total entertainment, the cast are total class and the music is fantastic one of the best films of the decade and the best film of the year.
0385504209|2.0|Dan Brown can certainly write a gripping thriller and the book is hard to put down with non-stop action from beginning to end. What a pity, then, that he has wanted to use the Da Vinci Code to write an anti-Christian tract. Particular venom is reserved for the Catholic Church, or \\"the Vatican\\" as the author likes to call it, somewhat anachronistically when he is speaking of the Church in the 4th Century AD. The references to Opus Dei are so inaccurate that it is virtually impossible to recognise the organisation as it exists in real life. It appears the author did very little proper research, at least for this aspect of the work. I feel his having such an axe to grind really detracts from the overall quality of the book.
0688163173|5.0|First there were the noir detective books. Then &quot;Mystic River&quot;, which was 70-80% different. &quot;Shutter Island&quot; is a 100% switch from either of those. I was fortunate enough to purchase mine at a book signing where Lehane answered questions for about an hour. He has taught writing extensively and is a very patient, cordial and articulate inverview (not all writers speak well). Lehane said something that helps understand all his work, but especially this one. He said his stories are about people who strive and strive for what they want, only to wind up with what they need instead, and is makes their soul whole. &quot;Shutter Island&quot; is a very tight (we know what the main character, Teddy, knows - period), freightening story. Still, Lehane laces his outstanding literary skills and fantastic story line with his usual humorous passages, and his wonderful, punchy descriptive metapors. &quot;Shutter Island&quot; is not literally a haunted castle story. All the characters are &quot;real&quot; (human) and there are no ghosts or other-world beings. But it is absolutely, positively the best haunted castle tale I have ever read. This book goes on my list of all-time favorites.
6303607942|5.0|This is not Horowitz's best reading of the Rach 3, but it is still considerably better than any other pianist.  If I understand correctly, this was the second half of a concert, the first half having consisted of a solo recital by Horowitz.  For some reason the first movement is a little nervy.  There are some memory slips and a few smudges, but after mopping his brow at the end of it Horowitz settles down nicely in the second and third movements.  The playing is really very good, although one sees the point that Rubinstein made when he watched this live telecast that the conductor &quot;poor Zubin Mehta&quot; had to work hard to follow Horowitz's varying tempi.  While there are some wonderful moments in this performance, there are also some dreadful ones, particularly the octaves at the end of the third movement where orchestra and soloist are painfully out of sync.  However, the camera work is first class and some of the close-ups of the Horowitz's fingers are fascinating.<br />To sum up, an excellent recording, not Horowitz's best but very enjoyable and fascinating to watch.  Also, there are no cuts in this performance.  Horowitz's practice (and Rachmaninoff's) was to cut some sections out of the 2nd and 3rd movements, but here is one of the very few Horowitz recordings of the whole composition.
B00008BRDX|4.0|With the 1979 release of &quot;Regatta de Blanc&quot; (White Reggae) The Police left their punk pretensions behind and established themselves as a New Wave force with chops and plenty of rock punch. If you only know Sting from his solo stuff, check out this early group material. The guy could flat out groove on the bass. Stewart Copeland has always been an outstanding drummer. Andy Summers is an underrated guitarist who serves as the glue of this band, and his washes and textures and odd chords are incredible. There's also a lot more collaboration in the songwriting than on later releases.<br />Right out of the gate we get the all-time classic &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; with a deceptively simple rhythm line and the amazing timed drums that fill in the choruses. Sting turns around his &quot;me me&quot; lyrics in the final verse when the castaway realizes he's not the only lonely soul.<br />&quot;Regatta De Blanc&quot; is near-instrumental with a great groove.<br />&quot;It's Alright For You&quot; is a joint Copeland/Sting effort that has a punky edge, killer drums and cool guitar and bass fills.<br />&quot;Bring on the Night&quot; is an underrated gem of a song, with its rising guitar line, echoey drums, and one of my favorite lyrics, &quot;the afternoon has gently passed me by/evening spreads itself against the sky.&quot; Great reggae-tinged polorhythmic structure between the bass and drums.<br />&quot;Deathwish&quot; features some nifty time changes and cool guitar and drum interplay, especially Copeland's high-hat work.<br />&quot;Walking on the Moon&quot; is a definite 5-star tune, again with the bass and drums working in slightly different times. Sounds simple but it's deceptively tricky. The lyrics about new love have a certain weightlessness and joy...<br />&quot;On Any Other Day&quot; is a Stewart Copeland featuring his lead vocals and some hilarious lyrics of a guy having a bad one. Great aside lyric &quot;I'm covered in misery.&quot;<br />&quot;The Bed's Too Big Without You&quot; is another underrated gem similar to &quot;Bring on the Night&quot; with loopy guitars, pulsing drums, and a haunting bassline and vocal. Great lyrics by Sting.<br />&quot;Contact&quot; is a Copeland tune with some wry lyrics like &quot;I've got contacts in my book and in my eyes/my good connection on the telephone never lies&quot; and Stings bassline snakes all over the neck of his guitar.<br />&quot;Does Everyone Stare&quot; is a quirky little song with a piano/vocal intro and Sting singing in his lower register, then kicking it up an octave as the other instruments come in. &quot;I never noticed the size of my feet/til I kicked you in the shins...&quot;<br />&quot;No Time This Time&quot; has Sting taking things up a notch for the final tune. Good rocker.<br />I love the various dynamics The Police achieved on this album and the raw energy of their trio performance before they became an international sensation.hout You&quot; is another underrated gem similar to &quot;Bring on the Night&quot; with loopy guitars, pulsing drums, and a haunting bassline and vocal.

B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd is for any kind-of rock/alternative/rap fan, you will LOVE it. The songs are more advanced and varied than Hybrid theory, and maybe a bit more rap that rock this time around (Which goes amazing). The best songs are (by me) Lying from you, Faint, Numb.... but i keep changing them, like, i love Nobody's Listening too. GET THIS CD NOW!!!
B0000931OL|5.0|This cd kicks more [butt] then i thought and blur has done it again with mind warping melodys and beats.Thats the one great thing about these guys is that they never stay to one sound on each of their cdz and they always stay fresh with genuis driving talent. Check \\"Jets\\" out, that has to be one of the best blur songs on \\"Think Tank\\" besides \\"Trouble in message Central\\" from the \\"PARKlife\\" cd. Keep the good work up guys cant wait till your next cd Dropz.<br />Blurred For Life!!!
B00008S2VG|3.0|This CD has the most ugliest booklet,but the most important thing\\"You cannot say that about the CD\\"at all!It starts with American Life\\"including a fantastic accapella intro and rap!Just another smash hit!The second single/song\\"Hollywood\\"is great but if you hear it live you missed the magic you will hear on this CD.The sound sounds so known from the very first time!\\"I'm So Stupid\\"is comparing to the first two songs a bit boring.It missed something.\\"Love Profusion\\"has a good groove but has not such a original parts.\\"Nobody Knows Me\\"is a bit better than\\"Love Profusion\\"but not much better!\\"Nothing Fails\\"is a good camp-fire-song like you imagine when you heard songs like\\"Sealed With A Kiss\\"that was covered by Jason Donovan in the eighties!<BR>\\"Intervention\\"has such a romantic vibe when the chorus starts but the rest is a bit boring.\\"Xstatic Process\\"has not very much instruments on it and that is a miss.Endlessly there is the third GREAT song on the CD\\"Mother And Father\\"is danceable,emotional,varieted.WHATTA MIXTURE!The best song on the record!Deserve a number one position!Also a great rap by the way!\\"Die Another Day\\"is a fantastic bunch of sounds.It has so many influences from Classic till Pop!(but\\"Papa Don't Preach\\"was ofcourse better).The final song is\\"Easy Ride\\"a good ballad!But the Madonna that i likes most is a dancy on.If someone ask me\\"do you recommend this\\"I will advice\\"yes\\".50 Percent is VERY GOOD and 50 percent has an average quality!
B00005YW4H|1.0|Overhyped, and highly overated album.  Just more proof of the out of touch with reality mentality of the Grammy's.  Great for insomniacs, also great if you want to hear the same song over  and over.  Where has good taste gone?
0375422307|5.0|At last this gem reaches us in America, after raking in awards all over Europe. Not only is it a very timely and revealing peek inside daily life in Iran, it's also a very personal, sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking slice of one remarkable girl's life. There really is nothing quite like it, it's true. I've given copies of it to all my friends, many of whom never read graphic novels or comic books, but they all agree: this is something special. It's not suitable for kids though, because of its depiction of torture and violence and other mature themes you might expect in a society under the yoke of fundamentalist islamic rule. But for everyone else, I highly recommend PERSEPOLIS. <BR>This is an exceptional childhood memoir, that ranks with Angela's Ashes for its depth and authenticity. This one will be around forever.
0788816454|3.0|Adam Sandler stars as Bobby Boucher (pronounced Booshay) who is a waterboy for a college football team in Louisiana but Coach Red (Jerry Reed) is fed up with the waterboy and he asks the assistant coach on why he didn't fire him, he tells Red that he didn't think that he was serious and later on Bobby winds up being the waterboy for a new football team and he tackles one of the football players for making fun of him and the coach (Henry Winkler) is impressed his Bobby's tackling abilities and Bobby ends up playing for the football team and there's a laugh-out-loud scene when Bobby tackles the teacher for making fun of his mama and the teacher looks alot like Colonel Sanders, later on we meet Bobby's new girlfriend Vicki Valencourt and Mama tells Bobby that she is the devil (the way she usually describes people cause her husband left her when she was pregnant with Bobby).<br />Overall I didn't think that the Waterboy was one of Adam Sandler's better movies cause his voice gets kind of annoying after a while but since I am a fan of Adam Sandler's work, I'm going to give this movie 3.5 stars instead of 3.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Before Audioslave was realality and just a rumor that sounded like an awesome Idea, I really didn't know how it was going to turn out. I mean think of it, the former members of one of the best rap-rock bands (rage against the machine) with the front man of one of the best grunge bands (soundgarden). At first sounds like a capitol idea. Is it? Well let's get to the review. <BR>Overall, with all of this albums praise by the public and massive over play by the radio it's really noting more than an average rock album, bad? Absolutely not, but nothing really special. Of course Chris Cornell delivers top-notch vocals. But the other members, well.... at times seem to be as finely tuned. For instance, Tom Morello is one heck of a guitarist, but in a majority of the albums seems not as creative as he was in rage. The drums and bass are as well average. <BR>Some of my favorites are \\"Gasoline\\" \\"I am the highway\\" a pretty dam good ballad I must say. \\"Shadow on the sun\\" and others show extreme powerhouse tunes. <br />So, in conclusion audioslave is an average rock album, solidly recorded and solid song structures. Just in some places the albums sounds a lot of what's drenching the music rock market today, and at this albums expense it kind of suffered.
B000005J08|2.0|I like Zorn.  His Spy vs. Spy record is excellent as well as Spillane.<br />This one has a few but it's mostly just noisy as hell.  A novelty.<br />I didn't like this record when I got it back in the early 90's.  I think I sold it or something.
B00008RWC2|4.0|Making Faces is a fun read. Kevyn Aucoin is one of the beauty business top talents. However, I enjoyed reading Healthy Beauty using nature's secrets to look great and feel terrific by Letha Hadady. In the makeup and style genius chapters Clif de Raita, national director of makeup for Georgette Klinger, recommended makeup colors based on MY natural complexion and eye colors.<br />I don't want to look like everyone else or like the fashion trend of the moment. I want to bring out my best features and colors. De Raita also recommended the right jewelry according to hair and complexion colors. Interesting and highly useful for everyone.<br />I enjoy Making Faces for its pretty pictures and Healthy Beauty for its great information.
B000000OUJ|5.0|this is album is flat out money. if you are into wu-tang or hiphop in general you cant go wrong with this..the gza is one of the most creative and thought provoking mc's and he doesnt dissapoint what so ever on this album.  throw in the rza's beats and production and you got yourself a winner..if you dont own this buy it or steal it because you need it
B00008NG5V|2.0|Sorta hate to be the voice of dissention here...but I was quite disappointed w/this disc.  I loved BF within the first 2 listens but found this to be just too....repetitive I guess. I was hoping JJ would've expanded his sound a bit more, or at least mixed it up more than was evident here.  I enjoyed the 1st two tracks and was looking forward to the rest, but then it just seemed to me that it all sounded VERY SIMILIAR.  While BF had very diff't rhythms and sounds to most of the tracks I viewed this offering as a fallback on a tried and true recipe, almost as if he was determined to make this album sound enough like the first so that it would be successful.  For me, it wasn't.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I love this CD.  Madonna can sing the National Anthem 15 different ways and it would be good.  I have loved her music since I was 5 and this CD is no exception.  She is consistant and her music is constantly evolving.
0060512806|5.0|While starting out a little dry, it unfolds into a rich, complex, and well thought out story with well developed charecters.  I had trouble putting this one down.
B0000931OG|4.0|&quot;Think Tank&quot; is another excellent album from a band that is not afraid of growing up. They continue to evolve and experiment, and when you're dealing with musicians this talented and creative, it's exciting to follow. As with &quot;13,&quot; you need to listen several times through to pick up on all the layers and nuances. I bought this CD expecting a lot of pleasant surprises, and Blur didn't disappoint. I love this band, and I'm growing to love this album.
B00000K19E|4.0|This is a good movie, but doesn't deserve the fanatical following it has.  Some reviewers below commented on the &quot;good story&quot; in the movie, but that is really it's weakest point.  There are so many holes in the plot and entire concept that you can't possibly do anything but go into suspended disbelief mode and ignore the so-called &quot;plot&quot; entirely.  <br />Other people talk about the &quot;innovative&quot; plot, too, but I've read science fiction books in the 1960's and 1970's that covered the same story line.  Sorry, guys, but there is very little new under the sun; the plot (such as it is) for this movie certainly isn't new in any sense of the word.<br />Another criticism that other people inexplicably argue with me over - the acting skills, and I use that phrase lightly, of Keanu Reeves.  He has improved a bit over his horrendous performance in &quot;Speed&quot;, but still, he is one of the worse actors in the business today.  Lawrence Fishburne's acting consists mainly of looking cool in his sunglasses, too.  He pulls it off, but it's not a challenging or engaging performance at all.  The best actor in the movie is Joe Pantoliano, who went on to be the gangster everyone loved to hate in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.<br />So what does the movie have going for it?  Great innovative special effects, and for people who aren't heavy into the martial arts genre, good fight sequences.  Those of us who have been following martial arts movies BEFORE &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; have seen all this before, and done far better, too (Hong Kong has it all over Hollywood in this department).  But still, even though the actors have NO martial arts skills, the action sequences are reasonably well done.  That's a credit to Yuen Wo Ping, the fight coordinator.  Again, those of us in the know have been following his work for years.  Once again, nothing new...<br />The buzz for &quot;The Matrix - Reloaded&quot; is all about - what?  The special effects.  That says it all - no one cares about the story, they just want to see new and better FX and action sequences.  So I'm afraid the movie will be all about out-doing the original as far as action sequences and special effects go.  That's fine, but there needs to be more to it than that.  Well, then again, maybe there doesn't...<br />Now, the DVD.  In spite of my criticisms of the movie, this is still one of the best DVD productions, in some way, on the market.  The unfortunate part is the visual aspects of the movie.  The Wachowski brothers purposely made the movie dark, with very little color or detail.  So it is not reference quality, visually, at all.  Don't use this disk to show off your video system; it just doesn't deliver in that deparment.  But the audio is outstanding; one of the best sounding DVDs ever.  I'm surprised so few DVDs releases since this one have equalled it's audio quality.<br />So is this DVD worth buying?  If you have a good surround system, yes, absolutely.  Just don't try to follow the story - sit back and enjoy the action.

0194313425|5.0|I was first recommended this book by my English teacher when I was in high school.  I read it through and felt I got a pretty good idea about English grammar and English usage in general.  It was 15 years ago.  Since then I completed my undergraduate and graduate degrees in institutions where English was the language of instruction, and continue using English on work.  Often when I see grammar mistakes in writing or speaking, I realise that it was explained in this book and feel greatful what it taught me.  I have read many other grammar books but whenever I am not sure, I still go back to this book. My teacher who recommended me this book said exactly the same thing.  So I strongly recommend this book for foundation and referrence for English grammar, for those who have not found grammar book they are satisfied with.
B000068IEU|4.0|I don't know what was wrong with people in the 70's.  The most disturbing movies ever made were spawned from that decade and \\"Last House on the Left\\" is no different.  If you want to see a real horror movie and really be scared, then I certainly recommend this.  Yes, it is distasteful, poorly filmed, poorly acted and poorly scripted, but well worth it if you're a fan of 70's horror.  Know what to expect, don'y be like the two bleeding heart crybabies below that couldn't handle it.  Apparently, they think that rape doesn't happen, therefore it shouldn't be in movies.  If the subject matter is going to bother you, then simply don't watch this movie.  If you want to get totally freaked out, then watch it!!!!!!!
B00004URWV|4.0|I bought this CD when there was need to test the stereosystem almost 10 years ago. I must say, music by Space is very inspiring, really in the mood of 70s vision of cosmos and interstellar trips. I rate it 4 stars though - Space sound get a bit dated as years pass, not the way it happens with Jarre's music.
B000001IPL|5.0|Along with the many other millions of people who bought this album, I love it.  This cd defies time.  You can put it on today and not be tired of it, even though you have listened to it 10,000 times already.  Along with Green Day's \\"Dookie\\" this album was responsible for putting a punkish sound of music into the mainstream.  While that is not necessarily a positive thing to say for some punk die-hards, you have to respect the effect that this cd had on millions.  This album was put out on a tiny little punk label and nothing much was expected of it, and look what it did.  Label them sellouts, say what you want, but this is the catchiest, most enjoyable album I can think of.  Amazing.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The acting is great and the storyline is VERY good. And you dont get a plot like that very often. All of the songs are awesome (the soundtrack is good too) I kno every song from that movie by heart except for Mr.Cellophane. But anyways go see Chicago it's BEYOND AWESOME!
B000002UY5|5.0|Strangely, I only rediscovered this album a couple of weeks ago, after it had remained dormant at the bottom of one of my many boxes of CD's. I bought it around it's UK release date after seeing the video for &quot;No Rain&quot; on MTV: like most people, who subsequently heard &quot;Change&quot;, I was taken in by the light-hearted, vaguely rocky-folky noises and the lilt of Shannon's voice (which I later discovered to be far weaker in a live setting than in a studio). <br />No doubt, the release of the two semi-accoustic songs on the album was a wonderful marketing ploy by a genial, grey-suited man in an office, but it worked wonders: the drums at the beginning of &quot;Soak the sin&quot; signalled a bold change from the overplayed singles which had been released, and when I heard the line &quot;What he says to do, is that we don't have to&quot; in the half-tempo passage, I knew that I had discovered something rather remarkable. &quot;Tones of home&quot; starts with that nice jazzy pizicatto guitar, and just makes you happy. &quot;I wonder&quot;, by far and away the best song on the album (and the song which defined the style for Soup) still sends shivers down my spine - just listen to the words of the first verse proper - I, too, would love to daze away... (with his overdose, Shannon later lived his dream.) <br />Other highlights on the album include &quot;Sleepyhouse&quot;, which invokes memories of all great summers, and &quot;Time&quot;, which rivals REM's &quot;Find the river&quot; as the greatest end to an album of all time. If you can get past the egotism of &quot;Dear ol' Dad&quot; and manage to recognise &quot;No Rain&quot; for what it is (the single to open doors) then you may find that this album changes your life. Few people in the nineties could write lyrics like Shannon Hoon ('I'm tired of me this way'; 'When you stop dreaming, it's time to die'), and few bands had such a solidified approach without having to be classed in altogether obsure genres. Take my advice - buying this album is a musical investment.
B000000OSG|5.0|This album is my alltime favorite of any of the rock albums I own.  The musical entegrity is astounding.  The songwriting also is far more mature than AFD was. Axls maturity level was greatly hired through the release of UYI and II.  Many GnR fans turn this album away as being to much of an artistic album rather than a straight foward rock album like I was.  But UYI II makes up for that and more.  Estranged (being my personal favorite) really is a soothing and low key masterpiece thought up by Axl.  The second half is more my type, beautiful lyrics, soothing ryhtyms and a kick ass solo via Slash (whos at his top game on this album).  Breakdown is my second favorite cut off the album.  It successfully merges heavy rock with a little country-influenced banjo.  Once again great GnR.  Pretty Tied Up, Breakdown, You Could Be Mine, Get In The Ring and Shotgun Blues deliever great hard rock tunes.  All very bold in whatever way implied.  Dont Cry is so gutwrenchingly-beautiful even I get teary!  14 years supplies great blues via Izzy Stradlin who's ryhtyms are a little undermined by Slashs mastery of hard rock riffs.  Civil War, Yesterdays, and So Fine break down the barrier for this record.  They ensure its genious through simple chord structures and lyrics and they pull it off.  No one can listen to those songs and think GnR sucks anymore :).  My World has grown on me but its not my cup of tea per say.<br />Buy this album.  Its worth EVERY cent.
B00006RAKP|2.0|A good collection but would be a Great collection if one [1] song had not been omitted .MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER should have been on it .
B00005JKPF|4.0|I'll say this...the sequel DOES make a few improvements on the original and thus doesn't fall victim to the stereotypes about sequels.  It also doesn't come to THE END; so I was sure to be awaiting number three(potentially good selling point as long as there is a three).  Being not a die-hard fan but a avid observer of such a diverse group of characters working together in a set/pre-designed world, I DID find certain changes to what I knew somewhat unsettling.  I also realized that had I not known what I did(and this is advice to those who are informing others who aren't familiar with the comics/cartoons: DON'T inform them; let them see the movies uninformed as I went to see the Lord of the Rings films unread.), I probably would have enjoyed the movies better.  Best regards go to those who sold the first movie: Hugh Jackman(wolverine), Patrick Stewart(professor X), Famke Janssen(jean grey)(who looked much better/closer to how Jean appears at the time though her part here seemed subdued) and Ian Mckellan(magneto).  I just hope Miss Storm doesn't walk out or make things difficult. Her part was fine, and she just needs to stay cool and get a better wig:P(the somewhat short hair seems unauthentic).  I'd also like to see Juggernaut and the origin of Rogue's \\"evolved capabilities\\"(and perhaps her birth origin if that doesn't become too difficult) worked into the next film(rather than tell Storm's story which doesn't necessarily relate to the next phase as it seems to be playing out.).
B00005JLR2|5.0|This movie is incredible! Not only were the graphics and CGI through the roof, but the stroy is incredible too. Jim is a dreamer that just wants to be himself and please his mother, though at the same time is trying to recover from the loss of his father. When he meets Silver, Jim takes a whole new outlook on himself. He learns that he can be more than what he is now. A very powerful and incredible movie and I would recommend it to anyone!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|After the massive success of her 2000 album &quot;Music&quot;, Madonna is back, with the most interesting and personal album of her career, &quot;American Life&quot;. I have been a fan of Madonna for many years now, and I must say, this is her best album to date. Every song is terrific, and for more reasons than one. First of all, many fans of Madonna will listen to this album for the first time, expecting to hear the typical Madonna musical form. That is a big mistake. This album is a total 360-degree turn away from anything else she has ever done in her career. This is certainly, a different Madonna. However, she changed for the better. Each song on the album has a deep, and mature meaning to it. The lyrics are very personal, as they deal with fame, materialism, family, loss, and of course... the American Life! All this is not to say that Madonna doesn't have fun with this album either. There are a few songs on the album that will make you want to dance around the house! This album shows a more mature, fun, and utterly talented Madonna. &quot;American Life&quot; will satisfy the ears of every Madonna fan! The Limited Edition comes packaged in a beautiful leather box. Inside the box is a beautiful two-sided poster, and a really cool, collectible Madonna Stamp Sheet. As someone who has heard every note Madonna has every sang, take it from me... &quot;this type of modern life&quot;, is certainly for you!
B000001IPP|5.0|As my title implies, I found this record to be rather light for a punk record, but I totally love this music.  The music is fun, fast, and catchy, and is always a good listen.  This record is more punky than ...And Out Come the Wolves (though that's not saying much), but no where near as punk as Rancid 2000 (my personal favorite).<br />These songs are really good, but, at first, they all kind of sound the same.  It takes a few listens, but, after a while, you start to notice the uniqueness of each song.  Once you realize how great of an album Let's Go is, you'll want to listen to it all the time.  It's got 23 songs on it, so it never gets boring.  This, ...And Out Come the Wolves, and Rancid 2000 are what I consider the essential Rancid purchases.  AOCTW has a punk/ska-ish, almost poppy kind of feel, while Rancid 2000 is pure punk, and Let's Go is sort of a median between the two.<br />Bottom Line: Great, sort of light punk record from the 90s.
B000002KMV|5.0|Although it often escapes into obscurity sandwiched between the legendary \\"Dirty Mind\\" and \\"1999,\\" \\"Controversy\\" is an astounding album in its own right.  Here, Prince extends his forays into the political realm notable in \\"Partyup\\" (from \\"Dirty Mind\\").  He has so much to say, and you'd better believe he's going to say it all in the short 37 minutes that form the duration of the album.  While at times this causes the music to sound a little forced and rushed (on the otherwise astounding \\"Sexuality\\" and the roaring \\"Ronnie Talk to Russia\\"), when Prince takes a little more time to extend the groove and elabroate, it works marvelously.  The title track remains one of Prince's most timeless, effortless anthems and truly epitomizes what he represents.  \\"Annie Christian\\" is a haunting, distorted song that paved the way for future stunners like \\"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute).\\"<br />Despite the overtly political messages, present on the songs mentioned above and the album sleeve, Prince delves into the world of sex quite successfully.  \\"Do Me, Baby,\\" the only track on which Prince takes his time, is a bedroom burner unrivaled in his extensive catalog.  The empassioned vocal delivery and slightly comical climax make it a classic.  \\"Let's Work\\" features Prince ABUSING his bass guitar with licks so tight that George Clinton would cringe in envy.  \\"Private Joy\\" bounces off the record with youthful exhuberance and energy and \\"Jack U Off\\" offers a tongue-in-cheek rockabilly ditty that is sure to delight (if not embarrass).<br />Prince may not have reached his peak at this point, but on \\"Controversy,\\" Prince displays not only unlimited potential, but some undeniable classics.  It is an oddball among Prince releases, but one that ages well and features some of his most telling material.
1400034779|4.0|First, I have to say that this is not a detective novel; at least, not in the traditional sense of having a murder take place at the end of the first chapter and then the rest of the book is spent by the detective solving the mystery. This is more of a novel with some snippets of mysteries thrown in for good measure. The writing style appears to be simple but as you read on, you realize that the prose is deceptively simple. There are layers beneath the surface that give an unexpected depth to the book. I find Precious Ramotswe, the \\"lady\\" of the Ladies' Detective Agency, to be an incredibly interesting character. She has suffered with a bad husband (now ex), the loss of a child, and the loss of a beloved father but is strong throughout and keeps her humanity intact. I cannot wait to read the further adventures.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Gza is by far the most talented member of the Wu tang clan. His lyrics are so amazing that its hard to argue otherwise. the way he flows is so natural. other members of Wu tang focus on how they look, or how much money theyre making, not GZA, he focuses on his Rhymes, being the oldest member of the Wu-tang clan, he is also the most mature and experinced...if u like dope beats and rhymes go out and buy this CD
B00005JLRT|3.0|First off, I've got to say I'm a huge Star Trek fan.  However, this is probably the first ST movie I've ever really been disappointed with.  I mean, ok... there was 5 with the god thing and everything, but...  I've loved STNG especially.  I've never thought they threw up an airbal until this one.  I agree with all reviewers about stale ideas, etc...  Why didn't Berman ever take the next logical step???  Its like the idiots with the Alien franchise.  Why didn't the Aliens ever make it to earth???  Same goes here.  Why didn't the Borg make it earth, ala the Wolf 357 tv episode???  Or, if Deep Space 9 was along the same time line, why didn't the Dominion make it to earth???  I know some people will say they did that in First Contact, but that's NOT the same thing, nor is it what First Contact was all about.  I just hope they get some new ideas and make better movies.  If not, I guess there will always be the hope of a Star Gate SG-1 movie!!!
0871359448|5.0|Marvel has the best cosmic stories in the industry and this is the best Marvel has to offer.  Not only do you have a rather awesome tale of a megalomanic gaining aboslute control over everything, but Jim Starlin's characterizations of dozens of core heroes are dead on.  <br />I would have prefered Starlin to have illustrated this himself, but Perez and Lim do admirable jobs in bringing this tome to life.
B000002L61|5.0|THIS is EXACTLY what metal should sound like. Dio knows EXACTLY what he's doing. He truly is the metal God. Since I got this cd yesterday, I seriously have not stopped listening to it. I got in trouble for listening to it at work today. When I think \\"metal\\", I think DIO!!!<br />The opener \\"We Rock\\" is one of the best openers I have ever heard. It just takes hold of you and rocks the hell out of you. It is so cool because in the chorus, when he shouts \\"we rock!\\", you know he's so right!! The whole band is incredible, and when they play together, they truly do rock. The title track \\"The Last In Line\\" is incredible also. It has an epic kind of sound, and the main synth line is mind-blowing.<br />The intro to \\"Breathless\\" absolutely freaked the hell out of me. The breathing thing is insanely weird and freaky. Dio sings so well throughout the album too. Trading off with Vivian Campbell's awesome guitar soloing, they make one of the best vocalist-guitarist duos ever. Plus, the rhythm section is amazing too. Vinny Appice is one of my favorite drummers, and Jimmy Bain tears it up. The production is excellent, you can hear all the instruments perfectly at all times.<br />My favorite songs are \\"We Rock\\", \\"The Last In Line\\", \\"I Speed At Night\\" (a great fast rocker), \\"Mystery\\" (a really catchy single), and \\"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\\". This last song is one of the greatest album closers in metal history. Its main riff is totally awesome, and the whole song is an epic adventure in that slow-paced Dio kind of way.<br />What more can I say? Every single song is a winner, with the possible exception of \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" which is kind of run-of-the-mill. But other than that one song, all the songs are top-notch metal. I couldn't have hoped for a better metal album. Dio typifies the perfect metal sound. He rocks, he knows it, and he sings about it.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|On the upside, this film turned out to be not nearly as bad as the reviews I had read would have led me to believe.  It had, in fact, a number of good aspects.  It was great to look at, and the special effects added considerably to the story.  Guy Pearce was good in the lead role, and Samantha Mumba was remarkably fetching as Mara, the woman he would meet 800,000 years in the future.<br />But there were just too many undeveloped or hard to swallow elements for this to be a good film, and it too often became merely unintelligible.  I have read Heidegger and Spinoza, Habermas and Derrida, Duns Scotus and Deleuze, so I can understand difficult texts and ideas when called to.  But there is a different between a merely difficult idea and an unintelligible one, and the central dilemma of this film--\\"Why can't I change the past?\\"--was dealt with in an unacceptably blithe and confused manner.  The \\"answer\\" as mouthed by Jeremy Irons, in a role that was more of a cameo than a real part, was unforgivably simplistic and superficial, not to say unconvincing.  But there were so many other moments that were so improbable that it was hard to take this movie seriously.  For instance, the Orlando Jones computer generated character appears not only in the early 21st century, but in the distant future as well, in the ruins of a former city.  What powered the computer that contained his database?  How did people hundreds of thousands of years in the future retain a perfect knowledge of the dead English language, and speak with a perfect accent?  How did our hero know that jamming the gears of his time machine would have the effect it would?  There were a host of other problems as well.<br />If you don't ask questions of this film, and don't expect it to deliver much, it can provide a couple of hours of delicious eye candy.  But if you try to force it to make sense, you will hate it.  In the former, you end up not taking it seriously, which is on one level to do it and its makers a disservice.  On the latter, however, you do them the compliment of taking the film seriously, but at the cost of condemning it.  I hope I can be forgiven for taking it as simple minded, light entertainment.sservice.

0393057658|5.0|I enjoyed reading this more than any other book I've read in a while. <BR>  It's about Billy Beane and how the A's have been run in the last couple of years.<BR>It has a lot about Bill James as well... and mentions Rob Neyer a few times. It's not even really about money, which is surprising, coming from Michael Lewis, and with the title.. It's about baseball. And it focuses on the A's, going all the way until January this year. <BR>As an A's fan, I'm worried that it gives away too many of Beane's secrets! <BR>ALthough, there is a passage that puts me to ease a little (page 241) <BR> <BR>\\"IF one didn't already know better, one might think that Voros McCracken's article on baseballprospectus.com would be cause for celebration everywhere inside big league baseball. One knew better. Voros knew better. 'The problem with major league baseball', he said, 'is that it's a self-populating institution. Knowledge is institutionalized. The people involved with baseball who aren't players are ex-players. In their defense, their structure is not set up along corporate lines. They aren't equipped to evaluate their own systems. They don't have the mechanism to let in the good and get rid of the bad. They either keep everytyhing or get rid of everything, and they rarely do the latter.' <BR> He sympathized with basball owners woh didnt' know what to think, or even if they should think. 'If you're an owner and you never played, do you believe Voros McCracken or Larry Bowa?' The unemployed former paralegal living with his parents, or the former All-Star shortstop and current manager who no doubt owned at least one home of his own?\\" <BR>Voros McCracken's astonishing discovery about major league pitchers had no apparent effect on the management, or evaluation, of actual pitchers. No one on the inside calld Voros to discuss his findings; so far as he knew, no one on the inside had even read it. But Paul DePodesta(assistant GM of the A's) had read it. Paul's considered reaction: 'If you want to talk about a guy who might be the next Bill James, Voros McCracken could be it.' Paul's unconsidered reaction: 'The first thing I thought of was Chad Bradford.\\" <BR> <BR>The article that Voros wrote is on baseballprospectus, about how pitchers don't control the hit percentage of balls in play, so the most important thing about them is the nubmer of strikeouts, walks, and home runs. [...]<BR>This is just one of the many great points about the way baseball is now analyzed.<BR>Run, don't walk, to get this.
B0000011P7|1.0|Ian Anderson's 1st solo album,well what's so different about that, virtually every Tull album since Mick Abrahams departure is an Ian solo album. Of course this had to happen in the early 80's when everyone made their stinky synthesizer robot boy album and this one's no exception. Like The Human League with a flute player. Very Un-Tull, so was Under Wraps; at least 'A' had Eddie Jobson, chops a plenty, and still a nod or two to the more earthy past. Pass on this one please!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is just plain amazing. Thom Yorke is a genius. Really.<br />All of Radiohead's albums are great, but this is the best.<br />If you're new to radiohead, get this album. Then get the Bends, then Kid A. Then do whatever you want.<br />Nigel Godrich is the best producer in the business today. There are so many hidden clicks and buzzes throughout the album, it's actually pretty crazy.<br />1. Airbag - Very likable song. Great setup. Good lyrics. It's extremely hard to dislike this song. Good opener. 4/5<br />2. Paranoid Android - Widely considered Radiohead's best song, it is one of their most complex. Basically a three part song, it is eerie, powerful, and sad.&lt;---Three parts. A highlight of the album. Everyone loves these lyrics. Listen for those clicks and buzzes I talked about, and also some voices in the back. 5/5<br />3. Subterranean Homesick Alien - The name comes from Bob Dylan's song, with a Blues instead of an Alien. Great song. Uses those floating guitar notes hinted at in Airbag, and my favorite part is the ending tone, which is absolutely mysterious in a crazy way. 4/5<br />4. Exit Music(For a Film) - That film is Baz Lurhmann's Romeo and Juliet. This is an incredible song that is reminiscent of Radiohead's later &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; from Amnesiac, but a little more accessible. A great build up with great lyrics in terms of Romeo and Juliet. Also is a great lead into the next song. 4/5<br />5. Let Down - The best song on the album. Full of floating guitar notes and bored but heartfelt lyrics, this is the most poignant song Radiohead have ever made. 5/5<br />6. Karma Police - This song introduced me to Radiohead when I saw the video. It's a great song, but it doesn't have the same effect as the others. Still, I can't imagine OK Computer without it. 3.8/4<br />7. Fitter Happier - This is a computer talking with some piano nonsense in the background. Cool the first few times, then it gets old, but then after a while you just listen to it as a part of the album. 2.5/4<br />8. Electioneering - At first my least favorite on the album, but it rocks pretty good. I like it a lot more now, but it's still my least favorite, other than Fitter Happier. 3/4<br />9. Climbing up the Walls -  Very creepy song, with distorted vocals and threatening lyrics. Kind of insane. 3.8/4<br />10. No Suprises - A much calmer tune then the preceding one, but no less affecting. It's got an upbeat tune, but very bored, disappointed lyrics and singing. Strangely powerful. 4/5<br />11. Lucky - Mixes the darkness of Climbing up the Walls with the suspense of the opening of Paranoid Android. A great soaring guitar line in the end. One of the best on the album. 5/5<br />12. The Tourist - At first, I didn't like this song. It was slow, boring, nothing happened. But now, it is behind Let Down for my favorite on the album. It is just plain awe inspiring and amazing. A perfect closer too. 5/5<br />Buy this. It's talked about so much, and there's a reason.
B000005RTG|4.0|I admit, on my first couple of listens I thought this Blackmoreless Purple wasn't quite right, but hey the band evolved into something a little different and Bolin was a guitar ace in his own right. There is some smokin' material here and it's a shame Bolin didn't live to follow this up. A vastly underrated album, as is the whole Coverdale/Hughes Purple era(how about an expanded version of Made In Europe ?), personally my favorite, though Stormbringer is a big dissappointment. This is the 2nd best Coverdale/Hughes material to the masterful Burn. If you passed it up years ago or didn't give it a good listen the first time around, pull this out and you'll be rewarded with a fresh listening experience.Just keep an open mind!!
B00008WT5E|5.0|The one question every fan asks when remasters come out--&quot;Do I really need to buy another version of an album I already own?&quot;  When talking about AC/DC's reissued POWERAGE, the answer is undeniably yes.  Malcolm has said in interviews that these re-releases sound louder, and he's right!  From the first chords of the CD, the difference between this and previous versions is crystal clear.  The guitars are stark, then bass is rumbling, the drums have an extra snappiness to them, and Bon's voice sounds brilliant.<BR>To me, this is AC/DC's finest moment, both musically and lyrically.  With this new tweaking by the likes of Mike Fraser (who's sat in for the past two studio albums as engineer), this is sonically AC/DC's finest moment as well.<BR>Bottom line, if you are going to buy one re-issue from the Sony digipaks, let it be this one.  It's absolutely brilliant!!
B000001ELL|3.0|Though overall not quite in the league with their 4 and 5 star albums. Dynasty certainly has some fine Kiss moments. To kick things off, \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\", the band's biggest hit(yes it did better than \\"Beth\\" and 'Rock And Roll All Nite\\"-do the homework),and a fabulous rock/disco crossover tune from the same era of The Stones \\"Miss You\\", Blondie's \\"Heart Of Glass\\", and Rod Stewart's \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy.\\" This was a great tune that fit \\"the times\\", something Kiss always strived for, to stay current while retaining their sound. Paul Stanley checks in with two more brilliant cuts, the near hit follow up \\"Sure Know Something\\", and the overlooked \\"Magic Touch\\".There are no less than three Ace Frehley cuts including The Stones cover \\"2000 Man\\",actually better than the original version, as well as his bratty \\"Hard Times\\" and the cool album closer \\"Save Your Love\\", one of those Kiss sleepers in the same league with Hotter Than Hell's \\"Strange Ways.\\" Peter Criss' \\"Dirty Livin'\\" is a good dance floor thumper, and the only cut he played on in the studio(Anton Fig did the rest-Criss was in an accident and had difficulty drumming for some time). The only downers are two weak Simmons cuts, \\"Charisma\\" and \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" which sound like Love Gun leftovers, and typical of some of his \\"half interested\\" output of the 80's to come, where the band practically took a back seat (he admits) to his other activities.Maybe a 3 1/2 is more like it.
B00008WG3U|5.0|all i can say is wow.. ever since i heard the regaining unconciousness cd i have been waiting for this to come out, and i'm definitely not dissapointed.. definitely some of nofx's best.. nice energy, political, and its NOFX! do yourself a favor and get this..
B000089RVX|5.0|No soy profesional en cual es mejor musica, pero me gusto mucho la cancion &quot;Going Under&quot;.<BR>Pero este disco esta muy padre, se los recomiendo.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Tupac realsed the frist double CD All Eyez On Me.It is considered a classic Cd among hiphop heads.Tupac shows his true rap skills in songs like Ambitionz Az a Ridah and Life goes on.If you dont have this CD youre not a true 2pac fan.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have had this CD for 2 years and I recently listened to it again. It blew me away! Even though it's old, it still keeps getting better. If you buy Meteora your definetly going to want this CD. Great music, great lyrics. Very nice.
B000075BFK|4.0|Better Days come nearly Seven years after Tupac death.This is also a very good Cd.Songs like Ghetto Star StreetFame mikes this CD worth while.There are also hints in this cd that 2pac might still be alive.You be the judge of that
B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon is perfect in this part. She plays an unbelievably sweet Cali blonde who really is just out to make the world a better place. It's hilarious and leaves you feeling good. <BR>If you liked &quot;Clueless&quot; a while back, you'll like this one.
0792833201|3.0|A lot of people complain that \\"The Ring\\" (my favorite horror movie) doesn't make sense. It does too- you just have to think about it. *Here*, however, is a movie that does not make sense. It's kind of fun, but ultimately just a bunch of random and increasingly eerie occurences, climaxing in a total freak-out. I don't understand how most of these strange happenings could be related to the Freelings building their house atop an old graveyard, particularly not that \\"powerful, angry soul\\" trip. Not only that, but the stupidity of the characters is remarkable (why the hell would you spend one last night in a haunted house before you move?). The special effects (which are not at all bad for 1982) are the best features. <BR>  I admit I was pretty scared while watching this movie, but as soon as it was over I realized the absurdity of the whole thing. The fear did not stick with me for even half an hour (unlike \\"The Ring\\", which has tempted me to sleep with my lights on every night since I watched it). To make matters worse, \\"Poltergeist\\" is nearly two hours long, and to me seemed to last about twice that amount of time. Trust me, there are better ways to spend your time.
B000000W9Z|5.0|I am generally not a fan of \\"concept\\" albums.  These albums require full listens in order to experience the whole story.  I'm more of a casual music lover.  That said, you simply have to listen to Outside one time from beginning to end in order to fully appreciate it.   Bowie's tale revolves around the theme of death as an artform.  Specifically, the ritualistic murder of a 14 year-old girl at the end of the 20th century, and its investigation by a private eye.  It's a dark tale that is taken to disturbing extremes in some places (Wishful Beginnings, specifically), but is somewhat lightened by some truly humorous pieces.  Also taking some of the edge off of the story is the passing of the year 2000.  The pre-millennial anxieties in the story have been rendered ineffective with the dawn of the new millennium 2 years ago.<BR>  There is quite a bit more to the story, but all in all, I think that \\"Outside\\" is exponentially more enjoyable as a simple collection of songs, and I recommend listening to it as such after 1 complete listen.   <BR>    Musically, \\"Outside\\" is another collaboration between Bowie and Brian Eno (the \\"berlin\\" trilogy of Heroes, Low, and Lodger were past collaborations).  Eno is a pioneer in electronic music and he is arguably one of the most creative artists in all of music. It shows here.  All conventions were obviously set aside when writing this album.  It is as unconventional and experimental as Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" albums would prove to be 4 years later,  but I find \\"Outside\\" to be far more interesting and enjoyable.  Though it's classified as a \\"rock\\" album, \\"Outside\\" contains elements of electronica, jazz, funk, grunge, industrial, and pop in nearly every single song.  It is perhaps the most eclectic album I've ever experienced.  It is definately unlike anything that I've ever heard before.  This unfamiliarity can be daunting.  The first time I heard \\"Outside\\", it literally exhausted me.  The combination of the demented story and the unfamiliar eeriness of the music took me to a place somewhere between depression, fear, and utter euphoria.  I was intrigued.  I perservered. I listened again.   I didn't begin to enjoy \\"Outside\\" until I became familiar with each track.  It's strange.  There have been albums that have \\"grown on me\\" in the past, but \\"Outside\\" continues to do so with each listen, even 7 years later.  It's a great collection of some of Bowie's greatest songs ever recorded.  The backstory is always there, but I again advise you to use it only as a means to give meaning to the lyrics of the individual songs.  \\"Outside\\" is a phenominal album that you simply have to experience.  It ranks among my top 10 favorites of all time.  It's more than enough to make me forgive the whole \\"Tin Machine\\" thing.
B00004U60I|5.0|I first purchased the VHS and as soon as the DVDs were available, I snatched those up!  There's a really nice feature on some (don't know if it's all of them) of the editions that allows you to setup the DVD to play in a continual loop. I can't tell you how many times I used that feature for me to fall asleep on the sofa near my now 3yo when he couldn't go to sleep at 4am. My 8yo daughter and my son LOVE to watch the entire Baby Einstein series, altho they do like some more than others. They laugh at the puppets and they dance to the music. Boy do they dance! I really think the Baby Einstein series has helped my daughter learn to love classical music, and I hope it has the same effect on my son too.
0790729350|5.0|great movie for people who didn't make the festival.  Gives you a small, but detailed sight of what the great time was like.
0790729342|5.0|One of the things I like best about this edition is that the voice-over at the beginning is the original Australian accent.  I have come across versions of the film where they dubbed over with an American accent and it's distracting and out of place.  Same goes with the original Mad Max - to truly appreciate that one, you want the original Australian dialogue. <BR>This is the movie that made me fall in love with Mel Gibson once upon a time.  It's not one of those movies that falls easily into &quot;guy thing&quot; or &quot;chick flick&quot; categories.  Worth catching!
B000089RVX|4.0|At last count, there are 588 reviews of this on Amazon, so what can I, a \\"serious music lover\\" add to this? A different perspective perhaps, which adds up to \\"guilty pleasure\\", nothing more, nothing less.<br />Evanescence has come out of nowhere, really. Two tracks on last year's \\"Daredevil\\" soundtrack has caused all the buzz, and now we have their debut album, which is a mix of \\"goth\\" tracks such as the terrific \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Bring Me to Life\\" and ballads such as \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\". The thing that catches me are the rocking tracks, with Ben Moody's catchy guitar hooks. Amy Lee's vocals are outstanding as well throughout.<br />Do I think that Evanescence will make a lasting impact on the music scene? I doubt it, frankly. But \\"Fallen\\" is a thouroughly enjoyable listen all the way through. What a guitly pleasure!

B00005OWEG|3.0|This was one of the greatest war movies ever.  The &quot;Redux&quot; version is way too long.  It loses focus with the added scenes.  I highly recommend the original compared to this.
B000065V1V|4.0|I must confess that I am not much of a David Bowie fan. In fact \\"Heathen\\" is the only David Bowie cd I own. However I have always admired the thin white duke from afar. Like Madonna, David Bowie has been able to adapt to the constant changing in popular msuic. I picked up \\"Heathen\\" last year for the sake of curiousity. I had been hearing nothing but good things about \\"Heathen\\" on the message boards I post on. Initially the music didn't leave much an impact on me then. At the time I didn't think it was spectaculat but definitely not terrible. I recently started listening to \\"Heathen\\" this week and found myself enjoying this cd more than I did when I first bought it last year. I love the opening track \\"Sunday\\". It is almost goth-like with its haunting melodies. In fact \\"Heathen\\" does have a goth-like quality to its overall sound. David Bowie definitely is one of the best male vocalists around, next to Nick Cave, Dave Gahan and Andrew Eldritch. I can't really compare \\"Heathen\\" to Bowie's previous albums but for some reason \\"Slip Away\\" reminds me a lot like \\"Space Oddity\\". It has that retro feel to the song. The stand out track on this album for me has to be \\"Everyone says 'Hi'\\". The song is an incredibly infectious and hard not to sing along to when listening to the song. I am so glad that I gave \\"Heathen\\" another chance. It is one of those albums that sounds better months later after the purchase.
B000005J08|5.0|I remember vividly my first encounter with this CD, I was in a band and (I happen to think at the time we were pretty good) we were all sitting around after a practice session going over ideas and the drummer (the infamous Dick \\"O\\") got every bodies attention and hushed us and hit the play button. Nobody spoke for easily 15 minutes (that's about 4 tracks into the CD) I was stunned to the point of silence, at that time in my life that was a rare occurrence. This is an unbelievable CD, crazily diverse at moments sappy and others brash and noisy but always very cool and masterfully played by all involved. If you are a musician running out of ideas or in a dry spell (I don't care what you play) this will save your life.
B000002HGD|4.0|I consider Moby one of the best techno artists around to date. I find his music so soothing to listen to (except for that horrid \\"Animal Rights\\" cd). I didn't get into Moby until his breakout smash \\"Play\\" thanks to a former roommate who played that cd constantly. That was back in '99 and before \\"Play\\" was all over television and movies. After falling in love with \\"Play\\", I eventually bought Moby's underground classic \\"Everything is Wrong\\". Although \\"Everything is Wrong\\" isn't nearly as flawless as \\"Play\\" or \\"18\\", it is still an excellent Moby album. I wasn't (and still isn't) wild about the guitar-oriented tracks \\"All That I need is to be Loved\\" and \\"What Love\\". I just didn't think those songs flowed well on a mostly ambient cd. I wasn't crazy about the hip hop influenced track \\"Let's Go Free\\" either. Thankfully it was only 37 seconds long. I thought those two songs were the weakest tracks on \\"Everything is Wrong\\". Songs that I did enjoy was the opening track \\"Hymn\\" with its gorgeous piano melodies. The same with the epic \\"God Moving Over the Face of the Waters\\" and the stunning gospel-influenced \\"When It's Cold I'd Like to Die\\". Although flawed, \\"Everything is Wrong\\" is a beautiful piece of work that Moby produced and an excellent introduction to his greatness as an artist.

0385504209|4.0|As has been mentioned, the main thrust of this plot has been covered in &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; (which this book does credit.)<br />However, most of the book moves rather quickly, until the last hundred pages where the author gets a little carried away with the symbol deciphering and a lot of different locations.<br />I have read (and loved) all of the author's other books, but this is the only one that didn't seem to have it's plot as well-thought out as the others.<br />But I am just nit-picking: it's very refreshing to have a thriller-writer who can lift the genre into a new intellectual realm.<br />I recommend this book (as with all of Dan Brown's books) very strongly: for a quick read and something interesting to learn.
0679746048|4.0|Susanna Kaysen dealt with mental and psychic pain in a fairly common way: an attempted suicide. The year was 1967, the infancy of psychotropic drugs, when psychotherapy was in its hey-day. Girl Interrupted is Kaysen's memoir of two years spent in an expensive and exclusive psychiatric unit, previous guests having been Sylvia Plath, James Taylor, and Ray Charles, among others.<BR>The wit, wisdom, wackiness, and lyricism of 'a madhouse' come through clearly in the author's writing, and she offers vivid and insightful accounts of daily life, her fellow 'guests,' and the link between art and madness which often manifests itself in manic depression, or as we have lately been taught to say, Bipolar Disorder.<BR>A good read, and a pretty good movie...
B00005T30L|5.0|What a beautiful film.Viewing it is satisfying, and just delicious.But once you view it, I swear it leave an impact on you forever.Just a perfect film-all the way through.The first time I saw it, I watched halfway through, and decided that it was overhyped, then a year later, I decided to give it another shot, just to see if maybe there was some chance that all the hype was true.God, after really seeing this movie,I can say that what \\"hype\\" it got was nothing at all.This movie deserved so much more.Steve Buscemi gives an oscar caliber performance.Brilliant from the very first word he utters, and heartwrenching all to the biter end.My God, what a brilliant actor.Thora Birch is the perfect heroine.She gives you no reason to love her, or even like her.But her humanity, end up winning you over in the end.Scarlett Johansson is such an interesting and captivating character.The script was perfect-without trying too hard.This is the kind of movie that rips your soul up inside, without letting you shed a single tear.I'm afraid that most teens will be too embarassed to truly understand this movie.But, if you're willing to sit down and watch a movie which hits home, then I swear this is what you need.Perfect music.Just a stunning film.
0688163173|5.0|I was initially disappointed that Lehand had deviated from his Boston detective duo twice in a row (following Mystic River), but a few sentences into Shutter island, I forgot all about Patrick and Angie. The writing is atmospheric and spooky, and while those who've read many thrillers (or seen many film thrillers) may figure out the twist early on, the development of the characters and the quality of the writing prevent any disappointment.  My only word of warning and something of a spoiler - don't expect the standard happy ending.
0316666343|2.0|I read this book to see if it could be possibly as good as it has been hyped, and because I heard the author interviewed on the radio and felt sympathy for her horrific experience. One of the blurbs proclaimed that this book would be as classic as To Kill A Mockingbird. I don't think so. A classic is a book that transcends time, whereas this is a book that very much speaks to our anxieties of the moment, while the Jon Benet and the Elizabeth Smart cases are still in our minds, and our nation has been terrorized by an evil man just like this child was. It seemed to have too much that was unnecessary to the story. What was the point of Ruth's meandering around New York?
B00005JKZV|5.0|...  <br />This movie is a triumph in adaptation from book to film.  Most people realize that you simply cannot put the level of detail (Tolkien's is extensive--I, too, have read him and love him) in a movie and make it commercially viable.  Understandably, some portions of the storyline have been altered to make the visual experience better and the plot clear enough for a non-reader to follow.<br />At the end of the movie, Gollum mentions bringing Sam and Frodo to \\"her\\" to be killed.  He is referring to Shelob, the great spider-like monster.  The portion of the story which includes her has been put in \\"The Return of the King,\\" not eliminated.<br />The collection of talent assembled for this trilogy is amazing.  All of the actors did excellent jobs and created a believable atmosphere of \\"Middle Earth.\\"  The actors and actresses were selected for their resemblance to the characters described in the book, so their looks were appropriate.  There is still plenty of eye candy, though.  I thought Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and Karl Urban especially yummy.  The ladies were classy and attractive.  This cast is one of the best international groups assembled on one project.<br />The bottom line:  This is definitely a movie worth buying.  It's a keeper and will become a classic for sure.  Enjoy!
1577311523|1.0|Eckhart, like others, states that problems are \\"mind-made\\". This reminds me of the theory that there is no such thing as good and evil. He claims that problems are \\"only situations to be dealt with now, or to be left alone and accepted as part of the isness of the present moment until they change or can be dealt with\\". I thought the truth would be easier to understand.<br />\\"...You cannot fight the pain-body. Trying to do so would create inner conflict and thus further pain. Watching it is enough\\". In other words, if a criminal breaks into your house with the intention of harming you, don't fight him, this would create conflict, just watch him harm you because \\"you cannot fight the darkness\\". Even though he managed to 'reach enlightenment' shortly after suffering from anxiety and suicidal depression, he somehow still believes that we cannot fight the darkness.<br />He later states that 'the way of the cross' is the old way to enlightenment. Isn't the way to enlightenment the same for everyone? If Eckhart believed in equality and fairness, he would also believe that there is only one way to enlightenment. Besides, if Eckhart really has reached enlightenment, why is he still alive? Surely there would be no reason to have a physical body once having reached enlightenment.<br />The book's main message is: practice 'awareness'. Though an important practice, there is no need to write a whole book on it. Awareness can be taught in one short sentence: Be aware of your surroundings, what you are doing, and the information from your five senses.<br />Arnold Krumm-Heller, Helene Petrovna Blavatsky and Samael Aun Weor's books sound a little closer to the truth to me. Any particular book? I'd recommend Revolutionary Psychology by Samael...
B000063USY|2.0|It's impossible for anybody to deny that this movie has probably had the biggest impact on teenagers than any other movie in the past 5 years. And just like the movie, it's all gone to hell. <br />The whole plot is really very ridiculous - shooting ropes from TINY imports and trying to hijack a truck at 80 mph. Unsurprisingly, the movie gets less intelligent in the minutes following. When I looked around the theatre I was saddened to see all the teenagers gasping at which car had the biggest wing or the louder exhaust. Anybody who really works on cars knows that these RIDICULOUS \\"ricers\\" are painfully slow. Of course, nobody minded this and even the SLOWEST of cars was peeling out and hopping curbs trying to impress their buddies as they left the theatre.<br />The movie then takes a sharp turn away from racing for the next hour. It really bogs down when Brian starts dating \\"Doms\\" sister and somehow an asian gang is introduced to all of this. The racial stereotypes are also quickly broken out: the foolish whiteboy, the gangster asian, the stupid black, the drug dealing mexicans.<br />I haven't lost sight that this is a fun movie but it was just a little to ridiculous. You are guaranteed to laugh as Brian goes to warp speed when he hits his nitrous, or when Vin Disel says \\"you almost blew the welds on your intake\\", and the infamous floorboard panel flying into oblivion. The movie might have been better if it portrayed more realistic racing and added more domestics. The special effects were too fake and over-the-top for me to believe.
0446608955|5.0|this book was exquisit! If you haven't read it READ IT. Read the book before you see the movie even though it follows quite well it will ruin the fantastic story. A Walk to Remember is by far my favorite book.
B00004TKAQ|5.0|One of the two greatest live (non-bootleg) performances of a '60s San Francisco band around -the other being &quot;Bless Its Pointed Little Head&quot; by the Jefferson Airplane. I first heard Happy Trails when it was first released, and only recently got the CD. Despite a couple of decades between the time I last listened to it and today, the music was a fresh and creative, and exciting as ever. It had lost nothing of its power and spacey appeal and could easily hold its own against any contemporary band if released for the first time today. Anyone who'se serious about music ought to own Happy Trails -and &quot;Bless Its Pointed Little Head&quot;, too.
B00008NRI8|4.0|Great light movie! Perfect for nights when you want to watch a well written, genuinely funny, romantic movie. I thought this was much better than Notting Hill. Julia Roberts may have a fabulous smile but she's cardboard on screen in that one. Sandra Bullock is hilarious as the over achiever saving the world though some of her pratfalls were overdone. Wonderful scene in the restaurant when Hugh Grant is putting his ice into her water glass and she's taking the soft part out of her bread and putting it on his plate. Nice way of showing how they complement each other with their differences. <br />Some of the reviews here confused me when they refer to the \\"sweet\\" character who is hired to replace Sandra Bullock after she gives the two weeks notice.  Say What???  Hello??? Her replacement is a conniver of the first order, determined to sleep her way to the top. She brown noses Sandra to get the job, then sets her sights on Hugh with feigned small town innocence. Clue: suggesting a game of strip chess is not typical behavior for truly \\"sweet\\" characters!
0151008116|5.0|Canadian writer Yann Martel's spectacular novel \\"Life of Pi\\" is about a boy and his perplexed inquisitive journey through life. He is a boy of Indian origin. <br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is a story of this amazing boy Piscine Molitol who due to the deliberate distortion of his first name to \\"pissing\\", obviously likes to be called as Pi as the irrational number Pi is pronounced. This is the story of Pi and an elegant and monstrous Royal Bengal Tiger, both of them are entrapped in a lifeboat, the struggle for survival, outmaneuvering nature and clinging on the ingenuity of instinct and his steadfast belief in multiple faiths, namely, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, makes this story a memorable one. <br />Along with its serious theme of life and death, this novel is quite funny as well. Pi's earlier childhood was full of nostalgic memories in the middle of a zoo that his father owned. There was the atheist teacher who opens Pi's eyes on nature the way he never had seen before. Pi's successive journey to a Church, Mosque and a Temple, made him embrace each of these religions simultaneously. For Pi, each of these religions offered him a sense of peace that he did not wish to renounce by accepting any one specific religion and denouncing others. And Atheism had its own appeal to him as well. <br />If you read one book this summer, read this one. This is an unforgettable novel.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I'm a fan of Enigma. I love it. Enigma is #1 new release I am watching for in stores and/or on Amazon.com and as soon it comes out I buy it. Along with Enigma I love Deep Forest, Amethystium and few others. Enigma is one of the best New Age \\"artists\\". I recommend all Enigma CDs to every New Age music fan and not only.<BR>Excellent and wonderful music and even if it is not 100% what I would like it to sound, but it is one of the best so far on the market.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Buy This CD, you won't be disappointed. Extremely well written and has the Vibe that we've come to expect from Jack. Some songs are reworked but who cares...with a slue of new material that rivals Brushfire Fairytales. Go ahead and buy it now because you will end up buying it later. Jack's sophomore release proves that he will only get better.
B00005JLO2|1.0|This is a terrible remake of the two previous movies.  I would recommend either one over this waste of film.  <br />This movie followed the typical Hollywood formula of romance and violence rather than telling a story.  Romance to attract the women and violence & a little sex for the men.  The story line was lost in in the emphasis on romance & violence.  Characters were not developed.  The movie jumped around and left a lot to the watchers imagination.  <br />I walked away from the movie with a bad taste in my mouth and wondered why I had wasted my time watching it.  Maybe I was hoping it would get better but it didn't!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Forget all about people telling you to &quot;feel&quot; the music.  Dont listen to the people saying that it &quot;moves&quot; you.  What most people nowadays seem to forget to do is &quot;listen&quot; to the music.  This album rules solely for its amazing soundscapes, and musical merit.  Theres a reason that among all of my cds of extremely varied artists, there are maybe only 4 or 5 that I can always listen to and not get bored of.  And this cd is absolutely at the very top of the list.  I would write song highlights, except I'd have to list all of them.  I guess thats why this cd rules so much.  If you're in for instant gratification (top ten hits etc) this album probably isnt for you.  If you enjoy listening to music, and I mean listening, go for it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|... I thought the Two Towers was an excellent ADAPTATION of the book. Sure, there were elements that were left out or changed as a consequence of artistic license but to expect the movie to be absolutely faithful to the books--... ... Who cares whether Pippin used his mouth rather than his hands (or vice versa) to remove the Elven Broach? ... ...this is FICTION!<br />Gollum was spectacular!<BR>Ian McKelleran was brilliant!<BR>The battle for Helm's Deep was amazing!<br />Accurate to the book? Not exactly...A great ADAPTATION...definitely.<br />...
B000002LLC|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable music without the baggage normally associated with a Madonna album.  However Vogue is totally out of place here.
B000083E79|5.0|A pillar of pop culture since the 60s, Cher has had many compilations released over the years in her name, but none were as definitive as this 2003 release 'The Very Best Of Cher'. Gathering songs from every era, from her days as duet partner to Sonny Bono to her recent role as club music queen, this collection is the perfect sampler of Cher hits for the casual fan and a perfect starter for new fans.<BR>  The album opener is Cher's number one dance smash 'Believe', from her 1998 album of the same name. Other cuts present from that album are diva anthems 'Strong Enough' and 'All Or Nothing'. Her most recent studio album 'Living Proof' yields the powerful 'Song For The Lonely' and the Rodney 'Darkchild' Jerkins remix of 'Different Kind Of Love Song'. Her mid-90s club classic 'One By One', remixed by the notorious Junior Vasquez, is also featured.<BR>  Some of her best rock pop hits from the late 80s into the early 90s also put on a good show here, the most easily recognized being the Diane Warren penned power pop of 'If I Could Turn Back Time'. The hits 'Just Like Jesse James' and 'Save Up All Your Tears' also feature the words of Ms. Warren. Michael Bolton turned out the suprisingly excellent 'I Found Someone' for Cher, while she duets with Peter Cetera on the ballad 'After All'. 'Heart Of Stone' proves to be another strong rocker, as this era for Cher closes with her infectious take on the classic 'The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)'.<BR>  In the early 70s, Cher released three of her all time best singles - 'Gypsies, Tramps, & Thieves', 'Half-Breed', and 'Dark Lady'. Incredibly catchy with an interesting story behind each track, all three went to number one on the Billboard chart. In the late 70s she mounted the first of many comebacks however, this time with a disco record called 'Take Me Home'. This record was a top ten hit, and was more recently reworked by British pop star Sophie Ellis-Bextor into her solo debut single 'Take Me Home (A Girl Like Me)'.<BR>Cher started her career as singing partner and wife to the late Sonny Bono, creating the undeniable classics 'I Got You Babe' and 'The Beat Goes On', both of which are featured here. While she sang with Sonny, she did manage to do a few solo songs as well, two of which make the cut here - 'All I Really Wanna Do' and 'Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)'. An excellent beginning to an epic music career.<BR>   Widely varied and always good, Cher is perhaps the only star who could been called the Queen of Pop before the likes of Madonna made her appearance in the 80s. Truly a musical original, and this album illustrates that perfectly. A must buy!
B00008AWOD|4.0|'Sleeping With Ghosts' is actually a very good albume; it contains a lot of good songs, which include (in my opinion) 'Special Needs', 'English Summer Rain', 'Sleeping With Ghosts' and 'Centrefolds'. However, there are some songs in the albume, that you just skip, and not listen at all. It's not that they're terrible music, but it's just not as original, and moving as the songs I mentioned. That is why my satisfaction becomes partial.<br />Placebo has always had an indie style; a lot of the sounds they produced had some unconventional quality to them. And that's what we like about them, maybe. Therefore, 'Sleeping With Ghosts' is lovable, in this sense, that it is Placebo's most indie-like albume. Brian Molko adds the piano's affective sound to the songs even more beautifullably. 'Special Needs' and 'Centrefolds' are one of these songs. I agree with the other reviewers that 'Centrefolds' resembles 'Blue American' or 'Peeping Tom' rather, that it has a closing, ending atmosphere to it, which makes the song even more saddening than ever.<br />'English Summer Rain' and 'Sleeping With Ghosts' are really moving songs. These songs really take you away. 'The Bitter End' and 'Protect Me From What I Want' are more intense songs, that sometimes become intolerable. Some songs, such as 'Something Rotten' contain too much electronic sounds and effects. I think they make the songs a little artificial and futuristic; this causes the albume to lose its emotional effect at one level.<br />Overall, if the question is whether you should buy the albume or not, I will say 'if you really want to...' Real Placebo fans, will not be able to refrain themselves from purchasing the albume, either. No, I think the albume's worth listening and having. But, you might also want to take your friend's cd, listen to it for a while, and return it. For those who haven't listened to Placebo yet: buy 'Without You I'm Nothing' first, to see how the group's music was initially; since it has differed in 'Sleeping With Ghosts' a lot.
6304057709|5.0|With an engaging plot, witty dialogue, and consummate acting by an all-star British cast (there really isn't one performance that could even be described as mediocre here!), this is one of the most delightful films I've seen.  Emma Thompson received a well-deserved Oscar for this splendid screen adaption of Jane Austen's classic novel.  Indeed, it is rare that I enjoy a dramatisation more than the novel, but I must confess that I did so here. <br />This is a story about love and propriety in early 19th-century England, and it follows a chapter in the lives of the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet).  Their lives (together with those of their mother (Gemma Jones) and youngest sister) have been thrown into disarray by the death of their father (Tom Wilkinson), whose estate has been left to his son by a previous marriage (James Fleet--The Vicar of Dibley's Hugo).  At a time when money not only was equated with privilege and power but was essential for one's very survival, Elinor and Marianne, having neither an independent income nor dowries, are in the unenviable position (unlike Austen's Emma) of having to make a good marriage whilst having little but their appearance and personalities to recommend them. <br />Marianne, however, (the younger of the two) is an impetuous, idealistic romantic, for whom love must be some great all-consuming passion or it simply isn't love.  She wears her heart on her sleeve, and when \\"love\\" strikes in the dashing form of the dynamic Mr. Willoughby (Greg Wise) whom she takes to be a kindred spirit, she succumbs to her emotions.  Her overwhelming passion leads her to lose all common sense and act with reckless impropriety.  <br />Marianne's love is of the kind idealised by the Romantic poets and authors of the time (of which Austen was NOT one!)--the kind of love which cares not a toss for propriety, reputation or other societally imposed values.  It is also, alas, oblivious to boring monetary concerns such as wealth or poverty--concerns which in the cold light of day (and as the story bears out) few could disregard for all their talk to the contrary, and which were ultimately the deciding factor in many a marriage.   <BR>  <BR>Realistic rather than romantic, Elinor is of a calmer, more reserved nature, and not the sort to indulge in her emotions.  Indeed, if any fault can be found with her behaviour, it is that she is, perhaps, a little too reserved as even the object of her affections is unaware of her true feelings!  That said, she behaves sensibly, with dignity, and with concern for others, regardless of what she may be feeling inside (and this is also true of the gentlemen in the story--the real gentlemen, that is--played by Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant).  <br />Though set some 200 years ago, this is truly a film of timeless value.  If you've enjoyed the Firth/Ehle version of Pride and Prejudice in particular or you enjoy period productions in general, you'll definitely want to check this one out.  But it's such a good film all around--clean, warm-hearted and with plenty of comic relief--that I believe it's appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone looking for quality entertainment that the whole family can enjoy.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it most highly, and I look forward to reading the companion book: The Sense and Sensibility Screenplay and Diaries by Emma Thompson.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|As someone who has followed and loved Fleetwood Mac over the years....i will say that this album is ok.....but not their best. If anyone needed any proof of the heart and soul that Christine brought to Fleetwood Mac...this is it!<br /><br /> Now...before everyone starts waiving their fists at me...let me say some things. Nobody has to tell me how brilliant Lindsey Buckingham is...beleive me...i know! He is a criminally under-rated guitarist....and he is every bit as good as Peter Green (from Macs original line-up)... if not better! But the REALITY is...Christine is responsible for writing and singing a large chunk of their classic tunes...granted, with Lindseys excellent producing and engineering skills.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac is one of a small handfull of bands in history in which every single member of the group is incredibly gifted (like the Eagles, Led Zep,the Beatles, Queen and the Who etc... etc...)<br /><br /> Lindsey is DEFINATELY a visionary.....but he really needs a counter-balance in the band to settle him down....Stevie can't do it...but Christine can! After listening to the album a few times now...i will admit that SOME of the songs are starting to grow on me (especially \\"Red Rover\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\"). The new studio version of \\"Bleed to love her\\" is no match for the live version on \\"The Dance\\"..and should have been left alone! But..having said all of that....i still say it is a good album...and in an era of disposable pop tunes and \\"flavor of the month\\" groups that are pre-manufactured by the record companies themselves...i will take anything i can get!<br /><br /> It is good...but not as good as Bruce Springsteens or Elton Johns latest albums.It makes a body wonder who is going to replace all of these older..super talented bands....there doesn't seem to be anyone on their level..waiting to take the baton.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The first Harry Potter in my opinion was lackluster it was chopped up left out alot of stuff and didnt keep me intrested all that long well the second one changed that this movie is the follow up to number 1 but only 10 times better seems the actors and actresses evolved more more into the script and the plot has alot more action and mystery into it anyways buy this dvd its really really good i like all the special effects including the spider scene
B000050IE6|5.0|Ahem...<BR>Have you ever discovered something so astoundingly great, entirely unexpectedly that you where totally blown away? <BR>That's exactly what happened with me when I got this album. <BR>I had developed an interest in the Metal and was going through the big metal bands catalogs when I noticed the reviews for this album and downloaded 'The Moor '.<BR>Oh boy!!!<BR>From the first listen I knew that this was a band that surpassed anything in that I had heard before. Opeth have a great heavy sections and their acoustic passages have a kind of exquisitetexture and depth I have not heard in any other band. Michael's death vocals sound like the roar of a lion (...R0AAARRRRRRRR) unlike those in other death bands which sound like the YAAW...RRRRR of a cat(eg Children of Bodom, which is not to say that they are bad).<BR>It is due to Still Life being my first Opeth album and the story in it being more easily understandable than MAYH or Blackwater Park that I consider this my favourite. All the songs in the album are excellent (though Serenity Painted Death ends quite abruptly). The music of Opeth could be best described as a sort of transtional metal, with the different tunes melding seamlessly with one another. This is done best in the Morningrise album but is as prevalent here as any other Opeth album. The album is best heard at a stretch but I'll still give a trackwise breakdown,<br />1. The Moor - The brilliant opener to a brilliant album, this begins with a long quiet solo which gives way to an acoustic passage which moves to an awesome heavy riff. Then come the heavy vocals which quite appropriately reflect the mood of the protagonist on his return to the village form where he was outcasted and humiliated. Then the clean vocals come in with some of the best lyrics to this point. This was the song that introduced me to Opeth and is my favourite on this album - 5/5<BR>2. Godhead's Lament - Any other band given the riff that begins this song would use it as the main riff throughout the song. Opeth on the other hand porgress to show how poor it really is by following it with a barrage of even better riffs. The clean vocals on this song are really striking - 5/5<BR>3. Benighted  - This track quite experimental and one of the relatively weaker tracks in the album, but it picks up toward the end as you start to get the tune, and it falls into place with the start of drumming - 4/5 <BR>(Note:The tracks Still Day Beneath the Sun, and Patterns in the Ivy II from the second disc of the Blackwater Park album are similar but much better)<BR>4. Moonlapse Vertigo - By this time Opeth have served up so many great melodies that you would think they would have exhausted their resources. No sir!!! - 5/5<BR>5. Face of Melinda - this song has an extruciating pacing that I really love about Opeth. It starts out mellow and acoustic and ends with one of the most electrifying riffs ever. This is song gives a stronger kick than an out and out headbanger even without trying - 5 + awesome outro riff/5 <BR>6. Serenity Painted Death - this is a heavy song appropriately reflecting the violence in the lyrics. Another good song but, ends quite disconcertingly in mid-flight - 4/5<BR>7. White Cluster - this is one of the most accesible songs in the album despite being really heavy. You really have to watch out for what happens after the 5:30 mark. Godly - 5/5<br />Whatever I said in this review doesn't even begin to do justice to this album, I don't really like to act as a raving fanboy but Opeth really have me hooked.<BR>The value of five stars is really brought down when most bands get it. On the other hand giving 5 stars for this album is really depreciating its value. Get this album, I beg, plead and coerce you, all for your sake, GET this album.
1401200613|5.0|This book is incredible! Everyone who is a fan of Batman should buy it, and amazon is sell it for a great price buy two and shipping is free.   The art is incredible and storywriting performance is great but you don't have to take my word I'm only 14 yrs old, but very, very smart for my age!!!  And Jim Lee is the most coolest artist.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie was definitely one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in quite a while. Ben Stiller was perfectly clueless as male supermodel Derek Zoolander.  He played his part flawlessly and had some very great lines. I am usually an Owen Wilson fan, but he wasn't at his best in this movie. Still, Wilson's character Hansel adds an important element to the movie. If anyone is looking for a whole lot of laughs, come see this movie!
B00005B36H|5.0|You cannot go wrong with buying this album. I own every Tool album, and Lateralus is easily the best. It's one hour and twenty minutes of absolutely amazing music. Some songs on this cd will put your brain on another planet, and change the way you think about life. <br />Even though this cd is long, it never seems hard to listen to or digest. I've had this album since May of 2001, and I still listen to it religiously today. This album is a CLASSIC, and no rock fans collection is complete without it. Please, if you don't already have this cd, get is A.S.A.P. If you don't, your depriving yourself of a true classic.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I got this CD expecting many songs along the lines of &quot;Fighter&quot; and &quot;Dirrty,&quot; both songs I had heard on the radio. However, the majority of this CD consists of slower, bluesy songs and some ballads. However, the song &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; was an upbeat, entertaining song and more of what I expected from this CD. The song &quot;Impossible,&quot; which has Alicia Keys in it, is very bluesy, but has a nice feel to it. And, as I knew from the radio, both &quot;Fighter&quot; and &quot;Dirrty&quot; are great songs.  I'd reccommend this CD to someone looking for a CD filled with slower songs.
B00005U122|5.0|Leaves no doubt about the genius behind the Floyd. Excellent musicianship that brings it all home.
B000001EHS|3.0|[BEFORE I START THIS REVIEW, THIS CD IS THE ONE THAT INTRODUCED ME TO DEF LEPPARD. I AM A HUGE DEF LEPPARD FAN AND WHILE THIS CD IS A DECENT INTRODUCTION, I FEEL IT DOESN'T DO THE BAND JUSTICE. KEEP THIS IN MIND.]<BR><BR>     Now that aside, I just want to say \\"wow\\". I don't think I could have been introduced to D.L. any other way than with Vault. While \\"Vault\\" is highly controversial by many fans as being the \\"overloaded hysteria song\\" album, I have come to the conclusion that you shouldn't judge this cd by that one statement alone. Not one, but yes six songs from the hysteria album on this cd is inexcusable to me. This left absolutely no room for any songs from \\"On Through The Night\\". While their debut album doesn't really sound like any of their later music I still feel that it should have been represented by at least one or two songs on Vault. D.L. does not compile their best songs from each of their previous albums on Vault. <BR><BR>     To me, a greatest hits album should compile the best of all their previous albums. I'm not just talking about D.L. here either; I'm talking about any band that wants to make a greatest hits album. That is one of the reasons why I rated Vault with three stars. The 2nd reason I rated Vault with three stars is because some of the songs on Vault were shortened. It is good because it allows them to make room for more songs. It is bad because when songs are shortened i.e. Rocket, they lose the \\"meat.\\"<BR><BR>Finally my 3rd reason for rating Vault with 3 stars, can simply be put in three words: too many ballads. I'm not saying ballads are a terrible thing, but that's overkill.. Again, this comes back to the hysteria overload topic I mentioned earlier. Another point I want to make about greatest hits cds, they should be well rounded. By that, I mean that the greatest hits cd should have songs that equally represent the band.<BR><BR>Ok now I will break down each song and justify my reason why I think it should be on the cd or not be.<BR><BR>1. Pour Some Sugar On Me - This song definitely earned its spot on Vault. I have no problem with it. <BR><BR>2. Photograph - Again, definitely earned its spot. No problem here. <BR><BR>3. Love Bites - One of many ballads on Vault, D.L. should have placed them all on a second cd along with Vault. But as far as the song itself, brilliant lyrics, really hits the heart. <BR><BR>4. Let's Get Rocked - This song is starting to hint toward their \\"pop\\" attitude but doesn't quite make it there. Definitely has a unique approach. <BR><BR>5. Two Steps Behind (acoustic version) - Ok I have a major problem with this one. Since there are two versions of this song (other being electric) they should have obviously placed both on the album. For example, place the acoustic version with the other ballads, and the electric with the other rockers.<BR><BR>6. Animal - I have some mixed feelings about this song. It doesn't really fit well when you place it along with the rest of the songs. It's right up there with the caliber of \\"Let's Get Rocked.\\"<BR><BR>7. Foolin - Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this ballad is one of the ones that started it all for D.L.'s many ballads to come. I think it fits well with the other ballads on Vault. <BR><BR>8. Rocket - This song got really butchered in Vault. It lost nearly two minutes of instrumental. What was D.L. thinking? <BR><BR>9. When Love and Hate Collide - Ok I like this song a lot. I don't understand why a lot of people say this is just another mediocre ballad. It's one of their newer ballads so this could be why. This song definitely hits home for lots and that's why it is one of my favorites. <BR><BR>10. Armageddon It - This song is just plain hilarious. Listen to it a few times and watch the music video and you will see what I mean.<BR><BR>11. Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad? - Girls really love this song and D.L. doesn't know why. Well it's obvious guys! It is a very sentimental song with emotional lyrics that's bound to break anyone into tears. This song really hits home for me.<BR><BR>12. Rock of Ages - Definitely a ROCK N ROLL song if I ever heard one. KISS and TWISTED SISTER are proud. <BR><BR>13. Hysteria - This song I have mixed feelings about. It doesn't really fit well with the ballads. Don't get me wrong it's an awesome song but it just feels out of place on Vault, like Animal.<BR><BR>14. Miss You In A Heartbeat - D.L. did a smart move placing this song right next to Bringin On The Heartbreak. While it is the softer song of the two, I think it is the more overlooked song of the two.<BR><BR>15. Bringing On The Heartbreak - I have recently begun liking this song after I bought High N Dry. When I first heard it on Vault, I really pushed it aside and really just concentrated on the first half of the cd. Now I know what I have been missing by skipping this song. Everybody DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE YOU'LL BE KICKING YOURSELF!<BR><BR>To conclude, Vault is a great album to start out your collection with if you are a first time listener of D.L. It may not give you the opportunity to listen to a well-rounded collection of their music but it will definitely get you started nonetheless. If you start your collection with Vault I HIGHLY recommend you check out their other albums. In any event use Vault for starters but once you get your collection going, put it aside and enjoy the long ride on through the night.
0800177975|4.0|Last Action Hero is probably Arnold's best comedic performance.This movie is funny and it has a ton of action.Don't pay attention to the critics,this movie may be hard to comprehend but it tries something new with its unusual plot. Overall this movie is very entertaining and it stays that way through the entire movie.<BR>I would recommend this movie to any Schwarzenegger fan.
B00005RYKV|1.0|Kitano's \\"BrotherEgets eaten and spit out by Sony Pictures US. Not exactly a masterpiece, or the best movie he has done, but it gave a great insight into the Yakuza lifestyle rarely known outside of Japan. But on this DVD, the lackluster treatment of this movie is unforgivable.<BR>If some of the story was a little on the unexplained side, maybe it's because the US version is 30 minutes shorter than the Japanese original. Most of the Japanese sequences were cut, so Americans won't have to read too many subtitles. Great move(?). The DTS audio option was thrown out for some reason, thinking people who might like this movie will not have a DTS decoder. Sony, get with the times!<BR>The biggest problem I had with this DVD was that there were no English subtitles! It is listed as `English SubtitlesEbut in fact, it's English Closed Captions, so even when they are speaking English, the captions appear. Luckily I understand both languages, but for anyone else, they would be a headache to sit through.<BR>Extras are very minimal, only trailers for completely unrelated Chinese movies? For a list price so high, it just seems smarter to get the fully loaded Region 2 Japanese release. Believe me the story makes a LOT more sense.<BR>Also, the character that Tetsuya Watari plays is such a minor role in the US version, it was a shame that his name appears in the credits. If you want to check out a role where he actually is part of the MOVIE, get `Tokyo DrifterE(Criterion Collection). You'll be a lot happier with that film.
0385335482|5.0|This book was an awesome, funny read.  If you want some lighthearted moments, spend a little time with \\"Bex.\\"  She will lift your spirits and give you a chuckle.  Her relationship with her banker Mr. Smeath, or \\"Smeathie\\" is unforgettable!<br />Haven't we all rationalized that the item on sale actually \\"saves\\" us money?  Haven't we all needed that extra pair of shoes in case of emergency?  Kick off your shoes (the ones you got for a steal), sip some tea, and enjoy!
B00006LPEY|2.0|A DTS version of Akira was what SHOULD have been on the special edition in the first place! This is a total marketing gimmick from Pioneer. The Japanese Region 2 DTS edition came with all the extras of the special edition, for a limited time until switching to only 1 disc. The DTS track blows away the original stereo, but is it really worth buying the entire movie again? If only they put together a mail-in rebate it would have been worth the money. Collectors only.

B00004Y9PP|4.0|What an amazing movie! A fabulous if relatively unknown cast of characters headlined by one star (Vin Diesel) brings this movie to life. The plot is simple; a marooning on an arid, seemingly deserted planet that turns into a veritable charnal house when the sun goes down. There is the docking pilot-turned-captain (Frys) who attempts to save the survivors, and working with her is a mercenary who cons his way around as a police officer (Johns) trying to bring a cold-blooded, brilliant killer (Riddick) back to civilization. <br />After the untimely and horrific deaths of a miner, and a child of a holy man, the survivors realize that they aren't alone. The planet is inhabited by some blood-thirsty avian/reptile beasts who only come out when the suns go down. This may sound cheesy, since most \\"beasts\\" are afraid of the dark, but in this case, the sun never comes back up...the world goes dark in a total solar eclipse that is supposed to last 22 years.<br />Human nature comes into play as the survivors must fight through the dark to survive. Their only weapon is light, and the only ticket off the dark planet is an old abandoned skiff that has been derelict for years. The complexity of the charaters, and the stunning shots of the desolate wasteland make this film a nightmare come true.
0385720920|2.0|Well, I've got to say...Dude..<br />I'm sorry I didn't take the author's advice in the first section and put down this book and instead read some standard King, Koontz, or anything else.<br />Why not? <br />Well, Dude, this book had amazing language. The sentences were wonderful. I enjoyed how the sections jumped around. The overall theme was thought provoking.<br />Chuck's obviously a talented writer, Dude. However, I know what he is trying to do here. He's attempting to someday get himself into some cannonized literary text book of the early 21st century. He's being preachy. Sorry Chuck, it's not going to happen. Dude, I really do not care how controversial the topics--and sex scenes--are, Choke goes overboard and does not supply. <br />Chuck eventually leads you away from where he had been taking you the entire book at the end, Dude. He turned what was a hurmous, somewhat interesting book into a, \\"ah ... Are you for real?\\" at the end. For me to enjoy a book, I want a good ending! Choke did not supply. Fight Club does, however. I'd say pick up any other novel, even one of his others, just pass this by.<br />It's really not worth the time, Dude. <BR>Parents, this book would eaisly get an NC-17 rating, by the way.<br /> ...And if you're wondering what's up with all the Dudes, prepare yourself for that if you pick up this novel. NOT realistic but annoying.
B000002H33|5.0|If Metallica's debut Kill'em All pioneered thrash metal, then their third album Master of Puppets perfected it. It was on this record that the band basically put it all together (the aggression of Kill'em All and the maturity of Ride The Lightning), while improving both the songwriting and musicianship tremendously. The result is a truly amazing album that must not be missed by metal fans or even non-metal fans.<br />The first thing that's apparent on this record is James Hetfield's vocal performance. It is here that he finally sounds fully confident and ready for action. Kirk Hammett's guitar work is also simply astounding, with some amazing solos and excellent interplay with Hetfield's rhythm guitar leads. Lars Ulrich's drumming (while admittedly the least impressive aspect of the album) is rock solid, and Cliff Burton, of course, shows there has yet to be a bassist that matches both his skill and his passion.<br />Here's a rundown of each track:<br />1. Battery - Master of Puppets opens with what's IMO its best song. Battery (like RTL's Fight Fire With Fire) begins with a somewhat Spanish-sounding guitar melody before going into an all out metal assault. Lars Ulrich's drumming really shines here (especially his near perfect timing), and Kirk Hammett's solo will litterally blow you away. In other words, Battery is breathtaking from start to finish, and leads perfectly into...<br />2. Master of Puppets - A long time anthem for Metallica fans and with good reason. Master of Puppets features one of the most memorable riffs Metallica has ever written, mixed with a neat (if somewhat sad-sounding) acoustic interlude and a rocking solo courtesy of Kirk Hammett. The interplay between lyrics and instrumentation is especially amazing as each tone and riff in this song fits perfectly with the changing vocal tones and lyrics. Brilliant track.<br />3. The Thing That Should Not Be - A dark, mid-tempo track inspired by H.P. Lovecraft. The main highlight is, once again, the nearperfect interplay between James' vocal tones and the instrumental melody (alternating between electric and acoustic). Cool solo, too. <br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - The closest Puppetz really gets to a ballad. The song opens with a somewhat mysterious acoustic melody really reminding you of life in an insane assylum (which is what the song is about), before going into some amazing well-crafted lyrics and a very heavy chorus. The ending is especially amazing with the way Kirk Hammett produces a set of solos that somehow remind you of the pain these assylents are feeling. Great track.<br />5. Disposable Heroes - This song IMO stands right next to Battery as the best song on MOP. The machine-gun riff flat out rocks, as does Kirk Hammett's solo at the very middle and Lar's Ulrich's drum crash towards the end. James' lyrics are also quite good here (sung with an incredible amount of anger). Brilliant track. <br />6. Leper Messiah - This is probably the only track on Master of Puppets that I didn't much care for. Contrary to popular myth, Leper Messiah is not an anti-religious song but an attack on these \\"televangelists\\" that were plaguing the airwaves in the late eighties. Unfortunately, the main riff is somewhat grating and James' lyrics sound a bit too dramatic in parts. The speedier part in the middle is pretty good though.<br />7. Orion - Easilly one of the most creative songs Metallica has ever written. It is in this song that Cliff Burton's bass guitaring really shines, with him producing both lead guitar melodies and background riffs almost flawlessly. James Hetfield's rhythm guitaring is also quite good.<br />8. Damage, Inc. - Master of Puppets closes with a bang. Damage, Inc. is a lightning quick thrash song with some mind blowing lead guitar work and some of Lar's Ulrich's best drumming. I especially like the little \\"heavy metal march\\" in the begining.<br />All in all, with the exception of may be Leper Messiah, Master of Puppets is a masterpiece from start to finish. If you haven't heard any of Metallica's thrash material, this is a great album to start with. The band's newer material is very good (for what it is), but Master of Puppets will forever be remembered as the album that defined Metallica as one of the greatest bands of not only the eighties, but all time.
B00005JLXE|4.0|\\"Daredevil\\" is AWESOME if you like the comic, but it doesn't shut out those that just want to see the newest Affleck, J. Garner, or Farrell pic, either.  The film does a decent enough job of showing DD's origin without dwelling on it (i.e. EVERY Batman film), though adding training by Stick would have been a nice touch.  Affleck is very convincing as a blind man. Farrell does a great job with Bullseye, really playing him over the top.  Jennifer Garner holds her own in the fight scenes, and looks AMAZING from start to finish.  <br />DRAWBACKS:  too many people know Matt Murdock is DD by the end of the film, the Affleck-Garner relationship develops too quickly, Kingpin's character is thrown at us and not introduced or developed enough, and some of the DD/Bullseye sequences are too obvious in the use of computer generation (climbing the organ pipes looks like a playstation game).<br />ON THE PLUS SIDE:  Affleck, Farrell, Jon Favreau, KEVIN SMITH!!, and Joey P. straight outta the Sopranos into a great reporter role.  Loyal readers of the DD comic will recognize several shots right out of the comic book which added to the movie's appeal for my friends & me.<br />Overall, you will enjoy this movie if you like the genre, but you'll love it if you read the comic. GREAT DIRECTION!!!!  I just want to know how they'll pull off the sequel since all of Hell's Kitchen knows who DD is now????
B000000ZGO|5.0|This album was a big hit with me back in 1969, and it still is today, but I'm talking about only the first side, with its two trance tunes. Another reviewer mentioned &quot;the desired environment&quot; within which to experience the album, and let's just say a trance-inducing one is the best: the desired effect is what you get, thus sayeth George Clinton. Back in the day, we would put this album on the stereo and let it play over and over.<br />If you compare side one with side two, you'll see nothing in common between the sides, except the tunes are all long. &quot;By the time I get to Pheonix&quot; is just schlock, and there's nothing exceptional about &quot;One Woman.&quot; Isaac's treatment of &quot;Walk on By&quot; is magnificent, but he can't do it with every tune. (See, for example, his treatment of &quot;Man's Temptation&quot; on Black Moses, which did not lend itself to a Hot Buttered Soul-like arrangement.) You'd figure by now that someone would have noticed this obvious dissonance and reissued the album with two other tunes that would truly complement the first two. As with the third disc in &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; I doubt many people spent much time listening to side two.
B000056VJ7|5.0|If nothing more than for the cover art and the sweeping &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot;, &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; is for the rock connoisseur or the music historian or anyone that wants to know what the American musical ingenuity can do.
0060930187|5.0|For a school project I read Sylvia Plath's &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;. I thought this novel was very good. Sylvia Plath is a very talented writer and displays this in &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;. It is almost based off of Sylvia's life. Sylvia Plath writes in a way that it can make the most vivid pictures in your mind seem so real. And it is also written in an almost poetic way. You can almost feel Esther cutting her calves. This book especially caught me because Sylvia writes from her own life, from when she slowly fell into a deep depression, became metally ill, and eventually comitted suicide herself. Sylvia Plath is a phenomenal author and definently shows this with this novel. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something great to read!
B00006DEFA|4.0|Amadeus was one of those films that got way more Oscars than any movie deserves, but it still stands up as high-gloss entertainment.  The main problem is and will forever be Peter Shaffer's conception of the story; nothing and nobody will ever persuade me that Antonio Salieri had murderous designs on W.A. Mozart.  But that doesn't really matter.  View it as a splendid evening's entertainment, and don't delve too deeply into the specious philosophising.<br />Much of the brilliance was in the casting.  F. Murray Abraham is perfect as Salieri.  Saul Zaentz mischievously suggests, in the accompanying making-of documentary, that this is because Abraham is a bit of a Salieri himself - a hard-working, talented performer who has prevented himself from being really outstanding by his suspicion that he hasn't had enough breaks.  Sounds about right to me.  Abraham seethes with jealousy throughout, and when he's required to acknowledge Mozart's talent, then and only then does the mask drop and he becomes humble.  Tom Hulce's high-energy, giggling Mozart is spot-on, in that Mozart displayed little of his own genius in his personal life.  Elizabeth Berridge (as Stanzi) turns out to have been a late replacement for Meg Tilly, who tore a ligament playing football with some Prage street kids.  It was a lucky accident.  Berridge's enormous eyes, guileless American accent and disarming directness makes her a focus of the movie.  Simon Callow, who was the original Mozart on stage, pops up in an early film role as librettist Emmanuel Schikaneder.  <br />The real focus is of course Mozart's music.  One of the reasons why there are no real stars in the film is because the music is meant to be better than any of them.  The Dolby 5.1 sounds fab, although extremely loud.  But my personal favourite turn is Jeffrey Jones, showing early evidence of comic genius as the Emperor, a man just about intelligent enough to realise that he's the thickest person in the room, but so much more powerful than anyone else that this seldom bothers him.  His recurring vocal tic of \\"Mmmm...hm\\", whenever anyone says anything that he disagrees with, is sublime.  Real trivia fans watch out: the pasty-faced, red-nosed maidservant of the Mozarts, alternately spying on them for Salieri and sobbing that she doesn't want to work for them anymore, is a very young Cynthia Nixon of \\"Sex and the City\\" fame.  <br />It's a great night in.  And the funny thing is, I don't even like Mozart's music.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I must be the only person who doesnt get the popularity of this band. Meg White cannot drum at all. Jack White sounds as though he has acute larengitis. All the songs sound the same, and that is not a good thing. Even my band has more talent than this. I wish the press would pick a better band for the public to idolize than the White Stripe. They are not the next Nirvana, nor or they the next Beatles. In fact, they are far from it. Only buy this album if you are tone deaf, or in a coma.
B00000K19E|3.0|The Matrix was a good movie but it was far from great. The hype over Matrix 2 is way over blown. I just don't like it when a movie's strongest point is it's special effects. The Matrix storyline takes a backseat to the &quot;wow&quot; factor. It's filled with bad acting and poor matrial arts scenes. The specal effects are neat for the first 20min but get old. How many times does somebody jumping in slow motion look cool? One.
B00009APK1|5.0|Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a must see even if you are not a fan of the books. This movie is so action packed and with the humor of Gimli the Dwarf its fun all the way. The war scenes are spectacular as well as the special effects. The way they made TreeBeard and Gollum are just unreal. You think you are watching real creatures not computer animation. The return of Gandalf as Gandalf the white is just fantastic. If yo like action-adventure with a little humor mixed in you will love this movie.
B00005JLR1|5.0|This is one of the best animation films I have seen in a while (with the possible exceptions of Spirit & Shrek). Most of the main characters are unstereotypical, and come across as quite human (regardless of home planet). The saber-wielding, mutineering Long John isn't as evil as he tries to be. The indomitible Captain is incapacitated. The good Doctor gets to act the part of the hero. Jim's mother becomes quite frustrated with Jim's pre-adventure shenanigans. And Jim discovers that he isn't as worthless as he thought he was. <BR>The storyline is simplified, of course, but the main elements of the book are still present. If you haven't read the book - or even if you have - take this film on its own merits. It stands as an excellent movie in and of itself. <BR>My only complaint - if you want to call it that - is that some of the language used is far above a normal adolescent's vocabulary. The Captain, bless her heart, becomes extremely verbose at times. For myself, I loved the dialogue. I thrive on obscure words. ;) But most kids will be a bit lost in places.
0802130208|3.0|How could anyone say that this book is about nothing?  Toole incorporates so many social, political, and personal issues.  In an era of social change, he writes liberally of the Civil Rights movement, gay rights, and political activism.  Toole's offcolor humor is not always well understood (especially by me), but the humor I did understand made the book worth the read.  Toole's grotesque descriptions of Ignatius and his overly active valve were hilarious.  The ending of the book did seem a little rushed, which is why I only gave the book 3 stars.  For all of the odd happenings that occurred, everything wrapped up too nicely in the end.  I enjoy a happy ending, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't even classify it as happy because Ignatius was still really weird in the end, maybe even more so than in the beginning.  Overall though, I really enjoyed the book.  Read it for a good laugh, but prepare yourself for Ignatius' appalling antics.
B00000AFDW|2.0|This is not a \\"Kiss\\" album. This is an album where Gene & Paul hired Ace to play and paid Peter to sing...Criss does not play drums on this album. What you get here is nowhere even close to a group effort. Just an effort to $$$ in on the subsequent reunion tour. It is impossible for me to rate this higher considering it's a Kiss infomercial in the form of a cd. Notice how many used product there is for sale? How about the going price for a used \\"Psycho Circus\\"? ...
0767817478|3.0|I remember growing up and watching Godzilla on Saturday and Sunday afternoon's on the local UHF station (waaaaay back when). I remember the hype they put out for the American version, and the first 3 times I saw it at the theatre, I was only disappointed by the acting and the fact that Godzilla didnt face off against another monster. <BR> It IS a good movie if you keep in the mindset that you have never seen a Godzilla flick before, or that this could be an alternate timeline/universe story. I could have done without the bad humor or the Jurassic Park-esque baby Godzilla side story, but I kinda like this Godzilla...sleek,fast and cunning. Check the scene where he is swimming past the submarines, as he stares them down as he goes by...Devlin tried to make him an extremely intelligent monster and it almost worked. <BR> After the movie, Fox put out an animated series which did do the monster justice...fighting other Giant monsters...it went along the old Hanna Barbarra series line where they could call Godzilla when needed. The acting was a bit better in that series.<BR> Fans really dissed this movie, and some of the claims are justified. But really give it a fair shake. I think you'll agree it IS a descent flick worth a second look. Just keep an open mind while watching it.
B00005QIPH|2.0|For all the talk surrounding this band I must say that I was disappointed. I got the album based on Last Nite, a very good song. The rest, though, was merely a bunch of monotonous chord progressions and regurgitated riffs. The bass is excellent and really pushes the songs. Singing is okay. One bad thing is the lack of energy. It sounds as if they rolled out of bed and recorded this album. Not recommended.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Jack Johnson's 2 albums do not grab you instantly, rather they grow better which each subsequent listen. So i don't quite love it as yet, but give me a few months and i probably will. <br />However, something tells me i won't be dancing around like an idiot like i did to his previous songs \\"Mud foot ball\\" and \\"bubble toes\\". But its still good compared to anything else i've heard recently. <br />Good songs include Taylor, Gone, Cupid, Cuccoon.<br />P.S - Try to get a hold of the live cover of the song \\"High tide or low tide\\" by Jack Johnson and Ben Harper. It was originally sung by Bob Marley and the Wailers. I wish this one was on the album.
B00005RY7X|5.0|The prefect summer album.  If you want fun, Andrew W.K. is it!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple has definately found herself in her sophomore release.  Much more mature and thoughful than Tidal.  This album is simply amazing, without a doubt one of the greatest albums of the nineties.  I can't think of anyone who can more eloquently express their emotions than Fiona.  My personal favorites on this CD are \\"I know\\", a beautiful song with amazingly touching lyrics, and \\"Paper Bag\\", a catchy song with a jazzy beat.  There are few words that can express the perfection of this album, every song seems to flow together.  All I can say is just buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B000089RVX|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I thought this was a great album and I recommend it. But the bands range is summed up within the first five songs. The rest of the tracks on disc are more or less interchangable. There is an undeniable passion in Amy Lees voice and the orchestrations and production are top notch. However, Ms. Lee vocals are haunting and etheral and she plays it safe almost throughout the entire CD. &quot;Going Under,&quot; &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and &quot;My Last Breath&quot; being exceptions. She scores really well with &quot;My Immortal&quot; and that by far is the better ballad compared to &quot;Hello&quot;. <BR>Conclusion: Great sound with rookie mistakes. Leaves enough room for improvement for their sophmore effort to really knock you off your socks. Solid &quot;B&quot;
B000069HK2|5.0|Oh boy. Where do I start? This CD has so many great songs, but 'The Taste of Ink' and 'Box of Sharp Objects' aren't the best. I would say 'Bulimic' and 'Greener With the Scenery' have my votes. This album and MCR's 'I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love' turned me on to emo from the first song I heard on both albums. If you've heard the album and love it, go see them live! Please, just stop reading this and go buy the freakin' CD!
B00002Z88D|5.0|Oh my God will these boys ever stop. This does complete justice for them. It shows how genius Metallica are aswell as Kamen. Songs such as 'One' and 'Outlaw Torn' were alsways brilliant songs but with the orchestra it just completes the songs.<BR>This album is full of classics from 'Enter Sandman' to 'Battery' and 'Nothing Else Matters'. The classic songs are still amazing and the roar of James Hetfiled is perfect.<BR>It's just the whole balance of metal and Symphony, it was just perfectly executed.<BR>But it just to be amazed.
B00005JLR2|5.0|... It was so awesome, and I am not a sci - fi person. When I first saw the previews, I thought Disney slaughtered Treasure Island with this remake, but the movie was so good! It took Stevenson's already great book and made it even better. I highly recommend this if your child is into space, and definitely if you're a Disney fan. The animation and graphics are amazing, and the storyline is wonderful. My only caution is to beware the creepy spidery scorpion thing, which might be too scary for little kids.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has written the best mystery/thriller I've read in years.  As we follow Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon on his journey beginning at the Louvre with a mysterious death. His need to solve the crime takes us on a fabulous journey through historical places and works of art.  The fantastic research of the author reinforces the plot and keeps book's pages turning.
B00008IXAR|5.0|I'd actually rate this album at 4.5 stars but another reviewer prefering this rating went for 4 so between us we've achieved the correct rating average.<br />     Not having fully heard the last two Simply Red albums I'd be disingenuous in making any comparisons, but in general 'Home' is a more mature album than works previous to those two with influences from around many gendres exquisitely assimilated in Mick's efortless vocals.<br />     The familiar Hall and Oates rhythm in 'Sunrise' typifies the general retro feel to 'Home', as does the welcome return to analogue recording which adds warmth and body to further enhance the album's appeal; my suspicion being that the fairly recent success of Ryan Adam's 'Gold' and also Elton John's latest offering which benefitted from analogue technology's magic probably influenced Mick's decision in this regard and I hope it catches on.<br />      Just as Halle Berry would look good in a boiler-suit, you get the impression Mick could sing 'The Streak' and make it sound soulfull, but all eleven songs on 'Home' are worthy contributions and no need to fumble around for the 'skip' function on the CD remote at any point during playback.<br />      Too many times I play well-reviewed titles and am either underwhelmed or am initially pleased but subsequently the title doesn't get played.  Not so with 'Home' which I was initially pleasantly surprised with BUT also found to be a grower that now sits in the 'favourites' rack.
B000002GQG|5.0|With the huge success of their landmark classical-meets-rock album, 1967's &quot;Days Of Future Passed,&quot; and it's smash hit single, &quot;Nights In White Satin,&quot; the Moody Blues had beaten the odds &amp; successfully transformed from the rhythm &amp; blues combo of &quot;Go Now&quot; fame, to the masterful progressive-rock band known the world over. For the follow-up disc, 1968's &quot;In Search Of The Lost Chord,&quot; the Moodies decided to retain the classical instruments from their previous hit album, with one major difference: they would play all the instruments themselves, including cello, oboe, harp, harpsicord, and, for a touch of Indian-flavored music, sitar. &quot;In Search Of The Lost Chord&quot; is arguably the Moody Blues' most psychedelic album, but it is also one of their all-time greats. Bassist John Lodge's rockin' &quot;Ride My See-Saw,&quot; and flautist Ray Thomas' wonderful ode to Timothy Leary, &quot;Legend Of A Mind,&quot; remain Moody Blues concert staples to this day. There's also Thomas' playful &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I Presume,&quot; the experimental delights of Lodge's &quot;House Of Four Doors&quot; (with &quot;Legend Of A Mind&quot; sandwiched within it), guitarist Justin Hayward's beautiful &quot;Voices In The Sky,&quot; &quot;Visions Of Paradise,&quot; and &quot;The Actor,&quot; keyboardist Mike Pinder's spacious &quot;The Best Way To Travel,&quot; and the spiritual &quot;Om,&quot; and drummer Graeme Edge's fine poetry in the forms of &quot;Departure&quot; and &quot;The Word.&quot; Marvelously written, played, &amp; sung by the band, handsomely produced by Tony Clarke, and remastered for superior sound quality, &quot;In Search Of The Lost Chord&quot; remains one of the Moody Blues' finest works.
B00005JL96|5.0|I saw this movie four times in the movie theatre and pre - ordered it from the Disney Store a month before it came out I was so excited. I have collected tons of Stitch merchandise, he is so cute! The movie doesn't quite have the same &quot;Disney magic&quot; as a reviewer put it, and I agree, but it is definitely a cute movie and good for everyone. My finace hates Disney with a passion, and he absolutely adores this movie, if that means anything. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Director Chris Columbus has again captured the core meaning of one of the Potter Books
B00003CXXM|4.0|I was sort of surprised that this movie was so good, but it's definitely worth seeing. Matt Damon does a great job in his role, and is very convincing that he's not sure who he is. I would highly recommend this DVD to people who like suspense movies.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much, that I went and bought all 4 Harry Potter Books. I cann't wait for book 5.
B000069AUI|5.0|There is very little more to say.  I reviewed Parachutes with glowing praise--such an impressive freshman offering.  A Rush of Blood to the Head is so much better that words fail.  Purchase this CD, support great art, and enjoy perfection.
B00006LHYC|4.0|This album is not only a big step for her but also to the fans. You need to get used to a new Laura. Well, it's not totally new Laura. Only what's changed is the language. The music is stil the same. To me listening this album is easier than the other albums she's made, because I dont't understand italian very well. Now I can say something about the lyrics too. I like them, but some songs are really strange or it's just that I don't really like them. For example &quot;Do I dare, Love comes from the inside&quot; I just don't get them. But my favorites are &quot;surrender, It's not goodbye,I need love, Every little thing you do&quot;. And the remixes are very good too. I can't wait 'till the next album of Laura and I hope it I like it more than I did this one.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Wow, what an amazing album. Madonna has done it again. She has yet transformed and changed her musical style and did it in a good way. This album has different flavors for all different kinds of people. Being a long time fan, I am used to Madonna's ever changing style - which has caused me to be an even bigger fan.  The lyrics are absolutely amazing, some being simple, yet so powerful and easy to relate to. It is nice to get, yet again, something different, yet so unique. To me, this is not a mainstream cd like so many others out there, in which she will probably not sell as many cds, but I truly don't think she cares about that. Which makes this album all the better. She has done what she wants to do again, without having to stay in the mainstream of music to sell cds, like so many other artists. The songs will grow on you. One of my favorites is &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; in which she talks about being moved by something so powerful, yet it's not a religous thing. It's more of a one-on-one thing with God. Another beautiful song is Love Profusion. Also, some dance and fun songs; Hollywood, Nobody Knows Me. Her voice is at it's highest peak and excellent. After listening to this cd just a few times, all of the songs have grown on me and each has a different yet important message. Many religious people and people that are non-educated and closed-minded will probably not even begin to understand the complete message that she is saying in some of the songs.  They will probably take the lyrics in an absolute negative way, instead of seeing the beauty and love in the lyrics.  She has once again, created a cd that will remain in my musical library for life.

A full show, all the music videos including the MTV banned Spit it Out and a new version of Wait and Bleed.  Also, Purity is available.  Best music DVD i've ever seen, highly recommended!
0452282152|5.0|I loved this book.  It intertwines art and relationships.  I enjoyed the story of the young girl and how she was enamored with the great VerMeer.  It explained how some of the paints were made and how important every aspect of a room is to the mood being set in a painting.  I thought it was written as the picture looks - simple yet as you look closer, very intricate. Very enjoyable to read.
0689859368|5.0|This might be a childrens story but anyone who has ever been a kid will love this book!<BR>A creepy old house, some scary occurances, a hidden room, and a mysterious book all help to turn the lives of the three Grace children upside down.<BR>They must use their talants; Mallory's as a fencer, Simon's for handeling animals, and Jarad's natural curiosity, to save themselves and to solve what is causing the disasters in the big strange house they have moved into with their Mom. <BR>Their adventuures are scary, exciting, and dangerous as they learn about the very real world of Fairy that intersects with ours.
B00000DFTG|4.0|I never much cared for Black Sabbath.  Listening in the '70s, I thought their music sounded vague and sludgy compared to, say, Led Zep (which in addition to being a standout band had one of rock's greatest and least-recognized producers in Jimmy Page).  This live record has converted me: the mix and mastering is perfect, the rhythm section simply lays waste to the surroundings, and Tony Iommi sounds like a one-man satanic symphony on guitar.  As for Ozzy, several reviews note that he's lost some of his upper vocal register.  What a relief!  The keening screech is downplayed, and with the rest of the band gearing down to accommodate him, the music sounds even darker and more dramatic.  Ozzy can't really sing, technically speaking, but he's almost tuneful here.  The band's performance is nicely sloppy at points, tight and relentless at others.  Overall, &quot;Reunion&quot; is a near-classic live album that finally convinces me Black Sabbath deserve their place in the pantheon.
0156027321|5.0|The eleven and one half hour audio is brilliant.    Read by Jeff Woodman could not be better.  This amazing story had me under it's spell.<BR>It left me wanting to know more about the author Yann Martel and how his brain could conjure up such an imaginative tell. <BR>If only Pi had such a book for his nine month ordeal as a castaway.  It's one that he would have loved to read over and over.
B000089RVX|5.0|It's very rare that a new band comes out that generates as much energy and such awesome tunes that Evanescence has done with this CD.  Honestly I can say that this is the only CD I own (out of hundreds) where I like every song. Of course &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is the major highlight of this CD but there are other great songs on this album including two slow songs where it's just Amy and the piano.  Great stuff!

0385504209|3.0|This book was interesting to read.  Many of his facts or suggestions were intriguing.<br /><br /> As a christian, I had some mixed feelings about some of the alleged \\"conspiracy theory\\" of this atheist writer.<br />In fact, I did not like the way this writer tries to sell his \\"natural\\" beliefs through his characters in this fiction.<br /><br />In the end, this book is a cheap thrill.

B00004RFFI|4.0|First motion picture on DVD.<br />It was incredible and awesome to watch this film in a movie theater.  The first of its kind and the high-upgrade in special effects is mind-boggling.  To see the movie tornadoes in a theater from ceiling to bottom (well you know what I mean) was breath-taking.  They did try to add some sense of humor every now and then (the cow). Shown in squeezy widescreen. I know some people that just will not watch this film because it is too real for them.  The only thing I disliked about this film is, the soundman did not turn up the sound on the K.D. Lang song (heard when Hunt is at the diner with the drive-in in backgroud).  You can barely hear her wonderful ballad.  I also disliked the rock & roll music at the end credits.  TRIVIA: Did you know that one of the writers of this film, Anne-Marie Martin, played \\"Gwen Davies\\" (1982-85) on the NBC serial \\"Days Of Our Lives\\"?  She was also in PROM NIGHT (1980) and HALLOWEEN II (1981).  This DVD includes in Special Effects, Audio Commentary with Director, Jan De Bont and Special Effects Coordinator, Stefen Fangmeier.  A featurette nearly 14 minutes long on \\"The Making Of Twister\\".  Here you will see how they made fake storms, filming in real storms approaching, videos of real tornadoes, how they made a set that was seven blocks long of destruction and much more.  \\"An Anatomy of the Twister\\" is an 8-minute featurette is mostly about the over 300 special effects for the film.  How they made the tornadoes look so realistic.  Each tornado created had a character of its own.  Two original theatrical trailers and info on cast and crew are also available.  The music video \\"Humans Being\\" by Van Halen can be played.  I wish they added the song \\"Love Affair\\" by K.D. Lang to the DVD.<br />  The movie seen in the drive-in is [[ASIN:B000UJCALI The Shining (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] (1980). Starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley DuVall, Danny Lloyd.<br /> Incidentally, Stephen King is writing a second book to \\"The Shining\\".

0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I kept hearing everyone rave on and on about it for years...saying how wonderful and touching it was, so I thought I'd go ahead and give it a chance. I'm really glad I finally did. I finished it in one day. In fact, I started reading it at school in one of my classes and I just could NOT put it down. I was done with it by the time my classes ended.    I read a lot of books like this...about teen and social issues, and this is definitely one of the best I've ever gotten my hands on.    Charlie is such a wonderful character. I practically fell in love with him as I was reading this novel. He's got an amazing personality that really gives you hope...maybe there ARE a few good, decent, and HONEST people left in the world.    After finishing this book, I started feeling this intense desire to write. Just write and write and get all of my thoughts out on paper as soon as possible. That's how much this book inspired me. It made me WANT to start journaling again!    Some say it's far-fetched and that Charlie's experiences aren't true to life, but I think that everyone can find a little piece of themself in Charlie if they are just willing to look hard enough.
B000002B1M|4.0|After his breakthrough with the instant classic Illmatic, It Was Written was one of the most awaited albums in 1996, which turned out to be a roller coster year for rap music. Nas returns in this more mature, introspective album to prove the critics correct that he could sustain his crown of King of New York with the increasing number of competitors such as Mobb Deep, the forthcoming Jay-Z and the established Notorious B.I.G. Although not as raw and to the point as Illmatic, Nas still expresses himself well throughout the album, an official LP of 14 tracks. <br />The production level of this album exceeds that of the lyrical as Nas does not seem to be as focused as on the previous Illmatic. The shots are still called by DJ Premier but with newcomers such as Havoc (of Mobb Deep) and L.E.S who provide the album with a different sound. In front of the beats enters Nas' ever lasting lyrical flow. No hesitations, stutters or pauses halt the album as Nas shows his lyrical ability is still at the top. <br />The album's strongest point is its beginning with the single release of \\"The Message\\" and \\"Street Dreams\\", with Nas rapping from an experienced, street wise gangster. Next comes \\"I Gave You Power\\" rapped through a pistol's perspective of how it is just to be used and thrown away like nothing. Nas' evidence of his sustained flow is shown in \\"Watch Dem Niggas\\" and \\"Take It In Blood\\", which happen to be the two best tracks on the LP. From this point onwards, the album takes a downhill direction, although the partnership of Nas AND Dr Dre proves to be a working formula in \\"Nas Is Coming\\" an analysis and evaluation of the East/West Coast rap war being a waste of time. The one other significant track on the album, which again shows Nas at his best, is \\"If I Ruled The World\\" with backing vocals supplied by Fugees member Lauryn Hill. <br />As with every Nas album, It Was Written was compared to his \\"classic\\" Illmatic, although not as real or philosophical, this 1996 release attains platinum status among loyal Nas fans, definitely an overlooked album.
0440180295|5.0|This `anti-war book,' as Vonnegut himself has called it, focuses on the life of a World War II prisoner of war named Billy Pilgrim.  Pilgrim (along with Vonnegut, the narrator) was present when Dresden was bombed and destroyed by the Allied forces, killing far more people than the atomic bombs in Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  The bombing, and the ensuing ruinous carnage of the former city, serve to show the horrors of war, and the violence and destruction of innocent lives which are sometimes a price of the bloody game of war.<BR> <BR>But this is not your typical anti-war book.  Vonnegut does not openly criticize the Allies for bombing Dresden--in fact, one of his characters points out that, at the time, it seemed like it had to be done.  Another, more subtle consequence of war is the focus of this book, however, and this consequence is exemplified in the mental state of Billy Pilgrim.  Billy thinks he has stepped outside of time, and no longer sees things chronologically.  Instead, the novel constantly jumps back and forth in time to different events in Billy's life, including a supposed alien kidnapping.  Though the book treats these time jumps as real, enough hints are given for the skeptical reader to doubt.  The war left Billy's life in shambles, and he spends the bulk of the novel trying to make sense of it all (hence the non-linear narrative).<BR> <BR>Vonnegut seems to be showing us two ugly sides to war.  The first is the side we all know by now--the innocent victims, the meaningless slaughter, the terrible destruction.  But the second, subtler side can only be seen in Billy Pilgrim's character, and it seems this is another horrible effect of war.  War causes carnage and bloodshed while it is occurring, but it also has long term effects.  Depression, anxiety, and many other forms of mental illness can come about because of war, as Vonnegut so eloquently points out in this novel.  This is considered to be one of the greatest modernist novels of the 20th century, and with good reason.  I highly recommend this unique take on war.
B00000JLWW|4.0|Dicappio and Winslet may not have the depth necessary for their parts. The director's treatment in these respects may not carry too much weight and as such the movie may not be as convincing as some would have expected. But as a commercial film this is a big success.<br />The story itself may well be a true reflection of what had actually transpired. The director started the film with a recent exploration of the sunken Titanic leading the viewers deep into the ocean to be followed by an interview with the 102 years old survivor, Rose, the heroine of the movie, to make it ring as true as a documentary.<br />The grandeur of Titanic was particularly well captured. The life of the upper class life on board was convincingly conveyed. Even the life of the lower class was well portrayed, and when things are not quite unrealistic, they have good purposes to serve, touching up the general atmostphere making it more juicy... etc. <br />The two contrasting scenes, the dinner party of the upper class and the party of the poor were well handled. These are one of the mosting exciting part of the movie. The Captain, who was so convinced and so proud of the unsinkability of the ship and then the musicians who hung on till the last minute... they are so telling and touching. The rhythm of the movie is quite fast and never boring.<br />What more can we expect from a commercial movie like this? Recommended.
B000002KOQ|4.0|Joni's first two albums had their moments, but &quot;Ladies Of The Canyon&quot; was really the first time that people began to realize<BR>that here was a major talent who would come to define their generation.  Released in early 1970, the album sums up many of the hopes, dreams and disappointments of the decade which had just passed, and as a result remains one of her best-loved works.<BR>For the first time, she used piano nearly as equally as she did the acoustic guitar, moving her sound away from pure folk and into a more sophisticated singer-songwriter savvy, with her lyrics moving into deeper, more mature territory as well.<br />Tracks like &quot;Morning Morgantown&quot;, &quot;For Free&quot; and &quot;Ladies Of The Canyon&quot; contain a purity of imagery, vocal and music that is <BR>just unparalleled; they run like water that has been filtered for the clearest taste.  Which makes the darker tracks such as &quot;The Arrangment&quot; and &quot;The Priest&quot; sound even starker by contrast, and also foreshadow the breakdown documented on the next album.  The three most popular and well-known songs close the album: &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; matches a bouncing rhythm against<BR>a rather cynical ecology rant (watch the way she says &quot;a pink hotel, a boutique and a swingin' hot-spot!&quot; with an exaggerated,<BR>slick adman's sense of excitement), &quot;Woodstock&quot; is a slow, meditative attempt to poetically sum up the mood of the festival she came so close to attending in airy, transcendent vocal<BR>phrasings (and IMO far superior to the more commercial CSNY version), while &quot;The Circle Game&quot; is a folkie standard sung with a chorus that marks a gentle nod to the passing of time.<br />Overall, &quot;Ladies Of The Canyon&quot; paints an optimistic portrait of its time, where the problems of external and internal pollution<BR>are quietly resolved by the extreme purity of its sound.  Coming as it does only one album before the torrid &quot;Blue&quot; makes this<BR>even more revealing, and certainly essential.
B000084T18|1.0|anyone who could give this CD more than 3 stars knows nothing of hip hop... i'm sorry, they just can't. Granted, Dr. Dre can supply some really good beats, but anymore they're not much more than party beats, which he gives to horrible \\"lyricists\\" to butcher. <BR>50 Cent has no talent...<BR>if you really want good hip hop, check out artists like Del The Funky Homosapien, Mr. Lif, Jedi Mind Tricks, Nas, Jurassic 5, The Roots, Eric B. & Rakim, the list goes on.<BR>this kind of music is only made to be sold to suburbia so the real hip hop generation will lose sight of it's past and what hip hop is really about.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Having been lucky enough to have seen the 9 episodes, I can say that the Wachowskys are the best thing to happen to movies in a long time, and this generation's creativity icons in Hollywood.  That they could take The Matrix's success and share the wealth with this incredible project, giving so many people a chance to showcase their talent while giving the world of The Matrix an exciting new medium in which to express itself, shows their brilliance, and that they are no one-trick ponies.<br />I'll start by commenting on the overwhelming rave reviews for \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\".  In truth, with all the hype, when I finally did see it, I was sorely disappointed.  Technically, yes, it is brilliant, as I feel is the usual with Square's work (definitely including the Final Fantasy film).  But the execution is way too juvenile.  The initial fight scene and the pipe acrobatics (while the fate of humanity is ticking) scene are so ridiculous and juvenile that they are almost embarrassing to watch.  You'll know when you see them.  Suffice it to say that everyone will be awed by the CGI quality, but its overall appeal will only lie with the pre-teen crowd.  Good action, fabulous animation, but disappointing plot execution.<br />The best of the 9 are, in my opinion, the two Second Renaissance parts and Kid's Story.  They are the most entertaining, bold, intelligent, and artistically brilliant of the bunch.  The dark Second Renaissance will bring chills down your spine, and the touching Kid's Story takes a basically action-oriented short and enhances it with brilliant artistic shifts and terrific music.  <br />The worst of the bunch is, without hesitation, Program.  It is the one regrettable mar on an otherwise brilliant DVD.  Very derivative and juvenile, both artistically and plot-wise, it's the only one that wasn't brave enough to examine The Matrix's world in any real way...it is just a very weak, over-the-top Samurai fight scene that just happens to take place in a Construct program.  It's nothing that isn't dime-a-dozen with TV-cartoon-quality anime, and the fact that the Program team wasted the incredible opportunity to push the envelope (that the other shorts took advantage of), is a real shame.  Program does not belong on this DVD.<br />That aside, however, The Animatrix is one of the most exciting and different projects to come out of the Hollywood machine in a long time.  It is incredibly entertaining, often brilliant, and vrey reasonably priced.  And as an aside, the Wachowskys and the incredible anime talent they shared their good fortune with, all deserve your support.  This is the no-brainer purchase of the year, especially (though not only) for anime and Matrix fans.
B000001DQI|5.0|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was the 2nd album I ever bought, and still in my all time top five. It's taken about 30 years, but I finally realized that it was intentionally modeled after the Beatles classic Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Consider:<br />Both albums start with a medley of two inseparable tracks. (Funeral For a Friend / Love Lies Bleeding vs Sgt Pepper / With A Little Help from My Friends).<br />Both contain tracks segued by animal noises. Both contain tracks intended to sound live but actually recorded in the studio. (Bennie &amp; the Jets / Within You Without You)<br />Elton was a huge Beatles fan and within a year of recording this album covered Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Heres my review:<br />American Life-Am I the only one who loves this song?<BR>Hollywood- Cute, but a little too \\"I want to be a radio hit\\"<BR>I'm so stupid- Sorry, I love it. The lyrics suck, but this is catchy as hell<BR>Love Profusion- Amazing<BR>Nobody Knows Me- OK, probably the only song I could do without<BR>Nothing Fails- Nice, not as great as everyone says it is<BR>Intervention- Love it<BR>X-Static Process- Nice, thats about it<BR>Mother and Father- Like it a lot<BR>Die Another Day- Sorry again, love it<br />Easy Ride- Great song<br />Overall, the first CD of hers that I can listen to from beginning to end. But you cant help but miss the intensity of a usual Madonna album. If it were any other artist, it would probably be their best. I cant help but feel that she played it safe with this one. Recommend it for anyone, but if you're a die hard Madonna fan, dont expect anything more than a catchy tune.
B00005QDW5|2.0|If you're a Floyd completist who's just gotta have When the Tigers Broke Free on cd, that's one thing.  But if you're a casual fan looking for a concise package of essential Pink Floyd, one has yet to be made.  There are 26 tracks on Echoes, a whopping 10 of which are either from the short-lived and over-hyped Syd Barrett era or from the post-Waters albums.  In other words, almost 40% of Echoes (by track, not time) is a mix of whimsical 1967 ditties that sound like nothing else they would ever do, and David Gilmour solo material that he understandably chose to release under the more lucrative Pink Floyd name (well, not quite: Marooned is a Rick Wright instrumental from the post-Waters days, but it's also possibly the most baffling inclusion on this collection). There is not enough space remaining on these two short discs to do justice to the band's classic years, and even a fair chunk of that is squandered on questionable picks like Fletcher Memorial Home, Happiest Days of Our Lives, Sheep, Great Gig in the Sky, and When the Tigers Broke Free (a rarity only included to snare the folks who've already got all of the albums)....
B000089RVX|4.0|I was incredibly skeptical of Evanescence, considering that their popularity stemmed from their overplayed single off the Daredevil soundtrack. It's a real pity that they can't flood the rest of the album onto today's radio stations: it's definitely better than most rock people are into.<br />The biggest statement the album makes is obviously through vocals; however, its not what is said, but rather HOW its said. Amy Lee has an incredible voice, hands down. She isn't afraid of using variation, and she can jump from sweet nothings to a low, definitive growl in a heartbeat.<br />Knowing this about her voice, the band isn't afraid to contrast the voice with some powerful chords. The band has no problem smashing on the strings, but the lyrics aren't anything to be amazed about. Then again, this style of rock isn't aiming for any meaningful revelations or deep truths--it rocks, and rocks hard. There's nothing uplifting to be found here, but don't confuse uplifting with worthwhile: Evanescence put out a good record here, a hard album that easily stands out from the rest.
B00005JLET|5.0|Disney made a brilliant choice when they decided to bring the works of Miyazaki to the U.S.! I remember when I was ten watching Warriors of the Wind for the first time. It was truely an art form, even if it was edited beyond belief! Anyone who liked Warriors of the Wind will truely enjoy Spirited Away. Chihiro is moving to the suburbs with her mother and father, and they decide to make a stop on the way to explore. What they find is an old abandoned theme park with the alluring smells of food drifting on the wind.When Chihiro's parents finially find the food they were seaching for they gourge themselfs on it without asking permission and turn into pigs!Now Chihiro has to work for a spirit who runs the park to free her parents. Giving up her name and losing her memory in the process.I will not give away the whole plot, but I will say that children and adults alike will come to love this movie with it's brilliant animation and beautiful soundtrack.Spirited Away has an amazing likeness to Lewis Caroll's Alice in Wonderland, in it's quality to keep you guessing on what can happen next. Watch it, and I promise you will be running out to see the rest of Studio Ghibli's masterpieces!
B00003CX95|1.0|Mel Gibson, looking uncannily like Billy Ray Cyrus, tramples all over Scottish history in his relentless pursuit of the almighty dollar. 1995 wasn't a vintage year by any means but how this travesty managed to beat out the likes of The Usual Suspects, Heat and Se7en at the Academy Awards is a mystery on a par with the Easter Island statues and anyone liking prunes.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Gladiator is Ridley Scott's very successful attempt at portraying the life of of a gladiator. It is definitely one of my top ten favorite films, because of its excellent character development, excellent storyline, and excellent portrayal of the time period and of the life gladiators lived. <br />Gladiator is the story of a Roman general who, in the beginning of the film, is leading his army of soldiers against a stronghold. It is the last stronghold they must take over before they achieve total victory in the war. Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is the Roman general survives the battle, leading his forces to victory. The emperor, Marcus Aurelius, who presides over the battle commends Maximus for his abilities as a general. A little later on he chooses Maximus to succeed him as emperor instead of his son (Joaquin Phoenix). When he learns that his father has chosen Maximus instead of him to succeed as emperor, he kills his father, then tells the people he died of natural causes. When Maximus refuses to acknowledge him as emperor, he orders Maximus to be killed. Maximus narrowly escapes from the executioners with his life and makes his way to his homeland, where he finds that his wife and small son have been murdered by the new emperor's agents.<br />He is then captured by citizens of Zucchabar and taken to Zucchabar to be sold as a slave he, along with several other slaves, is purchased and forced to live the life of an arena gladiator.<br />The rest of the movie portrays Maximus the gladiator struggling to stay alive as he battles professional fighters, barbarian hordes, and tigers, determined to win his freedom. The film's climax comes when Maximus battles against the emperor himself . . .<br />Gladiator is a film which should not be missed by anyone. The excellent character development, plot construction, and choreography makes it one of the best films ever made (in my opinion). 5 stars
B000002USN|5.0|This was my introduction to Frank Sinatra music and what an introduction it is!  Although Frank was 80 years old when he recorded this album, it is a delight!  His voice is not as smooth as it was in his glorious prime, but the voice is still &quot;Frank's&quot;, and combining it with the likes of Aretha Franklin, Julio Iglesias, and Barbra Streisand is like putting cream in your favorite coffee.  I have all the Duets albums and this is my favorite (with Duets II being a close second).<br />The album begins with the high energy duet of Sinatra and Luther Vandross in &quot;The Lady Is A Tramp&quot;, and it does not quit there.  There are 13 duets on this album and each is a unique gem.  The duet with Barbra Steisand, &quot;I've Got A Crush On You&quot;, will absolutely charm you.  &quot;New York, New York&quot;, with Tony Bennett, is wonderful, and the haunting, &quot;All the Way/One For My Baby&quot;, will give you goose bumps.<br />This is a &quot;MUST&quot; album for all Sinatra fans, or fans that just enjoy good music.  I actually prefer the Duets album to Frank's earlier solo works.  You can't go wrong buying this album - I guarantee you will love it.  I have listened to it over and over and it is one of those albums that one never tires of.<br />Jim Konedog Koenig
B00008WG3U|5.0|Considering that NOFX has been around for twenty years now and has managed to avoid mainstream publicity and has not sold out, and that they create possibly the best punk music is and achievment that not too many bands can brag about.  &quot;The War on Errorism&quot; is everything that NOFX is about, from mindless songs about a limb-challenged fan to songs satiring the so-called leader of the free world.  This album is one of their best, with music from more genres than you would imagine.  &quot;Franco Un-American&quot; has some whacky instruments that one would not normally hear in a punk song; &quot;Mattersville&quot; is a ska-like song with some vibraphones; &quot;Anarchy Camp&quot; has a great sounding sax part; and &quot;13 Stitches&quot; is as raw as punk made in the past 10 years gets.  This album is worth every penny, and any fan of NOFX, punk music, or music in general should give this record a listen.
0792101448|5.0|Extremly great music.It is relaxing and entense at the same time.Very subtle and you can always hear a differant note under the main music.Like a song within a song.It is the best I have bought.
B00008LOS1|5.0|You will pay a little extra but what you get is worth every dollar.  It doesn't take a high dollar stereo to hear the improved sound on the original nine songs.  The tracks from the Record Plant in New York are great rock with LESLIE WEST of MOUNTAIN sitting in on the session and adding some great guitar.  The best has been saved for Disc 2.  The Who run through songs from the not yet released LIFEHOUSE(Who's Next).  LOVE AIN'T FOR KEEPIN', PURE AND EASY, BARGAIN, BEHIND BLUE EYES, GETTIN IN TUNE, and WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN are played for the first time in front of an audience.  Anyone who complains about the cost is not a true WHO fan.  I had the pleasure of seeing THE WHO perform in Dallas in November 1973 on the QUADROPHENIA TOUR.  The opening band was LYNYRD SKYNRD.  This is an excellent collection of WHO music and should be owned by anyone who loves classic rock.  BUY THIS!!
B0000931OG|2.0|When Blur acrimoniously parted ways with member Graham Coxon, not only did the group lose its guitarist, but apparently its ability to craft melodic, note-perfect pop tunes.  \\"Think Tank,\\" the group's first long-player in 4 years, sets a new precedent for Blur: they've actually created a record that's dull.  I didn't like it the first listen, and having given it a second go round, I can honestly say that the material doesn't get under my skin like previous albums \\"Parklife,\\" \\"The Great Escape\\" or \\"Modern Life Is Rubbish.\\"  Not that I was looking for a sequel to any of those CDs, but on \\"Think Tank, there's nothing that compares to the perky \\"Country House,\\" soulful \\"Tender,\\" or the hook-heavy \\"Boys and Girls.\\"  But there are a couple moments.  \\"Crazy Beat\\" and \\"We've Got a File On You\\" bring to mind the playful brashness of \\"Song 2\\" and are the only tracks that come closest to a classic Blur song.  The rest of the album, co-produced by Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim), finds Damon Albran and Co. trying to fill the void Coxon left behind.  It's an album built on promising ideas and interesting textures, but the potential is often left unrealized.  \\"On the Way to the Club,\\" \\"Brothers and Sisters,\\" and \\"Ambulance\\" are all haphazardly arranged songs that are all dressed up with no place to go, while it takes supersize patience to sit through the instrumental \\"Jets,\\" which aimlessly cruises on autopilot.  It pains me to say anything bad about Blur, a group I've admired since their debut \\"Leisure.\\"  They were one of the best British groups of the 1990s.  But \\"Think Tank\\" shows that even great bands are capable of releasing one subpar album, and this puppy is it.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Beautiful voice, great, chilled out acoustic guitar playing, nice melodies, some of the songs have that instant classic quality to them, as if they are songs you are going to remember for awhile. The one problem is that the lyrics are kind of mediocre. You think someone with his sound would have more poetic ability, but the lyrics just don't do it for me.
0064471837|5.0|For a book that's considered for children, I have to say that this book is a very excellent read!!! I feel this book borders the lines of semi-dark fantasy. I feel Garth Nix down played allot of scenarios due to it's considered a children's book. To be honest, this book is rated 4.5 stars due to the fact that it only 216 pages long & allot was left unexplained and unsaid. The ideas of Charter magic and Free magic is an excellent idea indicating it separating the old ways of magic and the new. Having the Old Kingdom divided by a wall to prevent dead and vile creatures such as a Mordicant to the New Kingdom implies that there are two separate almost alien worlds are working at hand here. The Old Kingdom has mostly dead roaming the land and free magic flows. The other where people are schooled in magic and having modern technology such as rifles and vehicles like trucks. From beginning to end you are definitely whisked away to an uncharted adventure. This book indeed has an excellent story to be unraveled. In the beginning of the story Abhorsen, Sabriel's father, came upon a group of villagers where a village woman give birth but the newborn died. Abhorsen had the magic ability of going to the gates of Death and bring the child back to life. Coming back from entering the gate of life he claims the child his own. Later in the story, Sabriel is looking for her father and sooner learns that she is having the difficulty to take on the burden of the title of Abhorsen, which in fact, she thought Abhorsen was her father's name and not a title. Don't want to give away any much more of the story but this book it truly unique and standing up to holds its own!!
0553378384|5.0|This book focuses on the Moon's Nodes from the point of view of reincarnation; however, you don't need to believe in reincarnation to benefit from this text.  The author summarizes her extensive experience with many clients in interpreting their Nodes.  Her delineations ring true and there is much of value in what she has to say.  I found this book much more focused and detailed than her previous book called Spirtual Astrology (which was rather general and vague).  It is well written and certainly well worth reading.  She deals only with the house and sign placements of the Nodes and promises to publish another book on aspects involving the Nodes (which I hope she publishes soon).
B00008WG3U|3.0|Ok if i really dont know what to say about NOFX, this album is not as fast as their other ones, if you are just getting into NOFX get this album, that will allow you to aphceriate their other ones even more. Stand OUT SONGS are , Shes Nubs, We got two jealous agains, thats it or maybe its I AM A PENNYWISE FAN, and i think this cd REALLY BLOWS.
B000002J2F|5.0|Duke is the best Genesis album of the Phil Collins era. A little above Trick of the Tail, further ahead of Abacab and miles away from most of the second side of their self titled album, Invisible Touch, and We Can't Dance. It is one of those albums I love to listen to straight through. It is wonderful and, on a personal level, helped me get through a rough time. I was working at a job I hated 60 miles from home and the one thing that kept my spirits up was knowing I would be listening to this cassette during the commute to and fro. Even though, lyrically, the songs on Duke are about loss, I feel good listening to it. Musically, it is uplifting.<br />It starts with the powerful \\"Behind the Lines\\" (a much better version then the one found on Phil Collins' solo album). \\"Duchess\\" is my favorite. It is about the rise and fall of a singer who was, at first, very committed to her art (\\"But she really cared about her music, it all seemed so important then\\") but then became wrapped up in trying to keep her newly earned fame (\\"Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want\\"). On VH1's Behind the Music, Tony Banks referred to this track when describing his band's current state. \\"Guide Vocal\\" is tied to \\"Duchess\\" and is a short, beautiful ballad with simple piano. \\"Man of Our Times\\" is the most experimental of the tracks. The aggressive keyboards almost dominate the vocals. It is a little long and repetitive, but very unique nonetheless. \\"Misunderstanding\\" was the single and quite a good one. You can't help but sing along to it, it is very addictive. <br />On the second side \\"Turn It On Again\\" is another fan favorite. It is an aggressive rocker perfect for the live shows. It sounds even better on Three Sides Live. \\"Alone Again\\" and \\"Please Don't Ask\\" are two pleasing songs about lost love. The latter is a very personal song about Collins' divorce that is, lyrically, even more revealing than the songs on his solo album Face Value (\\"I know that the kids are well, you're a mother to the world but I miss my boy\\"). The last tracks are powerful instrumentals (limited vocals on one) that are definitely not fillers. Fans of Genesis' later material who do not have Duke are missing out on something very special. Get this CD! My bet: your Invisible Touch album will start gathering dust.
0385504209|5.0|Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, Dan Brown tells the story of a religious symbologist and the granddaughter of the murdered curator of the Louvre who uncover mysterious clues that may have tremendous political and religious implications. Brown intertweaves fact with fiction so smoothly that it's difficult to tell the difference. This skill makes the story plausible and frees the imagination to accept the premise and explore the possibilities on its own.<br />Brown's knowledge of art, religion, myth and history is vast and he has equally enormous writing talent which he uses to carve a story that is both educational and entertaining. He interprets the art creations and writings of Leonardo da Vinci to support his premise about the Holy Grail and to unlock the mysteries that have surrounded it through the ages.<br />Brown tells us about the Opus Dei, the Priory of Sion, and the power of the Feminine. He takes the Holy Grail and redefines its meaning in what to some people, may be provocative and offensive. The works of da Vinci and others are interpreted in such a way as to justify and prove Brown's premise. Brown uses the works as evidence which, if brought to light, will drastically alter the Catholic Church and the world's perception of it. Brown populates the novel with colorful characters speaking authentic dialogue which brings them to life. Characters include an albino monk, a paraplegic historian and a persistent and conscientious detective.<br />The Da Vinci Code is excellent. It's intriguing, very readable and highly recommended!
B000000OQY|4.0|I think this is an ace album who cares about the lyrics or the song titles? I think frontmen shold be allowed to say what they want when they want simply because they have the right to. So forget about all the 'offensive' rubbish and listen to the songs not the abuse. This is a good album to listen to in any mood because of the variety of songs on it.
B00000GUZP|1.0|Don't let the enthusiastic reviews from other Debbie fans sway you, this album is a complete misfire.  Ms. Harry moves from disco to rap to jazz without succeeding in either genre.  &quot;Backfired&quot; the first single sounded ten years out of date even in 1981 when this solo album was released.  Despite dozens of listens by this huge Blondie fan, I cannot make myself admire any of the songs on this mishmash.
B0000067L2|5.0|Disraeli Gears is the second of three killer albums from Cream, along with Fresh Cream and Wheels of Fire. There are several classics on this album and the lesser known songs are just as strong. The performances are absolutely brilliant throughout the album.  First there's the huge single \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", featuring one of the most memorable riffs in rock n' roll history, which is still played everyday on classic rock radio. Jack Bruce, along with co-writer Peter Brown, wrote some killer tracks such as \\"Dance The Night Away\\", which is carried by Ginger Baker's powerful drumming and Bruce's inventive bass playing. They also contributed \\"Swlabr\\", one of their best tracks ever, lead by Bruce's soaring vocals. Eric Clapton's playing is great throughout, particularly on the wah-wah heavy \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" and their cover of \\"Outside Woman Blues.\\" Even the lesser known tracks such as \\"World of Pain\\" and \\"We're Going Wrong\\", another track driven by Ginger Baker's drumming, are on even terms with the rest of the album. Excellent album from the best year in music, 1967.
0316666343|3.0|All in all it wasn't really that bad, just really hard to get in to.  I felt lost a lot of the time, and took a long time to read it.  This book is definatly not a &quot;sunday read.&quot;
B00005JKZV|5.0|I don't normally review many items but I do feel the need to take a moment to say how great the Two Towers was. It is a given fact that it did stray from the book at times, but as any film maker knows, when you make an adaption of a series you must make a few sacrifices in order to aid those who maybe have not read the series. I was happy despite the changes that were made. I think peter jackson did an incredible job adapting a very thick novel into and understandable and enjoyable series of films.<br />By the way, being a reader of Tolkien does not qualify you to make a movie.
6301930827|5.0|I saw this movie a couple years ago and it is probably one of the best &quot;movies you've never heard of&quot;.  The details of this movie about a nuclear was between the U.S. and the old Soviet Union(remember, this is 1990) are incredible.  Everything from the cockpit of a B-52 on a nuclear strike mission, to SAC (Stratigic Air Command) Headquarters, to the White HOuse, and the E-4B Airborne Command Post.  The most shocking part of this movie is that it still could happen today.  The writers of this movie defenetly did there homework.

0345347951|3.0|I'm a big fan of sci-fi and deem Clarke as the best author of the category. But after reading great novels such as Rendezvous with Rama, 2001, 2010 and Fountains of Paradise and also having read good reviews about Childhood's End, I was expecting more of it. This book does not follow the good old Clarke's hard sci-fi. The story begins with an alien invasion pretty much like Independence Day film, which is something that even Clarke don't think it is possible. Of course the fact that UFOs are not plausible does not mean that we cannot enjoy a story about it, but it's important to inform clarke's readers that this book is different from what they would expect.
B00005JKHP|1.0|This was a box office smash when released in 1979. Tickets cost less back then, but as many people saw it today, it would have grossed $370 MILLION!!!!!!!!! How well a movie does has little, if anything to do with quality, it is all about promotion. So many people came to see it because it showcased such eye-popping special effects. Like 1998's Lost in Space, This movie had a very weak plot that was moved along only by the breath-taking visuals. When I rented Lost in Space five years after it came out, the visuals were still impressive, but not as good as I remembered. When they become obsolete, as this movie's are, the movie is essentially left with nothing. <br />Don't get me wrong, I am a big Star Trek fan, I just found this movie to be too long and boring. I have never gotten tired of the other movies (Except for the mediocre Star Trek V) But the positiv ething about this entry to the movie series is it made Trek mainstream. If this weren't the phenomenal success that it was there would be no Wrath of Khan. While this first movie was a boring film that contributes little if any insight into the Star Trek universe, it did pave the way for 9 more sequels, which blew this one away (I really hope that Nemesis won't be the last.) However, as for as quality goes, this movie didn't do it for me. By contrast, The Wrath of Khan, the BEST in the series had the lowest budget, minimal special effects, but it focused on plot and character development, making it much more watchable.

0553288105|3.0|The book is based on the electron-pump as an unlimited source of energy, possibly the most creative idea I've ever seen in a science fiction book. Asimov handles very interestingly the existence of a paralel world, but I think the story lacks the narrative power that makes you refuse to stop reading the book.
B00006LJ79|5.0|This CD is great. It has all the great songs of t.A.T.u. I recommend this album highly. I have thwe Not gonna get us being shipped also, i recommend that too.<br />              GREAT ALBUM!!!  ^^
0451166752|5.0|This book made me become a sci-fi fan! Even if you found the film incomprehensible or boring, you must read the book, because it's hugely readable and not boring at all! The ideas involved by Clarke, such as the monolith, HAL and a civilization independent from matter are not only ingenious and creative, but it also goes deeper than sci-fi and makes us wonder about existence, God and the meaning of life.<BR>  If this book has a defect, it is the fact that it's hard to find a novel as good. Since it was the first Clarke book I read, it made me read 7 other Clarke's books since then(including the 3 Odyssey sequels) but none as brilliant and uncanny as this, even though Rendezvous with Rama and 2010 are almost as good!
B00005QK3B|5.0|This is, in my humble opinion, Marillion's best album together with Clutching at Straws, and ...Jester's... Great music, great buy.

6304401132|5.0|Ever since I was a little girl, this movie has touched my heart. I'm 13 now, and I still love it! :) This movie is great, funny, romantic, and proves that you CAN have your Prince Charming, with a little faith. I'm still waiting for mine, but I have faith that the beloved boy I adore will be my Prince Charming someday... :) Anyway, back to the story. LOL. The voices are excellent, espically Mary Costa for the speaking and singing voice for Princess Aurora. Kids and adult's will love this movie, I can't wait for the DVD!
B00000K19E|2.0|This flick is all computerized special effects and characters who are as bloodless as the computers.  That is, the effects are fun but the people are of little concern, since they have no reality -- being involved instead with leaping great distances through the air, walking on walls, and dodging bullets. The plot seems to involve the premise that everyboy has been created or controlled by a computer somewhere.  The principals, who may be human beings, lie about hooked up to a computer aboard some sort of vehicle.  What we see on the screen appears to be what's going on in their brains.  Then there are other human-like creatures trying to hunt them down.  Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburn sort all this out.
055321277X|5.0|Along with &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is a part of that great immortal triad of gothic terrors from the 19th century from which a seemingly endless stream of fans, imitators, critics, and dreamers continue to derive unmitigated inspiration.  But despite its classic status, and the fact that virtually everyone in the English-speaking world can instantly recognize the story's title, few have ever actually read Stevenson's little nightmare (the Bantam edition runs to no more than 114 pages, including Jerome Charyn's afterword)or even seen one of its many cinematic incarnations.  Of the aforementioned trio, &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; certainly appears the most neglected.  This, despite the fact that it is certainly the most accessible. It is indeed much shorter than either &quot;Dracula&quot; or &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; and anyone with good eyes can read it in a day.  Even the visually challenged amongst us can do so in two.  More importantly, this book is certainly the best written of the three (in)famous works, as Stevenson was by far the most proficient and thoroughly accomplished wordsmith of the authors who gave us these benighted classics.  Moreover, despite its reputation as a horror story, it is in fact more of a Victorian mystery, and for those who do not much care for horror is surely a more palatable selection than either of its brothers.<br />That last point is perhaps part of the problem.  Readers who come to Stevenson's novella expecting to find a giant Hyde rampaging through London like Godzilla in Tokyo, or even doing his best Hannibal Lecter imitation, will be sadly disappointed.  &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is not about blood and thunder, however valuable those elements undeniably are in their proper place.  Rather, it is a story of philosophy, soul-searching, sin and redemption.  It is a subtle, scholarly tale in which much is implied but little shown, and where the goblins which haunt the London fog are only rarely permitted to stumble out to us.  The modern reader, particular one weaned on such drivel as the &quot;Scream&quot; movies or &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; will have to unlearn much he may have come to believe about effective fantasy in order to savor Stevenson's masterpiece.<br />Beyond that, the story's classic status and innumerable adaptations and parodies in the cinema and pop culture (particularly in the classic Bugs Bunny episode) have vampirized the tale of much of its major element--mystery.  Nobody today opens this book with any doubt as to the true relationship between Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde.  However bowlderized our modern perceptions of this story have become, we nonetheless all know from the outside where Hyde really comes from.  So the mystery that must have been so opaque, so innovative and exciting to the original audience that had nothing but Stevenson's own story to go by, is denied us.  To some, that makes reading this book little more than a minor chore.<br />And that's a shame, because no matter how familiar this tale of the duality of Man and his eternal struggle between his Dark and Light sides may have become to us, it remains one of the most readable and thoroughly pleasurable books of its era.  Stevenson's prose is precise, and with short, sure strokes he paints a tapestry of the human psyche and its unhallowed depths the like of which no modern slasher film has ever approached.  Granted, the story may have been better served to give Hyde a bit more time on-stage.  Perhaps some of the characters could have used some more fleshing-out.  An epilogue might have served to tie the narrative up more securely...<br />...may, perhaps, might...ultimately those words do not matter, for whatever &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; might not be is irrelevant compared to what it is:  the penultimate masterpiece of gothic mystery, and a classic that will endure long after that very genre has itself otherwise disappeared.  Read it for what it is, and enjoy.
B000066NW0|4.0|I've heard her live, and her live voice sucks.  However, since they fixed up her voice on the CD, it sounds really good.  The songs are catchy and poppy.  So pick it up, it's not the best or most original CD ever, but it's all right.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I have no idea why there are so many 5 star reviews for this album.<br />I have desperately tried and tried time and again to at least find any redeeming moments on this CD. Unfortunately, that did not happen. INstead, I have found myself getting more and more angered at the sheer lack of substance and the extremely juvenile nature of this 'excuse' for an album.<br />Even from face value, the first single \\"I'm a Slave For You\\" absolutely made me lose my lunch in it's softcore nature and it's lack of any melody and shoddy rhythm. I swear, was this from a broken drum machine or recording computer? I haven't heard a song that totally made me feel insulted and absolutely<br />Every song on here is totally ridiculous. \\"Boys\\" is just a complete and totally laughable joke from beginning to end and an embarrassment to all kinds of pop music. It sounds like a cheap attempt at trying to create a 2002 version of Janet Jackson's \\"Nasty\\" but where that Janet song is a total classic, \\"Boys\\" is more like the opening theme to some comedy show. The cover of Joan Jett's \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\" is absolutely atrocious and completely ruins a marvelous classic. The rest of this album fares no better with jokes like \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Overprotected\\" and \\"Anticipating\\".<br />Overall, I don't see a single sign of artistic growth. The last two albums were bad enough but this one deserves to be thrown down the garbage disposal.<br />I have desperately tried to at least appreciate at least something on this album but I have completely given up and I find this to be a bloodstain on the history of pop music. I don't know why so many seem to like this horrid album. This is the bottom of the barrel in pop music. When the moments come where I'm not disgusted when hearing this wretched album, it's just completely boring.<br />If you want something intelligent and challenging, I suggest Massive Attack's \\"Mezzanine\\" for some REAL artistic brilliance. If you want something great fun to listen but don't want to be challenged or intellictualized, I suggest getting the \\"Dance Mix USA\\" and \\"Ultimate Dance Party\\" collections instead. Even Britney herself can do better than this.want to be challenged or intellictualized, I suggest getting the \\"Dance Mix USA\\" and \\"Ultimate Dance Party\\" collections instead.

0316666343|5.0|Ok, I really really enjoyed this book. I laughed and cried, it was a good thing. It gave me a look on after life that I really never thought of before. go read it.
B00008MNYS|4.0|He's a mega star all over the globe, 5 years strong;  but in our little world he's Robbie who? Will he make it here this time? Chances are NO! I bought the Euro version months ago and love it. Even thou his US label changed the org. tracks (for the better I think) the Radio Gods (programmers) still wont give him a chance. Keep up the hip hop,rap and the same tired rock. I for one know better. If your a fan of RW obtain both versions.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|Until the revelation of the Big Surprise, the movie is great.  After that, it becomes the typical Hollywood head vs. heart smackdown.  Like any professional wrestling presentation, it's a fixed fight.  You're a fool to bet on the gray wrinkled tinker toy instead of the little red pumping engine that could.  We Americans can't seem to get enough of such this corner/that corner spectacles, despite the predictability of the formula and the drabness of the platitudes that pop out in the end.<br />Crowe puts up a good struggle here, but no actor could slog gracefully through the syrup that coagulates over the last third of this script.  Ed Harris is awesome.  Jennifer Connelly is a pretty cream puff and little else.<br />The DVD is full of the typical self-congratulatory and mutual back-patting nonsense, along with a bunch of useless behind-the-scenes material.  What's the point of knowing how the special effects and make-up were done, how the cast was chosen, how the score was written, etc?  Especially for this film which is not destined to be a classic.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The movie The Two Towers is a great movie. I have read the books from: The Hobbit - The Return of the King. The Two Towers movie doesnt show everything in the book that is important that will be supposed to be coming up in the 3rd book, The Return of the King. But the movie is great, the 3rd one should be the best, Iam also starting to read Sauron Defeated. It is a great book.
B000002540|5.0|My brainwaves echo BOC music.  They are truly a Cult. Those who know, know.  <br />This album is great.  \\"Last Days of May\\" and \\"Subhuman\\" themselves are worth the price.
B000002UAU|5.0|\\"Lovely Rita (Metermaid)\\", \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" and \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\"--for these three hits alone, any Beatle fan needs this album. Along with \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", I think this makes a core set of Beatles for anyone who loves them. Oops, have to add the White Album to that list.<br />When I looked at a Linda Eastman McCartney photo of the Beatles that hangs in the shop where I get my hair cut, it struck me that two of the four are now gone. How sad that is. How wonderful to have this cd to enjoy their music. I love this album.
B00007KQA3|4.0|1984 is not a happy book nor is this a feel good movie. one gets the sense of how opressive the world of Big Brother would be. The film was prosessed to look washed out and this adds to the overall effect. The film is done well, but it's not something you would want to watch everyday, it's just too depressing.
B000002UAX|5.0|When this album first came out, the intent was to have a nude photo on the cover. Nope, not in the Sixties. So the cover was blank white to protest the censorship. Many kids peeled the white cover to shreds on the rumor that the nude photo was actually underneath (and we played Revolution #9 backwards on the turntable to hear if it said \\"Paul is Dead.\\" We did a lot of dumb stuff.)<br />This is absolutely one of my favorite of all Beatle albums, especially for the guitar work in \\"Blackbird\\" and the quirky tunes like \\"Rocky Raccoon.\\" There's also the bluesy \\"Why don't we do it in the road\\" which was pretty rude back then (no gangsta rap in the Sixties.) There is tons of great music here, two CD's. One of my all-time favorite albums of all times, of course, replete with fun teen memories as well.
B000069AUI|5.0|this is an absolutely awesome CD. i love the lyrics and the music, it's so well put together. i've never listened to Coldplay before except for the song &quot;yellow&quot; and they are now my favorite band. i know i sound a little extreme, but this CD is REALLY good. it's worth buying.
B000089RVX|5.0|I got this album a few weeks ago and I haven't stopped listening yet. Here's a run down of the songs and how I feel about them:<BR>1. Going Under - Incredible song. Should be on the radio soon. 5/5<BR>2. Bring Me To Life - Even better song. Already on radio. 5/5<BR>3. Everybody's Fool - A cool song with awesome guitar. 5/5<BR>4. My Immortal - Not my favorite since it's slower, but good to listen to when you're sad. 4/5<BR>5. Haunted - This is a great song! I can only imagine how awesome the video for this song would be. 5/5<BR>6. Tourniquet - Cool song, and even if you're not religious, the song still works. Like she's crying out to a God that won't answer. This is a cover from another band. 4/5<BR>7. Imaginary - Wonderfully written song about escaping to your own dream world. Great lyrics and imagery. 5/5<BR>8. Taking Over Me - This is my favorite song on the album. The hopeless pain she pours into the song coupled with the intoxicatingly gorgeous background music makes for a song which should be their next single in my opinion. 10/5<BR>9. Hello - Strange song. From what I can gather it's about schizophrenia?! lol 4/5<BR>10. Last Breath - A song about death. Not original, but what music is anymore? Great presentation and deep lyrics. 5/5<BR>11. Whisper - This is a cool song, but the ending is rather odd. 4/5<br />There ya have it. My run down, for whatever it's worth. My advice would be to buy the album right away. I haven't regretted it for one second. Also as an aside here, buy LoveHateTragedy from Papa Roach if you want to hear some more good music. ;)
B000002HRE|5.0|This album is full of songs that feature depth and meaning, and still rock. Metallica is still just as good, if not better than before. I am a fan of all Metallica, but I find the material on \\"ReLoad\\" the best the have ever done. The album is well balanced with rocking songs like \\"Bad Seed\\", \\"Better Than You\\", \\"Prince Charming\\", \\"Fuel\\", and \\"Attitude\\". Songs like \\"The Memory Remains\\", \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" and \\"Unforgiven II\\" show us a side of the band filled with meaningfull creativity. \\"Fixxxer\\" is a song that completely described my life a few years ago. I beleive it is the best Metallica song ever made.<br />This cd rocks.
B0000931OG|5.0|Naturally, I have been waiting or this CD for quite some time.  The boxed Best of Blur was great but not enough.<br />From  the first track on,  this is an exceptional CD.  It is still experimental and lo-fi, like \\"13\\" but a little more polished.  However, unlike \\"13\\",  this is less meloncholy, other  than \\"Out of Time\\" which is a great track.  Most of the tracks although not as punked at \\"Crazy Beat\\" are less introspective really, which is good, seems Damon has moved on from that break-up that was tormenting him.  \\"Good Song\\" does harken a bit back to earlier sugary love songs and \\"We've Got a File On You\\" sounds like a shot back to \\"Bank Holiday\\" with punk overtones.  I particularly enjoy the heavy Morrocan influence on some of the tracks.<br />Even with the departure of Graham Coxan, the guitar work is still all Blur.  The one big difference I notice was much more use of  bass lines, guess Alex had to step up to the plate on that one.<br />This isn't for people who are expecting another \\"Song 2\\" or \\"Parklife\\".  They have grown up quite a bit and you can hear it.<br />Cheers!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Don't be fooled by my name.  While my style of music is hard and loud, I also have a deep love for the music of Johnny Cash.  I have to admit, though, I was somewhat skeptical about Cash covering Depeche Mode and NIN.  Boy...was I wrong!!!  He does a haunting rendition of Hurt by NIN.  It gives me chills everytime I listen to it.  He also does an awesome job on Personal Jesus and In My Life, by Bette Midler.  WOW!!!
B00008S2VG|1.0|I bought this because I am a big fan of the artist, but this is the most boring music Madonna has ever created. It begins with the lackluster first single and title track which sounds like two very different songs which were spliced together in an attempt to make one song out of them. She sounds like she wants to say something important, but doesn't quite have the vocabulary to get her point across. She wants to express an extreme point of view..she's not a Christian and not a Jew? Please...who cares? The next song is Hollywood which is supposed to be the second single. Too bad she repeats the same lyrics over and over and ends by saying \\"Push the button...don't push the button, etc,\\" which is exactly what I find myself doing each time I listen to it...I push the skip button only to end up at the awful song \\"I'm So Stupid\\" which is even worse than the previous two songs. There are several songs on the album with potential. \\"Nothing Fails,\\" \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" and \\"Mother and Father\\" are acceptable Madonna pop songs; however, songs on this album sound unfinished and unpolished. Madonna should know that her fans are not fans of folk or guitar music. If I wanted to hear something like this, I would buy a Jewel or James Taylor album.
B00005JKES|3.0|I watched this and was very excited, i wish it could go on and on and on.  Unfortunately it doesn't go on, so I ate the DVDs and casing and made a small poo castle.  Isn't that wonderful?

0385504209|4.0|The first 180 pages are great, then the middle becomes a little contrived, you ever see on of those movies, where they throw so many twists in it pisses you off?  Well there are a good 80 pages of that in this book, but he wraps it up delicately in the end.  I enjoyed immensely and overall was very satisfied.

B000002HMH|4.0|You know, Its absolutely mind boggling how closed minded and un-appreciative people can be. Metallica, a band where in the beginning had such a solid fan base, and come the black album a portion seemed to just turn their back and never look back. As I will say and other metallica fans have, metallica evolved and will continue to do so. One if not the main objective with any band should be to try and go onto new and different musical territories with every album that comes out. As a fairly new metallica fan, and an ever growing one I like both new and old metallica.  Although I do consider the old material to have a more...well timeless value to it.  <br />After 1991's the black album metallica took a five-year hiatus from releasing any new studio material. People grew suspicious and a backlash occurred when load hit in 1996. Where the black album came into metallica's evolution, they were no longer a thrash metal band, but a very well rounded hard rock band. <br />It is my opinion and belief and contrary to a popular one that load caught metallica at their most versile musical point yet. Hetfeild had a very good vocal range, Newsted's bass was more vibrant than even and show's very interesting bass riffs in such tunes as \\"king nothing\\" and \\"until it sleeps\\", Lars's drumming has a better range and Hammet's guitar playing was and is ever evolving. The point is people, bands change, metallica changed.  By when they released this album they were well into there mid 30's and it's illogical a band would not musically change in that instance. Unfortunately, metallica at the point of load's release were dammed if they did, and they were dammed if they didn't.<br />Load, in my opinion is much more diverse and show's metallica can do much more than thrash metal (and I am partial to thrash) and  mix blues, hard rock, and alternative into a very solid album. The only problem is that load and re-load despite having great tunes also had their share of filler, songs like \\"cure\\" and \\"poor twisted me\\" are examples. Odd enough, re-load had twice as much filler. Songs like \\"the house that jack built\\" , \\"until it sleeps\\" , \\"Bleeding me\\" and \\"Ronnie\\" with it's led zeppelingish vi
B00000DGUY|3.0|Fine cuts but what about the earliest and the best, from the first album??  Sultans of Swing, fine, but for my money the most swingingest of Dire Straits tunes were Water of Love, and Down to the Waterline.  Unsurpassable...
B00005JKPF|5.0|i've havn't seen this movie but i know a lot of people who have and it looks so good and i've herd it was good.  \\"X-MEN\\" was great and that last sentence at the end made u know that their is a second one and the sentence at the end makes u want 2 see this one.  I can't wate 2 see it!
B00005JKPF|5.0|I loved the first X-Men, mostly for its intriging story, fine acting and cool special effects.  Multiply all those by two and you get the result: X2.  The characters are more developed, the action tighter and more gripping and the story more  compelling.  This is a truly statisfying thriller.  The best performance in the movie is a tie: I would have to give that honor to Hugh Jackman again for his evolution as Wolverine, Brian Cox as the sinister, mutant-hating Col. Stryker, Ian McKellan for the wicked Magneto and surprisingly Alan Cumming as the religious Nightcrawler.  The movie starts off with a bang as Nightcrawler attempts to assinate the President in a headspinning opening sequence.  The film moves from there, held together by the stern and tight direction of Bryan Singer and a meatier script where original writer David Hayter gets aid from two other wirters, who help develop the characters more and give the movie a healthy dose of humor.  The climax is an extended sequence at Alkalai Lake, where special effects and an atmosphere of  impending doom take over leaving you leveled from it.  Unless you have been living under a rock for the past month, you know X2 has been coming, and it was well worth the hype.  An action movie with a brain, X2 will leave in awe.
B00005JKPF|5.0|X2 starts off like a Jackie Chan flick; a riveting action sequence that doesn't really explain what's going on, but you don't care because its a darn good ride! Seeing the teleporting blue-one(Nightcrawler) in action was pretty cool, but nothing prepared me for what would come next.<br /> This is the second Marvel Comics film sequel(the first being Blade 2), and luckily unlike most sequels, this one surpasses the original. The plot's deeper, the action is more frantic, and the special effects look better. Plus, we get to see some brief cameo appearances of some mutants that weren't in the first X-men movie, including Colossus. The relationship between Cyclops and Jean Grey is delved into a bit further, and we also get to witness even more of Mystique's power to transform into other people, which even got me confused at one part. The orchestral score is decent, though you won't find anything memorable like the Star Wars or Idiana Jones themes.<br /> The movie isn't hard to get into if you're not a fan of the comics or even if you didn't watch the first movie. Either way, X2 is a great movie for those who'd like to see the further adventures of Wolverine and Co.
B00008A7HZ|5.0|In Oz, they released a CD + DVD version. I didn't buy this 'cuz <br />a) it's a [bad] CD Case <BR>b) the video are always on VIDEOHITS <BR>c) it's seems to girlish and babyish to have a notepad included. <br />If it were a normal case, with song-words (original version doesn't have song-words) and DVD, i'd buy it. the cds okay
B000002UB3|5.0|A few years back famous figures in the music industry were asked to name their favourite Beatles track. The results were predictable (Yesterday, Hey Jude etc etc) until it got to George Martin, the man who should know named his favourite track as side two of Abbey Road taken as a whole. Start at Polythene Pam and you will not find a finer 15 minutes of music anywhere.
B000007S5B|4.0|I rate this album at four stars, instead of five, because \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" is not the Doors best album. That said, this is still an excellent disc. In 1967, the Doors released two classic, trippy, dark, hard rocking albums, the self-titled debut, and \\"Strange Days\\". The Doors toned it down a notch for their third album, \\"Waiting for the Sun\\". Overall, this album, and the follow-up \\"the Soft Parade\\" are more pop-savvy and lightweight than it's predecessors, and the Doors final two albums with the original lineup. The songs on this CD are very well writen, with a lot of harmony, melody, and good hooks. \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" has a rellaxed, laid back feel, and flows nicely. The first two tracks \\"Hello I Live You\\" and \\"Love Street\\" are feel-good, pop songs. I feel that \\"Hello I love You\\" is one of the weakest Doors songs, ever, as it is over produced. I prefer \\"Love Street.\\" \\"Not to Tough the Earth\\" is pretty dark, creepy and menacing.\\" It has an almost urgent, paranoid feel to it. \\"Summer's almost gone\\" is a rather mellow song, which I interpret to mean as innocence coming to an end. \\"Wintertime Love\\" is a very underrated pop song, in the vein of \\"Hello I love You\\" only much better, in my opinion. The \\"Unknown Solider\\" is an antiwar song. \\"Spanish Caravan\\" is another pop song, with, as the name of the song suggests, a Spanish feel to it. \\"My Wild Love\\" is an anthem, that seems to have been world beat, and Native American inspired. \\"We Could be so Good together\\" is another pop song. It's good, but not great. \\"Yes, the River Knows\\" is a beautiful, balled that sounds almost like a lullaby. \\"Five to One,\\" is the closing song. It is an anthem about youth and standing up to the status quo. This album was released the same year as the Tet Offensive, large domestic antiwar protests, and the assassinations of RFK and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, and the election of Richard Nixon. \\"Five to One\\" can be better appreciated, if thought of in that context.<br /> Do yourself a favor and buy this CD.nd buy this CD.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Criticism 1: Meteroa is Hybrid Theory 2.<BR>- as great as HT is, Meteora is better. Better because it takes the the spirit of Hybrid Theory and expands on it, in a fuller, richer and more mature way. Meteroa is an album of muscial depth, one listen is never enough. Where Hybrid Theroy was edgy, Meteroa is softer. Meteroa is very much of a reflection of where and who Linkin Park are now.<br />Criticism 2: Meteroa is repetitive.<BR>- having listened to the album non-stop for the last 2 weeks, I think this is just an unfounded. Don't Stay sounds nothing like Nobody's Listening, Easier to Run sounds nothing like Lying from You. Breaking the Habit sounds nothing like Faint.  Where, I ask, is the repetition? All the songs on this record are standout briliance, fantastically individually and yet always with the common thread that is Linkin Park.<br />Criticism 3: Meteora is too short?<BR>-since when has the value of a record been determined by it's length. Meteora is the only CD I have in my considerable collection that hasn't seen the skip button. I'd rather take 37 minutes of brilliance than have to skip over \\"fillers\\" and ... songs. <br />Meteora is everything that music should be: without boundaries and restrictions of genre and sounds, rich and powerful. The vocals are fabulous as always, with the chemistry between Mike and Chester becoming fuller with every song, the guitar work by Brad is flawless, accentuating the mood of each song, the drumming is superb, Phoenix rocks on bass and Mr. Hahn is far superior on Meteora than he ever was on Hybrid Theory.<br />Can't find a bad thing to say about this CD, it is absolute fantastic! A more than worthy addition to anybody's music collection.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Well, Mr. Bay & Mr. Bruckheimer, I really did expect a lot more from this movie when I saw your names on it. I'm sorry to say that you guys disapointed me a little.<BR>Ok, the reason I gave it at least 3 stars is that the special effects are great and the love story triangle between Rafe(Ben Affleck), Evelyn(Kate Beckinsale) & Danny(Josh Hartnett) brings a good drama into the movie, the cast is very good, but...<BR>BUT<BR>why did you name the movie \\"Pearl Harbor\\" something that's supposed to be based on an actual event and pretty much messed up the real story, including F.D.R.'s famous speach? And another big mistake is that little \\"2-men hero\\" [show] that Ben & Josh managed to pull off during the attack. Not that it didn't really happen, but the whole thing pretty much concetrated on those two. I don't know if you're aware but in the ACTUAL attack there were more than 2 men that deserve at least some credit. And I'm not even mentioning the Japanese military which was so greatly played by Chinese actors and extras.<BR>Oh well I'm still one of your big fans, but you definetly [messed] this one up. <BR>I DON'T THINK YOU MADE THE VETERANS HAPPY EITHER!
B000002C4J|2.0|I am definitely no Celine Dion fan and never will be. Celine has a tendency to oversing and as a result my ears bleed from her oversinging. I own this cd because I love the previously unreleased song \\"To Love You More\\", a theme song to some Japanese soap opera; and Celine's cheesy covers of the Bee Gees' \\"Immortality\\" and Harry Nilson's \\"When I Need You\\". And as overplayed as it was, I even enjoy \\"My Heart Will Go On\\". Well now I do because it isn't clogging up the radio airwaves. The worst tracks has to be the Barbara Streisand duet \\"Tell Him\\". The lyrics are corny and the music is awful. I found Celine's attempts at reggae on \\"Treat Her Like a Lady\\" quite laughable. Bad comedy at its worst. The title track is even worse in terms of corny lyrics. No, make that her duet with Pavarotti on \\"I Hate You Then I Love You\\". The title itself is stupid enough. I have heard much better singers at the church I attended as a child. At least they didn't blow out their lungs like Celine does on every song she yells, er, sings. I will never understand why she is popular.
B00005YW4H|3.0|These days in mainstream culture, I've gotten so used to singers and records getting unworthy overhype. I've also gotten used to singers with truly exceptional talents get walked over. I've also gotten used to, and accepted the fact that all the good stuff was a few decades before my time.Not that there isn't any good music these days, but I sure ain't been seeing any more Nina Simone(s), or Aretha(s) come along, which is saying that all the best is nestled in the past.What exists these days is just the rest.So, I can't say I was exactly dissapointed, upon taking a whole listen through this album.I don't believe in the grammys anymore, and I expected what I heard from Norah's hit \\"Don't Know Why\\".Something sweet,calm,safe, and no exactly jazz(more like soft pop with some western twang, and a touch of jazz).That is exactly what I got.This album offers nothing new, or special.And neither does Norah Jones.Norah has a sweet,if slightly thin voice, but I've heard many sweet voices, and I gotta say I've heard sweeter ones. The main problem is that Norah's frail voice, and lack of experience does not have what it takes to sing jazz.In jazz,or blues, what you need above all is experience.You need to understand each and every single word you're pronouncing.You need to feel the music, you need to know the music, the music needs to broil within the very depths of your soul.Get it???Norah Jones does not have the ability to do that.And never will.Then again, you say well, \\"she's only 22, give her time\\".Then again, I say, Nina Simone was also only 22 when she sang I Love You Porgy.That should shut people up.Not that there should be any comparison between Nina and Norah, and you need compare nobody to Nina, or other greats, especially Norah, but what I'm saying is that, just like a joke is either funny, or it's not, well, you either feel the music, or you don't, and just like no amount of time will make an unfunny joke funny, no amount of time will the give the singer soul.The most Norah can hope for is to improve her range a tad. I also hate how Norah pronounces her words, as though she were some sexy,smoky jazz singer.Always putting special emphasis on the A's.It's incredibly annoying, and makes her otherwise pleasant voice annoying.You know someone who tries to sing with soul, but doesn't have it??That's Norah for you.As for the music, I can't exactly all it real jazz.It's more like lounge-y type music, with jazzy undertones.Or soft pop.Whatever.It's painfully bland arrangements don't help the otherwise pretty songs. Her pronounciation takes away from the Painter Song, and Turn Me On.Turn Me On starts out with promise, but falls flat in the end, as it lacks depth, and has Norah reaching for places where her voice can't go.The material is pretty, but forgettable.Nothing that has me thinking about it twice.One listen through this album is enoughto assure me that this girl is nothing to go nuts about.Heck, she's not even anything to look out for.I predict that within 2 years this girl will fade into obscurity.I'll let you search for some truly great music on your own.
B000002UAX|3.0|As a MAJOR Beatles fan, and as someone whose heart breaks to say anything negative about them, I really don't understand the praise for this double album.  This is The Beatles at their worst, when they were beginning to splinter as a group and becoming individuals.<br /><br />One can hear that the music is not tight and there are four guys trying their best to work together as a group and two albums of junk being the end result.<br /><br />My favorite cut on this is \\"Dear Prudence.\\"  I also enjoy \\"Cry Baby Cry,\\" but this album makes ME want to cry because it's not the boys working together.  Magical Mystery Tour is better than this!<br /><br />If you want to listen to the boys at their best, listen to Rubber Soul and Revolver, in that order.
B00005JLXE|3.0|out of all the comic movies coming out, daredevil ranks about half way.  it is a very entertaining movie with some really cool moments.  the down side to the movie is its far fetched aspects.  i know this is a comic book movie, but you have to understand that the characters of this comic book are all human and have no special or mutant powers.  daredevil's enhanced senses make sense because he is blind and everyone knows that all other senses become keener when one is lost.  the story is a good one and has its interesting elements.  affleck does not disappoint, and does a good job, not great but good.  jennifer garner does a great job and fills elektra's shoes very well.  she has a great presence and has the right attitude for the role.  the real standout is colin farrel. (i can never spell his name right.)  he anils bullseye to almost perfection.  to me it does not seem like much of a stretch for him to play that type of character considering his personality in real life.  however, i really dont care because i feel that he is one of the best actors to come along in a very long time.  he has charissma to spare and has the acting chops to back it up.  michael clarke duncan does make his presence known, but for a man his size, its hard not to make his presence known.  but any man of size could have played that role, so he does not garner a lot on attention.  like i said, daredevil was good, but the fact that at the end of the movie charcters start jumping distance and scaling walls that are not humanly possible are the only real detractors to the story.  the action is great and the fight scenes are worth going to see the movie or at the very least rent it.  i recommend this movie but not strongly, its good for a friday night watch.  but i am still torn as to whether i will buy it on dvd or not.  who knows.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is amazing. I don't like very many musicals. I was kinda scared to watch Chicago at first because I never heard any of the songs. Then I heard \\"All that jazz\\", \\"Good to mama\\", and my absolute favorite song, \\"Cell block tango\\". I knew I just had to see it. And I did. I loved it. Now I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can see it again.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book based on a recommendation. It was awesome, and I couldn't put it down. There were times during it that I was so caught up I actually started to tear up. Buy this book, you won't regret it!
0060926317|4.0|I bought this book because of a book club I am in.  I was surprised at how interesting the novel was, and was moved by the message.  I enjoyed the message about we, the takers of the earth and the givers being the first people.  I would recommened this book because of what it has to say, and also it is a quick read.

0385504209|5.0|I received the Da Vinci code several weeks ago but with limited reading time, held off until this Mother's Day to take my &quot;day off&quot; to read.  What a wonderful gift.  Though a thriller, a genre I love, the book was exceedingly well written and a page turner from the first to last.  Brown's exhaustive research is well balanced and informative.  The ultimate gift however was the underlying theme of the necessary balance between the feminine and masculine.  Thank you Mr. Brown.
B00006JDVV|4.0|I cant believe the reviews this movie has on this page! I saw it in theaters and own the dvd. I love the acting,the special effects and story. The reason why the dragons are not shown in every frame is they had a medium sized budget.Even so they look fantastic,and you never spot one bad shot of them.Matthew mcconaughey steals the show as the meanest dragon slayer on earth.If you love b movies that look and feel like first class pictures you will love this furious ride.
B000005S6B|5.0|well, i liked floggin molly and dropkick murphys, so pogues were recommended to me. <br />all i have to say is, MacGowans voice is the sexiest voice ive ever heard. man i love his voice. yeah i love irish accents...ahh.
0345409671|3.0|As a tremendous Anne Rice fan I loved her style of writing and her way of making the book so full of details you feel as if you're there, in this book. But this book, I believe, was weak compared to the other books in \\"The Vampire Chronicles.\\" The base of the book was strong suggesting that Lestat was being chased by Satan, yet I feel it got lost with the way in which Rice tried to add in nonsense fluff to the story. I think that she went too deeply into religion, the beginnings of man, and the way she believes heaven and hell will be. I just hope the next one will be better.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|This third album from Godsmack entitled FACELESS is a good rock thrill ride, but lacks anything original. Godsmack is simply re-hashing what they did in the first two albums, and putting it on this one. But it is still a good kick in the balls!
B000084T18|1.0|I have issues with 50 Cent and no, it's not because I love Ja Rule. The first time I heard \\"Wanksta,\\" I felt unmoved. It was just another rap song. \\"In Da Club\\" was okay the first five hundred times, and that was only because it was catchy and had a decent beat. The lyrics...mediocre. And that is how I would describe the rest of his songs: average. People rave for miles about how 50 Cent's lyrics are the \\"realest\\" and how he's one of the best out there right now. <br />Don't kid yourselves: He's not. To me, he is simply a fad. I notice a lot of 50 Cent fans are people who never listened to rap to begin with. Perhaps because he's a novelty? <br />I don't recommend this CD to real rap fans. Some of the songs on \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" may be tolerable, but I don't see the point in supporting an artist that feels the need to claim how \\"real\\" and \\"gangsta\\" he is incessantly. If you're real, you don't need to repeat it 500 times. Go pick up something else worth your time and money.
B000069HKH|5.0|I'm a Springsteen fan, so I have a bit of a biased opinion about his stuff.  I heard the album's material at his live show in Sacramento.  It was amazing.  When I bought the album the following day, I was a bit surprised to find out that the songs which were great at the show were so-so recordings.  Mary's Place is the first song that comes to my mind.  During the show, this song was the one where he stopped, introduced the band with his hell-fire southern baptist preacher impression, and gave the E Street Band their proper respect.  'The Fuse' and 'Into the Fire' also fall into this catagory.  <BR>     The fast / slow tempo of the album is also a weak point in my opinion.<BR>     Obviously the concert made this a better album album for me than it would have been if it had to stand alone.
B000050XEI|4.0|I have loved Enya for years.  I anticipated something familiar and sweet, but wondered how fresh it would be.  I wasn't disappointed, as it was like visiting an old friend who is dependable, but never boring, and who always has some way to make your time well-spent.<br />It seems many reviewers either love or hate &quot;Tempus Vernum.&quot;  Put me in the love column.  While it still sounds like her, it was also a wonderful, stirring departure.<br />By far my favorite track, however, is &quot;Deora Ar Mo Chroi.&quot;  It's so simple, yet full of melancholy.  It makes me think of the end of a long, lonely journey.  I highly recommend it.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is, well, I save that for really mind-blowing entries :-)
0802130208|5.0|It may very well be the funniest novel in American literature. One thing is for certain: it is unique. I've wracked my brains to think of a parallel to it, and the closest I can come is P. G. Wodehouse with his Bertie and Jeeves characters. But this really doesn't come that close, except for the zaniness of the characters. Ignatius Reilly stands alone. He is repulsive, yes...but not in an evil sense. His self-deluded, self absorbed worldview leads him into some of the most preposterous statements regarding the people and social conventions of his native New Orleans that you are likely ever to read. His fulminations are at once breathtaking in their verve and linguistic acrobatics, while at the same time so absurd as to pass beyond lunacy. How in the world the author came up with some of these dialogues is a wonder and you must read this book if only to experience the world according to Ignatius Reilly. There is an undertone of sadness to this work, and I can't quite figure it out. There is nothing overtly tragic or sad here, and yet somehow or other, a gray fog seeps out of the text and at the end of a particularly funny episode, you stop laughing long enough to feel the tug of poignant humanity. Where does it come from? It's hard to explain.  But reading this book was an experience well worth the effort.
B000000W4M|5.0|I bought this cd used and I was amazed. Corgan's voice sounds so very good... always. I would probably recomend this cd to anybody... no matter what genre of music they listen to. The Pumpkins look very good next to a Vivaldi cd.
0380820846|1.0|Snore.  The fun of Regency romances is their structure -- no sex, a significant economic reason why the heroine had better find a mate, a flawed hero ... not this 21st century superimposition of sexual desire (and relief), a financially independent heroine, and a perfect (athletic, handsome, tall, shapely, well-spoken, intellectual, did I mention handsome, tall, shapely?) hero.  Skip this book unless you really just want to read about another perfect initial sexual encounter nominally staged two hundred years ago.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I heard Bring Me to Life on the radio, I thought \\"a pretty good song\\". The second time, I started to get curious and wanted to know the band behind it. The more I heard the more I liked it and when I finally got to know Evanescence, I bought the CD without much hesitation. And boy, wasn't I ecstatic when I finished listening every single song and felt absolutely amazed. This is one of the few albums that I can say that \\"takes my breath away\\".<br />The use of various instruments is superb. The combination of piano and violin at the beginning of several songs is absolutely beautiful. It builds up the emotion and gives listeners a false impression of peace only to discover the power behind. Amy Lee's voice is powerful and yet ethereal. The two \\"mellower\\" songs make the whole album richer and more colorful. <br />The songs of Evanescence have a rare power that provokes people's emotions as well as imaginations. For some odd reason, the songs gave me some very strange imagery. There is a something opulent, something about life, death, desperation and  salvation about it. I am reminded of Anne Rice's vampire stories when I listened to Bring Me to Life - the desolate, white Southern mashion, the lonely vampire who will never see the light of the day, and the many stories around him. Other songs gave me the imagery of some tragic love stories, deserted gardens, ghosts.<br />If you don't like vampires, that's ok coz it's just me. I am sure people have different responses based on their life experiences. This is one of best albums so far this year!
B000002KKC|4.0|&quot;Rumours&quot; was one of the best selling albums in the history of the world, so when Fleetwood Mac went back into the studio Lindsey Buckingham evidently decided that since it was going to be pretty much impossible to do better, they could go for bigger.  The result was this 1979 double-album and I agree with those who see a basis for comparison with the Beatle's White album, not so much because of the freedom given Fleetwood Mac's trio of songwriters, but more because having twice as many tracks meant hard choices did not have to be made and &quot;Tusk&quot; could embrace all of the myriad song styles.<br />For Stevie Nicks this meant songs that were simply longer.  All five of her Welsh Witch songs are over 4-and-a-half-minutes long; there is only one other track on the album written by anybody else that long, Christine McVie's opening &quot;Over and Over.&quot;  Nicks contrasted the light and etheral &quot;Sara&quot; the eerily and thunderous &quot;Sisters of the Moon.&quot;  But mainly she slowed things down, with the poignant &quot;Beautiful Child&quot; and melancholy &quot;Storms.&quot;  None of these songs ended up being another &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; but clearly Nicks was writing songs in that mode.  These might not have been her best Fleetwood Mac songs, but they were her most ambitious.<br />Christine McVie continued to write solid soft rock songs, although &quot;Brown Eyes&quot; certainly seems more of a Nicks-type song.  &quot;Never Make Me Cry&quot; is a similar sort of sad ballad, although the explanation for this could simply be Buckingham's production values.  &quot;Think About Me&quot; and &quot;Honey Hi&quot; are fairly standard pop rock fare for McVie, who stays pretty close to home with these songs.  Buckingham also delivers more than his fair share of melancholy songs on the slow side with &quot;That's All for Everyone&quot; and &quot;Walk a Thin Line.&quot;  The result is that &quot;Tusk&quot; veers strongly towards the moody side.  The brilliant harmonies that were displayed on the previous two albums are not as prominent this time around.  After this Fleetwood Mac would try to go back and pick up where they left off with their next album, \\"Tango in the Night,\\" but only McVie was able to keep the magic going.<br />What ever else it might be the &quot;Tusk&quot; album was not more of the same, a fact exemplified by the title song.  What starts off as an apparent attempt to make Mick Fleetwood's drumming a prominent feature of a song suddenly becomes an excuse for the USC Marching Band to add a lot of brass.  &quot;Not That Funny&quot; becomes the other Buckingham song that is in a similar vein and gives more hints as to what he was thinking during this album.  This album ended up being branded a failure for Fleetwood Mac, but nothing was going to come off as well as &quot;Rumours&quot; and it was not like critics liked the new and improved Fleetwood Mac anyway.  All I know is that when I play this CD I tend to go right to the Stevie Nicks songs, including suffering through the edit of &quot;Sarah,&quot; because I think she wrote the best tracks here and it is her mood that ultimately defines the entire album.he brilliant harmonies that were displayed on the previous two albums are not as prominent this time around.

B00003CXSP|1.0|Don't waste your money on this film.  If you liked Silence of the Lambs, what Red Dragon, not Hannibal.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" took the audiences by storm when \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and \\"Two Towers\\" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale.<br />The movie picks up where \\"Fellowship\\" left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai.<br />Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve \\"the master of the Precious.\\" But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will.<br />While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for.<br />Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: \\"But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.\\" These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes.<br />But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words.<br />The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of \\"Fellowship,\\" are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film.<br />Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camerawork and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering.<br />Of course \\"Two Towers\\" isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, \\"Two Towers\\" is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure.

6303418287|4.0|Young Victor Frankenstein is obsessed with conquering death. Such a mad scheme thoroughly takes over his life to the point where he succeeds and brings forth a new life. Ah, this creation of Frankenstein's brings more harm and pain to Victor that he ultimately regrets. Thus begins this sweeping epic of science vs. God and man vs. monster. Welcome to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.<br />     Kenneth Branagh stars as the misguided doctor whose egotistical dream has him step over those he loves. Robert DeNiro superbly plays the tortured creation. His depiction of the monster's agony, isolation, tenderness and anger makes him an object of pity. The monster is believable and has our sympathy despite his grotesque condition both physically and mentally.<br />      The pace of the film and it's wonderful outdoor scenes are pleasing to both the eye and mood of the story. You are carried up into the lives of the characters as they share their emotions. One moment you are in love with Frankenstein but in the next you begin to despise this man for his selfishness and lack of taking responsibility for his creation. You have a love and horror story mixed into one which will certainly capture your attention.<br />     Of course there are some flaws. Although the screenplay stays close to the spirit of the book it does have a few deviations. Don't allow those distractions to take away from the essence and beauty of the story. Robert DeNiro is the true star of this epic. His tortured soul and thirst for revenge keeps you riveted to the screen. DeNiro then gives us a flip side of the creature. We see his emotions of love and compassion for people. Unfortunately humanity can't accept the \\"other\\". The creature is doomed to exile but not before he gets his revenge. By all means indulge yourself in viewing this sweeping film.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD not only brings their Genre to a new level, It, in a way, makes a whole new Genre. The vocals on this CD are totally outstanding. Amy can sing so immaculately that it almost disgusts me and makes me want to shun myself for my own singing. I have never heard such a good combination of musical elements since, well...a long time. The way that they transition from songs like &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Haunted,&quot; and then go to something like &quot;Bring me To Life&quot; is practically seamless. This band has proven to me, with only one CD mind you, that they can me versital yet not totally and completely changing out of their own individual unique style. I'm suprised that this bunch wasn't exposed before Daredevil.
B00006CXXU|1.0|This is an awful CD. I don't understand what people like about it. Christina has the potential to be a good artist but she makes herself into a cartoon instead. I can't stand the way she sings, she sings a few notes and then starts screaming. And I'm so tired of hearing about how abusive her childhood was, if it was so painful then she should be in therapy.
0195145925|3.0|Oddly, the most succinct and lucid statement of Barbour's theory comes, not from him, but from a reader whose email he quotes in the footnotes at the end of the book: &quot;All moments are simultaneous ... My conscious mind feeds them to me in a linear sequence strung out with a bunch of other moments in an illusion of a continuous flow of action.&quot; (p. 340, trade paperback edition) Barbour comments that this reader's views are &quot;often very close to my own position.&quot;<br />I see two problems here. First, the hypothesis seems essentially solipsistic - it's not clear if it can ever be tested, proved, or disproved. Second, how can &quot;my conscious mind feed these moments to me&quot; in a world of total stasis, a world where everything is frozen and motionless? Either consciousness itself is exempt from the timelessness of the rest of the system (but Barbour seems to think it isn't) or consciousness, being part of a timeless reality, is frozen and unable to engage in any processes - including the process of &quot;feeding&quot; moments to me. In other words, if time is an illusion created by a filmstrip of single frames being run in our heads, then what is running the movie, and how can the movie run at all when nothing can move? <br />The theory seems to raise more questions than it answers. Still, questions are always valuable, so - three stars!
B00008H2LB|3.0|I've heard the album. I was an avid fan of Hybrid Theory. But even that grew old rapidly. There were many problems with this CD. Most noticeably was that it was unbearably short. Some songs were good, others, bad. But overall it was a good album. If Linkin Park does anything good, it'd their fairly original way of intergrating rap and rock. Although it sounds a little overproduced.<BR>     Bottom line: if liked the first one, you'll like this one. If you don't like sugar-coated rock with some mediocre rap that is bound to be discovered by MTV, the stay away.<BR>     Also, maybe people should stop handing out 5-star ratings like Try AOL 8.0 discs.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Gosh it's all about him from the first movie and now this one. Don't get me wrong or anything he's great and the X-Men wouldn't be the same without him but... this isn't a weekly series and waiting for like the next 3 years just to see more of our most favorite X-men characters is just fustrating. Let's have  Rogue and Jubilee explore and develope their powers a little more shall we!?<br />Other then the little issue X2 is bigger, badder, and better than the first one!<br />LADY DEATHSTRIKE, MYSTIQUE and NIGHTCRAWLER RULED IN X2!
B00004Y2QT|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Prince's music. To see him perform in concert on this DVD makes it that much better! I was kind of hoping it would have a few more songs from the album like \\"so far so pleased\\", \\"man of war\\", and \\"silly game\\". Other than that, every song on the DVD was great, especially the Purple Rain performance! I would recommend any TRUE Prince fan to buy this DVD... Regardless of the price! (It's that good)
B00005JLXE|3.0|Enough has been said concerning the movie, we are quite familiar with male super heroes, and this one was very good. But I would agree with other reviews concerning the heroine in the picture. They had a gold mine with her as this character. The part was perfect for this actress. Very few female heroes look totally convincing as butt kickers. But this one blew me away. She really looked as though she could take on any man. It was totally refreshing to see the addition of this character to the story. I was really prepared to be blown away with the rest of the story. The romance was to quick I thought but then I thought this is not really a love story. The chemistry between the 2 was very noticable right from the beginning. Even when he was totally beaten in a fight scene with the main bad guy, the last words she said to him made you believe that she was here to stay. \\"NOT\\" she comes to his rescue in a very convincing display of martial arts and bravado and is quickly dispatched in a very abrupt untimely end. My whole adrenalin rush just took a nose dive. Why even bring her character into the picture to begin with. They literally had a gold mine with Electra. The perfect compliment to a blind super hero. She had the looks the body the costume of a great female super hero. I saw another Sigourney Weaver emerging in her character. I gave this movie a 3 only because the action and effects were top notch. The storyline had a lot to be desired. What could have been an excellent movie is now only ranked as mediochre.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I heard the first single (&quot;Bring Me To Life feat. Paul McCoy of 12 Stones) from 'Fallen', I was watching a promo for WWE No Way Out '03. At first, i kept hearing only snippets of the song until i bought the soundtrack to DAREDEVIL. After listening to that and 'My Immortal', i fell in love with the band but most of all, the voice of Amy Lee. Once I bought 'Fallen', they officially became one of my three favorite bands alongside Cold and Linkin Park. Certain songs that stand among the others on the album are as follows:<br />&quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; ~ features Paul McCoy, of another relatively new band by the name of 12 Stones, who brings his strong voice and fierce screams to fit almost perfectly together with Lee's vocals, the band's fast sound and accompanying strings and piano. The quick synopsis of the song is seeing everything clearly for the first time due to being woken up by someone or something. <br />&quot;My Immortal&quot; ~ a song, which is basically Amy Lee, strings and a piano, about losing a loved one and feeling they still have a part of you.<br />&quot;Tourniquet&quot; ~ arguably, the best song of the entire album and also deals with suicide and regaining lost religion.<br />&quot;Taking Over Me&quot; ~ after listening to this song a few times, it began to pull at something inside of me causing me to almost cry. The meaning of it is similar to that of John Mayer's 'Love Song For No One&quot; except with a darker tone, a piano and Amy Lee's &quot;beautiful-it's-alomst-scary&quot; vocals.<br />All in all, 'Fallen' is one of the best CDs ever, PERIOD.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is the finest pop music album ever recorded.
B000002GVZ|5.0|Carly Simon was one of the greatest singer/songwriters of the seventies. Her songs are literate observations on life, love, relationships and commitment, usually set to addictive melodies. Highlights here include the somewhat sad The Right Thing To Do, the enigmatic You're So Vain, one of her biggest hits and a song which fuelled much speculation as to who it was about, and the plaintive Anticipation. Haven't Got Time For The Pain and No Secrets are memorable too. Attitude Dancing is an interesting experiment and That's The Way I Always Heard It Should Be is quite a literate number, questioning convention and tradition. Simon wasn't really a folk singer like then-husband James Taylor and as an observant singer/songwriter she created innovative melodic pop. This is an excellent collection of her early hits.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This record is a great guitar-and-voice album with rare emotion from any artist, let alone from one as removed from &quot;the normal life&quot; as Madonna. It's an exquisite listen and a real accomplishment. If you wondered what Madonna would be doing in 20  years when she first writhed onto the radar, you never would have thought this---writing, singing and playing music that is vulnerable, personal and better than anything on the radio right now. Try it---you'll like it.
B000002I8H|5.0|This is a generally laid-back album of Beatles covers. It defies classification - you could not define it as jazz, pop, disco, R+B or any other, but a mixture of all of them. It was recorded in the style typical of its time (1981), when synthesisers were fashionable. Whatever else may be said about it, this is not like any other album by Sassy, so her diehard fans may not like this, but I enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />The choice of songs is interesting, as Sassy has not confined herself to the obvious songs. You never give me your money and I want you (she's so heavy) are both from Abbey Road. The two most famous songs from that album, Something and Come together, are also included here, so I guess that Abbey road was Sassy's favorite Beatles album. Hey Jude is only included as a brief instrumental, so there are really only twelve tracks here.<br /><br />I don't know who this was aimed at. Was it the eighties generation, who would like the synthesisers? Was it the sixties generation, who like the songs? Did they hope to keep Sassy's loyal fans as well as attracting different people to her music? I don't know. You must make up your own mind. I can well understand that some people might think of this as a one-star album, but as somebody with eclectic musical tastes, I have no hesitation in giving it five stars.
B0000797IO|1.0|This movie made me thinking about how needy Jennifer Aniston and others in this movie should be to participate in something like this. Worst movie I've seen for the last two or three years. Feel robbed by both time and money. Do NOT recommend to anyone.
B000002MUW|5.0|This album has some similarities with Madonna's previous album, Erotica, in that it is filled with romantic ballads. However, while Erotica was mellow, this album has a different production with an R+B backbeat supporting Madonna's breathy vocals.<br />There were four major international hits on this one, these being Secret, Human nature, Bedtime story and Take a bow. Other standout tracks include I'd rather be your lover and Don't stop, both of which have an infectious melody and must surely have been considered for release as singles. Perhaps the reason why there were only four singles from this album (lower than usual for a Madonna album) is the similarity in style of so many of the songs - but that is exactly why this album is a masterpiece. It sets a mood and maintains it throughout.<br />Anybody looking for up-tempo dance music will find plenty of it on other Madonna albums and I also enjoy those, but if you're looking for late night romantic pop music of the nineties, I don't think you'll find anything better than this.
B00006G8O1|5.0|This strange movie has become a bit of an underground sensation.  Most people haven't even heard of it but it's huge on the alternative scene.  The first time you see it, you're just going to be like, \\"Huh?\\" and you're going to want to watch it again, immediately.  It pulls you in.
B00005JLWN|3.0|I read all the underground buzz about this film being a neglected scifi film that was excellent. I remember such films as Dark City and Donnie Darko receiving the same acclaim and to that I decided why not discover another unknown film to add to my collection and spread the good news about to others. Maybe I was a bit too hyped over it, maybe I expected more gun fights, or maybe it was the all too similar aspects between this and the Matrix that leads me to say it may not be all it's hyped up to be.<br />The action IS really cool but don't expect alot of it, I did enjoy that it wasn't all karate like most action films today, it reminded me of the gun totin days of Chow Yun Fat in such films as Hard Boiled and The Killer. It certainly follows the Matrix formula. Philosophy + Action + SciFi = ??? Well I don't know what it comes out too, it certainly takes after such books as Brave New World and Farenheit 451. At times it works but with such scenes as the puppy scene you wonder if their trying too hard to make us understand what it is to FEEL. <br />The acting was decent although inconsistent. If the Cleric (and everyone else) do not know emotion. How come Tay Diggs grins through out the whole movie, I wanted to slap him and say \\"Hey your not supposed to feel emotion dummy stop smiling!\\" Last time I checked, anger, wit, and suspsicion, are all EMOTIONS. The acting is not at all consistent with the idea of having no emotion. Even the villian shows anger, which again, is an emotion. Maybe their was too much Dashboard Confessional played on the set, who knows. Those little things did bother me but if you ignore them than the few moments of genius matched with the few and far between action sequences (which are very cool) than you have a decent movie that in no way matches the wit of Donnie Darko, or the gothic atmospher of Dark City, and let's face it steals alot of it's look from every scifi movie ever made.<br />A noteworthy mention is a really great audio commentary byDirector Kurt Wimmer. He honestly and boldly confronts all the criticism he's heard about the movie and even admits to many of the mistakes he made in the film. He addresses alot of my concerns with the logic of the no emotion thing and after hearing his explanation for them they don't seem to   bother me as much (Tay diggs smiling, the villian gettin angry). It's a great commentary for would-be film makers because he focuses on his first  time directing and the techniques he used. It's one of the most earnest and humbling commentaries I've heard in awhile and it's definetly worth hearing. (Unlike most directors  who seem full of themselves)<br />It's worth watching at least once, but don't go in expecting to \\"Forget the Matrix\\" as the cover suggests. It's decent SciFi and I will enjoy it on repeat viewings despite it's flaws.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have to say I listen to the cd almost everyday and everyday its suprises me i cant get enough of amy lee's voice its beautiful and sometimes angry in her songs. its abotu time someone came out with a album thats actually worth buying and actually worth liseting to, and i have a feelign they will be around a long time, and i'm hoping there next single will be &quot;going under&quot; or &quot;My immortal&quot;
014028902X|5.0|Upon the recommendation of a good friend, I picked up this book - and was never disappointed. In fact, when I read the table of contents, listing the names of the chapters, I knew that this book was something extraordinary. It showed that the book lived up to my initial anticipation.<BR>Unlike most of the books ever written, there's not a single cloud in here to shadow the reader's mood. It's a delightful, warm, comfortable read, a mix of exceedingly beautiful landscape (I HAVE to go to Corfu, one day *sigh*) and hilarious family affairs. Add some animals and their interactions with the highly peculiar family, and that's what the book is all about. Thank God! Any attempt to insert a serious matter, or something sad, would fail because of the lightness and litheness of the narration.<BR>After reading this book, you might dream of shady olive tree orchards, of turquoise ocean, of age-old walls slumbering in the heat of noon. It's one of those books (at least for me) that made me long for being the narrator, young Gerald Durrell.

B000002I2G|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best album the Doors put out during their short career.  Morrison usually gets all of the credit, but Robby Krieger's songwriting is a highly underated, as well as the rest of the Doors musicianship.  Remember that Krieger wrote &quot;Light My Fire&quot;.
0385504209|5.0|Don't start this book late one night and expect to be able to close it up and go to sleep any time soon.It's a great book, full of fascinating historical information plus a cool plot and lots of fun codes-and-word games.<br />Silas the albino monk is one of the more interesting &quot;is he good or is he bad or is he crazy or is he simply misguided?&quot; characters I have read in quite a while.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Those  would be the words spoken onstage by Robert Plant to describe that night's concert on July 29, 1973 at Madison Square Garden. During the second drum solo during Whole Lotta Love, there was a crazy display of firestick twirling by an onstage guest clad only in a white loincloth. It ended with an Olympic size bowl-of-fire high above Bonzo's head, cymbols crashing and the audience in complete awe! Lost for 30 years, these scenes are probably NOT on this DVD and my advance purchase of this product will prove disappointing. Does anyone else remember this concert? We'll see if its on there when its released- Kevin Shirley does GREAT work with Dream Theater, but Jimmy loves to cut. This video may be lost forever. Search \\"Eddie Edwards- The Garden Tapes\\" for more details.
038572179X|4.0|This is a story of a young girl who is trying to balance a lively imagination with the innocent morality of youth with family loyalities with social prejudices of society.  The telling of Briony's actions based on her perception of reality is fascinating.  The story is frightening also, how lives can be changed forever due to actions with no ill intent. <br />The reader is left to decide if Briony has atoned for her actions.  The reader is the beholder and decides the consequences.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I've been waiting for this CD to be coming out for a while, and it was well worth it. This album is funny and exposes the truth of how Bush is illegily running our country since he didn't really win the election. Anyway, here are my ratings:<br />Seperation between Church and Skate: 10/10<BR>Whenever I think of Simple Plan, GC, NFG, blink 182, I think of this. This song is about how Punk Rock came from hard rockers to preppy posers, it's a must.<br />Irrationalty or Rationalty: 10/10<BR>THIS SONG IS MY ANTHEM!!! It says everything I'm thinking like \\"WHEN ONE MAKES 20 MILLION, 10,000 PEOPLE LOSE\\".  It really opens up your eyes.<br />Franco Un-American: 8/10<BR>A funny yet sorta poppy song.Thats really all I have to say.<br />Idiots are Taking over: 15/10<BR>A very true song, I just have to quote it<BR>\\"It's not the right time to be sober, now the idiots are taking over\\" and \\"Majority rule  don't work in mental instutions\\"<br />She's Nubs: 7/10<BR>There's not really a point to this song except a girl without arms or legs....... Nuff said<br />Mattersville: 8/10<BR>A song about a place where punks can live in peace.... Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh<br />Decom-Poser: ?/10<BR>Sorry havn't really listened to this song that much, sorry.<br />Medio-Core: 9/10<BR>Another song about poppy punk bands and how they play the same tunes and over agian. <br />Anarchy Camp: 7/10<BR>A reggie sorta song, its okay, but if you like ska, you'll probally like this song.<br />American Errorist (I Hate Hate Haters) : 6/10<BR>I just don't like it.<br />We Got Two Jealous Agains:  8/10<br />13 Stitches: 8/10<BR>I don't know where they recorded this sh!t, but it sounds like it was done in a cardboard box. I'd like it more if they recorded in a studio.<br />Re-gaining Unconciousness: 10/10<BR>IT'S GREEEEEEEAAAAAAATT<br />Whoops, I OD'd : 10/10<BR>Very sad song.
B00008PBZW|3.0|Seriously, sometimes while watching this movie I fealt like it was the Pacific war version of Saving Private Ryan.  It had its good points, don't get me wrong, but in the end the story behind this movie is over-dramatic fluff.  The idea is a good one...hell, its a great idea for a film!  The true story about how the Navajo language was used as a code against the Japanese in WWII?  I'm surprised no one had tried this before (or have they, and I'm just ignorant about it?).  Even with the good acting, and amazing battle scenes (still not as graphic as SPR, but still quite good), it falls WAY short of its intended mark.  <br />The backdrop of the story is, of course, the use of Navajo's and their language to help win WWII.  The actual story in the film, however, centers on two Marines, played by Nic Cage and Chris Slater, who are ordered to protect two Navajo code talkers (two actors who's names I didn't catch...sorry).  Thats all well and good, but it gets really kinda sappy and melodramatic, and it feels a lil too much like we're watching a Hollywood movie, and not enough like we're watching a serious war story about an important part of American history that is long overlooked.  The comparrison of this movie to Saving Private Ryan come from the fact that Cage has to do everything he can to protect the life of a younger soldier.  The main differences here are that its through the whole movie and not just the last 30 mins, as in Private Ryan, and in this story if the Navajo is caught, the protector must kill him to protect the code.  <br />Anyway, I think if you watch this movie you'll pick up on what I'm getting at.  This is a movie that had a lot of promise, but who's sappiness and over-dramatic Hollywood style of story telling almost ruined.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I'll admit, I wasn't too crazy about John Mayer when he first came on the scene, but his singles started to grow on me.  So, I downloaded this recently to give it a chance.  I must say it's wonderful!!  Sure, it's definitely not the fast paced pop music I normally listen to, but unlike Jason Mraz, most of John's songs have that &quot;hook&quot;, &quot;catch&quot;, or just &quot;that special something&quot; about them.  They have a great mellow feel without being boring, so it doesn't force you into a coma.  It made a pop fan like me take a second glance!  Definitely a must-buy!!
B0000683DH|5.0|I have always considered \\"Star Trek-The Motion Picture\\" my favorite Trek movie ever.  However, its Director's Edition DVD, in my opinion, left much to be desired in spite of the nice reshooting of the visual effects.  Now comes fan favorite -not mine -\\"Star Trek II- The Wrath Of Khan\\" in a Director's Edition DVD.<br />It may not have new effects shots, but it has interesting extended scenes that had some sort of substance, especially the relationship between Scotty (James Doohan) and Midshipman Peter Preston.  But I have to admit that I liked this movie mostly because of Ricardo Montalban's portrayal of Khan, and his conflict with Kirk (William Shatner, in one of his really good performances -KHAAAAAN!!! KHAAAAAN!!! notwithstanding); in fact I recite 98% of Khan's lines by heart.  Nicholas Meyer really did inject juice to this revenge story with an unexpecting ending.<br />I would have loved to see new FX shots, but this special edition -which I rate five stars -happens to be slightly better than the DVD of the first movie, in spite of the fact that I prefer the first movie to \\"Wrath Of Khan\\", despite the popularity it has garnered over the years.
6305428298|5.0|Aussies who have seen Malcolm, the story of the socially inept inventor, will find strong similarities with the LV character in this film, and the background music is also similar and used in a similar way. It brought back happy memories of cars dividing in two, and boys who talk non-stop to their girlfriends about boring technical stuff.<br />But the highlight of the film is the terrific vocal impersonations of great singers by Jane Horrocks.<br />I thought the plot was well thought out and ended in a most satisfying way. A great DVD to watch several times, I think.<br />If, like me, you are one of those people who think that characters can be shown to be rough without them having to be given copious amounts of gutter language to use, then be warned there is a lot of this stuff in the film, but other than that, it is terrific.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JKJA|4.0|First of all, I admire this movie for having a subtle yet intelligently and creatively done plot.  This is a one-of-a-kind movie to see and I would like to recommend this to people who gains pleasure in viewing such weird movies.  Don't wonder if after viewing the film for the first time, you'll be in awe and say, &quot;What's this movie I've just seen?&quot;  I think that's what everyone have in mind after viewing the movie for the first time.  <br />     Thanks to one reviewer below I was able to fully comprehend what David Lynch was trying to detail in this movie.  Just then I realized how fantastic and delusional must be having a mind like David Lynch.  I've seen the movie twice now and my second reaction is that viewers may get tired looking for clues for 2 1/2 hours.  The only lapse in this movie is that it is too long and sometimes too tiring.  If only some scenes were deleted or shortened, this piece could be a masterpiece to play with.
B00008WG3U|3.0|This cd is very polished compaired to nofx's other releaces and doesnt sound as punk as other recordings. i thaught this effort would stand out more. what is next for nofx mtv. they are changing their music like afi did to make the $$$ with their last album.
B000068PQ7|3.0|I tend to agree more with the reviewer below who gave this album two stars rather than those who gave it five. There is a tendency with artists who have been unfairly neglected in their own time to somewhat over-compensate and talk their work up TOO much. This has certainly happened with Nick Drake, who was a fine artist but not really as great as his CURRENT reputation would have you believe. I bow to no-one in my appreciation of Gene Clark as a songwriter and a singer but this is not a classic album and it is not his best work.<br />It does contain some beautiful music: &quot;With Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;For a Spanish Guitar&quot; are as good anything he ever wrote. &quot;Because of You&quot;, &quot;The Virgin&quot; and &quot;1975&quot; are all excellent songs but... The album has a sparse, under-produced feel which doesn't really do these songs justice (yet, perversely, &quot;With Tomorrow&quot; is just vocal and guitar and works beautifully).<br />Gene Clark tended to write songs within a brilliant but rather narrow range (like Nick Drake again), which means you have to be careful, over the course of an album, to avoid monotony - I don't think this album quite manages it. The sleevenotes mention that Dylan, at this time, was interested in Clark's work - I can only guess that this is due to imitation being the sincerest form of flattery as this is far and away the most Dylanesque album of Clark's career, right down to the wheezy harmonica playing which crops up far too often. As if to drive the point home there is a version of &quot;Tears of Rage&quot; which hardly deviates from The Band's version, right down to the drum rolls.<br />All in all, this is an OK album, in an acoustic Neil Young/ Dylan way but not amongst Gene's best works. The bonus tracks are fairly uninteresting to boot.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This truly is the Best Album of the Year. Norah Jones has landed a sucker punch right in the face of conventional pop music. This is the best alubm to come along since Josh Groban's self-titled debut. It has been a top ten seller, most of the time number 1, here on amazon.com, and deservedly so.<br />1. Don't Know Why is one of the most infectious songs I've ever heard. The music is gentle but it's so a great song. And best of all it introduces Norah's sultry voice, almost like a drug, but not addicting in the bad way.<BR>2. Seven Years is one of my favorite songs. It's country blue grass fused with jazz, like the whole album. It's another showcase of Norah's voice, which every song is, in a different way every time. This, like every song, deserves the accolades for all of the great songs she gets to sing.<BR>3. Cold Cold Heart is a great cover. It's Hank Williams best known song given a complete overhaul. Not like it needed one, but it's very bluesy; she can do it all! I love the stand up bass in the beginning.<BR>4. Feelin' The Same Way is another one of my favorites. It's one of the speediest songs on the album, but the brushes on the snares give it the jazzy sound. The words are beautiful.<BR>5. Come Away With Me is my favorite song on the whole album. It sounds so much like a beautiful lullaby. It's gentle but it says so much. Norah has written a wonderful song. This is such a deep song, one of the best love songs ever. The piano is airy, her voice is breezy and it's just perfect. This could've easily beaten Don't Know Why for record of the year if nominated.<BR>6. Shoot The Moon gets us back to the bluegrassy sound. Once again, the brushes on the snares give it that infectious beat you just can't forget. I love the gentle whisp in her voice.<BR>7. Turn Me On is hard core bluesy. And man does she do it well. This has some of the funnest lyrics on the whole album. It's a great testiment to love.<BR>8. Lonestar could be played at the Grand Ole Oprey and fit rightin. It's got that great walking, one-two beat. And the stand up bass reprises its role.<BR>9. I've Got To See You Again sounds like a tango to me. I love the drawling violin. This is a very sensual, seductive song. It has a great hypnotic beat. The layered vocals are absolutely delicious. <BR>10. Painter Song is as fun as Turn Me On. It's a great quasi story song, like Don McClean's Vincent (Starry, Starry Night), covered wonderfully by Josh Groban. The brush stroke sound effect is awesome. The accordion is great, gives the song a very Paris bistro kind of atmosphere. And did i mention she has an amazing voice!?! It's just too bad this song has to be so short.<BR>11. One Flight Down, and by song 11 on a 14 song album, you'd expect it to start losing some steam, but that is definitely not the case. There are so many songs where voice and words fit perfectly and this is one of them. She's got great range and damn near perfect pitch. It's another one of those songs that you hate to be so short.<BR>12. Nightingale is quite possibly the best song on the album. The piano is the best, the gutiar is the best, the brushes onthe snares, ooh, how I love them so, and the lyrics are the best. I think I shall say this is the best song on the album. It's got a great guitar solo, soft but it'll make you air-guitar along every time. <BR>13. The Long Day Is Over has so few words to it, but it's such a beautiful song. The echoing guitar is gorgeous. By this point in the album, I want to start it over again already. And once again, like so many great Beatles tunes, this one is so short. It seems that all the great ones are. This could be an award winning poems, it really could. Probably the simplest, but best lyrics of any song on the album.<BR>14. The Nearness Of You is another great cover. Hoagy Carmichael would be nothing but proud. Norah's voice and a piano. There is a God and he gave us a rwal treasure in Norah Jones. This is as simple as a song can get, but how can it be so good??? It's absolutely amazing and just bleeds passion. <br />Norah Jones is amazing. She's beautiful and her voice is just as gorgeous. This truly is album of the year if any album has ever been deemed worthy of such an honor. Norah Jones is just like Josh Groban, an absolutely wonderful break from the monotonous pop and neo-punk \\"revolution\\" garbage we are bombarded with every day. It's impossible to escape from the ad nauseum \\"saviors\\" of rock that spring up like weeds. Good Charlotte, Blink-182 and all those other meaningless names for no talent bands of noise makers. The White Sripes, Coldplay, The Hives, The Vines, have nothing caompared to Norah Jones. She has more musical talent in one of her toenails than all of the bands in their whole bodies put together. It's cliche, but it's the truth. We need more Norah Joneses and a lot less Ramones rip-offs.<br />There is a great mistake going around.  Just like everyone thinks Josh Groban's debut is classical, everyone thinks this is jazz, well, you're all wrong.  THIS IS NOT A JAZZ ALBUM.  She has created the jazz/bluegrass/blues?country/pop genre all herself.  This is not Ella or Nina, nor is she Linda Eder or Cher.  She is Norah Jones.  If it puts you to sleep, then good, you won't be an insomniac for the rest of your life.  If it bores you, then good, you have a chance to go find your real musical taste.  Any way you look at it, this is a great album.  It has done great things and will continue to do more.  I give Norah Jones' debut, Come Away With Me, the highest recommendation I could possibly give and I'm standing on a 60 foot ladder. It's amazing!
B00005JKPF|4.0|If you're a big fan of the 2000 sci-fi fantasy \\"X-Men,\\" you're sure to love the sequel, \\"X2: X-Men United,\\" because it's another big fix of all the elements that made the original such a blockbuster, done with similar imagination, high-tech style and old-fashioned filmmaking elegance.<br /> <BR>If, however, you're a more casual fan of that film, you may have some trouble with part 2 because it assumes that you saw part 1 yesterday, and it makes no particular effort to recap what happened before or thoroughly reiterated you with its numerous characters and conventions.<BR> <BR>Three years is plenty of time to forget the complex details of \\"X-Men,\\" and I found myself struggling through much of the first half trying to figure out which mutant has what superpower, what a Cerebro is, what Magneto was doing locked up in that cell.<BR> <BR>The movie opens with its best sequence: a genuinely spectacular assassination attempt on the U.S. president in the White House by a new character named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) ..., moves like a monkey and is covered with strange symbolic tattoos.<BR> <BR>It quickly turns out that a fanatical mutant-hater has manipulated the attack, named William Stryder (Brian Cox) who is trying to provoke the U.S. government into not just social control of its mutant population, but total war on them and, ultimately, extinction. ...<BR> <BR>\\"X2: X-Men United\\", happens to be low on the \\"story-line\\" side. The screenplay is plain and clean, and it seems that X2 is more interested with beating ... villains as opposed to actually building up a sensible story.<br />Before I go on about how much I enjoyed this film, I would like to include the new X-Men introduced in X2. Some of them include: Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), the teleporter who attacked the White House; Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), who can cool your drink and lots of other things; Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who can hurl flames but needs a pilot light, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can take on aspects ofthe personalities around her. And let's not forget our old, but familiar heroes: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who has blades that extend from his knuckles; Storm (Halle Berry), who can control the weather; Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), whose power of telekinesis is growing stronger; Cyclops (James Marsden), whose eyes shoot laser beams; and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).<BR> <BR>Still, on a certain level, this film was very enjoyable. I found that the special effects have improved from the 1st X- Men and that the characters seem to be more comfortable in their roles.  As much as I'd like to hail everything about X2: X- Men United, I MUST stress the fact once again to all of the writers, to make a great movie, which this film sadly wasn't but still was worth watching, you need to have a good script! But you have to think to yourself after you watch X2: Does it make you want to see a sequel to the sequel? I say bring on \\"X3.\\"
B00005YW4H|3.0|These days in mainstream culture, I've gotten so used to singers and records getting unworthy overhype. I've also gotten used to singers with truly exceptional talents get walked over. I've also gotten used to, and accepted the fact that all the good stuff was a few decades before my time.Not that there isn't any good music these days, but I sure ain't been seeing any more Nina Simone(s), or Aretha(s) come along, which is saying that all the best is nestled in the past.What exists these days is just the rest.So, I can't say I was exactly dissapointed, upon taking a whole listen through this album.I don't believe in the grammys anymore, and I expected what I heard from Norah's hit \\"Don't Know Why\\".Something sweet,calm,safe, and no exactly jazz(more like soft pop with some western twang, and a touch of jazz).That is exactly what I got.This album offers nothing new, or special.And neither does Norah Jones.Norah has a sweet,if slightly thin voice, but I've heard many sweet voices, and I gotta say I've heard sweeter ones. The main problem is that Norah's frail voice, and lack of experience does not have what it takes to sing jazz.In  jazz,or blues, what you need above all is experience.You need to understand each and every single word you're pronouncing.You need to feel the music, you need to know the music, the music needs to broil within the very depths of your soul.Get it???Norah Jones does not have the ability to do that.And never will.Then again, you say well, \\"she's only 22, give her time\\".Then again, I say, Nina Simone was also only 22 when she sang I Love You Porgy.That should shut people up.Not that there should be any comparison between Nina and Norah, and you need compare nobody to Nina, or other greats, especially Norah, but what I'm saying is that, just like a joke is either funny, or it's not, well, you either feel the music, or you don't, and just like no amount of time will make an unfunny joke funny, no amount of time will the give the singer soul.The most Norah can hope for is to improve her range a tad. I also hate how Norah pronounces her words, as though she were some sexy,smoky jazz singer.Always putting special emphasis on the A's.It's incredibly annoying, and makes her otherwise pleasant voice annoying.You know someone who tries to sing with soul, but doesn't have it??That's Norah for you.As for the music, I can't exactly all it real jazz.It's more like lounge-y type music, with jazzy undertones.Or soft pop.Whatever.It's painfully bland arrangements don't help the otherwise pretty songs. Her pronounciation takes away from the Painter Song, and Turn Me On.Turn Me On starts out with promise, but falls flat in the end, as it lacks depth, and has Norah reaching for places where her voice can't go.The material is pretty, but forgettable.Nothing that has me thinking about it twice.One listen through this album is enoughto assure me that this girl is nothing to go nuts about.Heck, she's not even anything to look out for.I predict that within 2 years this girl will fade into obscurity.I'll let you search for some truly great music on your own.
B000002ITW|5.0|I have been listening to this album since it first day of release on vinyl.  There are about 10 albums in my collection that I listen to, and never ever tire of.  Deja Vu, CSN, Get Your Ya Ya's Out, Santana, The White Album, Marry Me Jane (The 1st album), Matchbox 20, etc. etc.... however, 4 way street ONE OF THE BEST from a perspective of each and every member of CSNY demonstrating that they can take songs out and jam &quot;70's&quot; style, and not miss a beat.  This is a mood setting piece of work, and despite everyone's view on Stephen Stills, conflict within the band, etc., etc., etc., I feel that the band cuts through dimensions that nobody can ever top with this album which is live, live, and livliest (except for equaling the Beatles White Album which is studio).  Anyone giving this less than a 5 star is questioning what I believe will be added to the &quot;Mozart/Chopin&quot; vault of the 2200's and beyond.  BUY THIS ALBUM, and you will be equally impressed I am sure!<BR>Regards to All,<br />Joe_Slo from NJ
B000002JSN|5.0|If you asked any true Zeppelin fan which album they liked the best, they would probably answer with this album. This double disc album was recorded at their peak and probably the last great LZ release(In Through the Outdoor was their last studio record and it was good not great). The first disc alone is worth the price for it contains some of the finest material ever recorded like Kashmir, Custard Pie, In My Time of Dying and The Rover. The second disc lacks compared to the first, but its still classic Zeppelin and this album would not be complete without it. Highly recommended.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth is a band that defies neat categorisations. Yes, Mikael ?...kerfeldt has one of the best death metal voices around, but Opeth isn't really death metal. Similarly, Opeth employs lots of intricate arrangements and unexpected breaks, but they are not really prog. And even though the guitars are frequently set to full distortion, they also have lots of very un-metallic moments. However, no matter how one would like to musically categorise \\"Blackwater Park\\", it is still so good it is almost ridiculous; indeed, it is arguably Opeth's best album.     The opener, \\"The leper affinity\\" is a 10+ minute whiplash-inducing moshfest with enormous power and drive, as well as the obligatory creepy lyrics. Album highlight \\"Bleak\\" has the best riff since Slayer's \\"South of Heaven\\" and also serves as a production and arrangement showcase - the middle section features producer Steven Wilson harmonising beautifully with ?...kerfeldt, before his return to full blood-in-the-lungs roaring. \\"Harvest\\" is a beautiful, sweet little acoustic ballad, while \\"The drapery falls\\" ventures back into the territory only Opeth seems able to explore convincingly - the mid-paced semi-acoustic song that gets punctuated by full-blast guitars and vicious snarling. It is, and will remain, an ber-classic. \\"Dirge for November\\" is possibly the album's weakest song, but is still an excellent, slow-paced atmospheric number. \\"The funeral portrait\\" is another highlight, with a Black Sabbath-esque, almost poppy feel to it; while it is a stand-alone great song, it also servees to break up the brooding mood of the album. A quick, clever little instrumental piece (\\"Patterns in the ivy\\") then sets the stage for the apocalyptic closer, \\"Blackwater Park\\" itself. Combining almost impossibly intricate arrangements with visceral intensity and immense power, it is a mega-classic in its own right.     \\"Blacwater Park\\" represents someting of a pinnacle of musical achievement (big words, but fully warranted). It is as ragingly mosh-friendly as \\"My arms, your hearse\\", as cool and sophisticated as \\"Morningrise\\" and \\"Stil life\\" and as punishingly heavy as \\"Deliverance\\" - not to mention beautifully produced and performed; even the cover art is great. Head and shoulders above anything released the last ten years, and on my shortlist of best albums ever.
B00006F7S4|5.0|The lyrics, the tone and the pace of the music consistently express sadness, disappointment and disillusion.  I'm amazed that someone experiencing the sentiments conveyed in this music was able to create and perform it.  I wouldn't have been surprised if the artist had responded by staying at home for a year or two, but instead he expressed them so perfectly capturing the mood that this strikes me as a demonstration of true genius.  I'm not a huge Beck fan, but I appreciate the way he's sort of removed himself from center stage and let the music speak for itself.
B00008OLYN|4.0|Intermittently the entertainment industry shows its true face of repulsive, soulless corporate greed (I'm thinking Rod Stewart,  nu-metal, Aaron Carter), making me want to choke them all to death. And then something like \\"Damnation\\" comes out, reaffirming my faith in the culture peddlers. An album that can certainly not have been made with any commercial intent whatsoever, it is a thriumph of content over form on a scale that one rarely sees anymore.<br />Still, it gets only four stars, but this is mostly due to personal taste and the awesomely high standards that Opeth's previous albums have set. Of course, the production, again courtesy of Steven Wilson, is absolutely fabulous, crystal clear and drenched in atmosphere. Equally unsurprising, the lyrics are superb, the arrangements clever and the songs unconventional. However, I prefer the Opeth of \\"Bleak\\", \\"Deliverance\\" and \\"April ethereal\\" with fully distorted guitars, driving percussion and Åkerfeldt varying between his patented death rattle and sweetly melodious singing. Still, \\"Damnation\\" does have highlights of its own. \\"Closure\\" is probably my favorite and is the \\"most\\" Opeth-esque song; it sounds like a \\"Blackwater Park\\" session outtake. Fantastic track. Other showstoppers include \\"Death whispered a lullaby\\" and \\"To rid the disease\\", with the strange little instrumental interlude of \\"Ending credits\\" being another high point. However, unlike other Opeth albums, this one actually had an outright bad song in closer \\"Weakness\\". I guess there's a first time for everything...<br />In a way, Opeth has fallen prey to their own standards. Most bands would have killed to make an album this good, but by Opeth standards it is merely middling. It is still very good; quality metal you can play for your Grandma. Five easy stars for any other band. But not for Opeth. They can do better.
078322804X|5.0|Absolutely great movie! Wonderful story line, Killer sound track, a band with actual musicians with talent to burn, cameos by some of the greatest ever to grace a stage, and a 100 car wrecks to boot. What more could you want?<BR>It is everything that Blues Brtothers 2000 wasn't. Avoid the sequel, stick with the original.
B000001DYA|4.0|Blue Cheer erupted on the radio in 1968 with \\"Summertime Blues\\" and I was immediately drawn to the over-the-top guitar riffs and psychedelic mangling of the old Eddie Cochran standard. It perfectly matched my extracurricular activities as \\"sound candy\\" par excellence. I bought (or possibly stole) the album and was immediately blown away, literally and figuratively, with a first-of-its-kind mushroom of a sonic nuclear explosion.<br /><br />That same year my girlfiriend and I panhandled our way into a Blue Cheer concert at the Sacramento State University's men's gym. I have been to many, many concerts over the years but I have NEVER heard anything as loud as Blue Cheer was that night; in a venue as small as the men's gym the Wall O' Marshalls were gigantourous. They were every bit as great as the album only better and louder.<br /><br />This group was the granddaddy of metal bands and this album was a breakthrough.
6301208773|5.0|Die Hard defines action.  It has everything that every action fan desires, such as explosions in an elevator shaft of the Nacatomi Plaza, where the story mainly takes place.  From the first moments of when John McClane enters Nocatomi Plaza at sunset, the journey begins.  And, a fast one, too. <br />The terrorist group controlled by Hans Gruber, where they wanted the big bucks saved down in the vault of the plaza, decide to retrieve it, but they can't get the code, so they have to unlock the vault maunally -- this makes the plot so much more intersting.  Hans has that certain accent or personality that really makes this movie so much more intriguing.  <br />Now, John McClane must fight off those terrorists, then Hans, and make sure that he can save as many hostages as he can, but first, he wants to see his wife and his family, primarily.  But can he do just that? <br />To do just that, it takes bravery.  This movie shows extreme examples of great fighting scenes between John and the terrorists, including some solo action from Sgt. Al Powell and his cop car...with the backup police in the rush with sirens blaring.  This movie makes a perfect example of what it's like to be surrounded by hostility, in a 40 story building.  <br />Great use of music too.  I was really impressed by the adrenaline-pumping music-orchestra type format for various scenes.   <br />Like I said, this movie defines action.  It has all the aspects of heart-pumping action, e.g., c-4 exploding in an elevator shaft, strategies made by John McClane and Hans at the same time, and the sheer amount of chaotic scenes makes this movie one heck of a great journey!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I love Madonna, and I love this record.  Okay...so it's not Madonna most commerical record (and you think &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is?), but that is why I love it.  I think it is about time Madonna just rocked out the way she wants to, and I am right there with her.  I can't tell you how much I love &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, and I won't even start on how much I live for &quot;Intervention&quot;, and you better cool me down cause &quot;American Life&quot; is fierce like a lion.  The one clunker (cause you know there's bound to be one in every group) is &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot;...you said it Madonna, not me.  But I digress, cause this album really is something amazing.  The mesh of guitars and the elements of techno astound me to no end.  When I hear her voice on &quot;X-static Process&quot;, I just melt into a juicy pile.  &quot;Music&quot;...what's that?  Madonna has always been about experimenting, and this time I think she got it down just right.
0440237688|5.0|When I began The Giver there was a sense of longing.  A world where there is no crime, hate, or fear sounds perfect.  It describes utopia, 'a place of ideal perfection especially in laws, government, and social conditions'.  It is very similar to Sir Thomas More's book Utopia. And like Utopia, there are many contradictions in this world.<BR>The community's purpose is to create uniformity throughout the society.  This is seen in the indistinguishable clothing that is worn, the elimination of material possessions, and the identical family units consisting of a male and female parent and a son and daughter.   <BR> \\"Almost every citizen in the community had dark eyes.  But there were a few exceptions.  Jonas himself, and a female Five who he had noticed the different, lighter eyes.  No one mentioned such things; it was not a rule, but was considered rude to call attention to things that were unsettling or different about individuals.\\"(p. Lowry 20)   <BR>Using the word individual in this quote contradicts the message it is trying to convey because the goal of this community is to eradicate any form of uniqueness.  <BR>In a Utopian society everybody's work is considered equal and important.  Yet the book includes undertones, which uncovers hierarchy within jobs.  When Lily confesses her desire to 'get assigned to be a birthmother' she is immediately chastised and is told \\"There's very little honor in that Assignment.\\"(Lowry. p21)  This alone shows the societies unfavorable stance towards life when a job that is directly related to the giving of life is thought of as inferior.<BR>Overall Lowry's Utopian society exemplifies a lack of trust in human nature. Decisions are left up to 'The Elders' therefore eliminating any free will.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|More than a perfect performance, more than a perfect movie,more than a perfect quality all thanks to the DVD. I don't need to say what's this movie is about, or how good it is I just have that dire need to remind you that it is a must have movie.<BR>It is absolutely entertaining and I consider it as 'my motivational guru' as it always cheers me up everytime I watch it.<BR>I was caught watching this movie the other day by my cousin and I was told &quot;It's a childrens movie&quot; - my reply was &quot;I don't<BR>care...it's good and it makes me feel like one of them&quot;.

B000002NJS|4.0|In 1998, the pop queen Madonna was basking in the &quot;ray&quot; of spiritual &quot;light&quot;. Before that, few critics regarded her as true artist. Her music was presented as too light, too simple for intellectual listeners. And then the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; suddenly shone.<br />No, Madonna's music did not got any better with this release than it was before; it always had its considerable quality. But <BR>especially significant about &quot;Ray of Light&quot; was that its sound was very modern, cooked mostly by the British electronica genius William Orbit, and that its message was deeper, even tapping deep into eastern philosophies. That Madonna really did not become a spiritual person when making this album could be seen from her later releases, when she is back in worldly and secular affairs. Nevertheless, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; served its purpose brilliantly; showed the singer in a completely new &quot;light&quot; and, among other things, earned her four Grammies -- something that Madonna never before came close to.<br />The music? Simply, the singles are the best of the album, as is always the case with her. &quot;Frozen&quot; is one of her most beautiful songs ever. &quot;Ray of Light&quot; stands among her best and most original compositions, &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot; perhaps best represents the spirit of this album as a whole, with its wonderfully swaying melody.<br />Other highlights include the Orbit-esque opener &quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot;, pounding &quot;Skin&quot; and lyrically nonsensical yet powerfully alternative-clad &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot;.<br />Not really helpful to make this album better are very ordinary &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; and &quot;Skin&quot;, while &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; is utterly superfluous. The end of the album gets a bit out of this world musically and does not fit Madonna very much, although containing numerous autobiographical hints (&quot;To Have and Not to Hold&quot;, &quot;Little Star&quot;, &quot;Mer Girl&quot;).<br />Despite its flaws, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; ends positively on the sunny side and is a powerful testimony to Madonna's ability to keep up with state-of-the-art trends and directions without sacrificing what fans like most about her -- her highly listenable music.
6304698798|5.0|Before Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone began to collaborate in the mid 1960s with A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, the western epic had been pretty much running true to form for more than fifty years.  The lone cowboy rides into town to chase out the outlaws and saves the populace.  These movies, usually starring John Wayne and his clones, were fixedly predictable in their portrayal of the laconic hero.  Except for Gabby Hays, humor and style were too often lacking.  In the first two of Leone's homage to the sprawling western, he tried to break out of this tried and true mold.  Eastwood star charisma allowed Leone to fashion a new prototype, but it was not until Leone added Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach to the mix that he found exactly the right note of violence, humor, music, and camera angles, all of which still mesh as perfectly today as they did back in 1967.  <br />The plot has been borrowed from dozens of oaters.  A trio of gunslingers seeks to recover a hidden cache of gold with only one emerging triumphant.  What sets TGATBATU apart from its predecessors is a sense that despite the crushing reality of the harsh Civil War days, there is a leavening humor that keeps it from being squashed flat by the violence of both sight and sound that assault the senses in nearly every other scene.  Eastwood plays straight man to Wallach's Lou Costello, feeding him lines that are truly funny.  Their continuous interaction that bounces back and forth from mutual self interest to several aborted instances of near murder keep the emotional focus of the film on track. Eastwood's face is frozen into a featureless frown, while Wallach's radiates a goofy grin even as both dispatch legions of inept cowboys with gunshots that reverberate as loudly as thunder blasts.  Lee Van Cleef is the 'Bad' one of the title, and he is bad indeed.  Eastwood kills to stay alive while Wallach does so with a flair that Jack Nicholson would later emulate in THE SHINING.  But Van Cleefmanages to infuse his killing with a viciousness that well suggests his rat-faced persona.  <br />During the course of the movie, all three work variously, singly, in twos, and in threes, but the thrust of their interaction leads inexorably to the triangular showdown that in its blending of sight, sound, and action, has never been equalled.  This is a long movie, as any epic should be, but it never drags.  From the opening scene where Van Cleef blasts a family apart to the closing delicate balancing act of Wallach on a grave cross, the audience is carried along and finds itself teetering with Wallach in sympathetic rhythm.  The fact that the audience can overlook the obvious Italian flavor of cast and crew is a memorial to the seamless melding that Sergio Leone has established as the pinnacle of the western epic.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Jack Johnson is an instantly likeable guy. i mean, seroiusly. his first album, brushfire fairytales, is by far one of the best albums released in a long time. his laid back style, his smooth lyrics, and oh that guitar. Jack Johnson is the real deal.<BR>On &quot;On and on&quot;, He hardly changes a thing, And that is to our benefit. The sound is even more laid back (nothing nearly as catchy as 'flake'), but just as good. It's a nice, lazy record that, while not as good as brushfire, still holds it's own, quite formidably. it usually takes me a while to warm up to albums i like; but this one is instantly wonderful. <BR>The Real notable difference, is that johnson's conscience shines through much clearer on this outing. He tackles a more social arena. &quot;Look at all those fancy clothes; but these can keep us warm, just like those. and what about your soul- is it straight from the mold, waiting to be sold?&quot; he questions on &quot;gone&quot;, one of the many standouts on this collection.<BR>my reccomendation: Throw this on, sit back, and just get immersed in the sound.
B00005JLRT|1.0|I waited in anticipation for this movie because to date, I have loved the Next Generation movies.  I was really disappointed.  The characters were not themselves . . . not even close in some cases.  PLEASE rent the video/DVD before buying it to make sure it is what you want to spend your money on.
B00008N6N5|5.0|\\"The People vs. Larry Flynt\\" has long languished in a no-frill, barebone widescreen edition.  Now Columbia has finally released a Special Edition that includes bonus material that fans of the film can appreciate: two full-length commentary tracks (both free of the excessive \\"back-patting\\" that other commentary tracks devolve into), a pair of interesting deleted scenes (though they are very brief, they include commentary), and some other bells and whistles.<br />The featurettes deserve a special kudos as they're actually quite good, not the normal fluff studios usually put in DVDs.  Both were produced in 2003 for the Special Edition and allow the interviewees to reflect on the entire production and theatrical life of the movie and the backlash it recieved from the Left.  The interviewees include Foreman, Flynt, Harrelson, the producers, screenwriters, and as a commendable surprise, Rev. Jerry Falwell himself.  The featurette on Larry Flynt's life (narrated by Dennis Hopper) gives a brief synopsis of Flynt's entire life -filling in areas that the movie did not cover (like his service in the Army and Navy) and putting the events of the movie in actual chronological order -making it interesting to compare to how the movie interprets the truth.<br />As for the movie itself, I would recommend that you rent a movie before buying a more expensive \\"special edition.\\"  I personally enjoyed it a lot when it was theaters.  Milos Forman's style is very visual, and he's able to keep his subject at enough distance to allow the audience to make up their own minds about him.  Harrelson's performance is top notch (he recieved an Oscar nomination) and the rest of the cast definitely fits the bill.  It stands alongside Forman's Amadeus and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Just be forewarned, it is quite graphic -so if sexual situations bother you, it may not be something you'll enjoy.<br />As a final note, the DVD is actually contained within a jacket (the stripes you can see in the picture), when you pull the DVD case from the jacket you get to see the original \\"People vs. Larry Flynt\\" film poster that wasn't released due to it's parody of religion, sex, and patriotism -a good synopsis of the film indeed.
0440539811|5.0|Many seem to complain that this book is a waste of time and often times their complaints seem to stem from this books lack of cohesiveness. Pity be to the people who have been so taken by modern, popular, best-selling authors, such that they are unable to appreciate literature because they have to think when they read it. If cohesiveness measures a books quality it makes one wonders why books such as Faulkner's THE SOUND AND THE FURY and Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE are such great works... of course cohesiveness doesn't measure a books quality, nor should it. Indeed, at times, cohesiveness is simply boring. The Illuminatus Trilogy is one of those books that boggles a person's mind that another human was able to write this, and you'll feel smarter after about the third time you read it and finally understand what is going on.
0385504209|1.0|I finished the book hoping for a redeeming conclusion.  It never came.  Wild and controversial data concerning Christ, Da Vinci and anything sacred is peppered haphazardly throughout the book (a bibliography would be nice for verification of claims).  Fellow believers, be warned... as a Christian woman, it was an offensive and painful read.  I will be praying for you, Dan Brown.
6303201954|4.0|Science fiction fans, as well as film historians, are aware that director Robert Wise had traveled similar interstellar waters with the classic &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. The 1951 film appears on many &quot;best of&quot; lists and coined an alien catch phrase that is forever embedded in popular culture (&quot;Klaatu Barada Nikto&quot;).<br />Some thirty-eight years later, at the helm of Star Trek's first theatrical adventure, the director presented a movie with close ties to the landmark &quot;Day&quot;.<br />Both films feature highly intelligent aliens seeking to better understand the human existence (&quot;Klaatu&quot; and &quot;Mr. Spock&quot;, respectively). Both feature then-state-of-the art special effects. Both have award-winning scores from legendary film composers (Bernard Herrmann from the former and Jerry Goldsmith on the latter). Persis Khambatta and, to a certain extent, Patricia Neal from &quot;Day&quot; are the female &quot;love&quot; interests that provide some stimulation for male characters in the film (Stephen Collins in &quot;ST: TMP&quot; and Michael Rennie/Hugh Marlowe in &quot;Day&quot;).<br />There is little action in both films, though it works to the earlier film's advantage; the protracted &quot;flyovers&quot; in &quot;ST: TMP&quot; - though beautiful to look at - slow the plot significantly.<br />Finally, the two films end on a positive note as to the future of humanity if it follows the warnings given by seemingly omnipotent aliens that could snuff us out in a heartbeat.<br />When looked at from this comparative angle, &quot;Star Trek: the Motion Picture&quot; isn't that bad a flick. It is not the standard by which intelligent sci-fi is measured, as is &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, but it is still a commendable achievement.
1565845072|4.0|A young girl stands in a field and threatens to immolate herself. She can't be talked out of it, and so she dies. Now follows a series of murders, linked by the common touch of the victim being scalped. The reader knows the murderer, and now waits for Inspector Kurt Wallander to catch up. <br />A nice mystery, but not very profound. But, again, Mankell takes this opportunity to lambaste the Swedish society for corruption, trading in human beings, and the disintegration of the social network..<br />Otherwise - an easy and intelligent read.
B00005QIPH|4.0|When this album first came out I was (like many people, I suspect) turned off by the volume of hype surrounding it, and as such, I ignored it.  My mistake, as \\"Is This It\\" by the Strokes is a simply fantastic album that is both original and in the finest traditions of rock and roll while somehow detracting from neither.    As far as the latter comment goes, the songs on this album are all brief and driving, hearkening back to the early days of the rock.  Moreover, they sing of classic themes, love, relationships, alienation...there aren't any seven minute political rants on this album.    That might lead one to expect that all the songs sound more or less the same (a complaint I have heard from some who have only listened to the album in passing), but in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.  Or perhaps more accurately, they sound the same in the same way that all good albums follow through on a theme.  For example, no one rips Pink Floyd because \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" has common thematic elements, so it strikes me as absurd to do so in this case simply because this is a new band.  The Strokes' pulsating guitar and driving drum beats are a joy to listen to, but each song compliments the one following without be completely derivative.  Yes, the lead singer's use of distorted vocals does take some getting used to, but after a while, you don't even notice, and the effect fits nicely within the music.    Specifically, three songs that really jumped out at me were \\"Barely Legal\\", \\"Someday\\" and \\"Hard to Explain\\".  The latter two will be familiar to listeners from their heavy radio rotation, but are no less excellent for that.  With \\"Someday\\" there is and absolutely brilliant drumbeat that drives the song: WARNING, this is one of those songs that makes you want to push the gas pedal through the floor!  \\"Hard to Explain\\" mixes what I assume is a drum machine with driving guitars that somehow never gets old.  Finally \\"Barely Legal\\" features a chorus that completelyshifts the style and pacing of the music and makes for a great tune.    Ultimately, if you're looking for hard driving pop/rock, this is an album you'll definitely want to check out.  While it perhaps does completely live up to the ridiculous expectations that surrounded it, \\"Is This It\\" is still a breath of fresh air in a music scene dominated by dull, derivative rock.

B00005ATQF|5.0|Most people think that this is really 2 movies in 1: the Marine boot camp first half, the Vietnam combat 2nd half. Actually they are two sides of the same coin.<br /><br /> I agree with the Boston Globe's assesment that this is \\"the greatest war movie ever made.\\" It captures the essence of war: the mass psychological programming that makes it possible, and the concrete results of that programming when it comes in contact with reality.<br /><br /> A lot of people criticize the second half as being slow, abrupt, pointless, ugly and anticlimactic---which, of course, is exactly how war IS, especially the Vietnam war.<br /><br /> ...The movie suggests that both forms of innocence/humanity must be killed if one is to \\"get with the program\\" of war fighting---a program that is by terms hideous, brutal, corrupt---and absolutely, hilariously absurd.<br /><br /> In contrast to today's Bush Jr.'s simpleton yee-haw post-9/11 view of the world, Kubrick's film presents a much more ambiguous and therefore more richly accurate picture: There are no good guys, there are no bad guys, there are just guys who kill and guys who get killed, and there's no telling which category you'll find yourself in, 'cause it's just one big crazy Mickey Mouse show out there, in this \\"world of s***.\\"<br /><br /> Right-wing lovers of patriotic kitsch need not apply!
0393312836|5.0|This book is absolutely fabulous!  Simply fantastic.  Reading this book, one cannot but be totally embedded in the sadistic mind of Alex, a trouble teen who'd like nothing more than to kick you in the teeth for doing absolutely nothing, like minding your own business on a street corner.  But this is anything but a mindless read. On the contrary. After being arrested, Alex is embarked on a Reclamation Program where the Government attempts to brainwash criminials by conditioning them to do good. The story veers into a serious exploration of the morality of free will: is it better to be evil and free; or good and without choice?<br />For the first part of the book though, expect very brutal and gruesome scenes of the crimes committed by Alex's gang (what he terms droogs).  These scenes would be very grim to read, if not for the inventiveness of the author who cleverly pens in a self-invented slang known as nadsat.  Queer words like viddy (see), slooshy (hear), horrorshow (good, fantastic), metso (place) and veshch (stuff) abound, so much so that the scenes become somewhat alien and bearable.  I suppose, nadsat is a really a double-edged sword.  Readers may be put off instantly after reading the first 2 pages. I guarantee you that most would come out scratching their heads, comprehending 20% at most. Take heart, push on - you won't regret it. A glossary would come in handy for sure, but that would rob the fun of deciphering the pecularities of the lingo. By the third chapter, the prose becomes much more fluid as readers grow accustomed to Alex's street talk. In fact, nadsat is so fundamental to the book - that's where we find Alex's voice and establish a connection to his character.<br />I would like to say that the book is funny (because it FELT funny) if not for the gravity of the crimes committed and the degree of suffering decked out by our hero's careless actions.  In Alex's voice, the wanton acts of violence seem \\"muted\\" - and thus, charming. One is not confrontedwith the carnage of the his brand of violence because everything is seen from his eyes and in time, you'll empathize with his pitiable state. It is little wonder that 'A Clockwork Orange' remains shrouded in controversy.  Nonetheless, this is a superb read, by any standard - short and sweet, morally substantial and totally out of this world. Go and buy this book!
6305428352|5.0|This is such a poignant story.  The story involves a musician whose greatest dream is to compose, and see performed, a classical work of musical expression.  But as with many in life, the demands of reality force him to put aside his dream and take a job as a teacher.  He faces frustrations and disappointment in his career, family, and his music and does it with courage.  As he struggles for 30 years, with the many conflicts in his life, he is still able to share his appreciation for the art while clinging to his dream.  He touches many hearts with music, defining it's significance in our lives.  But, this isn't just about a teacher, it's about everyone, and the sacrifices made for the important things in life.  Each of us can identify ourselves in some way.  We see  how one man learns to accomplish it all, while giving back a part of himself.  And finally there is the realization of how far his talent can reach, when amazingly it is revealed who he has touched most.  It is heroism at it's most fundamental state.  This movie is about everyone who holds on to their dreams, never giving up.  This movie gives hope to all who chance to dream, and encouragement to those struggling to find a dream to hang on to.
B00005RDSM|5.0|There are four classes of Disney films: the Classics (Snow White, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty), the Good Films (Robin Hood, Alice in Wonderland), the Yawners, or Unremarkable Films (The Aristocats, The Sword in the Stone), and the Failures (The Black Cauldron). Basically, all but the last class are ones that are enjoyable, and only the first two classes are worthy of being hailed as &quot;Classics&quot; by the Disney marketing machine.<br />Peter Pan fall distinctly in the second class, the &quot;Good&quot; films. Great villain (both Hook and the crocodile), great hero, and great story, but just shy of being perfect in the execution in a few places. Still, it's a classic Disney film, and &quot;good&quot; for Disney is a perfect feature for all but a few animation studios.<br />This edition has a decent amount of extras, including a commentary track (which I haven't listened to), and making-of featurettes. All in all, this is about as good as it gets for a Disney release outside of the Platinum Editions. If you can find it, make every effort to buy it.
B000021YQV|5.0|PRISON SONG - First song on a spectacular album.  Great intro, great rhythm, weak lyrics.  8/10.<br />NEEDLES - Alright song, they really didn't put too much strong material at the beginning of this album.  8/10.<br />DEER DANCE - Excellent song.  Great message and good chorus.  Serj is really powerful here.  9/10.<br />JET PILOT - Probably a filler.  This song is pretty much pointless but is fast and fun to listen to.  7/10.<br />X - Song about overpopulation.  Not that interesting but again Serj is a great singer and System can make any song sound great because of their amazing musical ability.  7/10.<br />CHOP SUEY! - First great song of the album.  This is their first single, and is probably the mosh-pit anthem of the year.  Such a cool song, even though it doesn't make too much sence.  I think this is System's best song ever.  10/10.<br />BOUNCE - More of a comical song, one to let you catch your breath after Chop Suey!  Good fast music, alright song.  8/10.<br />FOREST - Average music, average lyrics, average song.  8/10.<br />ATWA - Slow song until the chorus, which is heavy.  This is one of the best songs on the album.  9/10.<br />SCIENCE - Cool song and good lyrics and good music equals great song.  9/10.<br />SHIMMY - Really great song.  It is a little short, but it was an experimental track for System and it turned out good.  Actually one of my fav System songs ever.  10/10.<br />TOXICITY - Second single.  Slow verses, faster chorus.  This is a really deep song so you have to listen to the lyrics hard to understand whats going on.  Excellent song.  10/10.<br />PSYCHO - Song about playing concerts and being on the road.  Alright song but sweet chorus.  8/10.<br />AERIALS - Great way to end a great album.  This is the third single off the album, and pretty much the only really slow song on the whole album.  Great song though, makes my top five System songs.  10/10.<br />For any &quot;nu-metal&quot; fan, BUY THIS CD.  Also a must have for any System fan, itis better than their first effort.
6304806442|5.0|I've now seen this film about 10 times, and it stays fresh every time.  The acting, dialogue, music, cinematography, script...everything works together beuatifully.  The opening scene is especially unforgettable, probably the best marriage of music and film I've seen in a long time.<br />Instead of seeing this as a film about heroin addiction, a much better way of viewing this movie is examining WHY the central character played by Ewan McGregor, does heroin and WHY most mainstream people DON'T turn to chemical drugs.<br />Hint: listen to McGregor's voice-over at the beginning and at the end of the movie, when he goes into the rant about all the everyday addictions of \\"normal\\" people: materialism, conformity, mindless pop culture.<br />At the beginning of the film the narrator reads this laundry list of all our modern \\"necessities\\" with scorn; at the end, he reads it again but with mock enthusiasm as he flees the UK with a couple grand stolen from his buddies and promising to turn over a new leaf by embracing mainstream capitalist culture, affirming that he *will* indeed \\"choose life.\\"<br />The genius of the film is that at that point you not only suspect he's just going to continue his drug life overseas but also you almost sympathize with him---look at the lame excuse for a \\"life\\" that most of us on the straight-and-narrow have.
B0000931OL|4.0|hmmm. having just finished listening to THINK TANK for the first time, i have to admit that i was very surprised by just how good it actually is. having heard the advance track 'don't bomb when you're the bomb' and 'crazy beat' on the radio, i was beginning to think blur were going to have a real hard time growing up, so to speak. this is their 7th(!) album, they just lost their guitar player (who happens to be one of the finest in the world) . . . you have all the elements of the 'bad' album. but against all odds, blur have made a mature, understated record. damon albarn takes over on guitar, bringing that drunk-sounding $15 gorillaz acoustic guitar with him. very nice. alex james holds the whole thing down with grooves that, without graham coxon to complicate matters, hold the songs down very nicely. dave rowntree, always a sport for sampling his own drums and reprogramming them, has come up with some very laid-back, understated rhythms. to sum up: blur ages gracefully!gorillaz meets '13'! sort of. the pretty parts of '13' with the more melancholy parts of gorillaz.
B00005JKPF|5.0|If you didn't like the first you will like the second, if you did like the first you will like the second... it's that simple! The first X-Men prepared you for the second which directly means more action in X-Men 2. There is not much to say about X-Men since most people do understand the plot but i am here to give you a little more info about this film. X-Men United has a great cast of new characters but the only downfall is that you don't get to see them do as much as in the first since there are more characters, especially Nightcrawler which is a new character in the film. You get to see him do a few cool stunts but frankly he doesn't do as much as i expected. You get to understand a little more about Wolverines past and \\"YES\\" he has a lot more action scenes than he did in the first. Simply all the characters that didn't get to steal the spotlight in the first film ,for instamce Magneto, get to show off this film. So enjoy the movie and definitly add this to your DVD collection when it's released around Oct.!!!!
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is, without a doubt, the single most important album the Beatles ever made, if only because it signaled the group's shift from being more about singles and simple themes to a group about complete albums and much more complex musical themes. As such, the disc isn't as reliant on its hits as it is on the entire album as a whole. (Not that the individual songs aren't great; even the worst Beatles songs could easily be played on the radio with some regularity.) Between this CD and Revolver, you've got what is (or should, really) be the cornerstone of any music fan's Beatles library.
B00006CXXU|5.0|She's hot, she can sing, and there's quite the diverse style of song on this CD.  Slow to dance and everything in between.
B00005PJ8O|4.0|&quot;Patton&quot; remains one of the most ambitious WWII films ever mounted. The film's grand battles and outstanding visual effects are complimented by George C. Scott's performance as George Patton, who gave us all a taste of what it's like to lust for war. The DVD features a fine digital transfer of the film (the dialogue is overshadowed by sound effects at times, and this is the only reason I don't give it a full five stars), complete with  an intermission brake, as well as theatrical trailers for this film, the epic D-Day film &quot;The Longest Day,&quot; and the ill-conceived &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; The DVD also features a commentary track by a Patton historian! I recommend this DVD to all those who love war films.<br />Movie Grade: A+ (5 Stars)<br />DVD Grade: A- (4 Stars).
B00005JLXE|3.0|I waited years for them to make a movie about the blind super hero named Daredevil and man was i somewhat disappointed when i watched it. Ben Affleck does a great job playing Daredevil (but doesn't look cool in the suit) and Jennifer G. was the perfect person to play Electra.The movie had it's ups and downs and a lot of corny parts to it, especially when Daredevil was young. I don't like to be insulted about my intelligence but a 13 year old blind kid jumping roof to roof to train himself to be a super hero was a little to ridiculous for me!!!! I know people can't fly like Superman or climb walls like Spider-Man but the scenes with the kid doing all those stunts on the roof was just a little to much stupidity for me to handle,yet some of the action was pretty cool. I definitely liked the fact that they got Michael Clarke Duncan to play King Pin, I couldn't think of anyone else to cast for that role, but some hardcore fans of Daredevil disliked the fact that King Pin was a black guy in the film since all the years king Pin has been white in the comic books and cartoons, but sometimes it's good to have changes. Overall the movie was a success, but yet not the greatest super hero movie of all time. I personally thought the entire movie went to fast... Everything happened at once and that is one failure that can ruin a comic book movie! I would recommend to add this film to your DVD collection and i would also recommend to go and watch it in the theater just not with your hopes high thinking it's going to be the best Comic Book movie of the year!!
B00000JMQE|5.0|I loved this film. I would love to see it again. I thought it was fantastic. Adventurous and sort of darker than the original. Worth a look.
0451169514|5.0|This is by far Stephen King's best work.  The Stand, which is also an awsome work is a distant second in my opinion.  He makes the characters jump off the page and you kind of wish you were part of the \\"Loser's Club\\" yourself.  King is also a master of the concept of time, as you other constant readers can agree with in his short story \\"My Pretty Pony\\".  In this book time in itself has many differnt aspects.  Read the book, you will not be dissapointed.  ANy negative reviews you read are just pure jealosy.
B00006LI4S|5.0|There is no denying the talent and profciency of David Gilmour as a guitarist and performer and through this DVD he proves it again.The concert is mostly played on acoustic guitar which sounds amazing considering that most of the Pink Floyd songs are just layers and layers of electric sounds and melodies.The stripped down version of Shine On You Crazy Diamond is brilliant.The choir backing Gilmour is amazing.I got goose bumps listening to the girl playing the celo, she added such a delicate and beautiful touch to High Hopes and Je Crois Entendre Encore.Special appearences from Richard Wright and Bob Geldof as well.Over all a mind blowing performance.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I got this DVD not knowing if I would like it or not. I heard that it was supposed to be really good so I decided to get it. I was hesitant because I am normally not a fan of anime and movies like that. However, once I started the movie I realized how amazing it truly is. From the beginning I was hooked to the movie and couldn't stop watching it. It is a visual wonder. The animation is spectacular. Everything about the movie is excellent. I would suggest this movie VERY highly.

0064471837|2.0|I had heard Sabriel was a fantastic, awesome, you-have-to-read-this sort of book. I love fantasy, or any other good fiction, but Sabriel just didn't keep me interested. I eagerly started this book, anticipating a great story, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  Maybe my expectations were too hight, or something.  Garth Nix seems to be trying to be another bold fantasy writer, but he lacks description skills, and it was very confusing at times. I found myself rereading things because I was so sure I'd missed something. The whole concept was reallly cool, actually, what with the magic bells and stuff, but it didn't work. And that love between Sabriel and Touchstone is so... forced. Touchstone was incredibly boring. Neither he nor Sabriel meant anything to me, and if they had died at the end, quite frankly, I wouldn't have cared. Mogget was an intersting character, though. You know how authors say that they start writing books and then the charachters take over? It seems that Nix's characters are so flat that he has to force them to do what he wants, and it doesn't quite work.  I don't think I'll read the second or third one of these unless I am seriously bored.
B00008S2VH|5.0|I love this album!! I think it pokes fun at society as well as reveals madonna's inner self. Beautiful ballads!! &quot;Hollywood&quot; is very upbeat, and &quot;Nothing fails&quot; is my personal favorite. I think its pleasantly surprising. I can't wait to hear it in concert, should be fun!! Enjoy!!<br />FD :)
0609610570|5.0|I agree that the most important thing in business success is the execution of the strategy, and there are a lot (a hell lot of) good strategies get wasted by lousy execution.<br />Execution is important in any type of business, and failing to do so is the responsibility of the leader. Most small business owners know that by heart as they saw the execution right there days in days out, but a lot of big corporation did not, especially those who never really do MBWA.<br />Linking the three processes will be the only way we can execute well. People-strategy-operation surely is the heart of the matter.<br />I like the part of the PEOPLE PROCESS, and i think we often put the wrong emphasis in finding the right people on the right job. We did not put the track of their past EXECUTION into our major consideration.<br />I think this is a good execution-framework book for all leaders and supervisors to learn about execution.<br />I think EXECUTION will be more useful if you also improve you business model innovation, the book &quot;The Ultimate Competitive Advantage&quot; will be best paired to this book. Read both and combine the good strategy with superb execution and you will be a winner.
B00005JLK0|2.0|This movie had a good plot and some impressive special effects, but isn't a horror movie supposed to be scary? I'm telling you right now, I haven't seen many horror movies and I scare very easily, but neither this or its predecessor, &quot;13 ghosts&quot;, scared me very much. while the images on the screen were sometimes scary, there was no underlying creepiness or sense of foreboding that movies like &quot;the ring&quot; and &quot;the sixth sense&quot; had in droves. those movies had a minimum of blood and very little violence, and yet they still managed to scare me senseless and disturb me on a psychological level. i think that movie makers are confusing gore and violence with fear, but unfortunately they are two very, very different things.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|This scenario best describes Phil Collins \\"Hits\\" collection. With a simple title it should do just that. Phil Collins was at his peak in the \\"me\\" decade of Reaganomics. Every show he booked was packed to capacity, and every song he released assaulted Radio and MTV.<br />Fear not, the Lion's share of Phil's hit singles were gathered up, And it's wonderful for the financially impaired to hear \\"Take me home\\", \\"In the air tonight\\", and \\"Another day in Paradise\\" at the press of a button.<br />However in the quest to pack Phil's 17-Year (at the time) career onto an 80-Minute Disc, it was skimmed of a few well known hits: \\"I Missed again\\", \\"Do you remember\\" and \\"Billy Don't lose my number\\". Which for me is a tremendous drawback, considering the latter is one of my favorite Songs of all time. And if the casual fan wants the studio versions of these tunes, they'll have to track down the actual albums. Which I'd encourage, but \\"Hits\\" is probably aimed towards the budget minded casual fan. <br />A minor qualm I have is the tracks aren't arranged in order of their release, \\"In the Air tonight\\" off his 1981 \\"Face Value\\" album should've been the definitive opener.<br />For it's shortcomings I deduct a star, but still \\"Hits\\" is a great retrospective and is a worthy addition to your collection.<BR>Casual fans will be more than content with \\"Hits\\". It won't disappoint.
0679600019|5.0|The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author.  The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.<br />Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde:  the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.<br />Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde:  carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty.  This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go.  Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.<br />Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like.  Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian.  Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.<br />This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings.  Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description.  She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for.  This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry).  There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.<br />Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take.  Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life.ead for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life.

B000002U82|5.0|... and still a fascinating listen. I think I may have discovered DSOTM a few years after its release, in the late '70s, when I was in my early teens. For many years this was a staple of my music collection and my preferred PF album until it was dethroned by The Wall. After non purposely avoiding it throughout the '90s, I went back to DSOTM sometime in the last 2 years. Still every bit as innovative and breathtakingly awesome as it was then. Cheers, gentlemen. And thank you.
0156027321|5.0|It was the jacket of this book that first caught my eye. The fanciful illustration of the boy and tiger in a little white boat, hoardes of sharks swimming below them, made me instant curious if the actual book itself would be the same way. I resisted buying it for a week or two, but I finally gave in - and was in no way disappointed.<br />The narration is intelligent and easy to follow at the same time, and Yann Martel draws on many fresh sources to find humor. From the moment I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The days that Pi is lost at sea read like a dream, and all of the boy's hardships are your own. There is no way to express in words the sort of book this is, or how wonderfully Martel captured the entire event in words.<br />I would reccommend this book to anyone, and already have given it to several people.

Once you start it you can't stop till you get to the end, and then you just want to read it again, and again, and again...<BR>Imagine to your self London, and then imagine it's subway and then imagine a whole new world down there with different customs and people and even animals. And imagine one man who acidentlly gets into this world, this is what the book is about and everybody who loves fantasy should read it.
0553381709|3.0|I enjoyed the first three books in this series.  I agree with some that this series is better than the Wheel of Time series because the plot actually moves with each book.  The story line is great and here's to hoping that the next installments are just as good.<br />BUT<br />There are rather descriptive sexual scenes in these books.  At first, it was just a scene or two but by this book there are several scenes and the descriptions continue to go into more detail about the various physical descriptions and actions of the characters.  If there was any reason I would stop reading this series, it would be this.  Actually, if the fourth book has similar descriptions, I'm done.
B000002GQE|5.0|Maybe!! When I first heard this album in full (Sometime in the 80'S), I was blown away. Of course I have always known &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot; and &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; but to hear it all in context was...like I said above....mindblowing! I love to watch the expressions on my friends faces when I start &quot;Overture&quot; (my favorite piece)... &quot;What is this &quot;Disney&quot; music?&quot; they sneer. When I say &quot;No, just one of the greatest albums of the 60'S&quot; that usually gets their attention...and keeps it. They usually end up getting their own copies. As has been said before some of the songs are dated but there's not a bad one in the bunch. I also find myself looking forward to the &quot;Classical&quot; pieces between songs like just before &quot;Peak Hour&quot; which gives you the feel of a busy city at work. So many images flow from this album I can't describe them all. Give it a listen for yourselves. I only wish they would do the whole thing live sometime.
6300215814|5.0|This movie in my opinion, is the BEST movie ever made!!  I love this movie so much that I can actually watch it over, and over again!!  I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone.
B00005U122|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST DVD IN MY COLLECTION. THE SOUND IS AWESOME!!!<BR>THIS IS BETTER THAN \\"DAVID GILMORE IN CONCERT\\". I CAN'T RECOMMEND A DVD ANY HIGHER. IT HAS SO MUCH MUSIC ON IT COMPARED TO THESE 60 MINUTE THINGS LIKE THE EAGLES. AND THE MUSIC IS ALSO BETTER(AND I'M AN EAGLES FAN TOO).YOU REALLY HAVE TIME TO GET INTO THIS MUSIC WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTIONS. IT IS SIMPLY SUPERB IN ALL WAYS. YOU'LL NEVER FIND A BETTER DVD IF YOU LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC. I LOVE PINK FLOYD MUSIC AND IT HAS THIS SOUND. THE MUSICIANS AND WATERS AND THE BACKUP SINGERS WILL SIMPLY BLOW YOUR MIND!!!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|As a major fan of the book (note I say book, not books, as Tolkien never intended it to be split), I am disappointed in how much the movie veered away from the original. However, the purpose here is to review the movie, which plain and simply is 100% entertaining.<br />Never has 3 hours passed so quickly, and I absolutely cannot wait for the extended edition!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Some people out there will say that this cd might be too commercial or not punk enough. They are totally wrong! The thing that makes this cd so punk is because of the varying music styles. Think about it, the Clash probably inspired some new punk bands such as Rancid. Rancid has some punk and ska songs, so does this cd. Even thogh this cd is still VERY punk (and probably the greatest Clash album) it is not as heavy as the songs on THE CLASH or SUPER BLACK MARKET CLASH. That really doesn't matter, though. Any true punk should own this cd. Below is a small review of each song.<br />LONDON CALLING: 9/10 A good opening song with a punk beat<BR>BRAND NEW CADILLAC: 10/10 One of my favorite songs, I love the drums and guitar<BR>JIMMY JAZZ: 7/10 Easily skippable slow song<BR>HATEFUL: 10/10 Great song that has a faster beat, good punk song<BR>RUDIE CAN'T FAIL: 10/10 This song shows how much The Clash can stretch their wings. Best ska song on the cd.<BR>SPANISH BOMBS: 9/10 Not bad, nice political lyrics.<BR>THE RIGHT PROFILE: 9/10 I love this song. Catchy poppish punk song<BR>LOST IN SUPERMARK.: 5/10 The only song I actually HATE! Way too slow.<BR>CLAMPDOWN: 10/10 Nice rock song<BR>GUNS OF BRIXTON: 10/10 Second best ska song on cd. Great lyrics!<BR>WRONG 'EM BOYO: 9/10 Sort of fast song. Funny lyrics!<BR>DEATH OR GLORY: 10/10 One of the best songs on cd. PUNK!<BR>KOKA KOLA: 10/10 Good song with talking about kocaine and stuff!<BR>THE CARD CHEAT: 8/10 Ok song, not one of the best. Too poppy!<BR>LOVER'S ROCK: 9/10 Rock and roll!<BR>FOUR HORSEMEN: 9/10 Good rock/punk song.<BR>I'M NOT DOWN: 10/10 Great song, has alot of rock and punk drum sounds!<BR>REVOLUTION ROCK: 9/10 SKA! YES!<BR>TRAIN IN VAIN: 9and a half/10: Not bad for a pop song.
B000068TPN|5.0|We Were Soldiers is quite possibly one of the best war movies ever. The battle scenes are excellent, though the music isn't quite exhilarating but the action itself makes up for that. Mel Gibson is excellent (he should have been nominated for an Oscar in my opinion, but you know, those Hollywood types) and I loved seeing Sam Elliot in his element as a hard-bitten and tough Sergeant Major, straight out of a western. As I said, the battle scenes are well choreographed and are very realistic. And this movie isn't just for us men, there are many tender moments and it shows how the war effected the loved ones these men left back home. All in all a very powerful war movie and extremely realistic.
0553573403|5.0|If you want to enjoy other books... because you'll raise your standard on quality books after reading A song of Ice and Fire.<br />I was a very avid reader, reading on average 2 books a week.  But once i finished A song of Ice and Fire, i just found it hard completing any other books.  I even went back to my old favorites such as The Dragonlance Chronicles and Wheel of Time, but they all seemed so childish after reading Martin's works.<br />Simply the best writing i've ever read.
B00006F83Y|5.0|I was reticent to purchase this album because of all the &quot;hype&quot; surrounding it. What finally convinced me is hearing that these guys have been at it for 12 years, so it's not like they're some record company created overnight sensation.<BR>Perhaps people have been a tad over zealous in the praising of this album. But let's take a look at the state of modern music today. What else have we got? Creed? Linkin Park? Good Charlotte? Sum 41? The Donnas?...UGH! Sorry, but they just aren't any good. Poor musicianship, poor songwriting, poor everything! (Interestingly enough, one reviewer here poses the question &quot;Why waste your time with boring and inane patter when there are thousands of great albums just waiting to be heard?&quot; WHERE?!?) <BR>Enter Queens of the Stone Age. Just when you thought fine musicianship and great songwriting didn't get anybody anywhere anymore! One of the best things about this CD is that QOTSA's sheer love of music really comes across. These guys aren't just in it for the women and money. Another great aspect is that the musical influences are quite clear (Iggy and the Stooges, Hendrix, Cream, 70's punk, I also sense a little Pixies...) but nothing seems plagarized. In fact, it's more as if they remember what music was great and feel we all need a little reminder (which we do). The third, and probably best element of this album is that it's fun. No, it's not anything new, but what is? It's all been done before. The only thing any of us can aspire to do is improve upon an existing theme. In my opinion, that's exactly what Queens of the Stone Age accomplish here. This album is not without it's flaws. I found the little radio interludes rather tedious and there are a few songs that come off as &quot;filler&quot; to me (Six Shooter and that lauhing business). I also think it appeals more to people of a certain generation. I don't think many people born after 1975 are going to &quot;get it&quot;. All things considered, I think this isa solid effort and definitely worth a listen.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I was shocked to find this CD so disappointing, that I only could listen to 4 of the 18 songs all the way thru without hitting the &quot;forward&quot; button on the stereo.  Definitely not the Mac of the past, and for sure I won't ever buy anything of theirs in the future.  I have never been moved to write a negative review before, but I have to say this is probably the worst CD I have bought in a few years.  Guess I should have listened to more samples before buying it out of the adoring faith of past work..... my mistake indeed.
B00000K19E|4.0|This is one of the best action/sci-fi movie to date! The special-effects are the best. Everybody says Keanue Reeves acting in this movie was very stiff, but I think they just can't get over some of his other movies, because all the acting in this movie is superb. Carrie-Ann Moss' role as Trinity was brilliant, and Lawrence Fishbourne's role as Morpheaues was equally amazing. And of course, the best part of this movie is the action. I was very impressed with the Bullet-Time effects.<br />The movie focuses around Neo, a hacker whoose world is turned upside down as he finds that the world he and everyone else exists in is only an illusion and a prison to the entire human race. The leader of a resistance group fighting for the freedom of mankind, Morpheaues, believes Neo is \\"The One\\", destined to save humans from total destruction.<br />If you look at the top of this review, you notice that I gave The Matrix 4 stars instead of 5. The one complaint I have is not with the movie. The one complaint I have is with the MPAA. My question to them: Why is this movie rated R? There decision to give this movie an R rating was, in my opinion,....<br />That aside, this movie is awesome.
0805053883|4.0|Hands down, \\"Brown Bear\\" is better than this.<BR>However, when the two are interchanged regularly, this is also a fun book to read.  <BR>My children definitely prefer Brown Bear to Polar Bear, but this requires more parental \\"animation\\" to make the book fun.<BR>Still worth the purchase....
B000005TQO|4.0|I bought this album 9 years after it had been realised. So I noticed immediately how much Laura has changed. Her voice has come stronger and actually everything about her has changed. But although Laura is much better artist now than she was in 1994 there are stil good tracks on this album. My favorites are Non c', La solitudine, Baci che si rubano and Dove sei. Only thing why I was little disapponted was a number of the songs. But when you think about that how she was just a beginner in those times, this album is not bad actually it's good.
0805047905|5.0|Starting from infancy onto age 7 or so, this book is a great book to read.  Rhythmic, educational, and fun.<BR>Children love it, and best of all, you will love reading it to your children.  We've really enjoyed this book throughout the years.
B000083E79|5.0|i have this cd.  it's so great.  she is one of our best performers of all-time.  and now that her album is almost gold on the billboard charts, i would love to see her hit NO.1 on the charts in the hot 100 charts for the first time in her history.  i love her as an actress as well.  i can't wait till december to see her in struck on you.  the timing of this cd's promotion with the commerical, tour, and the tour concert on nbc has spring boarded this album to new heights.  so to those that are not sure of buying it get it u won't be disappointed and to those that have it rock on baby.         CAUSE CHER RULES!!!!
B00005JLRT|5.0|A sci-fi masterpiece. I've always found the TV shows to be very limited. The computer system was awkward. They never really fully used the weapons of their ship. While TNG was never bad about it, Voyager and Enterprise have always been filled with errors. This film really isn't. The ship is gorgeous, the technology more realistic for the time period. The plot is quite good, better than Star Wars, in my opinion.<br />The battle scenes are wonderful. They go all out in this one.<br />I know that many people do dislike this movie, but if you really read their arguments against it you'll see that they're almost as weak as an episode of Enterprise. Most people complain about how Data dies, but people do die. Get over it. I won't even address all the other complaints I've heard of the movie because almost all of them are nothing but nonsensical ranting. If you do your research, almost everything about this film goes along with Star Trek canon. The Reman planted WAS meantioned in TOS. It WAS stated that there were several prototypes before Data and Lore.<br />Bottom line: Buy this film. It's excellent and is a worthy addition to the Star Trek franchise.
B0000646UN|5.0|As several other reviewers have noted, the quality on the DVD is rather bad. What is even more irritating in my opinion is that several scenes have been cut away. I saw the movie when it was originally released for cinema, and I remember it being almost 3 hour long. My memory is certainly clouded by time, but I distinctly remember one scene depicting a visit to a prostitue which is gone. At least one combat sequence is gone too, when they go on a mission behind enemy lines.<br />The movie in itself is astonishingly good. Only &quot;Das Boot&quot; rivals it when it comes to war movies. Too bad the DVD is a mess.
0345409671|1.0|As a rabid fan I followed Lestat from \\"Interview\\" to \\"Memnoch\\". This book was the most self-involved, irrelevant bunch of garbage I have read from the hands of Rice. <br />Rather than a vampiric adventure, it's a long boring lesson in theology that takes up 90% of the book--LITERALLY. The characters (God and the Devil) are so unplausible and long-winded it COULD arguably destroy anyone's desire to meet them! This book is so filled with Rice's personal anxieties about religion and the next life that she neglects the fact that other people have to read it. Hello??? Why bore us to death by regurgitating the same old beliefs and worries about God and Christ and dogma that people have had for centuries? PLEASE!!! As I said, no vampiric adventure, just a lecture in theology from the very boring, effiminate, ultra-delicate Memnoch, and Lestat's uninteresting adventure.  Another flaw that each character in her book has is that they ALL sound alike.  That is actually common in most of her books.<br />As I've said elsewhere, this series should have ended in \\"Queen of the Damned\\" which was the crown of them all. \\"Memnoch\\" is a true downer and joy killer. If you want to remain in love with Lestat, don't read this one--he will kill you by sucking the enthusiasm out you!
B00006690G|5.0|Finally it's here.  Eminem is here to save the hip-hop world.  This is the best rap album of 2002.  I'm glad because Marshall Mathers Lp was good, but it could have been a lot better.  Almost every song was about killing someone. On the Eminem Show he way more versitale.  This album is a prime example of how Eminem has lyrically matured.  The Best lyricist in the game now!  If you don't have this album go get it NOW!!!
B000089RVX|1.0|I usually try not to review albums I think are just straight out awful, unless theyre overhyped by the press and i need to burst some bubbles. Well this band doesnt really do well with critics, but everytime i turn on the radio its like somebodys drilling into my skull. This kind of wanna-be tori amos meet creed sound with horrible orchestration behind it and two of the most annoying nu-metal vocals ive ever heard.  so at a party i heard the album... again like drills in my skull. this album has been called a stylistic breakthrough by people whose music tastes dont extend past mtv2, but i just gotta say this type of thing has been done before and it been done way way way better. check garlands by the cocteau twins and dummy by portishead.... but aw yes this sound is being done way way way better right now. by a band off of jade tree records (yes i know terrible label) called denali.  theyre sound is intense. and i dont mean radio ready get your buy on intense, i mean theres actual passion behind it.. they dont sound totally dead.  so if anyone is intrested in hearing a less corny, less christian rock version of the great idea behind this horrible band, i just want you to know there are alternative.
B000089RVX|3.0|I was astounded to hear Evenescence on the local radio.  Actual melodies!  A signer with some talent and a clue as to what key she should be in!  Something that I've been happy find in the Euro Opera Metal scene (Nightwish, After Forever, Flowing Tears) is available in an American band!  But then something caught my ear and really turned me off...what is up with that stupid rap in the background? It's bad enough that Linkin Park has to go down that route, but that doesn't mean everyone needs to jump on the idea.  If you're playing rock, you don't need rappers, sampling, and scratching DJ's - Play your own music, not someone else's.  I've knocked off 2 stars for the rap infusion.
0156027321|1.0|I only finished Life of Pi because my book club is reading it. I ended it with a strong and surprisingly emotional dislike for the book.  It is certainly quite well written with many interesting twists of phrase.  However, the primary theme, in my opinion, is a far, far too graphic \\"kill or be killed\\" one with survival as a sub-theme and religion as just an interesting side-show.
B00008NG5V|4.0|I really like this one.  Jack has a vibe of his very own.  Its good to fianlly hear some good stuff besides all of the fake MTV popstars.  This cd differs from brushfire in the sense that Jack is using more fingerpicking, than the strum patterns we became so very familiar with in songs like Flake, and Bubble Toes.  If you are into jack's vibe of peacefully mellow guitar with the mix of such well written lyrics this is the one for you.  <BR>I'm also likeing his reggae vibe.
B00008WG3U|3.0|As a die-hard NOFX fan, i have to admit that i'm a bit disapointed with this record. from the title, one would think that this would be another scathing political commentary stemming from the same vein as \\"the decline\\" e.p., but unfortunately, none of the politically driven songs on this record can hold a finger to \\"the decline\\", in fact, much of the band's older political material from less politically-driven records (songs like \\"perfect government\\", \\"dig\\" and \\"the bag\\") is much stronger than anything on \\"the war on errorism\\". i only make this point because in the last year or so, fat mike has been making his political opinions much more public than he has in years past, launching punkvoter.com and making numerous anti-bush statements through fat wreck chords newsletters. given the band's ultra-liberal stance and the current state of the world, i was hoping for much stronger political material, instead, i got the disturbingly poppy and lyrically dull \\"franco-unamerican\\", which sounds disturbingly similar to \\"quart in session\\" from 1997s \\"so long, and thanks for all the shoes\\". not to say that there aren't good political songs on this record; \\"the irrationality of rationality\\" and \\"american errorist\\" (i hate hate haters) both stand out as two of this album's better cuts, but by NOFX standards, they aren't anything special. another suprising thing about this seemingly ultra-political record is the number of light-hearted \\"fun\\" songs that were put on it. the band's last effort, \\"pump up the valuum\\", was crammed full of songs that could never be taken seriously, but were unarguably hilarious. for a record that features a clown faced bush on an american flag backdrop for a cover, \\"the war on errorism\\" has more than its fair share of such material. songs like \\"she's nubs\\", \\"mattersville\\", \\"medio-core\\" and \\"anarchy camp\\" are all pretty typical of NOFX humor, but they seem out of place on this record.<br />the album opens with \\"the seperation of church and skate\\", which isprobably my favorite song on this album. the song takes a serious shot at the bubble gum \\"punk\\" bands that have taken the spotlight in recent years, (new found glory, good charlotte, sum41, etc.) fat mike asks the listener \\"when did punk rock become so safe?\\" and speaks the truth with \\"these f--king bands all sound the same\\"...very true. \\"she's nubs\\" is definetly the funniest song on this record (the tale of a girl with no arms or legs)...\\"decom-poseur\\" and \\"we got two jealousa agains\\" are both pretty good songs, again, nothing spectacular, especially for NOFX. \\"anarchy camp\\" is one of the most uninteresting song ideas this band has ever come up with, but they make up for it by making it the most musically interesting song on the album, spicing it up with some nice sax leads, keyboards and kickin ska riffs...\\"13 stitches\\" and \\"whoops, i od'd\\" both have a softer sound than you're used to hearing from NOFX, and both sacrifice rhyming for the sake of telling a story. \\"regaining unconsciousness\\" is the albums last politically driven song, and it also stands out as one of the disc's better tracks.<br />all in all, i can't call this a bad record by any means, but by NOFX standards, it's nothing special. of the band's last six full length albums, this is definetly the weakest, but again, it's certainly not a terrible album. it has it's fair share of good songs, but there really isn't one truely fantastic NOFX banger to be found on the album. fat mike's lyricsism on this record was also somewhat disapointing. when you think that this is the same guy who wrote \\"the decline\\", it's suprising that the ultra-conservative bush administration and the rampant nationalism in the united states hasn't inspired him to write some lyrically spectacular songs. <br />so yeah, if you're a die hard NOFX fan, you should probably pick this album up, but don't be suprised when you find it doesn't measure up to \\"punk in drublic\\" or \\"white trash, two heebs and a bean\\"...if you're not one of theNOFX faithful, you should probably listen to this record before you buy it.
