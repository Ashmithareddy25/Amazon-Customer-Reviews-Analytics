B000FA5STS|3.0|Good read. Not one of his best. Entertaining, at times exciting, but lacks the intensity and depth of Baldacci at his best
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|This game is boring and doesn't make sense. I don't hate it but I don't like it either. Though I don't like it, it is fun.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Stimulating, touching, real. As a result of reading WILD, I want to hike more, but not alone. Stayed allowed her raw emotion and fear to come through, and one could feel  it as you turned the next page.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great endless fun but where is the new update we're supposed to get? It's out on Apple devices but I can't find it for my kindle.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I like this game it is like a gun simulator (duh) but this game is fun I just want a new gun or something
B00AK57N00|5.0|Land on platforms and if you can land in the center you get more points. Pretty simple until gravity changes and the wind starts blowing. This is actually a very fun game even though it is a dead simple timing game. The only problem I found is one that if the developer just threw it away entirely I wouldn't miss it and that would be the leaderboards. They are obviously hacked and I wonder how people are cheating but I don't care because I'm not really into all of that social media stuff anyway. I just like the game. Its well done for what it is and I can't really find any other problems with the game itself so I'm giving it 5 stars. But as far as the leaderboard, I don't want the NSA knowing my high score, anyway. ;)<br /><br />I honestly don't know why I'm joking about that because it's actually not very funny.
B00079FUI6|5.0|This season has everything a woman could ever want in a show, it's funny, sad, dramatic. You will fall in love with these characters, they are so funny! I could watch this series over and over and never get tired of it, awesome show!
B004I654WQ|1.0|Don't get me wrong.  I love this movie or I would not have bought it for my kids.  But when I opened it up a few months after Christmas there were no discs in the case!  I am extremely disappointed.  It makes me hesitant when it comes to future orders from Amazon.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This story is really amazing. I like it when I can't expect what's going to happen. I recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy stories.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Eva and Gideon are still captivating and romantic and toxic, but I can't believe it's another cliff hanger?!  What happened???
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Where do I begin? I love foreign languages, and I want to speak Russian someday, but when I'm relaxing, (1) I don't want to have to read subtitles. (2) The subtitles went too fast, and I consider myself both literate and a speed reader. (3) It was frustrating when the Russians were speaking English because whenever I let my guard down (laid down), I had to sit up and read more subtitles. Pick a language! Realistically most Europeans nowadays speak English so it wouldn't have been a stretch for the Russians to speak English throughout the movie.<br /><br />(4) Did the producers get a subsidy for filming in Russia? It's great to have most of the movie take place in Russia, but could we see more of Russia versus only the destruction of property? The director could have made his point without having a 30 minute (?) worth of scenes trampling over people and cars. Really, is that what you want us to take away from voyeuristically being in Russia? That Russian people are to be trampled all over without regard or consequence for their safety. I did NOT like the subliminal messages from this movie at all.<br /><br />(5) Did the producers get a kickback for using Mercedes? For a person who likes Mercedes to see Mercedes after Mercedes destroyed was sickening! How about donate a car or two to a charity? I didn't count the number of cars, including Mercedes, destroyed, but it had to be in the hundreds if not thousands. Ridiculous! The $100 million dollar budget went mostly to the destruction of property.<br /><br />(5) Jack was so disrespectful towards his father. What messages are we sending to others? That Americans don't know how to treat their elders with respect?<br /><br />(6) At least with &#34;Fast and Furious&#34; movies there's a believable plot and believable elements. You're surrounded by ******SPOILER ALERT******<br /><br />radiation and you don't get sick? PLA - LEASSSSE! So the producer(s) got a subsidy (guessing and speculation) for filming in Russia. Really? The script writer couldn't think of anything better than uranium coming out of Chernobyl and double cross upon double cross?<br /><br />(7) We, the viewing audience, purposefully selected the extended cut - it only contained two minutes at most (guessing). The total movie was 97 minutes. If I had seen this in theaters, I most likely would have demanded my money back. It was too short and when it ended, there wasn't closure. There were too many lose ends. So the CIA doesn't have anything to say about the discovery of uranium? There could have been more finesse.<br /><br />(8) I have to credit/blame the director for this movie being a flop despite bringing in $300 million. I hope the next movie isn't directed by whoever this director was (I can't remember), but you can tell that this is another movie entirely. Where's the original director????<br /><br />I had high hopes for this movie. If the director is directing the next one, I will not be patronizing this franchise any more. With the addition of Jack, I could have seen this movie living on, but now, I'm not quite so sure.<br />Comment
B000FC11A6|5.0|Love this adventure story, fast paced 1300+ pages.  It will not disappoint, action will leave you wanting more.  REAMDE  is also an awesome adventure as well
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This is, in my opinion, QOTSA's best album since Songs for the Deaf.  It's experimental, but focused.  It's consistently well written song after song.  The only thing that I don't like is that it's a pretty short album, but I think that also helps it.  I am definitely left wanting more which leads me to listen again and again.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|Songs on this CD just do not have the energy and excitement of Rod Stewart repetoire.  After a while, a lot of them sound the same.
B008OURHPY|5.0|I must say I luv this cd so refreshing<br />love and found is truly my favorite<br />I can so relate to the song<br />all of her music is really beautiful
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|This was action packed and full of a lot of gun fights and explosions.  Arnold is getting a little too old for action films.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Loved this movie. I think you will either love it or hate it, but give it some time before hating it.  A lot is happening and it's a bit hard to keep up with it all, so I think a second viewing is worthwhile. I don't often want to watch a movie more than once, but no so with this one
B007THA4FI|2.0|The book seems to exist for no other reason than to point out social injustice and the callous disregard of most people for anything outside their narrow self-interests. I was not really drawn in to any character. The lot of them seem self-absorbed. My dogged determination to finish what I start got me to the end, but for naught. I do not feel edified in any way for having completed the laborious journey through this narrative.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's hard to put it down, and the ads really aren't too annoying. A help section would be nice, though.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The tale is long and twisting.  The intrigue, treachery, alliance, feud, lies, loves and battles are fascinating.  The story weaves a spell around the reader and binds you until the very last word.  In a single word: WOW.
B00258SS72|5.0|This movie brought me to tears, but I enjoyed crying. The sentiments are profound. The problems shown in this film reflect those all around us today. And I loved that car!
B008602KQI|4.0|Enjoyed the book and found the movie to closely follow the book. Thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie after reading the book. Can't wait for the next movie in the series.
B005HEPOKU|4.0|I appreciate Rodenberry's vision of man.  Full of potential. You should take the time to watch it and learn from it.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|This really sets the stage well for how the story of the entire series started. I recall reading the Hobit as a kid and again when this film was announced. It follows the story well and introduces all the characters we have come to know in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.
0634021869|5.0|I have the CD and the book and they compliment each other. Learning a lot about Blues. Worth the purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game on any version but it needs to update more often other than that its a wonderful game.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Better than expected, funny and serious at the same time. Action packed and  over the top only as Tarrentino can get away with.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Very entertaining. Addictive. Challenging! I just can't walk away from it.  Makes you feel like a kid.  What else can I say?!?!?!?!!!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Hope Tom Cruise will make more Jack Reacher movies. This movie is as good or better than the mission impossible movies. My wife enjoyed this movie as much as I did. A keeper.
B0018KSB5C|4.0|i have all the spiderman films so i needed this to complete my collection...nothing more special than the other two films, but great for adults and kids.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|A fun love story. Animation was super. A keeper. This is a movie adults will enjoy as much as the kids.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I specifically love the black background with white letters for night reading it is a must for anyone interested in reading in bed.
B004IK30S2|4.0|Decent Will Ferrell movie. Wanted to see before Anchorman 2 is released. Surprise cameos were fun part of the movie.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Its quirky. Even and just hilarious. Interesting characters. Such smart characters getting into unforeseen situations due to living sheltered live
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A wonder full story, ripe with personalities and deftly written .  As Monty Python use to exclaim that &#34;no one expects the spanish Inquisition&#34; and  no one expects the plot twists that come one's ways.  And within this framework MR Martin provide us characters who think what they want say, but say what is most prudent.<br /><br />A plot give away - The moral in the story do not have the luxury  to win out and are placed in positions where may or may win not.  The palace intrigues are deftly executed or botched depending on the capabilities  of the character undertaking the task .  One meets folks who really understand the game thrones and the those who are real pretenders.<br /><br />And if this were not enough, commentary on regions philosophy / individual greed / family / and the need for love - if not the central to the story, pops up regularly and just makes the book that much more special
B001EBYMB2|5.0|Excellent story, action and stars. Very wery wery wery wery good movie. Somewhat vioent but what would u expect from an Army movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever. I just wish that when the updates come out I could get them instead of waiting another month. Otherwise I love this game.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Hands down one of the best fantasy novels! With the advanced currency system that makes Rothfuss seem poor, the characters drive this one home. Love it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best TV shows ever. Funny, action packed, good characters and science fiction to boot. Love it, wish there had been a lot more.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I guess its the roles they both play.  I like the ups and down of each episode.  The characters are all so interesting. Waiting for season two is very difficult. I just have to say it is great.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Both are important,  the messenger and the message.  During all my life I have been waiting for this bit of information.  I am reading the suggested bibliography.  From now on, every one that care about this message will continue searching
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I have been wondering about battery usage and just stumbled across this deal..not sure if it will benefit me but it looks cool
1781162646|5.0|The old time cover gets your money. Forget that the scene never appears in the book. There are pretty photo girls in green dresses, but not in danger as depicted. But that was the job of those old pulp art masters. But SK scores again. Age and memory and youth and innocence, all themes that have served him well, do it again. He can cause a tear or a flash of recognition as well as any author. A winner and a joy.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This outstanding movie was the forerunner of all big budget SciFi. A must see for viewing &#34;Robby The Robot,&#34; the first real movie robot.
B008NQYWC0|5.0|Not too long after I started this novel, I knew this was going to be an amazing story. Actually, the premise alone got me excited but Mr. King has a way of keeping that entertainment going. I was so locked into this story, I finished it in 2 weeks. I had a lot of time on my hands, but I chose to devote all of it to this awesome story. The characters are realistic, the research is impressive without being overwhelming, and the overall story is fast paced. (Long story, explains the length of the book). Read this, you will not be disappointed
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so good that I would like to give it a million stars . But I can't do that
1781162646|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Stephen King is definitely my favorite author of all time. I have never doubted his story telling abilities. I also recommend \\"IT\\" and \\"11/22/63\\". Pure classics. \\"Joyland\\" kept me entertained all the way through and now I'm eagerly awaiting \\"Doctor Sleep\\".
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Boring with a horrible ending to the series. I don't like these kinds of books so I would not have read this.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I have not had much time to try this item, as I purchased it for connecting my tablet to my wired network when wishing to record live TV from my network tuner. Seeing as the television shows I regularly record are on summer hiatus, I will not know whether it is up to the task until these shows resume in the fall. However, it has performed very well in the testing I did with it upon first receiving and installing the device, so I can say with some certainty that I believe I will be very happy with it. I would have rated the adapter with five stars if it weren't for my lack of proper testing. :-)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This apps helps me a lot! With my daily reading! It has notification when I need to<br />Start reading. Everyday plus a bible verse readily at hand!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game<br />MINECRAFT does not have a update yet sadly.<br />When will it come out. I really want buckets and better graphics
0812973992|3.0|This is a dense, thick work of poetry-prose that layers on lives and experiences. The author dives first into the lives of interconnected characters whose choices combined with chance throw them into a hell of personal tragedy or allow them to take small steps to redemption. A common thread to all the action is the tightrope walker, an actual person, and his dizzying feat of walking between the twin towers, an actual event.<br /><br />The first narrator tells of his brother Corrigan who has vowed to be celibate and poor, who has chosen a life of helping the untouchable elements - the sick, aged, hookers and heroin addicts.  The reader is as frustrated as the narrator with Corrigan's choices.  As Corrigan makes a choice that promises to free him, by loving a woman (the nurse at the nursing home), his fate catches up to him.  We also see from the hooker, Tillie's, perspective the sheer frustration of the choices she has made and her guilt at bringing her own daughter into the life of hooking and heroin.  Is there a way out for these people?  The author leads us through several other lives, including a Judge Soderberg, who sees cases of both the hookers and the tightrope walker in one day, and Claire, his affluent wife, who befriends Gloria, the woman from the projects who stepped in to care for the Tillie's grandchildren - their common bond being the loss of sons in Vietnam but their continuing friendship a flickering light of hope for the future.<br /><br />McCann's ambitious effort to get into the heads of these diverse characters is an attempt to get at the human condition.  The characterization flows naturally for some characters (such as Corrigan's brother) but is less natural and more superficial for those who are probably further from McCann's experience, such as the hooker and the judge.  Reading their stories I want to laugh or cry, but I still don't know what really makes them tick.  (And maybe that's the point.)<br /><br />Overall, despite some flaws, thisnovel is an interesting work of art that I'm glad I read.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|What can I say?  It's about making sushi!  But it is really about so much more.  It documents the life of a man who dedicated his life to making sushi from boyhood into his eighties.  Some might say he was obsessed by it or that he had answered a calling.  I found it fascinating that he knew at a young age what he wanted to do in life and proceeded to do it...for the rest of his life.  And seeing all of the sushi being made was like looking at art.
B008220D5K|4.0|A couple of my favorite artists - Graham Parker and Ryan Adams were featured.  I liked it ... funny and I thought the relationships were realistic.  I loved Melissa McCarthy's part.  Good movie.  It was fun to watch.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|The Adjustment Bureau was very engaging from the start and really made me think about issues of free will and predestination.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|Anyone who replaces an older computer with a new model knows the inevitable quest for adapters for existing peripherals, such as flat screen monitors.  This adapter is for a current model Mac laptop to a desktop monitor.  On Amazon, it was about $5 less expensive delivered than at the local retail store.  Like all Apple products, it worked as advertised out of the box.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I gave it five stars because my daughter loved it she plays it everyday and loves playing with beauty so as long as shes happy I'm happy as well so I'm glad I downloaded this app
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|well who ever dint get the movie you really stupid or you dint pay attention , in my opinion it was a good movie, it sad and happy moment, its a great movie for family 12 and up, I really don't want to kill the moment of the movie so if you really want to go see it go don't listen to stupid people, i pay 12.50 and i saw it in IMAX worth the price and had a great time :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is the only game I play it is on all of my electronics l!!!!!!! everyone has to have this game
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT'S JUST AWESOME. Probably the best game I've played since 2007.<br />This deserves 6 stars for it's amazing gamepla. Like I said minecraft is<br />Awesome.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is so fun. It's challenging. I'm always getting new high scores. Subway Suffers is extremely popular at my school.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|Enjoyed this movie. As long as you can sit back and not try to poke holes in the logic of some things, it's a delight and hilarious. I would also recommend the book. I read it after I saw the movie and loved it.
B001NA6096|3.0|I mostly watched to see Ethan Hawke again.  I like him.  The movie was so, so. I might watch the sequel.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This story holds you captive and keeps you there until the very end. You will be entranced from the first page.
B008Y212PI|4.0|These apps aren't overly challenging, but they are a fun way to waste some time. The pictures are sweet, and I like the different levels of difficulty.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|its really fun cuz u can kinda txt and i like that cuz i dont got a fone so i cant txt but with the comments u make new friends and u can talk<br /><br />p.s.im only 12
0452273331|4.0|I have read the book before, and it is FABULOUS. I love all of Rand's work! However, I am rating the book based solely on the fact that it was a gift for another person. I gave it four stars because it was in great condition, but was slightly larger than I would have liked it to have been. Seeing how people enjoy putting their books on a shelf after/before they have read them, I have to say that with this book one may not be able to, seeing how it is the size of a small school textbook. But, size and gift aside, the book is wonderful, and I suggest anyone who is a fan of Rand, politics, or philosophy read it!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Ince you get this game you will never want to stop playing it. I absolutely love this game but it can be a time waster if your on it to much!:)
B009NY43NY|2.0|*SPOLIER ALERT* -<br /><br />I initially pre-ordered this book (for my kindle) as I own every book in the series in hardback. The day it came out, 1 star reviews per popping up left and right. I returned the kindle version without reading it and waited for a copy at the library. Boy am I glad I did! What a bunch of garbage!<br /><br />Charlaine's last two books were not her best but I hoped she would go out with bang. Nope! It  was more like, lets come up with some inane story line and have a mention of as many past characters as we can.  Then just wrap things up with a little bow at the end.<br />I admit I always was a Bill fan and wanted Sookie to end up with him. Maybe Sookie could have had that church wedding, get artificially inseminated since she wants kids, and use the cluvial dor to slow down her aging.  Well I didn't actually think that would happen but that would have been my happy ending.<br /><br />While I always had an inkling that Sookie would end up with Sam in the end, they didn't really develop the relationship. They just went from friends to hot and heavy overnight. And the disintegration of Sookie's relationship with Eric was pathetic. What happened to fight for your man? Eric turned into a big dumb wimp. Previously he would have devised a  shrewd strategy to free himself from his maker's arrangement to marry the Queen of Oklahoma.<br /><br />Overall I felt things were very predictable. You knew right away when Sam wasn't in court he had struck some deal with Eric to bail Sookie out. Although since she had inherited the fae money I'm unclear why she couldn't have used a bail bondsman to post the bail since she was obviously good for it.<br /><br />This book had no umph. I want a better ending! I demand a re-write!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The actors did an outstanding job portraying real people with mental disorders....Finally, a well written movie displaying real people!!!! 5 stars for excellence!!!!.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is a quick simple instructional. It tells you step by step how to upload your book on Kindle without the frills or butting around the bush. It's great read for beginners.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|I first saw this movie when it first came out in the 80's, I loved it then and I appreciate it even more now. Classic
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|It was pretty good. It almost followed the book but it did jump around a little but I thought the movie did a good job with telling the story
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Placed them in a situation and took notes on their journey. Thank you for letting us read their account, Mr. GREEN
B00CT2P6VA|2.0|I loved Quell and Quell Reflect. They were very challenging. This game requires so thought...I'm very disappointed so far. sorry.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really love playing this game.I can play for hours I am so addicted. I just wish I didn't have to wait so long for free credits.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|LOVE it.....way better then any temple run game I have played so far. There also made a movie can't wait to watch.
B008602KQI|5.0|The books were all great reads and this movie was very close to the written story. It was as I had imagined in the print
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book had me speed reading and just drew me in.... I so can not wait to see where their lives go from here
B00913DPW2|1.0|Puzzles are so esoteric you don't even know what the goal of them are. Got this for free and I still feel ripped off.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Downloaded this app for my KindleFire and it was blocked by my antivirus program... wouldn't even let me open it, said it was loaded with potentially unwanted programs (PUP's) so I promptly deleted it. Not happy at all...
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Jack Reacher is just like any other Tom Cruise movie.  He plays the hero and the other guys just fall down.  It was OK, not great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just love minecraft ,just that it takes forever to have updates on the kindle<br /><br />fire hd  I just hate when it's out dated
B00CWV9FQA|1.0|I have lego batman 2 for the Wii. This movie is all the cut scenes from the game put together. I feel very ripped off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0036RCVJM|5.0|I felt I was there with Eric Lomax suffering with him and I could not put the book down.<br />One of the incredible aspects was that he was unable to speak about it for over 30 years.<br />This is a special story and book and it is not fiction and worth 5 stars.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This is a super movie!!!!!!  I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who loves suspense. Of course it never hurts when the movie includes good-looking guys, as well!!!!!  Watch this movie!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book contains more twists than a Weirwood tree...Can't wait to see what happens next! The game of thrones lives on...
B007R41E8O|4.0|I love HO games, but this game has some issues that cause it to just stop when you're right in the middle of completing a task.  If it weren't for that, I'd give it 5 stars!  Please fix this issue!!!!  Also, it takes forever to download.  Therefore, you would expect it to be top notch!
0307454568|5.0|The book was in excellent condition and of course the story did not disappoint at all! This is my fourth time reading this series and I can't wait to read it again! Needless to say that is why I finally bought it! Thank you for being a reliable used book dealer!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Non stop fun filled action, great acting by superstars.  Twisted but extremely entertaining.  One of Tarantino's finest pieces and I've seen them all.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I read this book because it's one of my niece's favorites and I thought it was really good. I'm old, I have kids the ages of these characters (and even some older) but it took me right back to my high school days & the way we felt & the crazy things we did.  The dynamics are the same regardless of the generation. We conform to what is around us to \\"survive,\\" so to speak, but there comes a time (for some) when the real you needs to burst out. In Margo's case she took it to the extreme, she was selfish and left a lot of people worried but I get it.  I understand what she was looking for, or maybe what she was running from. As far as the \\"nerds\\" connecting with the more \\"popular\\" kids their senior year, well I've seen that before. The \\"popular\\" kids spend their HS years socializing only with the other \\"popular\\" kids until some realize there's not as much substance in their relationships as they'd like. Eventually some find more of a connection with the \\"nerds\\" who really aren't so nerdy after all, just normal! Ah, life's lessons :)
1451648537|5.0|Got to give the book an A. At least for content if nothing else. Every night I would read a chapter or so then talk to my wife about it before bed. I couldn't help myself. It raised all kinds of emotional responses from my own dealing with computers in the 80's to Jobs' personal demons and unrepentant personality.<br /><br />Jobs and I are the same age. I was in Cupertino in 1977. I have always chosen not to buy an Apple because of the price but am a PC guy. I thought Jobs had made a very serious marketing mistake by not allowing others to use the OS. I still do.<br /><br />But at least I now understand his thinking.<br /><br />I thought the author started out objective but slowly became a fan and at the end in love with the subject. It was a process.<br /><br />I understand his attitude toward the Pixar options and the Apple options. He was like the evil eye in Lord of the Rings. He didn't care about the money, which is amazing, but once his eye was turned toward it then the Steve Jobs approach kicked in. And that was not always pretty. He wasn't a nice guy. He was a taker not a giver.<br /><br />Liked the book very much. Highly recommend it. Would never have invited Jobs over for a beer without wondering what he was trying to get out of me.<br /><br />Much more could be said, but that is why its a great story. It totally kept me engaged.<br /><br />For those complaining about Apple stories being left out, this book is not about Apple. Its about Jobs. Without Jobs, Apple doesn't exist. Without Jobs, Pixar doesn't exist. But without them both, Jobs doesn't exist.
0743243153|5.0|Provides an excellent understanding of the effects of good and poor parenting.  Shows how our behavior and feelings about ourselves can be traced to our early childhood experiences. Does examine the spiritual aspect deeply which I thought was done well. Would definitely recommend.
B0073B587E|5.0|This is great! Kevin Honeycutt used this during his presentation which was awesome and I bought it right then! Works great w kids and adults! I'm using it with garage band on the iPad and its great! Awesome product but needs an amp!
1427229201|1.0|I COULD NOT WAIT TO GET THIS BOOK. THE ENDING LEFT ME HANGING BUT NOT WANTING MORE .  I LISTEN TO BOOKS ON CD AND HAD TO SKP AHEAD AS IT WAS SO BORING OR PREDICTABLE. I WILL NOT ORDER THE LAST 2 OF THE SERIES OF 5.

B001ANSSDC|3.0|This was not really my type book and it was so simple.  A bit depressing.  I don't know how a movie could be made from it
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am glad I waited to start reading this series until after A Dance with Dragons released. That said now I will go insane waiting until the sixth and purported finale to this fantastic epic is published. This is by far the most detailed science fiction fantasy story since and (dare I say) more human, (though sometimes vile) and exciting even than the great Tolkien epic Lord of the Rings.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Riveting and thrilling with lots of anxious moments with much bravery and hard work. I admire these men and women on the battle field. A fantastic account of events.

B001NEI96O|5.0|Here is the real thing, done expertly and elegantly<br />tilting at windmills that exist no more.<br /><br />This movie is sheer genius by those who made it,<br />who made a movie about a sheer genius and hero.<br /><br />\\"Man On Wire\\" is the title of the police report filed<br />by someone at the World Trade Center when they<br />noticed Philippe Petit tightrope walking between<br />towers of the World Trade Center.<br /><br />The movie shows how they planned and executed<br />this daredevil event, and a bit of the life and history<br />of Philippe Petit too.<br /><br />It's really good ... maybe not the biggest action flick<br />of the century, but it has tension ... no pun intended,<br />heart and nostalgia for a simpler America.<br /><br />I loved this movie, 10/10.

B00COGZ8FU|3.0|The language was a bit over the top and some of the violence.  Over all is was ok though and the story line was good and encouraging.
193700788X|5.0|After reading all of the novels in this series, I think the author did a good job of tying up a lot of loose ends in the previous novels.  The outcome in the end was exactly how I expected it to be, and the drama getting there was classic Charlaine Harris writing of this series.  Thanks for the all the great rides of adventure throughout this journey of Sookie Stackhouse.
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|An eye opening preview of what may be coming with the increasing acceptance of HTML 5.  Don't heed the negative reviews, this is an excellent read.  No, it is not a technical manual, but something to reflect back on and use in your work years from now.

B0020BUWX2|5.0|Goodreads Description- In a single moment, everything changes. Seventeen-year-old Mia has no memory of the accident; she can only recall riding along the snow-wet Oregon road with her family. Then, in a blink, she finds herself watching as her own damaged body is taken from the wreck...<br /><br />A sophisticated, layered, and heart-achingly beautiful story about the power of family and friends, the choices we all make, and the ultimate choice Mia commands.<br /><br />Mia is eighteen and has the kind of family any of us would happy to be born to and the kind of boyfriend that can only exist in the fictitious world. She is also a gifted musician and is about to be accepted into the prestigious Julliard. Mia has a choice, she can follow her love of music, go to Julliard and accomplish her cellist dreams, or she can stay with her family and the love of her life and follow her heart. Either way, she has something to gain and something to lose. Then, one fateful morning, Mia's world is turned on its head and life as she knows it changes. The one thing that remains the same is the question that Mia has asked herself for the past few months, should I go or should I stay?<br /><br />In the book the characters often tried to divide people up into 2 groups...those who are artists or not, those who plan their own funerals ahead of time and those who don't, etc...  Well I think that there are 2 kinds of books.  There are those that we read, close the book and then move on.  Not thinking about the book again because it made no emotional mark on you, the reader.  The kind of book that you forget.  Then there are books that pull all kinds of emotions from you as you read, books that you go back and to re-read well written passages.  Then when you close the book the writing will haunt you.  You will think about that book for the rest of the day.  It is this book that you will often recommend to friends.  It is the book that you just don't forget.  If I Stay falls into the latter type of book.  I can't stop thinking about it.  I became invested in the characters and their stories.  I want to know what happens next.  So my opinion is to read this book.  See if it haunts you.  What emotions will it pull from your heart?  The only way to know is to step into the pages of If I Stay.  5 stars.pe of book.  I can't stop thinking about it.  I became invested in the characters and their stories.

111846446X|5.0|Since the Raspberry Pi usually comes without a user guide, Gareth Halfacree's book is a valuable aid to getting started &#34;on the right foot&#34; with that wonderful learning tool. It is clearly written and discusses both the software and hardware elements of the Raspberry Pi.  I recommend it to anyone who has a brand new Raspberry Pi or is thinking about ordering one.  I spent decades as an IT professional, and months getting familiar with the Raspberry Pi, but when I eventually purchased and started reading this User Guide, I realized it would have shortened the process substantially.<br /><br />Leo Toribio<br />Pittsburgh, PA

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was really good. While being very sad at times, it really does have a silver lining. It's great to read a book that is so very optimistic in a world of pessimism. Matthew quick does a great job of making you understand and really believe in his characters. Great read. I'd recommend it!

B009NY43NY|4.0|I was worried about all the bad reviews this one got but as a true Sookie fan I had to read for myself.  The first few chapters seemed to be written by someone else but soon settled into true Sookie style.  I couldn't have been happier with the ending.  Thank you for wrapping it all up.  Sookie is one of my favorite characters.

0767836286|4.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch \\"Blown Away\\" with Tommy Lee Jones and Jeff Bridges.  This is like a follow up story to it.  I could be behind in the knowledge that it is a sequel but both movies are about the same kind of characters and motives for bombing.  http://www.amazon.com/Blown-Away-Jeff-Bridges/dp/0792835727/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1370742639&sr=1-1&keywords=blown+away

B0076DCT2G|5.0|If you like the previous Nelson DeMille books with John Corey as the main character then you will not be disappointed.  DeMille writes with the well loved wit and clever dialogue readers have come to expect.  There was quite a lot of interesting views and description about the characteristics of modern day Middle Eastern countries and their residents.  It's a wild world out there and that is what creates the suspense and keeps you reading and turning the pages.  Spread amongst the serious suspense is the clever dialogue and thoughts of John Corey that will have you laughing out loud!  All in all a great read.

B004CLYKLI|5.0|Amy Chau is a mother warrior, willing to make the tough choices and suffer the consequences of their unpopularity.  She has a discipline for parenting that most Western parents have abdicated to teachers and institutions.  While harsh on the surface the humor and love for her daughters shines through.  She clearly answers the question \\"why are Asian students seemingly superior?\\"  Answer:  They work harder.  Longer.  And give up much.  She demonstrates in this touching memoir that the loving parent gives up just as much.  At times Amy is cruel and she could stand a boost of the nurturing gene, but she shows the Western parent what having a vision and commitment to your child's full potential could look like.  I teach Kindergarten and I am saddened by the number of parents that think parenting is about trips to Disneyland and smorgasboards of all you can do, see and eat.  These girls have been trained to succeed.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to use and very informational.  Lots of data is shared.  When moving from one screen to next horizontal, the touch needed is very light so you may go down into screen rather than across to the desired one.  Still I would recommend this app.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|I am putting forth this review at a great risk of literary blasphemy. But then, it is true from my point of view. To me it was quite bland. I probably have never had the opportunity to live in the IN crowd which makes the characters of this book and thus could not identify. But then I never have been a sailor, still liked Heart of Darkness and never have been a Doctor, but did like Razor's Edge of Maugham. Maugham also wrote simple sentences but did not miss a metaphor which looked forward to jump into a story. Hemingway was like being on a salad diet, zealously guarded any kind of ornamental feel which might sneak into the words. The story did not carry one anywhere, but rather felt like a travelogue in which characters swiftly fall in and out of love, slept together, slept late and did not sleep. Guess it reflects about the time when we started considering any adultery, promiscuity a sign of freedom. It is not easy to like a story which doesn't align with your ideas and you search for reasons for the divergent view and if you find none, you are lost. Same with me, could not know, why Brett, a divorcee kept moving from one lover to other and why Jake kept on facilitating the same. For me, an OK only read.
1781162646|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that Stephen King is one of the great writers of our age.  There is good reason why his works are so popular.  He simply writes exceptionally well and he has a great range of knowledge and interests. Leonard Bernstein once said of Beethoven's music that each following note always sounded \\"right.\\"  Kings prose is much the same, it always reads well because it sounds \\"right.\\"  In this book, King follows his interest in the carnival life.  I venture to say that we all think the carny life is something mysterious and apart.  He introduces us to the carny experience through his protagonist who gets a summer job at a southern amusement park. Introducing a mysterious murder at the park in years past and the natural curiosity of college age youngsters and a story is born.  Someone has said this is a \\"coming of age\\" novel and it could be that too.  It is well-written and engrossing as many of King's books are. It is a very good read and I cannot recommend it more highly.  (P.S. Even though I have a Kindle, I was happy to buy and read this book in paperback. I found space for it on the \\"King\\" shelves of my bookcase where it resides with \\"Carrie\\" through \\"11/22/63.\\")
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This series is based upon a totally new and fresh concept, showing the stories behind the scenes of putting on a Broadway play. The actors/actresses and acting are superb and the stories are very realistic.

B00846REIS|5.0|Just read this book for the second time. Getting ready to 're-read book 2. I wanted to refresh my memory of the plot and characters before starting the long awaited book 3. This series is a great one, filled with hot scenes. Gideon and Eva are dynamic together. They are so in love with one another and so completely messed up that this story keeps your interest.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I love Gideon & Eva. Such a powerful story. Raw emotion, sizzling scenes and an amazing story. Now I have retread the first two books I can't wait to see how their story ends. A must read!
B002APU580|1.0|There are so very many things wrong with this incarnation of the novel that it is difficult to know where to start. Austen's classic is butchered and it's wretched carcass thrown to the crows in this miscast and poorly directed adaptation. Avoid.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I've always been a big Tarantino fan. This movie doesn't disappoint. The music is brilliant and the fight scenes are amazing. (Kiddo taking on the Crazy 88's!) If you don't shy away from blood, rage, revenge, dramatic heroines, and the like, take this movie for a spin. You'll probably be glad you did.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I don't normally write Amazon reviews, but for some reason I feel compelled to do so with this book. First off, the reason for my 2 star review isn't that the trilogy has been turned into a quintet. That's fine, stuff happens and it just may be that as a writer you've found new and creative things to add to the mix. But this? This I don't understand. If you're going to extend this into the series, then at least make each and every installment worth it, don't just turn in a subpar excuse for a book. Give us something meatier, more full-filling than this obvious \\"filler\\" chapter.<br /><br />There was so much meandering, so many secondary characters cluttering the narrative, that I can honestly say this story lacked focus. It read like a \\"day in the life\\" of Eva Tramell, which had its interesting parts, but it's tedious parts as well. (I got up, dressed in this, saw the receptionist, went to lunch with so and so... came back, had sex with Gideon... he looks hot in that suit...) come on, make each every word WORTH reading it, don't just toss in a bunch of things because you are so sure the reader is going to hang on every word just because you're the one writing it. That's just arrogant.<br /><br />I am not completely slamming the book, it DOES have it's good things. First of all, Sylvia Day's writing style is what rescues this from being a total train wreck. Her prose is both rich and descriptive, and YES, the sex scenes are extremely well done. That's clearly her forte. Storytelling? not so much. Her narrative is long-winded and rambling. This book really read like a long rambling episode and her storytelling is oddly anticlimactic at times. There's a certain sluggishness to it. But if you like well written books that come off very professional in this day of badly written self-published titles, you'll find merit in this.<br /><br />I'll finish with this though, there really is no excuse for such a unsatisfying ending. Perhaps this book could have been better had the story been longer, but no, she chooses to end it with a \\"non-ending\\". THAT is what makes this reek of greed and money-grabbing scheme. And don't sit there and say that there was no other way, because that is simply not true. Entwined With You is only a meager 105k novel, which is seriously shorter than the 159k of Fifty Shades Darker. Fifty Shades Freed is even longer than that, over 170k words. Both the 2nd and 3rd installment in the Fifty Shades trilogy were longer and offered more full-bodied stories than this third installment of the Crossfire series. Why couldn't Entwined be longer? It could have been, but author and publisher chose to print off as little as they could get away with. Worst of all, they chose the worst possible route to publishing this third book (constant push-back dates) and then take the arbitrary, inconsiderate decision, to extend this by 2 more books without caring about the overall quality of this one. Epic fail. Honestly, the only reason I'm not flying off the handle is because I borrowed this book. Had I dished 10 bucks for this, I'd be livid.story been longer, but no, she chooses to end it with a \\"non-ending\\". THAT is what makes this reek of greed and money-grabbing scheme.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|a top-40 hit that is actual music - there is hope for popular culture yet with this lively dance track.  Sure they're saying &#34;get lucky&#34; but it's not a lyrical raunch fest,  nor a chord-free pounding rap fest void of any melodic content.<br /><br />A fun & infectious track.  Buy it if for no other reason than so music companies get the idea people want this kind of music - & will sign artists that do more of it!  :)
B001DM1VXE|1.0|As a lover of math, I was hoping to see a thriller connected intimately to the well-known irrational constant. A rational hope smashed into uncountably many pieces. There was no depth of mathematical content to keep the mathematician interested, and the overall plot left this viewer completely unsatisfied.  Wasn't this Aranofsky's (sp?) first effort?  I hope so.  Maybe math is just not his thing.

B00D6BQPMM|2.0|I liked the special effects, but did not like what the picture was about.  Too much of what I saw I could not believe.  I did not  like either of the two leading characters portrayed.<br /><br />I only watched it because it was recommended by someone who I like and respect.  She said the beginning of the picture was so funny that she couldn't imagine anyone who would not get a good laugh out of it.  It didn't have that effect on me.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Ok should I even begin by saying how big a rip off this is from 50 Shades!!  With that said I barely made it past the first few chapters of the first book; however, I usually like to know how a book ends even if its horrible because I want to believe the ending will bring it all together.....well considering there is not even an ending to this book you can only imagine how disappointing.  I realize sylvia day made need the break to read 50 shades again to \\"imagine\\" how these books will end but SERIOUSLY!  I made it through all 3 books because I grew to know Eva and now this.. Needless to say this is the last time I pay my hard earned money for this \\"trilogy\\".....UGH FRUSTRATED!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I read this book switching back and forth from the hardcopy to the ebook. There were no errors, it read exactly the same, never lost my place in the book.
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|I wish that I had watched the movie before reading the book series. While the movie was good, and I know that an entire book can't be in a movie, key characters were left out. Other than that, the movie was good.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|I was excited about this moving coming out on DVD.  I have not read the book but was intrigued by the trailers.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />I kept waiting for the moment when these characters and stories came together in the momentous &#34;a-ha&#34;, but it never came.  The language in the most future scenes was annoying.  Visually it was beautiful, but not enough to make up for the confusion.  I felt like I really had to work to make sense of it all.  Perhaps I chose the wrong time to watch it, but this was not touted as a really intellectual film.<br /><br />I am a bit curious about the book and wonder if it all comes together better in written form, but with limited time and other books on the shelves waiting to be read, I am not optimistic about reading it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this one as well as the first two.  I don't understand why everyone is complaining about the series continuing.  Seriously???? I LOVE the fact that this wasn't the last one!!!  I am not ready to be done with Gideon and Eva and you should all be happy there's going to be more.  The book wasn't dull or boring at any point.  If anything I kept thinking to myself... WTH else can go wrong for these two!  But then if all went right, it would be boring.  That's what drew us all into this series, the EXCITEMENT and lets not forget the smokin' hot sex! Sylvia, you cannot write fast enough for me! Keep up the great work and I'll be waiting for number 4!!!!

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was upset to see all the bad reviews but I ignored it and wanted to judge the book myself. I have never written a review on anything but this book pissed me off so much I had to write a review. I felt like Silvia Day ran out of ideas and was milking this \\"TRILOGY\\".. There was no plot.. no climax.. no nothing. It was basically a recap of book 1-2. Waited a long time to read this book, and was rewarded with such disappointment not just at the book but the author for pulling this kind of stunt. I feel like she slapped her fans in the face with this junk just to make more money. Ms. Day, you do not piss off the people who are supporting you.. bad idea.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|Well written, well acted and not too many legal errors.  It's LA Law with a little soap opera thrown in.
B004YM6JLO|3.0|When I found this series I was thrilled. I had followed True Blood until half way through the forth season when I said enough is enough. I watched Twilight up until the last movie when it just got bizarre. I was hoping this series would be different than the others--more captivating with less gratuitous sex and teenage drama. And it was in the first two seasons. It was by far the best vampire series I had seen. But then by the third season it began to get old and weird.<br /><br />The plot was advancing and then digressing as it traveled in circles to the point that I said enough already. Elana and Stephan are following the same path as Sookie and Bill in True Blood. They love each other so much that one cannot live with out the other, and then they are cool. She finds herself attracted to his vampire brother, and then she's back hot for Stephan, but he doesn't want her. Oh wait, yes he does, but she is not sure about him. Klaus is evil and then he isn't. We have to kill the originals, and then when we have them, we let them go because we can't kill them without hurting our friends. There was so much back and forth with all of this that my brain got whiplash watching it. If the fourth season follows down this path, then just like True Blood and Twilight, I'm done.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I love Lee Child's, &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; and was very pleased with Tom Cruise as a slightly shorter &#34;Reacher&#34;  I hope he makes more and they become a new franchise for Tom Cruise like &#34;Mission Impossible&#34; did
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is interesting! I haven't ever gotten a zoo game before so I can't compare it to any of them. But this is the only one I would want to play! It's amazing.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|A great read and commentary on world events. An eye opener that is perplexed by current events and the struggle for power.
B00114RKT8|3.0|Okay plot, with great supporting cast.  Generally just like Amastad, but has some really good dialogue, cast moves the film, not the actual story.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Use of two of my favorite software 'products' in one story<br /><br />  +plus<br /><br />just about every computer in the story is made by Apple<br /><br />  +plus<br /><br />based, here, in the SF Bay Area<br /><br />  +plus<br /><br />the story had a nice amount of historical fiction and mystery<br /><br />  +plus<br /><br />a really cool bookshop<br /><br />  +plus<br /><br />boobs<br /><br />  =means<br /><br />this book hit so many of my sweet spots it is hard to be objective. I loved it.<br /><br />  !however<br /><br />I now feel my technical skills are inadequate, I need to get better at 3D programming (better? maybe 'started' would be a more correct word here). Does anyone have any good books to recommend in the area of 3D programming?
B00AG297GK|4.0|better than i expected. great comparison to the american govt. makes you think. a few sex scenes so not for the young.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|I'm not sure if this book reminded more of DaVinci Code or Forrest Gump.<br /><br />The similarity with DaVinci code was that the plot twisted and turned so many times and in so many ways that I felt the twists and turns were random unconnected events that I could not possibly foresee. No seeds were planted to link the plot twists to earlier points in the story.<br /><br />I felt with the tale of Forrest Gump echoes the way the main 100 yo character in this story seemed to be living his adult life. Namely both lived in a zany, random and high impact way.<br /><br />I read the book, enjoyed the book but felt no emotional connection with the story or the characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is one of the greatest and most succsessfull games of all time. its very fun. love survival mode for a challenge
B004FOA84A|1.0|I expected quite a bit more from this game.  Although the rooms and the items were interesting.... which they should be... it was VERY short.  Better choices out there
B00563M11M|3.0|My favourites are the Watchmen novels, but this one disappointed me a bit - the narration is somewhat long and tedious, Pratchett goes into details everywhere, the inner monologues felt a bit boring... so I was a bit disappointed. It still has some of the humour and the unusal charm, but is a bit less well-written than the previous novels. Fans will appreciate it still, but don't let this be your entry-novel into the Discworld.
B002Z0TPFE|3.0|Enjoyable but not great. Like to concept but starches too far without the CGI to back it up. Got to like the Eiffel tower having a bad day.
B000YPUFAG|5.0|Great collection must have. My PSP now has all the volumes for the Resident Evil Movie Series. Love Milla Jovovich here and in the Fifth Element. Love the UMDs that Sony has created which makes them unique.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It's a good quick read, but there was no ending.  Will be hard to wait another year to pick up the same storyline again.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Beautiful settings and music.  A fine addition to any Les Mis fans collection! Voices are believable for the roles they play.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I've had my pair of PX21's for just about 3 years now. It's seriously been one of the better headsets I've used and experienced on PSN, Xbox Live, and my PC. There are some small flaws, but we'll get to that later. Right now, the good;<br /><br />* Comfy fit. They are a bit smaller (40mm) but with a wide cup it should sit just fine. I have a bit of a bigger head, so if you're average it should be great.<br /><br />* Very clear mic. If anything, sometimes it can be a bit too sensitive but that can be adjusted (and for last second measures, easily muted).<br /><br />* A bit on the light side, very easy to maneuver around if needed.<br /><br />* Volume controls are easy to remember and access. A big plus is that volumes can be adjusted individually, I didn't think this was a feature but I've had a headset lately that demands one slider be up for the other to function.<br /><br />Some flaws;<br /><br />* After time, the mic can come down away from where you had it positioned. It might be too heavy for it's own covering and after about 30 minutes of playtime suddenly you'll realize why you are quiet and will have to adjust again.<br /><br />* Build quality isn't amazing. After about a year of use both ends were you can lay the cups sideways had broken off - thankfully some hot glue and electrical tape solved that issue.<br /><br />After about three years use, I finally have to say goodbye to the headset and hadn't known or been able to appreciate how great it actually was until recently buying a new one. If you can or are looking, get a pair of these and take care of them.
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|Song for Zula alone is a great reason to buy this album, but there are lots of great songs on it.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|This is a paid app. Usually that means I don't have to look at ads or give up my private information. But this app keeps adding more &quot;features&quot; that devalue the &quot;I already bought this&quot; factor, like more ads, additional in-app purchases, and these features bloat the app and interrupt gameplay. I'm disappointed, because I really like all the games I've played from Halfbrick. I uninstalled it today.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|soo it looks pretty cool but, it slows down my whole kindle.every single game, movie, even this ...just writing this reveiew was...IS really hard!!! listen to the reveiews!!!IT PROBILLY ...WHAT AM I SAYING ...IT IS A VIRUS!!!!!!!!!!!!DONT GET IT!!!!!
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Bruce Willis should be ashamed of himself. Very poor story with a predictable ending. It gives a bad name to the franchise.
B000OVLINI|5.0|It is beautifully written, with humor and suspense.  I think it is a wonderful read!  Have trouble putting it down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The 0.7.0 update is amazing. Finally spawn eggs and buckets! I'm gonna build a nether reactor and fight zombie big man, and get gold bigots! GO MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|If you like James Bond then this book is for you. Also, if you like World War 2 or just entertaining thrillers in general. It's a real page turner. I loved the detailed descriptions, especially the way the author describes the fashions of the era. The Nazi characters were really well drawn. I would like to have seen more of the romance between Ian Fleming and the French resistance girl. She was probably my favorite character. I won't spoil it but the twist halfway through the book worked brilliantly. I didn't see it coming and it made the second half of the book very suspenseful. This is a perfect beach read or airplane flight read. I recommend it to anyone who likes crisp prose, action, history and a little romance rolled into one.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Its not as jaw dropping and action packed as the first 2 books.....but I still like it... I am not finished with the book, so I'm still hoping it will get better.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I finished this book feeling punished. Where's the ending? Unfortunately I will never find it because I will not be paying $9.99 each for the next two books.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|great game.  The grandsons play the game every time they come to the house.  There are good graphics and it is not violent, which is really good.  Thank you for making a fun game.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Enjoyed learning something about the man and his relationship with his wife.<br />I always loved his movies and got scared everytime I watched them; especially<br />The Birds as a kid I still don't trust them flying around me. HA!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I can normally predict what's going to happen during a mystery thriller, but I've been on the edge of my seat since the first episode.  I'm very impressed how they were able to take a series of books and movies and integrate them into a television series that melds beautifully.  Good job!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I did finish the book, but was not happy about it.  I thought the whole story was ridiculous and frustrating to read.  I would never recommend it to anyone!
B005D0RDO8|5.0|The Duke, the Magistrate, the Bishop, and the President... How could men so high up in society stoop so low as to become libertines, torture their own daughters, and torture a gang of children? How could the soldiers who swore to protect their country join in and torture those who they are supposed to protect? Whether it's Sal&ograve; or the the incident in Cleveland, we are constantly reminded how there are those in this world who will commit these terrible atrocities. This is a fine film and a true test of one's own moral compass. Don't be a libertine! Fight for the right!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Added the Ka-Bar Becker BK2 Campanion Fixed Blade Knife to my hiking and camping gear. Knife functions in many different functions.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I find this to be Tom Cruise's best work.  I hope he can take what he had here into further movies.  Then I could enjoy them more.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Ok so i was looking for a good read with some naughty parts in it, found this, started reading and was hooked. I could not put it down. It blew me away!! I almost cried at the end! Its not exactly a porn book, but its an actual good novel with a great story. What i mean by its not a porn book is that there's only a few sex scenes and they aren't very long. I expected more of that but the fact that the story was so good made me keep reading. Love it love it love it!
1575666286|5.0|I was told about this author and wanted to know more.  I have done juicing but this explains things in greater detail.  I will be using some of the information.  I know I won't be able to do all of it because of my lifestyle but it is a good book for reference.  I believe what is written.  There are answers for people who don't want to take pills and be more holistic in their healthcare.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I think it is really great how it tells me how much time is left to play my games and lots more and also like the 3D battery that it shows.I&lt;3 BATTERY PRO.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Not much of a &#34;teen pop&#34; fan, but I bought this for my daughter and actually like it :) Better than her previous CD's.
B00992CF6W|5.0|fun, overall great game. Only issue is updates on our android tablets through our Amazon account. Google items prompt auto updates.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Although I love the book...it really angers me that there is more to come. I feel that the store is very drawn out and at this point, how many more books will there be?
0812971825|5.0|I am reading all these reviews: did all you folks with the abundant generalities, miss the maddeningly main point here?  THE MINISTER KILLS HIS WIFE!<br /><br />Tyler leaves the sleeping pills on the night stand (she had been trying to get at them), goes downstairs to visit with his mother for two hours and comes back up stairs to find his wife, Lauren, dead from an overdose.<br /><br />Did you all read this here book?
B000VHPXR2|5.0|I have always loved this show, and love the fact that the movie soundtrack includes stuff not in the original Broadway show.  I have seen this show a couple of times, and while they have always been good, they never really compare to either this, the movie soundtrack, or the original show.  You can't go wrong with this great recording of really one of the best from Andrew Loyd Weber and Tim Rice.
B001AQQR2S|2.0|I truly don't know why everyone else rated it so highly.  The story is steeped in abuse and the characters are creepy and, from what I could tell, there's simply nothing to enjoy.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie is so good!! It's worth a blind buy if you haven't seen it yet. The characters are outstanding, played by excellent actors and the story is less a cliched rom-com that the advertising led us to believe, and more about finding yourself and someone who can accept and love you for who you really are.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This version adds new challenges to previous versions of Quell.  If you liked those versions, you will love this one.
B00C9U9YOW|3.0|I'm relatively new to Queens of the Stone Age; I first heard Josh Homme's music in Them Crooked Vultures as he collaborated with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones. Liking what I heard, I started listening to the QotSA album Songs for the Deaf, and later Era Vulgaris and Rated R. I'll be honest; compared to those three albums, ...Like Clockwork seems meandering and boring. All the songs (with the exception of Smooth Sailing) seem pretty flat and lack variety/natural progression. Usually upon getting a new album, I enjoy listening to all the songs over and over, but I really don't feel that desire here. Personally, I don't feel this album brings anything new or interesting to the table. You may disagree, but for me, this was a disappointing buy.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I, like other reviewers, was waiting months for the release of this book. What a let down when I kept reading expecting things to start to resolve and they....didn't. Fluff and storyline I didn't care about for so much of the book.<br />Absolutely can't stand that what is supposed to be a three book series turned into a five book series. I will not be purchasing the next two and already returned this one for a refund. What a shame because the first two were so much better and I thought it would all come together in this book.<br />Sylvia Day - you could have finished the story properly and treated us to other books that delved into other characters instead of trying to make more money and cheat us.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Great series. DVD set was brand new in unopened original shrink wrap! What more could you want for the price!! very fast shipping
B00AK57N00|1.0|this is boguss stupeid i just hate it eww i think that if you bought this game you should say good bye it it
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I will talk about my shopping experience. WOW ! is all I can say. dvd was new in original wrapper at a great price. Super fast shipping.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Received series as a Mother's Day gift. The entire family is enjoying the series. Can't wait to see what happens next.
B00455IVHU|5.0|What a movie! Barbra Streisand is one of a kind and I appreciate her work and her talent! The movie is amazingly written, the acting is superb, and everything else in between is just great. I watched this movie as my Instant Movie as a new Prime member, it was worth it!!!!
B004HD61KE|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the Sigma force novels. Looking forward to more. Maybe Gray will find peace and love.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is something I'm sure Sir A. C. Doyle would have been proud of. It's not the original, but it surely captures its spirit. Benedict Cumberbatch brings the perfect amount of intensity, likability, annoyance, and irritation to the role. Martin Freeman is the perfect foil, for his intellect, and acts as the perfect stand-in for all of us. Although often befuddled, he is also essential, capable, and useful to both Holmes and the plot. If you love the originals, you'll love how they've worked in details from the canon. All in all, this is probably the best adaptation ever.
B00005JN0T|5.0|liked the actor and the storyline, plus the world needs to know that this is a possible future, that is if I can live to 2035!!
B00BDAP66E|5.0|This app makes tracking activity on multiple pages easy. Love it. Love the notifications as well. You have lots of info right at your fingertips.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Rather than sticking to the same tired formula, there were layers of different story lines: the angel of death, a mass murderer who skins and decapitates his victims, an asylum run by a heartless nun, an ambitious female reporter, demonic possession... They even managed to incorporate alien abduction into the plot without making it seem cheesy.<br />I really liked that they used some of the same actors from the first series. Jessica Lange was amazing in both and I enjoyed seeing Adam Levine in an acting roll.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|This was a good &#34;chick flick&#34;.  Had a good story behind it and the acting was good.  Not real suspenseful...
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Heard one of these songs on the radio and had to have it.  Did my search, found it and ordered it.  Had checked out a few tracks and decided to order the whole album
B0067R0APK|2.0|I like the older version better. I didn't mind scrolling for more information. Plus it was easier to see. The fonts now are way too small.
B00498YXG6|1.0|This was terrible. We liked the first one for fashion, New York and a good enough story line - this had none of the first film's charm. We watched it til the end hoping it would improve but no it actually got worse!!
B0058YPL66|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I started watching this series. It is well written with a new angle on all my favorite childhood stories.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Could be good if you're high, drunk, or better yet, dead.  Or blind.  And deaf. I had a better time during a root canal.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I learned after the First season that I couldn't just watch one season,  I had to watch all ten seasons, in fact , shyly, I admit that I watched the whole seriest three times in a row.  I don't know what I was doing when it was being aired on TV, but I am very pleasantly surprised from the story line and how well it is written and played by all the actors and etc. It was nice to get out of reality and into a fantasy world for awhile.
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|This is a marvellous finish to Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey tales, written in his very readable conversational style. Clarke is among the very best writers on the sci-fi scene. Like the rest of the series, it is a plausible and believable yarn.
B001CTDH76|3.0|I was not as thrilled watching the first season of The Mentalist, I will have to debate whether to buy more of the series.  I liked the idea and the elements it touches on, I liked the  actors in the series and believe that it probably gets better as it continues.  I was a bit bored with it, though, so maybe I will, or maybe I won't watch more of it.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I ENJOYED THE GAME VERY MUCH. ONCE I STARTED TO PLAY THE GAME I didn't PUT IT DOWN UNTIL I FINISHED THE WHOLE GAME
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|The Merlin Series plays the classic tale of Merlin and King Arthur with mystery and magic as it should and leaves the viewer wanting more. It is well written and played.  I will enjoy this series for many years to come.
0812983459|5.0|Lovely testament to hanging in there through all the transitions in our lives. A friend recommended it and now I'm doing the same.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|Not Disney's best but still cute and enjoyable to watch with the kids.  It was the first Disney movie my three year old would sit still through.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|What can one say about Casablanca.  It is a classic!  Everyone should own it.  I can't count the number of times I have watched it and I enjoy it each time.  They don't make movies like this anymore and it is a shame.  Not only do the stars put on an excellent performance but, the plot is wonderful as well.  The setting unmatched.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book beautifully captures all the insecurities, obstacles and challenges women face in the workplace. I constantly found myself thinking \\" I am so glad it's not just me\\" as I read through the book. It is so important  to know understand what external as well as personal internal factors hold us back. Reading this book has increased my confidence and courage to ask for and pursue what is required to advance my career
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like being able to tell what apps use the most.  that way I can put the ones I don't use often to my cloud.<br />That way my battery last longer.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|No empathy with Rooney Mara's character.  Did not care what happened to these characters.  Best think about it is Jude Law but its not enough.
1416914307|2.0|In this third installment of the Mortal Instrument series Clary needs to travel to the City of Glass to save her dying mother. That is about it.<br /><br />The characters, THE CHARACTERS!!!!!<br /><br />They all just keep getting worse and the plot isn't even redeeming them! I am getting through these because I am magically hoping the Dark Artifices trilogy is going to be as good as Internal Devices and I simply HATE reading books out of their supposed order.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Awesome book! Never wanted to put it down. Can't wait to read the whole series! Highly recommend for anyone who loves lord of the rings and similar books. Very enjoyable!
0385738757|3.0|The second book in this series left me more frustrated than the first! I wanted more answers and I was rewarded with almost nothing. The saving grace in this book for me was the interactions between the characters; it was amazing to see how the friendships developed and how bond can increase the will to live despite everything.
B00CX1TSSO|3.0|I saw this movie in the Theater with my kids. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the movie so much. I don't see why this movie is getting bad reviews? It's a kids/family movie. It not Shakespeare, it's an enjoyable change to a classic. The actors are great and the plot was pretty good.  I always find it crazy that horrible films with no plot and horrible actors makes tons of money but films dedicated to entertain our children in a wholesome fashion gets bad remarks? I can grasp it. At any rate if you have a kid around 8 up I think he/she will enjoy it. The only set back is it was a bit long. Other than that sit back and enjoy your family flick.
0385738773|2.0|Disappointing. That is pretty much all I have to say for this book without giving it away. I was overly unenthusiastic about how the characters had become, especially towards one another. And DON'T even get me started with the ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friend Tomas has a Google tablet he got the update  0&middot;7&middot;1 on Google play store  for minecraft I've tried to turn it of but I still have 0&middot;6&middot;1  I also  tried Google play store but it does not support this device . I hope they put an update in the Appstore. Other then that I think minecraft is great you should get it.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|just started really enjoying this game when an update took away all the free fun stuff and now you need real money. the old &quot;bait and switch&quot;.
1934030597|5.0|Great book. Had an old bike serviced at the dealer. Was told to consider new shifters. Zinn showed me how to align my jockey wheels. Bike works fine now. A must have for any bike owner.
B00280LYIC|4.0|The format is easy to read.<br />I am reading it to help a non-native English speaker,<br />so that is helpful.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. It's a challenge but once u get the hang of it it's addictive and habit forming. I have been playing daily for months now and have met some great people.
B0097AX6EQ|5.0|A great account of flying huey's in vietnam. Shows how many reluctant volunteers were thrown into a terrible situation over there.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nalini has done it again. A beautiful and complex love story that grips you from page one and won't let go. If you like to read a story that completely transports you to another world then this book is for you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am not one to spend my money on apps or games but I am glad I bought this game. Very well designed; the graphic was superb, the storyline was engaging, and the puzzles kept me busy. This game makes you think and try different things to open the box, which opens up other secret compartments, which has little gadgets or keys that you need to open up another compartment.<br /><br />I am looking forward to more of this game! Great job, developers!
B0050KEVO6|4.0|The game is nice if you want to kill some time or play something that is more casual. However it is very addicting which is why I gave it 4 stars rather then 5.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|UNLESS THIS GOOD ACTOR JUST TOTALLY BLOWS IT I WILL ALWAYS RATE TOM SELLECK MOVIES AT THE TOP.  HES A FAVORITE.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|What an amazing book. A lot of mystery, you will enjoy it and is going to keep you reading until you are done
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This app is definitely better than the built-in camera of the Kindle.  I haven't had a chance to use all the features yet, but it looks promising.  I love the video part of this app, but its too bad that there isn't a way to see what you are taking a picture of; a view finder.
B00465I17E|5.0|Extremely well written and well acted.  A lesser-known Denzel Washington film but nevertheless I highly recommend it.  It deals with much more than just debating.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I have read Kite Runner thrice and seen the movie twice. This book is a disappointment for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. It tries to relive the emotional pain associated to Kite Runner Geographic setting but fails to draw out the intensity<br /><br />2. Too predictable in the way the book is laid out<br /><br />3.looks like the editor worked more on this than the write because everyplace the story falls shy of bold and creative...whether it be a character or a place, a story or emotion...making the book lukewarm...<br /><br />Wonder about how this book would read in its unedited original flow...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|SUBWAY SERFER.  We have not had it on the kindel very long and all the grandchildren love to play it.  They range from.  6 to 13.  It. Is fun to watch them play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching the show because I heard it was good. I got my husband to watch an episode with me and now we're both hooked.. I can't wait for the new season.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Love this album, brings me back to a time when there were no computers in everyhome or cell phones in everyhand. Just 8 track tapes and record players.. Love this music..
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a good book. This final installment had a few good twists. Great story. I did not expect certain things to happen.
B00AVPYT8I|2.0|I find that I don't use this app. Kinda of useless. I never did find free ebooks. will delete from kindle.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Really loved this game. Great ho/adventure game. Has a good story line and great puzzles to solve. I do wish that it had more levels to conquer but it was still worth the price.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|We are on the fast diet and can see the results -It is the most logical way ot losing some extra weight
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|The movie portrays addiction in a real and powerful way.  Denzel Washington did his homework and gave a stellar performance...as usual!
B00000JFV9|5.0|Recently acquired the Rhino re-issue of Curtis Mayfield's brilliant soundtrack to Superfly.  Wow.  Sound quality of this re-issue is superb, and thank goodness, because this is a wonderfully constructed masterpiece.  The arrangements run the gamut from proto-disco with a real string section, to very sparse songs with just percussion, bass, and vocals.  This soundtrack was rightly called \\"The Black Sgt. Pepper's\\" by the director of Rhino Records.  Sadly musician credits are not provided, but a gifted multi-instrumentalist, much of what you hear is probably Curtis Mayfield playing.  After several listenings more and more really wonderful passages and arrangements become apparent.  I became familiar with the song \\"Freddie's Dead\\" from a really intense cover by the Fishbone, fantastic artists in their own right.  But now having heard[[ASIN:B00123NNIU Superfly (LP Version)]] the original version of \\"Freddie's Dead\\" I have to admit the cover pales in comparison to the original version.  If you have not heard this recording you really must check this one out. It is a masterwork of tremendous importance, clearly serving as huge influence in the worlds of soul, funk, and yes, even disco.  After finally discovering this recording for myself, I did some research and realize now what an important figure Curtis Mayfield was in the 60's and 70's, being one of the first major artists to infuse his music with messages about racial inequality and very penetrating social commentary.  You hear it all through Superfly.  Superfly does not glorify the the ghetto hustler and pusher, in fact this soundtrack is a scathing criticism of the ghetto drug culture.  I will be digging deeper into the Curtis Mayfield legacy.  I cannot imagine what else lies buried in that body of work.  If it even approaches the quality of Superfly it will be well worth having.  If you appreciate jazz, soul, funk, or just really great musicianship this is something you simply must have in your collection.  It is one of those rare recordings I would label \\"Essential\\".  If you appreciate any of those genres I listed, this is Essential.
0321704452|5.0|Garr Reynolds packs this little book (200 pages or so) with so much compelling advice you will find yourself returning to it again and again.  While there is no doubt anyone who follows his suggestions will be a better presenter the added bonus is being better equipped to deal with people in all situations.  My copy is getting all dog-eared from re-reading and should just come with every sentence pre-highlighted for the convenience of the reader.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Very good. Couldn't put it down. Makes you want to keep going and solve. Worth the money to keep going. Can't wait for the next one.
B000SEKNUK|5.0|In this wonderful book Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander present real-world instruction on how to reconstruct perception of life in ways that bring more joy to our own lives and those with whom we interact.  It is an uplifting and entertaining read that will have you posting notes to yourself like &#34;Toes to Nose&#34; and &#34;It's All Invented&#34; as reminders to keep their ideas top of mind. Keep it handy for a dose of possibility thinking whenever you need it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the book, Can't wait to read the next one. I'm liking better than the first one, that's for sure.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It is really fun but I have to pay for it I got it for fun so I'm kinda upset
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Very entertaining. I look forward to watching the other seasons.<br /><br />Truly shoes what teenagers go through daily...although I must say I don't remember \\"making out\\" that much at 15
B007I0K672|5.0|Everyone has general assumptions about intelligence and talent.  Carol Dweck divides these assumptions into two categories.  A fixed mindset believes characteristics are static, inherent, and permanent.  A growth mindset believes these same characteristics are expandable, moldable, and variable.  With persistence and effort, people can continue to increase their intelligence, talent, and skills.  Being aware of these assumptions is important but how we use that knowledge can have a profound impact on others.<br /><br /> The information presented in this book is helpful for any individual but is vital for teachers, coaches, parents, and anyone who influences others.  We all like to receive compliments about the job we are doing.  However, if the compliments we receive are all about the incredible score, wonderful presentation, great organization, or nice job we did, we may be afraid that when we aren't as successful, we aren't any good or are no longer valuable.  The reality is that we are all going to make mistakes.  That is part of learning.  It is impossible to get better at something without accepting the many mistakes that happen during the process of getting better.<br /><br /> When we compliment others, what we say can reinforce a fixed perspective or encourage continued effort.  Telling someone how smart they are may lead them to focus on grades and develop a fear of making mistakes.  On the other hand, telling someone how much their hard work and effort contributed to their success will encourage continued practice, persistence, and growth.<br /><br /> Carol Dweck provides multiple stories and examples from education, business, sports, and families of the growth versus fixed mindset.  It is written with simplicity so that it can be easily understood.  A person wanting more of the research behind what she is saying would benefit from searching out some of her other writings and journal articles.
0688152023|3.0|I am a dancer and dance instructor.  I bought this to gain some new ideas to help with flexibility and found a lot of exercises I already knew.  This book may be very helpful for less experienced dancers.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I'm not really into bloons TD but I saw my friend play it and it was good so get this game now
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are hard to put down.  Very well written and fantastic storyline.  These are meant for young adult readers but as an adult I still found them very enjoyable.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I think it was phenomenal I haven't seen the movie but I don't think they could capture how good it is
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I love the previous books and I felt that this was a bit of a let down. Despite having all my favorite characters in this book I found most of their stories very boring and stagnate with the exception to Arya's story.  The ending was pretty surprising though and I hope that the next book resolves some things and is a bit more exciting.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Its good it made me and my friends get to play somethig together<br />I would rate this game 5 star its like torchlite
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I started reading these books shortly after seeing the first season of the HBO series.  They did a fantastic job following the first book.  As the series goes on I have appreciated the small differences between the series and the books.  George R.R, Martin does a very good job of developing characters and then killing them off so be warned.  Even with that said he writes in a way that keeps you wanting more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great. I love it. I wish the new update that came on my iPod came on my kindle but its a great game (:
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Similar to 20 questions.  I know it's all science and mathamatics but I'm amazed at how he comes up with the answers.  And I'm not talking about the obvious one like Harry Potter but real old, off the wall characters.  Anybody remember Wonderbug?  It's fun at parties and can even be used to break the ice when trying to pick up girls.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|I often think that I want to be a writer like Malcolm. Tons of research that is converted into a simple to understand story used to elucidate his point. I reference his stories almost each day to proof my point to friends - That I'm smarter than they are.  Sometimes it works. Blink is a wonderful and fast read, you'll be smarter when you're done. Love you, Malcolm.  I want you to hear it first from me!
B00632HWOG|1.0|Kept freezing. Not easy to navigate through. How does one even sign out? Not worth the hassle. Why make an app that's not user friendly?
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So I was going to buy what was supposed to be book three in a trilogy but based on the fact there are more negative than positive reviews and I don't like soap opera's.  I will pass until Sylvia gets it together and gives Gideon and Eva closure.
B001NLKS16|5.0|If you are not a huge fan of Supernatural then this is probably not the book for you. I on the other hand loved it! I have always wanted to read THE JOURNAL and I have to say this book lived up to everything I could have wanted it to.  This is a must buy for any huge Supernatural fan!!!
B001NA6096|5.0|This was my third viewing--te first two many years ago. It stands up over time and culture changes. I like it en better than I remembered.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|A good fiction. It keeps your interest in the most unbelievable and believable circumstances. Lots of mystery and trying to determine who all are the good guys.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|My second viewing. When this was released @ 9 years ago, I re-watched Before Sunrise before seeing it. Now, I've again watched the first two films to prepare for part 3--Before Midnight.<br /><br />Charming and captivating. Love comparing the two characters to their younger selves. Looking forward to the middle-aged versions.<br /><br />Love the diaolgue,and this time we get Paris as a backdrop.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You ever watch Heartland on the CBC? It`s kind of like that. You`'ll be a horse whisperer in no time.
B0081336FO|5.0|Intriguing, very entertaining. I like to try and solve the mystery before the answer is revealed. Exceptional writing for television today.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome book as were the first two in the series. Very much looking forward to the next one. I love Eva and Gideons story
B0009HAHD4|5.0|I purchased this because my Nikon D5200 didn't come with an eyecup. At first I wasn't sure if it would fit, but I took at chance. And I'm so happy I did, it fits perfectly. Also its an original Nikon part at a good price.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This was an amazing book,and I loved it very very much. It was one of the best books I have ever read!  ;  )
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really like this game. I actually bought a family pack ($3.99) and I NEVER buy in game products, but I REALLY wanted to have more options to complete levels. It's very fun, a bit addicting and actually relaxing (the music). The game gives lots of information on sea life and the coral reef, nice touch of education without being too scholarly or boring.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Special effects and storyline are great 3D aspect was ok.  Well worth the sale price.  Ironman really made the movie shine.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|An insightful and entertaining as well as descriptive fictional but realistic account of a part of the world few Americans know. Realistic accounting of a current day problem with terrorism and Al Qaida following the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole.<br />A bit overloaded with cute John Corey quips. These became distracting to an otherwise good story. The resolution of the treachery so carefully set up in the plot was definitely inadequate.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game my sis and I both I laugh wene she dies but other wise it is a treat game
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|since your only limits the amount of money(seeds) you can get and the number of builders you have you can technically play a lot longer than games the expend energy points.  It is fun to play and has an interesting PvP feature as well.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|It is 1952, in a small village in Afghanistan.  Abdullah and his sister Pari live with their father, stepmother and baby stepbrother.  Abdullah raised Pari when their mother died in childbirth and the two are extremely close.  In the afterword, Hosseini mentions that the title for the book was inspired by this phrase in a poem by William Blake: \\"The little ones lept, and shouted, and laugh'd/and all the hills echoed\\".  However this idyllic upbringing is soon to be abruptly ended.<br /><br />This is quite a different book to [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]] and [[ASIN:B0084I2PEO A Thousand Splendid Suns]].  Whilst a large part of the book is set in Afghanistan, the impact of the Russian war and the Taliban's rule is only peripheral to the narrative.  This is a smaller book, about family relationships.  Again and again, we explore the relationships between children and their parents, whether the children are biological or adopted, whether the adoption is known or a secret.  And yet, while the stories are intimate, the story spans 60 years and the terrain is epic, moving from the Middle East to Europe to the US and back again.  The book begins and ends with Abdullah and Pari, but in between the stories will encompass characters as diverse as a Bosnian nurse, an American doctor, a French poet, a Greek housewife and an Afghan warlord.  All are connected - sometimes closely, sometimes remotely - to the central story.  Many characters will face difficult ethical dilemmas and sometimes they respond in ways that surprise the readers.<br /><br />Hosseini is a born storyteller.  I found it near impossible to put the book down, although I deliberately slowed my pace as the end neared, just to make it stretch longer.  And the ending made me cry, which almost never happens when I am reading.  So many of the characters are embedded in my heart now.  It is a book about caring for others, whether they are blood relatives or not, and about the enduring connections of family.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun to play for all ages. You can sit down with a parent or child and they'll have fun regardless.
B009NY43NY|3.0|A bit less exciting than the previous books. Somewhat disappointed. Was not the page turner I am used to in this series.
B000G24LZM|5.0|Timberlands are the best! Great fit and comfort! They are everything they say they are. I plan to order another pair for my son.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Works very well on my Kindle Fire hd. The best app for Facebook. Must sync it when you download it. Very happy with this app.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Arrived as described. Plays fine. No problems. DVD's were brand new. The trilogy was offered at an excellent price when compared elsewhere.
B00847KFDS|4.0|Some really great arrangements and duets - not fond of the Miranda Lambert song.  Her voice doesn't appeal to me
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|this movie was pretty good. it could have been alot worse and more entertaining then I thought it would be.<br />the story line was interesting and the characters held my attention. I thought it would be a B type movie of this genre but it is more of an A-/B+. anyone who likes a witchy storyline will find this captivating enough to watch and rent.<br /><br />I wish they would have explored the house a bit more, as old southern plantation homes hold a certain thrill for me. the interior set decoration of the house was way  over the top and it sort of ruined the mood that was trying to be set, but I understand what they were trying to do. I just think they failed, in that regard.<br /><br />good cast of actors.... top notch in their field.... would have loved to see more of them.<br /><br />all in all.... a nice rainy afternoon witch type film.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Overall, this is a good production of Martin's books and for the most part stays true to the events depicted in them. Since Martin is a \\"co-executive producer,\\" that might explain why. Peter Dinklage as Tyrion and Jack Gleeson as Joffrey are two great character picks. They play their parts well. Gleeson is convincing as a wannabe tyrant/spoiled brat/bully/coward and Dinklage is convincing as the sly, manipulative dwarf who manages to survive against all odds. Some of the settings are impressive and close to what I imagined them to be in the books. This is a must-see series.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Actually I find this app to be very useful. It helps remind me when I am getting near the end of my battery and as forgetful as I am sometimes, I need all the help I can get.  Thanks for creating this battery app.<br />June Saltiel
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|It's very much Willy!!  We enjoy it very much. He's still a great artist and put together a great album.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I'm writing this based on my grandkids.  They loved this movie and watched it a few times.  I came in on some of the scenes and could see where it would hold their interest and teach them a few things at the same time.  In my view, a good reason to get this movie!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|The &#34;tutorial&#34; in this game is awful. You are not sure what you should be doing so you just go around clicking  on land hoping yo are able to build a dinosaur habitat there.
B00C8SBNMG|5.0|While there is no denying the pedigrees of the musicians involved, it has groove. The wife and I needed some music to cover for our intimate time, we have kids and don't need them to hear our fun. I clicked on Epic Obsession by Burning Rain. The music is awesome. The songs are very well written. The blues rock groove they produce is almost hypnotic and very sexual. I have liked this album from the day I got it. After listening to it under the right circumstances I was inspired to review it. Buy it! You may not get sex, but you will hear it in this kick ass blues rock release!! Guaranteed not to disappoint!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Like the satellite tracking especially for bad weather. It is the best. You can not find better.Definitely my choice. Easy to follow.
B0010T7R5G|5.0|A Really Good What If Alien Movie.<br /><br />What If You Woke Up And Discovered Your World Is Not What You Thought.<br /><br />Think Matrix. Older Version.<br /><br />Excellent Mind Binder.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|99.9% of the time it guesses who you are thinking of. For you to defeat Akinator you have to think of a character that is off the wall. Have fun and share this app with your friends.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is an exciting, well-written book.  This is the kind of book I love to read.  Cheryl Strayed is a brave, sometimes fool-hardy woman.  She took risks with her life, trusted people I wouldn't have trusted, but if you're alone in the wilderness, I suppose you have to trust anyone who comes along.  I couldn't put it down!  That's the best thing I can ever say about a book.

B000I8ES2A|5.0|An Excellent Movie With A Strange Twist.<br /><br />I Love Armin Mueller-Stahl's Work In Movies.<br /><br />This Is A Movie To Buy, And Add To Your Collection.<br /><br />I Did !!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was just as good as the first one, I can't wait to read the third one. Loved it.
B00C32REYI|4.0|I love James Blakes approach to electronic music, not as overdone as most is. However, he needs to work on his songwriting. This album vocally gets quite boring after extended listening due to the monotony of the lyrics. He's lucky he's such a good producer because he's able to compensate for that with outstanding production.Hopefully, his next album will have more than two lines repeated endlessly every song.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|a great cd. it has all her great songs that made her big! I would recomend this cd for sure
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game will give you hours of fun. If you are a Mahjong junkie you won't be disappointed. Have fun.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|My husband, being an Air Force air traffic controller vet could explain a lot about the planes to our grandson, making it a good learning time as well. It also saved the cost of buying new RC planes when these crashed!  The crashes came often while learning.  The cost of buying new planes and helicopters is reasonable also.  Good game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is a great app to get. I use it all the time doing bills etc. Much better than a usual calculator. I always know where it is.
B00C2C637I|4.0|This book extended my vocabulary: I was regularly using the dictionary look-up feature on my Kindle for the words I didn't know.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Free app with good radar maps and forecasts.  Ads are a little annoying but hey they've got to pay the bills...
B004SBQGHS|3.0|This could just be me, but I feel like the resolution is faulty with the game playing on my HTC One.  Icons are tiny and difficult to read.  Gameplay seems fine.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app with many helpful things, you guys. I use it regularly. When I don't use it regularly, I wish I had.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like the game but am disappointed that I can only earn credits by posting on Facebook  and from what else I'm reading means I won't get far because I won't purchase anything. That's too bad because it is fun.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Thought this would be a typical college kids go to the boonies type of slasher movie but I totally underestimated this film.  If you can see past the over-the-top visual effects/gore, this is a terrific flick.  My husband and I laughed till we had tears in our eyes in parts where, in the midst of the dark horror of the action, a completely unexpected funny moment would happen.  This is NOT your typical horror movie!  Crazy, funny, clever.  We saw this elsewhere and had to purchase it so we could watch it again.
0679805273|5.0|This book will always be one of my favorites. Will give it as a present to anybody I want to think big!
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|With the upcomming monsters U my kids had to get the original.  Don't hesitate get yours worth it fr this one.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is one of those things that becomes addictive.  wonderful way to occupy free time. I am not a gamer but this one hooks you.

B000OIBY4Y|5.0|This and &#34;The Plague&#34; are two of my favorite books of all time. I Think plague is a little better, but this one is much simpler and by all means worth your time.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|Did not like that made up, baby talk language at all. Simply put, I do love movies like this. Made me think. Upset I rented it and not bought it from the start.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I was happy to find Season 3 on Amazon.com.  I recently became a fan of this series, watched the first season on Netflix, the second season I borrowed from a friend, and now, the 3rd season thanks to Amazon.  After watching this season, I will be ready for the new televised series which starts sometime late this year.  I like this story of the rich and famous, and the story of the people who serve them.....sort of like the old Upstairs, Downstairs, but that was a comedy, and this is definitely drama.  Some might call it a British soap opera, but it really has more depth than that. I am a fan!
B003YUQDFY|5.0|After reading the reviews regarding the fit of these shoes, I ordered a size larger than my usual tennis shoe with socks, size.  Mistake.  I had to send them back and order my regular size.  Otherwise, I liked the look of the shoe.  I now have my regular size, have worn the shoes, and find them very comfortable.  I could understand someone having trouble if they have a high instep.  I like them and will probably order them in a different color as well as the red I have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun,  I recamend  this to any one who likes tempal run. and even if you dont like tempal run its still a pretty fun game
B001974DG0|5.0|This was one of the first Koontz books I ever read. It is such a great story. I wish they would have made a movie that did it justice. Several attempts were made, but the story was never captured with the heart that was in the book. I have started writing and this is partly due to the wonderful journey this author provided with his countless stories.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is awesome because I've always dreamed of being a hair shop worker it looks fun to wash other people's hair
B001N3EZW2|5.0|this filmy has it all. handsome guy, beautiful girl way cool robot and deadly dangerous enemy.  space saucer is the bomb. well worth seeing. straight forward first class si fi the old school way!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great read.  Very enjoyable! I have read pretty incessantly.  Interesting theme and very well done.  I loved the movie too!
0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy<br />The book comes with a soft cover, since my wife is planing to read it at home, I do not think this will be a problem.
B00933JL0A|5.0|awesome game. relaxing game play. a lot of fun. need to update to the android version and keep expanding this desktop quality game.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I loved this game...it really made you think BUT it was waaay too short!  I would have given it 5 stars if it lasted more than a few hours.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love her work with this series, she has made me a FAN for life! I can't wait for the next installment. I'm just hoping it won't take a year so see......
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love the game, highly addictive and the kids love it too. I recommend anyone to download it and give it a go.
1423136802|5.0|For the record this series was awesome!!!!Rick Riordan is a very talented author for kids and adults. I have all all his books but I am waiting for House Of Hades! BTW if you don't have anything nice to say about the book or the author than don't say anything!!!! Also why did you buy the series if you didn't like it!?!?!?!?!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This has to be one of the most entertaining games I play on a daily basis. I love the changellage of trying to be the first to get bingo. The is simply fun so what are you waiting for download bingo now so you can have fun too.
B00AB16ER6|5.0|I am very biased.  I have been a Ritchie Kotzen fan for 20 years.  He had a stint with Mr. Big where he played with Sheehan as well after Paul Gilbert departed, but this is much better than that.  It has big hooks and phenominal chops.  There are the unison tapping licks that he and Billy do together ala Addicted to that Rush, but they aren't cheesy.  I hope that this trio takes off.  Most of Portnoy's side projects are good, but I don't think that they ever take off (perhaps Adrenalin mob is an exception).  While you wait for this to come out in America (July, I think), check out his last deal that he did with Steve Morse.  It was fantastic.  I don't think anyone bought it though.<br /><br />There are 3 videos out of songs from this CD already on YouTube.  Check them out.  That will get you by until the release date.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|My entire family of Trekies loved the fact that the characters retained and so faithfully portrayed the personalities of the original cast.  And the new twist of Uhura and Spock ads a great twist to it!<br /><br />We really enjoyed the plot, the story is sooo interesting now.<br /><br />Live long and prosper Star Trek
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Everything about this show is unique and amazing. Extraordinary writing, directing, acting. Even the costumes are better than anything on television right now. Tatiana Maslany is the most talented actress I have ever seen in a television show - and I have watched A LOT of television shows. The storylines are unpredictable and the dialogue is real and never cheesy. It's the perfect balance of drama and comedy, and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|My first time with an AMD build and I absolutely love this processor.  Hell I even save $150-200 by not adding the video card to the system and relying on the processor for graphics.
B000ID3E9S|4.0|I would equate the drama in this flick to that of 90210 or Gossip Girl (neither of which I enjoy), but this was actually not half bad. Other than portraying rich Manhattan teens as oversexed thirty year olds, it was a fun video.
B009GEDP26|5.0|We enjoy the series and it makes it all the better when there are no adds.  the price is right for the enjoyment and convenience we get.
B00337KM2S|5.0|The service of the seller was great! I received the DVD in good condition and in a timely fashion. On the other hand, the video itself was kind of disappointing to me. It was not what I had expected because I did not see very much linear character growth. While there was a great deal of plot development the ending meandered just as much as the beginning. It's like an existentialist crisis without any resolve. All in all, it was at very least a compelling plot that drew you into the character. The book is interesting too.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|I actually was disappointed..I have all his oldies CD's...this one didn't come close.  But, I only listened to it once.  It might grow on me!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I had been wanting this Lana Del Rey CD for a long time and this was sold at a very reasonable price. The music itself is debatable because she really has a unique mix of electronic and orchestral sounds, but I find her music very melodic and soothing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Somehow, I didn't pay for minecraft I just tapped buy for $6.99 and then it said&quot; download free game &quot;and of course I did it and now I have minecraft and it is one of the best games I have ever played on the kindle fire HD!!!!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Although formalic, it is a good follow-up to the Percy Jackson series without diminishing the greatness of its predecessor. A great read!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Sierra Boggess is the daughter of an acquaintanced.  Her performance and that of the phantom were  outstanding.  Ramin Karimloo's performance as the phanton portrayed his affection for Christine in a very warm and sensual manner.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|Having lived & worked in Hawai'I,  Lilo & Stich holds a special place in my heart.  My children love all the Lilo & Stich movies.  They are all grown with children of their own,  our Ohana enjoy Lilo & Stich and  Hawai'i nei.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This tale starts out with a bang, slows in the middle and had an ending which was predictable due to the broad hints along the way. However, It was an enjoyable read..
B005LLXB9K|5.0|LOVE THIS DVD! It is rich in high quality content and something we watch time and time again. Thank you for bringing me closer to one of my favorite bands!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I also have an Iphone (actually have been a supporter of IPhones since my 1st one which was the 2G) - I use the notes App almost daily. It is very simple to use and much like the Iphone Notepad.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Great CD, love the emotional connection that this compilation evokes! Has been creeping its way into my daily rotation since I pre-ordered it. Very highly recommended to LA fans :)!
0679805273|5.0|I chose this rating because of the response of the recipients , other guests, and would consider giving this book again to a graduate.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was great I could not put it down. The story moves so fast and you feel for the characters.
0307279189|5.0|The book is wonderful.  We visited the Copper Canyon in Mexico in April and got to meet some of the Tarahumara Indians.  They are such shy, wonderful people.  The book is very interesting and true to their nature.  I would recommend this book interested in either the Indians or just running.
B00821OX98|3.0|Pretty much a blend various Sci-Fi Genres. The acting is average. The alien monsters look pretty cool - but seen it before.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This was a cool app but it  is difficult to go fast in the jeep in the desert stage but it is fun.
0060574216|5.0|This is a classic book that still has applications today.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs communication help.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because it has different characters and the storyline is really good. Also it gives you stuff to keep working for. I me as n this because when th oh get enough coins you unlock people.
B004VFK5LO|3.0|Everyone is giving this film great reviews based on the performances. And I agree, the acting is great. But I can't get past films like this with some serious procedural flaws (in terms of what really can and can't happen in real life) -- that I won't go into so as not to spoil the film. It's fun to watch as far as it goes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PC PE and Xbox are all REALLY fun it doesn't matter about the people who say oh this is so bad don't get it. Some people even cures in it big I guess that's it. Wait one more thing if any of you people play PC OR MAC than if you see someone with the name 5KittyCatMan that is me
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers took me by storm when I saw it at first, but 3d enhancement took it over the top. I hope Marvel will use this movie as the sample to follow for future movie especially Thor 2.
B005HED11Y|4.0|Decided to take a look at the remastered episodes and the HD looks great.  The effects are first rate and really adds to the enjoyment of the story.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I preordered this book in November expecting a December release date. The date was pushed back twice and was billed as a trilogy (total lie). Even typing this review it says a 4 book series, not 5. The book was okay, but didn't draw me in like the first two....
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|It was a Decent movie. I was entertained for the hour and a half. Can't really say much more about it than that.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|This app gives me a much better idea of the life left on my battery in percentage and time.  however, the time will vary depending whether I am reading a book or watching a video.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I just started watching this show.  I had to catch up on Season 6 before Sept.  The characters have great chemistry.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It was such a touching story. Never thought someone so innocent would ever have to go through such an ordeal. Jaycee is a lovely sweet girl. Love her!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just couldn't put it down.  I was mesmerized from the very first page.  Excited to read the next book!
B0075FLTV2|4.0|Great songs and a few duets with other artists such as Elton John and Aretha Franklin. Add it to your collection today.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I cannot put this down...I won't let myself go to the next level until I get 100,000 points and I try again and again and again.  I'm not proud of it, but I certainly keep playing it.  My daughter did just point out to me today that the game uses poor grammar...when there are no more moves...it says &quot;no more move&quot;  considering the fact that I have played this for months without seeing this (and I normally would) describes just how addicted I am...
B00425S1H8|5.0|easy to buy, easy to install. I got what I paid for. no surprises. nothing to add, just follow the process And your be fine
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Overall this was a funny film and it managed to poke fun at almost every single activist group out there, not to mention governments, businesses, etc.  People who complain about this movie need to get a thicker skin.  Why not poke fun at ourselves?  Sacha Baron Cohen manages to highlight the ridiculousness of the world around us and draws us in to looking at things a different way.  Did I like everything in the movie? No, but that didn't prevent me from watching the entire thing and laughing throughout.
B008J4L3E6|4.0|This is a typical Mary Higgins Clark book - it has mystery, a underlying romance and a suspenseful ending.<br />A good read and the plot carries you through right to the end - great for a wet day in front of the fire.
B0064SHI9I|5.0|I used it to backup all of my apps and data when I had to switch phones and it worked perfectly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it especially the challenges in the missions went to 62 I also like the different places I went to nice and colorful plus the little images of things to catch
B005FUTC86|5.0|As a kid, I watched this movie when it aired on TV, but it was always a school night, and prime time movies end at 11, though for kid movie it might have been 10 ( I don't remember) But I always remember I had to go to bed before watching it end. As an adult, I discovered the old Dick Van Dyke Show and became a fan of his, and as soon as I realized he was in movies like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and Mary Poppins, I wanted to watch his movies. He shined in this movie and became a hero of sort, courting the girl and saving the day, great to root for him versus the bad guys. As a kid, I remembered the car did all sort of magical things, but now realized Chitty Chitty Bang Bang magic was fantasy while Van Dyke is telling a story to the kids. So this isn't exactly like Herbie movies, while Herbie was &#34;real&#34; Chitty Chitty Bang never was. This movie has a lot of good songs, and is the best part as this makes it fun to watch over and over. Usually movies get watched only once or twice, at most three times after purchase. But this one is up there with Disney Classics where whole family can enjoy many times.
1455523550|2.0|I thought it will be like a normal Nicholas Sparks book...I mean romantic, corny, different; to me it was like a mexican novel, full of predictable drama, but the end kinda saves the hole book, if you want a loooooot of drama this is the book you're looking for. If you want something different keep looking for a book.
6300274187|5.0|I don't know if Mary Poppins is in Widescreen or not, but if it is, it's always best to purchase the DVD. But I bought this VHS because the DVDs are more pricier than other DVDs of other movies, other DVDs can sometimes be found at a good price, but Mary Poppins can't. But as the movie goes, you can't lose when it stars Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. They sing and dance, and entertaining whole family, plus movie has special effects. Plus, you get to know the origin of that long word, &#34;super-whatever,&#34; that I don't know how to spell. As an adult and watching the movie now, I learn the meaning of the word, while as a kid I thought the word was nonsense and didn't have a meaning or origin.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! I actually yelled at my Kindle because my battery was low and I wanted to keep reading.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is highly addictive. If you have something to do, don't start on this game beforehand or you'll be mad that you had to quit.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|usually if you sell on eBay you have to dig and dig to get to things, this app streamlines everything. Wanna know if you got paid? You look at your auction and it puts a big red stamp on all items for which you have been paid for and even makes a little cash-register noise when you sold something Great work! And freeeeeeee!!!!!.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Could not put this first series down. It took me only minutes to order the next installment. Im not a fan of sci-fi normally but this writer has forced me willingly to examine my choice in books. I highly recommend this book series!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am SO hooked on Downton Abbey!  Such an amazing series!  I can't wait for season 4!!  Poor Matthew Crawley.....
B00821OX98|4.0|Starts off a little slow, but overall it's a decent sci-fi show.  I'm looking forward to watching the other seasons now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is hard finding books for my preteen daughter with strong female lead characters. She does not like the princess, fairytale glittery stories normally aimed for her age group. She likes books with girls of substance and Katniss was wonderful. She hated twilight books but she and my teenaged son really enjoyed this series.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good graphics, works well, and is fun and thrilling. Worth the space on your device. Can be a bit frustrating but doesn't feel penalizing, really good for what it is.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Have absolutely loved everything that I have read by Bernard Cornwell. His Saxon Chronicles is one of the best if not the best historical fiction series that I have read in a long time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like every other Firefly fan, I could sing the praises of this show forever.  Nathan Fillion can do no wrong in my opinion.<br /><br />The DVD is fantastic and has lots of commentaries and special features.  The only criticism I have is that the commentaries were hard to find at first.  Usually special features are in Special Features, on this DVD, they are in the Language menu.
1593272790|5.0|If you have a serious lego fan at home, this is a cool addition.  It has some cool ideas that expand your childs lego obsession into a learning experience.
B000001GK0|5.0|This concerto coupling is from Karajan's best days with the BPO.  Featuring the DG digital sound of the time, very good indeed, but no better than that, the piano is captured without \\"brittle strings\\" or sounding like the lid is closed.  The BPO resilient and robust, without overload or digital glare.  I'm going to buy the Karajan \\"gold\\" version for one cent for sonic evaluation, but my original disc sounds quite good.  Karajan's Schumann interpretations over the years were somewhat inconsistent, somewhat \\"routine\\" but here, we have a well controlled symphonic approach suitable for a young, (and fully capable) Zimerman.  The only element missing, is the higher energy of some recordings past and present.  Of course Zimerman was \\"on contract\\" with DG and made recordings for DG of the standard repertoire with Bernstein and Karajan.  So what is on offer here is rather succulent orchestral support from Karajan/BPO and a younger Zimerman giving workman like keyboard performances without striving for sheer virtuoso status.  Well after this recording, Zimerman's anti-military remarks made for controversy.  Zimermans disposition recently is somewhat reactive, but no argument can be made against him being one of the finest pianists of the digital era.  This recording belongs in anyone's collection, but another pairing is in order with workhorse pieces like the Grieg and Schumann piano concertos.
B005KITK6C|5.0|My son is obsessed with legos.  I don't think there is any way I could go wrong with the purchase of any one of the sets.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Very descriptive but maybe too wordy. I watched Star Trek, (the next generation),series on T.V. years ago, so I know the characters. I liked that AIs are protected now that they have a soul. I look forward to reading more books by David.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is  super fun runs smooth and really addictive i was really blow away by the graphics honestly i think any one who like skyrim or games like that should get this
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Settlers of Catan has been a great \\"gateway\\" game for many years.  Many gamers have been introduced or have introduce this game as a stepping stone towards more deeper strategy games.  There are a lot of fans and equally a lot of haters for the game.  I very much like the game but only after using some variants for our games.<br /><br />In short, Catan is a game where you try to obtain resources and build roads, settlements, cities, to grab victory points to win the game.  In the game, you fight for good spots on the board (spots on the board have numbers), dice roll indicate where those players at the location will grab resources.  Sometimes, one or more players can end up with the short end of the bargain.  Poor rolls and the lack of obtaining resources to progress can really put off players.  I wouldn't want to play it in with it's stock rules.<br /><br />There are a a few variants that improve the game for us.  One of the most useful is called the Welfare Variant.  When the dice is rolled and it's not a '7' and you don't receive anything, you get a welfare token.  During your turn, you can turn in the number of variant tokens equal to your visible VP for a resource of your choice.  Welfare tokens cannot be traded, robbed, or halved.  We read about this variant from BoargGameGeek.  Another we use is the Tournament Set up, also on BGG, basically, let's say clockwise, place a settlement and 1st road, in reverse, place city, 2nd road, AND take single resource, clockwise again, place 3rd road (must be legal connection).  Also, re-roll \\"7s\\" on each player's first turn.<br /><br />The Traders and Barbarians expansion has quite a few variants also that make the game more fun without complicating the rules much.  In that expansion, the few that I like are the Event card, Harbormaster card, Fishermen's of Catan, River of Catan.  These are very simple tweaks added to the game.  There are others in the Barbarians expansion that are more complicated.<br /><br />Others may not like the variants and say the game is fine as is.  I have no problem with that opinion.  For us, we do not play the game frequently enough to know all the strategy, nor do we play it as competitively.  We play it with family and friends, at get togethers.  Many times, we play it with people who never played it or played it only once in a while.  The variants we use, make the game more easily acceptable as a game that can be brought up again in the future.  As opposed to \\"oh yeah, that game where I was sitting at 4 VPs pretty much the whole period with nothing in my power to change anything\\".<br /><br />I urge anyone to give the variants a chance and if see if they improve the overall play of your Catan games.<br /><br />Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.
B000PC0S5K|4.0|this book is a must read, there are some really important points in this book. it's simple , but not easy to do.<br />i recommend this book to everyone!
1582701709|5.0|Lately I have been reading a lot about The Secret, and the other books by Rhonda Byrne. I have enjoyed each book I have scanned. I ordered this for my son to help him with the decision making in his life's direction, and we have both read it. I am ordering all of the Rhonda Byrne books and will share them with my son. In a world with so much happening, it's more than nice to have a road map to follow to help us get back on the right path. I recommend this book to anyone who is searching for direction in their lives.<br />I ordered this book from www.amazon.com/shops/okfamilyman as part of the Amazon shops used books offered. The order arrived promptly, as promised and  just as they had advertised it.  I was very pleased with the order and shipment. Thank you!
B000OVLINI|5.0|If you have ever had the good fortune to visit Barcelona, you will love this book!  And if you haven't, you will still love this book!  A magnificent and creative story that will take you on the journey of a lifetime!
B00CVCG87O|5.0|I have to say I'm really enjoy Ashe's new vocals with this band. His range is amazing and it's a refreshing and welcome change of pace.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|Tested it out and it seems to be a very handy tool.  I would recommend it to anyone that needs to scan a document.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I love reading about Eva and Gideon. I wish more was revealed but in the end you know why it wasn't. How can you not love Gideon? He just gets better in this book! If you have read the first two it is a must read! I don't understand the bad reviews. It was a good read.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|I love transformers & this particular one was intense. I did not expect to see any of the main important auto bots to die. I remember jazz died but to me... he wasn't as important.<br />overall I loved the movie.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app I use for my kindle fire. It tells me how much time it has left to charge an  how much time I have  left till it dies. It helps so much
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Badly written unbelievable plot which is a serious disappointment after the previous books. It's a book that seems to have been written in a hurry.
B0095P29EG|4.0|Really enjoyed the story...not too complicated, easy to watch and enjoyable for the entire family. Our 11 year old daughter enjoyed as much as husband did!
1401233384|5.0|I found Flashpoint to be a page turner. The story was well contained within certain boundaries of an alternate universe. The story is focused around the Flash and the choice that he made that created this alternate Universe.While trying to return the original Universe to what it was, Barry Allen (The Flash) has to make the decision to save the people from this specific Alternative World.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed this story was to me it was real page turner. It starts a little murky as well as mysterious and then finishes strong. But I what really like was that as complex as this story could of been was made real simple. Now as crazy as this premise may sound, I think if somebody is looking to get into comics this one is a good one as far as understanding the possibilities of what can be done with a Universe shared by a number of superheroes. The heroes in this story are different from the ones we know, including Batman, Superman, Wonderwoman, and Aquaman. They each get their moment in this paperback but otherwise can be followed through in their companion paperbacks.
B00BQ1DBUS|2.0|Rod Stewart always does an excellent job of interpreting new or older songs.  He is simply the &#34;Rod Stewart&#34; of music.
1416549447|5.0|Technique technique technique!!!!!! It's the way to go if you wanna run for decades!!! It takes time and dedication but you will get there eventually.....it is the journey!
B00846REIS|5.0|This is the steamiest, most romantic book I've read in a while! The two main characters are strong willed, but broken on the inside. Their traits remain consistent throughout the story, which enables you to feel like you really get to know these characters. Eva and Gideon communicate best when involved in sexual situations, and Ms Day does a fantastic job of describing those situations! Keep in mind that this is the first book of the series, so the journey is just beginning.  I can't wait to read Reflected in You to discover Gideon's secrets and the extent of his obsession! I highly recommend this book!!
B006ZZC3D6|3.0|Cute graphics will hold your attention for a while, but like a lot of puzzle games, after a time the game just gets too repetitive.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the season finale, although was disappointed in who was killed. It will make next season very interesting. Can't wait!!!
B0085YOD1A|1.0|I just didn't see any advantage to having the app over my Kindle's own little battery pic up in the corner, that lets me know how much battery life is remaining. I deleted this app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Some of us remember how playing solitaire with cards could be a pain with all the playing cards strewn about. Love this little app when I need to just get a quick game in.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Good but gets boring after awhile but I still like it and would recommend it to other people to play it.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|10000000 is a game some may like but some may not like it. I kind of like it, I am considering to delete it from my KF. It was the free app of the day at one point, I liked it for a bit, but not too long. It got kind of boring and was cramming space up.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I play on Pogo so was very pleased to get this one on my Kindle. I love the explosions and sound effects. Thank you
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so looking forward to getting this book I didn't read anything about it.  I just knew it was the third and supposed final chapter in Eva & Gideon's story so I ordered it.  Not only am disappointed in the story its not finished.  I agree with all the other reviews.  The book was just a set up for the next 2 books.  Shame on you Sylvia.  All the added plot twists only served to drag out the story.  When the sex scenes are repeated almost verbatim it would serve the story better just to leave them out.  I went back & reread the first 2 books before starting this one because it took so long to come out now you tell me there will be 2 more???!!!  Just finish the story for Pete's sake.  You should also rethink your pricing<br />I wont be paying $10 each for the next 2.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Like the size so i see right away I need to connect charger.<br />Gives me time to get to a place where where I can connect. Especially in an airport.
B004XWLIJS|5.0|Was a great movie. Stay ham always has great movies. If you prefer an action movie than this is a movie for you.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Arrived very quickly, I have watched it countless times. I LOVE THIS MOVIE and Emma Stone along with Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are just magnificant
B00D2K40WY|4.0|it is awesome and it inspired me to be a makeup artist<br />me and my daughter love you should play it
B005LAIIKI|2.0|When I purchased this item I was under the impression that this was a two disc set. I just got 1 Blue-ray copy. The movie was great but since I got ripped off on this deal I gave it a two stars.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|As an old time surfer, I had heard of Mavericks and was concerned that the movie wouldn't hold my wife's attention.  But it turned out to have a very engaging story of family strife, teenage love, morality, tenacity and adventure.  It was awesome for both of us.  I went from the woots of the surf scenes to teary eyed at the heartfelt moments.
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|Wonderful worship music. Terrific for personal devotion.  I am sure I will continue to enjoy this very much for a long time.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson has definitely hit a Grand Slam with this one, not only has he created a new world, with a new type of magic, great characterization which is tied together brilliantly, but he has that rare ability to \\"Set the hook\\" and leave his readers desperate for more.
B000FC1KBG|3.0|I think Tracy Hogg's EASY routine makes absolute sense, but I would have liked to have seen more detail on how to actually implement the routine. The book is filled with stories of her clients and how she worked through their issues. I think sample schedules for different ages and more troubleshooting techniques would have been more helpful than the stories.
B005BGBPBG|2.0|It's a story we've seen portrayed 100 times, except this time without the feel good ending. Rather than our cinderella making good, I felt it was more like she made do.<br /><br />And pretty much the characters were classic cliche' without anyone even bothering to TRY to update them of make them interesting. John Kryzinski has the best role in the film. I expected a much funner romance than this...which was not very fun and only disappointingly romantic.
B002C4YYEU|3.0|Benjamin Buttons is one of those movies that didn't fully develop in my opinion. It was slow and hard to follow at the beginning. The ending was the best part but too little too late to redeem it. I would not watch it again.
B00BWL99L2|5.0|This was my introduction to Epica when I first bought the original CD. So it was with some trepidation that I bought this expanded edition. I feared that the extra tracks would be little more than filler to what I considered to be a classic album. I took the chance since this was an MP3 and I could listen to the album I knew and loved and just skip past the expected lesser tracks and maybe get lucky and find one or two worthy additions to The Phantom Agony cannon.<br /> I was quite surprised to find how well each of the additional tracks actually added to the album as a whole. If I were to find any fault with this expanded edition it would be simply that some of the extra songs could've been placed in better order. This of course is easily fixed by rearranging those tracks to one's liking.<br /> I would recommend this expanded edition to any Epica fan be they old or new fans of this incredible band.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Tatiana Maslany does a terrific job portraying all the different clones and making them into three dimensional characters! The premise is unique and its compelling to watch. I'm looking forward to season 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun you can show your friends on Facebook how good you are and buy things for a store and be different people. This game is the bomb
B004WGIXX4|4.0|A cute, feel-good movie that was fun to watch. Loved the combo of Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman.  Predictable ending but very enjoyable.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Some days I miss my old flip phone with a three day battery life.  But time marches on and we now deal with smartphones that are in trouble by noon.  My daughter has the 5600 x 1 model and it is great.  The 8400 x 2 is bulkier and heavier but with two smartphones and an iPad, it is the right choice for us.  Bravo!
B0071DJZZA|4.0|If you liked the movie you will like the book.  The book fills in many gaps the movie leaves out.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie is good fun for the whole family. It's a great story filled with comedic interludes and great dialogues. Five stars.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the book  until I got to the end  wish it would've been longer  but I'm eager for the next one
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I had high expectations for this album and it delivered. Can't wait to see this live!  Hurry up and come to Detroit.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I need to address some of the rants.<br /><br />First off, no way in hell everyone would be ok with this being the last book. I agree with Day when she said that they weren't \\"there\\" yet. I hate when books are rushed and I feel short changed. I felt the last book of the Fifty series should have had a follow up. Everything was rushed because the introduction of all the climax in Freed. Saying that Reflected introduced the Nathan issue, and outed Gideon's secret. There is no way that would be able to settle everything in only one book. U would see a bunch of rants that they needed another book. About this book being a filler, um... did you read Reflected, complete filler and everyone loved it. Personally it was my least favorite of the three and left me hanging and WTF most of the time. I liked the introductions of all the \\"useless\\" stories and I look forward to seeing them play out. The only complaint is poor Cary. I want him to find happiness. I felt that Eva has put herself before him in the series and he was there for her a lot.<br /><br />I have read almost all of Day's work and she has never let me down and trust her to take me on a journey. This book is where it needed to be and GIdeon and Eva reached a level of trust that they needed- they both grew so much in this book that I do not understand the bad reviews. Honestly I am so proud of these characters. The love story was the best out of the series.  Gideon was so open with her and she was so strong for herself and for him.  In no way did I find this book was watered down but more through and Day let it progress without rushing these characters before they were ready.  In the end I think people will look back and see that this was the best choice. I look forward to 2 more delicious books.
078322611X|5.0|Bloody wonderful. I have had this video before, but this version is terrific. This movie being 2 disc is much better than the one I had before.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns was a very good read. I love Khaled Hosseini's writing and enjoy every word. I found it easy to make time to read it. Thank you to KH for his writings!
B006G2124E|5.0|The injustice of the south and the way they treated black people is certainly not new to us, but to witness it by the hands of the insipid Ladies of the south during the 50's was really heartbreaking and well, just plain wrong.<br /><br />I laughed and I cried.  I was moved to laughter, anger, disbelief, and tears.  What more could you want from a great movie
B00A7W29BE|3.0|Images can't be adjusted after saving. Automatic black and white can't be undone. Images hidden somewhere in the file system, can't be accessed with other apps. Adjusted cropping area ignored when saving. Not very useful as is.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I am often floored by an episode.  The characters, the subject matter.  The writing is stellar.  I can't really criticize anything about this because it is so excellent.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to good show to watch.<br /><br />The finale of the last season was a real surprise.  So our Good Wife is going to do some surprising things the next season!
B008RTE066|5.0|Nice package. The quality is finally where it should be after all these years.  I recommend you see it in it's full color glory for &#34;I am the Walrus&#34; alone!
B00BSBUZT6|3.0|I actually enjoyed this quite a bit but was very disappointed at the severely edited and brief concert footage on the third disc.  I don't know why but I assumed it would be the whole show.  Nope.  How much would it have cost them to put in the whole show?  I can't see how it would cost them a dime.  Kind of stingy, don't you think?  Other than that it was good.  Very well done.  I'm sure the two \\"little kings\\" made all the editorial decisions and they seem just as greedy as ever.  Joe is charming, of course.  Even sober he's kind of funny.  I didn't realize quite how acrimonious the tension was with Felder and Leadon and Randy.  Wow!  Pretty ugly and Glen still seems to have all that animosity to this day.  Well, I wasn't there and perhaps it's justified.  ???
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have been a huge fan of the series for years.  It seems this one, and the last, were written for the money.  I was hoping for a much different ending for these characters I love so much.  Even though, you have got to read it just for the closure.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A great movie, did not want it to end, would love a sequel. A great gift! If you know anyone who still uses DVDs, like me
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved book 3. I was totally left hanging.

My goodness, I cant wait, n for all those haters, u just dont know how to enjoy a good thing, im so super excited that there are 2 MORE books n' the works. I truly counted the days down til book 4 came out n I read it n 3 days, im so excited. Thank u Sylvia for keeping the great story going!!!!!!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|so sad that M died....  but, that's  part of life.<br />Judi did a very good job in her time as M
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|The colors of  the game is wonderful for playing.<br />And the stages was very for challenges. I like to play this game, and play every day.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|it keeps me in check with my power consumption and I like the size of the battery that pops up. yes, I would recommend it to anyone.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so fun. Get 3 diamonds in a row and press it. Its sooooo fun. You can play this on favenook and they have weekly challenges. U and your friends can try to get first out of everyone that is playing g it in facebook. Get this game no matter what other people say.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Where's the story? I loved the first two books but was sooo disappointed by this one. It was clear to me that the author is just trying to ride the \\"money train.\\" THANK YOU to the reviewers who informed how to return the book.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|The action was awesome!!!! The movie had a great twist with a sucky ending. Hope there is another part coming.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I downloaded the app for my husband to play on my Kindle Fire HD because he loves diving, reefs, fish, etc. I became addicted to it myself. I swore we would never spend real money on it, but we did end up spending a bit on it to get things we wanted. The graphics are really beautiful and my husband and I had both spent hours cultivating our beautiful reef. There are 40 levels to the game and we were at level 24, of course I had just spent several hours arranging a new expansion area, and had spent a few more dollars to get \\"special\\" plants when it became impossible for me to load the app and play it. It starts to load and crashes every time. I've since discovered this happens to some people with this app, apparently at random. I've done every single thing support suggested, but they can't seem to figure out what causes the \\"glitch\\" that won't let me get back to my original reef and apparently they can't recreate it. So support just stopped responding to me when they couldn't fix it. We are out the time and money invested in the app, not to mention the loss of our reef we really had come to enjoy. :-(<br /><br />*Update* I finally received a response from support and now they claim the problem is with the Kindle Fire. They say that once you reach a higher level in the app it requires too many resources to run on the Kindle. So they have an app out there they claim runs on Kindle, then once you advance in the game and spend money on the game they let you in on the secret that it won't run on a Kindle. Serious rip off. Do not waste your time or money on this app.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Although a demonic not scary movie it was good. This was a great movie about a mother's love for their child.
B004H4XDBI|3.0|I was hoping the 2nd book would have more of a plot line than just what seemed like an endless array of daily journal entries. It is simple- boy mourn  girl they cross paths and at first you think they are  done, but then they end  up together  in the end.<br />I will say that I was just begging for Mia and Adam to kiss. Overall okay, but not worth the money for me.
B0002SCZOO|1.0|The movie wouldn't play - said it couldn't play in our region. Threw it in the trash! Too much trouble to send back a 3.00 movie
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|A very addictive game that keeps you playing much longer than you intended.  You start off with the JEEP and the COUNTRYSIDE stage.  Once you unlock the MOON stage you can really rack up the coins by doing aerial flips that give you 1000 coins per flip and getting the INSANE air time with the MOTOCROSS BIKE.  Once you unlock and max out the upgrades to the SUPER DIESEL 4X4 it becomes the best vehicle for tackling the MOUNTAIN stage.  The game allows you to buy coins with real money if you don't have the patience to keep playing and saving up to unlock new vehicles, stages, and vehicle upgrades.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This is the season that has John Lithgow as the Trinity Killer.  He is such a great actor and I love the chemistry between Trinity and Dexter.  If you only watch one season of Dexter, this is it!
076790592X|5.0|I was told I should read this. Its a emotional touching story.  If your looking for a long reader this isn't the book for you.<br />Its a good length perfect for taking on vacation.  Love this Book
B008J4L3E6|5.0|I couldn't put it down! It cost me a whole nights sleep as I had to find out who the culprit was and I only figured it out at the very end.
B00AO2P3GA|2.0|Every time I try to load the game it sends me back to the home screen of my kindle. Please fix
B00992CF6W|5.0|Lots of people are complaining about no update for right now. It is not Amazon`s fault, nor is it mojang`s. It takes a while for the update to come through.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A page turner from beginning to end.I have read the first two books in a week about to start the final book.I highly recommend Fifty Shades Of Grey.Excellent!!!MeMe
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Leo's World 2 is really cool. You can jump, duck, move, and shot acorns at animals to make them die so you can move on and play.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I was playing on Bakery Story and it would give me gems if I went to dragon story. So I got this app. The screen is a little hard to move around and sometimes it freezes. It is so hard to step up a freaking level though! For me it also get really boring when you're out of money and can't do anything.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great graphics and gameplay! It was worth my money. But Gameloft if you could, the game needs a gamemode unlike multiplayer and campaign. What if you did not have WiFi and already beat the campaign and its already boring which is rare. But other than that... BUY IT!!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game. Just all the excitement and fun its just amzing! Its like world at arms (a game from gameloft) but with nature and ninja stars and samuri swords and bows and arrows kinda like a japanese set. Overall its great! Didnt take up a lot of space on my Kindle Fire HD either!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|If this had a game center sign in, it would be the best app on the kindle. I put so many hours into breeding and growing dragons. If you truly put time into them, these dragons will make you rich.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|It's hard to believe that the show's creator is a liberal. Anyway the cast was great; the story line was great. Too bad it didn't last longer.
B0013O123Q|2.0|Interesting concept with two brutal scenes, but this movie did not do much for me and I appreciate and generally like French art/Film Noir films. For most, I would recommend skipping.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I am not going to repeat the great reviews already written. There are not enough adjectives to describe how well this collection of tracks sounds, how it grows on you with each listening, how mature the work is or how incredible the work. I just love this collection. The best cd they have ever done.
B00BNWWVFG|3.0|In the beginning, Steven Soderbergh's alleged swan song SIDE EFFECTS is an expose of medical ethics and pharmaceutical abuse.  However, it mutates into a quirky murder mystery that employs lots of twists and deceptions.  Further plot nuances would involve spoilers that other reviews have  already done so, so I'll just discuss my feelings on the film's impact.<br />I enjoyed the movie overall---it held my interest and the acting is competent if unremarkable.  I'm not a huge fan of Jude Law but he comes across convincingly.  Rooney Mara who came on so strong in GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO seems like an upper scale Katie Holmes.  Catherine Zeta Jones who always looks good is somewhat miscast as Mara's first shrink and Channing Tatum has little to do as the hapless murder victim.<br />Soderbergh's penchant for sharp characterization is diminished by tepid pacing and unexpected predictability.  SIDE EFFECTS is an okay but unmemorable experience.
B000FOQ1EA|4.0|I would be happy to hear these in concert. The recorded sound is not handled the best (in the louder parts...softer sections are fine), but it is a decent effort. The samples here are quite representative of what you will hear.<br /><br />I would rate it about the same as Colin Davis in Boston. Both have the tubular bells in the 4th.<br /><br />It is rather evenly done, so I can't pick out any really outstanding symphonies or any really poor ones.<br /><br />If you want the Finnish approach, try Berglund or V&auml;nsk&auml; for comparison. The Berglund in Birmingham is currently a nice package.<br /><br />The orchestra is fine, well rehearsed.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!!!! I can't wait to get the 2nd! I am so excited. If there was a movie for the series,I would SO watch it!!!
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Joe is always great and it could just be me(nah!), but I'm not sure I have heard him like this in a while.  The feel of most every song seems to really make a connection with some emotional spot it was meant to reach and stir in some manner.<br /><br />Thanks for the ride Joe!
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|I really liked this movie! I had no expectations going in but was really surprised. I will recommend it to my friends.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|Great jump back to classic Maiden reminding me of when I was out in the crowd in my youth.  Very entertaining extras, as well.
B003G4W49C|3.0|War as Sherman said is hell but for the children in this story it is far worse. Well worth the investment of time to read
0930289234|5.0|Anyone who loved the movie should pick up a copy of the graphic novel and read it. The backgrounds of the characters, which I found so interesting in the movies, is explained in greater depth. It also adds material not necessary to the plot yet helps build the story's depth. There are even a few plot-necessary additions to the movie in the book.
B006S039YU|3.0|It was good and my three year old liked it but it wasn't particularly HD. If by HD they meant it looked less xrappy than it used to, yes. Colors were not vivid but the animation wasn't riddled with artifacts either.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Well kinda left you hanging and so far there is not another , and by the time there is , I'll have forgotten the preqiuel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a fantastic season of DA that showed the struggle between the old way of doing things and the new- from the evolution of women in the world at that time, to the struggles with the house workers and updating the estate!
0307959856|4.0|I am baffled by some of the negative reviews of this book and just had to add my 2 cents. I was thrilled to find there was a new book out by P.D. James and could not wait to savor it; this did not disappoint. I think she wrote beautifully in Austen's style and the mystery unfolded at just the right pace. I did not guess the twists of the ending and was utterly satisfied with it, if satisfied is the right term when you wish the book wouldn't end? I really cannot imagine how anyone who enjoys Austen and enjoys James could fail to enjoy this.
1426209584|5.0|Even if you're not a birder, you will love this book.  It's totally eye candy for the coffee table.  Picture after picture of the most fabulous birds I've ever seen, as well as behind the scenes tales of how they got the photographs.  I got this with the companion DVD.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I bought this for my Granddaughter who is 5 years old. She really enjoys this game and I<br />enjoy sitting with her and watching her play.  A very nice selection of dresses, jewelry,<br />makeup and accessories to put on the girls. I have to admit it, I've played this game<br />when she wasn't here too.<br /><br />Grandma Lene
B00AK57N00|4.0|This is a physics game.  It's very simple and very original in its simplicity.  Mr. AahH swings on a rope from pedestal to pedestal.  The pedestals are of varying widths; each successive pedestal is lower than the one before it.  Your job is to tap the screen to tell Mr. AahH when to release the rope.  Do it just right, you'll land in the red zone, earning you extra points.  At some stages, you have to compensate for wind and gravity changes.<br /><br />I found it quite compelling.  It's a bit repetitious, but since you will eventually work through your three lives, the games don't last forever.  The goal is to get ever increasing higher scores, like an arcade game.<br /><br />I loved that, when you just barely make it, Mr. AahH balances precariously on the edge for a second before backing up (or moving forward, depending on the edge).  The game will tell you when you are late or just barely make it, and will give you a big &#34;Just!&#34; when you hit the red zone.  I got to level G-2 and 12950 points on my third try, with two consecutive &#34;Just!&#34; landings.  (It tracks how many consecutive Just! landings you have, not how many total in the game.<br /><br />You can apparently use the accelerometer to fine tune Mr. AahH's landings, but I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />I'd give it a solid four stars.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is a great love story that tells about how love overcomes the evil and sadness in our lives ...so true!
159463176X|5.0|I bought this as my \\"summer read\\". Summer hasn't begun and I've already finished it. Two nights, couldn't put it down, and when I did I yearned to be displaced in the plot and the in the lives of the vividly and wonderfully depicted characters in the story. I've read all of his books. Thousand splendid suns is still my favorite but this was definitely worth it. Amazingly talented storyteller.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I AM ADDICTED TO MINECRAFT! I do have a need for update and it should have: redstone, pistons, buckets, online multiplayer, minecarts, boats, wolves, levers, buttons, everything in creative. If you can add these. I would pay $25!!

B00CRW2066|5.0|Matt, Arron and the rest of the band once again use intelligent lyrics, innovative instrumentation and finely honed musical skills to craft something familiar yet completely new. They have topped High Violet, which is not easy to do.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|awesome game. A lot of suites. The game play is really good also, very responsive. Great way to pass the time on a boring road trip.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Great Arnold Movie.  Just the way you like it! Has it all, car chases, helicopters, plenty of gunshots...  1000hp Corvette.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Nice application but useless since samsung already has an application for battery measuring.  Furthermore,  I can activate samsung futures to see the battery status. So, why I would like to have two numbers related to battery status in my screen? No sense.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you have Pandora turn off the sound in the game And listen to Pandora instead it is so relaxing best that's like the best way to play this game  add me on Xbox360 please my name is RubyMetal270 or add me on kik messenger my user name is rickygomez78  ~Maria &lt;3
1582701709|4.0|I got this because my friends were saying all good things about this book. I must say its not bad.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Before I begin my thoughts pertaining to content, I must say that I am confused about where I am in the series.  I just completed the Wool Omnibus....well, I THINK it was this, but I am not sure that all 5 books were included since there were no book divisions.  All I know is that it ends with Juliette, the main character, returning to Silo 18.  Is that really the end?  If not, I desperately want to read #2 so that the continuity of the story is not lost.<br /><br />I must say that I cannot stop thinking about the characters of WOOL.  The author refers to the memories of his characters as \\"ghosts,\\" I find that I, too, am affected by the specters of the characters.  I think the most brilliantly created cast member was Walker....who spoke to his ghost Scotty.....believed him to be hiding beneath a bench.  I understand why Juliette loved \\"Walk\\" so thoroughly.<br /><br />Thank you for such an impactful book.  I try not to think of the possibility of its dire fate for humanity.<br /><br />Blessings.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|Quirky and great read as a follow up to Something Borrowed.  Told from Darcy's point of view.  Definitely a recommend read.  Made me want a sequel to this book.
B004HD61KE|4.0|My first sigma force book...a spell-binding story that intricately weaves in parallel plots to converge towards one final secret in a seamless fashion... a treasure trove of knowledge, but one has to be careful not to mix up fact and fiction...occasionally, too descriptive, as if the author is setting up the script for a future film; but overall, an enjoyable read... definitely has my interest piqued in the sigma force series...
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|love it but i use kindle fire hd. I could not get out off the app to use the web. Luckily there were ads so i escaped!
B004EPYZZI|5.0|If you like true survival stories then this is a must see film.It was well acted and fast paced.Bethany Hamilton is a brave and courageous person.She had a dream and went for even though after all she went through her dream seemed out of reach.I love this movie and happy endings.But this is true and incredible.I highly recommend this movie.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved the visual story this book evoked. Such horror and sadness interspersed with hope and unbreakable ties. Loved it.
B000IDJNJ8|5.0|A classic Michael Douglas movie.This is the Sharon Stone movie.Great acting from everyone in it.I remember when it came out I wanted to see it just to see what all the &#34;fuss&#34;was about.One of my favorite movies.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|I love period pieces and this book reminded me so much of Downton Abbey. I loved it. It spanned a life of a woman from youth through to very old age and tracked the people who influenced and changed her life and how she saw the world. Lovely.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This was probably the EASY one to download.  I also like the features of the words coming up when you type, makes it easier and. you can,t misspell a word.
B009X2CUYA|5.0|I was enthralled from the first page. It is a great tale of love and loss. Relationships spanning generations. I loved it and kept trying the pre-empt the story ... but I never got it right. A really great read.
1616550414|5.0|awesome guide about the storyline on one of the greatest games in history. Perfect for any zelda / link geek :D.<br />shut up and take my rupees.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Everyone who has watched Evil Dead, or the last 3 movies, watches them for the laughs, or I did. This one actually has some decent acting, and special effects to it, so I give it 4 out of 5. It's the best of the lot.<br /><br />When you watch the folks at the cabin, and see that none of them are the sharpest knives in the drawer, one begins to think that the practice of eugenics might not have been such a bad idea after all. If intellect is controlled by DNA, then none of these folks should be allowed to multiply. It's a shame that one got away, and back into public circulation, at the end. For humanities sake, the demon done us all a favor.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|this is how metal albums should sound, at this stage of the game Dave Mustain on top of his game. being without drugs and alcohol free made the albums real metal a head-banger dream come true and its great that his best friend and right hand by his side. buy this album nothing will come close to this perfection

B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This is a great movie that not only entertains but challenges our stereotypes and norms. I love how the actions of 2 people changed their entire world!  The music in the movie is fantastic!
1781162646|5.0|Got it Friday night. Finished it Sunday afternoon.<br />So good!!! Great plot, even better characters. Loved this book.<br /><br />Best book of the summer!!!!!!<br /><br />Thanks Stephen!!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|As far as I knew, this was the third book in a trilogy. The possibility of a plot was introduced, but rather than exploring it NOTHING happens.<br /><br />Honestly I wanted to read the conclusion of Eva and Gideon's story. If she wanted to write about other characters she could have done so in a spin off series. This is their story. And she introduces some romantic suspense but completely drops the ball on the plot line. So literally nothing happens but Eva and Gideon having lots of sex.<br /><br />I've read many books and thought I could have spent my money better, but I've never been offended for having spent money on a book until I read that it was not the end and NOTHING had happened! Ok, maybe if she didn't have anything else to add and sort of dropped the ball. But she just seems to want to drag it out for book sales.<br /><br />I loved this series, but sadly I am now done with it.
B004W2V254|4.0|Looking for more German movies<br />Do you have more???<br /><br />The big black cat ran up the tree and stayed there.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Martin continues his complex story line and excellent character development.  Leaves you wanting more.  The plot line never gets tedious,  Martin is great at making you feel ambivalent about many of the heroes and villains.  (Sometimes you wonder which is which)
B0047VSW30|5.0|I have a strong interest in the historical period of 1,000 BC to 1,000 CE but I rarely watch movies that attempt to depict this era as they seem to impose modern values and traits on the characters. However, this movie was recommended by a professor in a video course I am taking on the transition from Paganism to Christianity.<br /><br />The scenes, clothing and attitudes seem to present an excellent portrayal of Alexandria at the end of the Roman Empire. It does not clean up the brutality of the period by making the emerging Christian movement appear to be one of kindness, love and understanding towards their fellow humans who might not agree with their religious beliefs.  It reveals that the early Christians of the 5th century behaved very much like the Taliban of the Islamic culture - intolerant and politically motivated, rather than guided by &#34;God&#34;.  &#34;Convert or Die&#34; was as prevalent then as it is now.<br /><br />Some of the dialog was difficult to hear as people spoke in whispers and low voices since, just as in modern radical Islamic settings, your words could condemn you to death. Those who only understand the evolution of Christianity through Bible Study groups might feel that this film was unduly harsh on the Christians; those who understand History as what it really was, will find this to be a realistic look at a world that has been romanticized to conceal the unpleasant, ugly facts  of 'how the West was won' in the late Roman Empire.<br /><br />Not a pleasant 'feel-good' movie; it is one that can be disturbing in its honesty and historical significance. It is no surprise that it was never released in the USA to the general movie audience.  As an added bonus, the acting was superb - not a clunker scene in the entire movie.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Martin's excellent an diverse character development along with a complex and multilevel plot line is quite engaging.  A real page-turner.  Just finished the second of the series. Will start the third shortly.
B007IJDXFK|5.0|Where do I start?! Passionate, emotional, moving, tense at times, incredible, stunning, and the list could go on!!<br /><br />Folks, I've been a collector of music for many many years. Every once in a blue moon, a release comes out that stops me in my tracks and begs for me to listen to over and over. This is one of those gems!! It will transport you to another realm. It's been a LONG time since I have been this moved by a piece of music;. Words really cannot describe!<br /><br />If you know this band from their early releases, this is an abrupt change. Incredible acoustic guitar playing, soaring orchestration, great vocals and harmonies, and thick guitar all come together to make this masterpiece!<br /><br />This is one of those releases where the music and the storyline fit perfectly. And wait till you hear the storyline...it will all come clear when you listen to the beginning of track 8.....<br /><br />If I had to have a desert island pick-this would be it!!!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, buy this and be transported......

B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This is a fun game. Quick pick up and play would recommend to anyone looking for a time killer with a little depth. The graphics seem to run smooth on my Kindle fire HD.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book dragged. It could have easily been the last. There was way too much unnecessary things going on. Very upset since it didn't have an ending. Extremely disappointed.
0553386794|4.0|So, I've been hearing a lot in the social media about A Game of Thrones. I decided I wanted to see what it was about. I want to watch the tv show, but when I found out it is based on books, I wanted to read the books first. I love to read and prefer to read a book before I watch the show/movie. I know that there are tons of reviews on this book, but mine is from a different perspective. The books I usually read are Christian historical romance novels. They all have sappy love stories and happy endings. A Game of Thrones was definitely a change from that! When I first started reading I didn't think I would get into it, but I continued and eventually I did. I found myself interested in the characters and slowly was drawn into the story. I like that there is some romance in the book. One thing I notice towards the end is that it is nothing like my romance novels. In A Game of Thrones it doesn't always go the way you want it to, people you like die, and it isn't always a happy ending. With that said, I still liked the book. It is also an interesting read because every chapter is from a different characters perspective. So, when a chapter on one character ends with a cliffhanger and you want to know what's next, you might have to read 5 chapters before you come back the the character. The book ended really well and I can't wait to start the next one and I'm also looking forward to finally watching the show to see how well it stays true to the books and to see the story come alive.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|this book is interesting to read,Mr. McCourt gives us an interesting account of his life as a child, the hardships he has endured and the trials he and his family have gone through.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|its a fun way to kill some time. it is like farmville but the dino version and it is semi educational.
B005LAII94|5.0|All you self appointed movie critics should try to be a little less clever and stick to your job at Walmart unless you actually get paid to be a critic.  I mean do you rate yourself as articulate??  Who cares to hear another rant by someone who can't find anything good to say.<br />It's just one big yawn.  Who picked up your screenplay anyway?  Didn't see you at the Oscars,  It's easy to slam anything if you've only two neurons to fire a synapse.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|Purposely provocative with little delivery unless you prefer car crashes, crushed skulls & one dimensional characters. Only purchased it after seeing video on Youtube of a favorite song, Down in Mexico.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was an entertaining and quick read enjoyed while I was on vacation.  Hard to put down once you start.
B000003TA4|3.0|The cd arrived six weeks later. Although the cd itself was in perfect condition the case was completely cracked, which meant I had to buy another jewel case and repackage it because it was a gift.
B00B78AIV0|4.0|Really an interesting read, did not want it to come to an end. Was a little disappointed with the ending.
0425263924|5.0|I also pre-ordered the book and was at first disappointed by the negative reviews the book received and was a little reluctant to even start reading. But...the book surpassed my expectations on content. Well written, lots of drama and lots of romance. Exactly what I expected from a book of that genre. I actually really enjoyed the many directions and angles the book took and the drama with some of the side characters. It really spiced up the book and made it a lot more fun to read. I also like the fact that [spoiler alert!!!] the book does not end with the marriage of Eva and Gideon [end of spoiler]. So many of the romance novels do and quite frankly in real life that's when the drama and the hard work really starts. So, I am actually glad that the series will continue. A nice touch was to look at the picture the author had provided in the snapshots on her websites for each chapter prior to the release and see how it related to the respective chapter. I admit, I was somewhat disappointed that the author was not more open about the fact that the series continues, but at the same time, I am looking forward to more of E and G and their drama and after all, I am writing a review of this particular book and not about the author's decision to expand the series and how she communicated that decision.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I admit this game is really fun. But once u get so far into this it will delete your progress. COMPLETELY. I had a rainbow dragon and a bronze Olympus dragon and was close to getting the Dragon of time. And remember I did this without missing any $. It deleted my game.
B00915G6YE|5.0|I have been a Dexter fan since the beginning. I have collected all the seasons so far, and can't wait for the last season to start.
0871164566|4.0|I really enjoyed Wire Pendants by Kimberly S. Berlin.<br />I could refer to this book over and over. It would also be easy for beginners.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This is a very good movie but its a little hard to follow. It jumps back and forth quite a bit, suggest you watch it twice to get all of good out of it.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I have listened to this album as much an any album ever, and it is timeless.  I have worn out an album, cassettes and CDs, and now have a. digital copy mp3.  Pink floyd 's  Dark Side Of The Moon  is a masterpiece .
B000WJSCZE|4.0|Would recommend it. What is good about the book is that it takes you not only to the presentation aspect but it teaches on the importance of assertive communication
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I have downloaded this to my Kindle, gotten all these things thanking me for getting, receipt for where I got it from them, but it won't open. I have tried everything and I'm very frustrated.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|After waiting years for this to come to theaters, it is finally here!  Les Miserables was my first Broadway show and holds a place in my heart because of that.  I was so excited for it to finally come to theaters, and with such an amazing cast.  This movie is excellent and should be in any movie lover's collection.  I typically am not one to sit and go through special features of any movie.  As soon as I got this in the mail, I watched the movie again and as soon as it finished watched every single bonus feature.
B002KAJ0AO|2.0|First off, I'd say this is a 2.3.  The men have not lost their talent for singing.<br /><br />There are only two \\"good\\" BSB songs on here: 'Shattered' and 'Undone'.  And those are a bit slow for how I like BSB to sound.<br /><br />The music is not 90s pop but instead the auto-tune crap you get from popular artists today. The lyrics make me EXTREMELY uncomfortable.<br /><br />Nick was nearly 30 and the others older when the album was made. GUYS WRITE YOUR OWN DAMN SONGS. Two of them were married...and they were singing \\"PDA.\\" I wanted to throw up. It was disgusting to hear the words and again, the music was not what I expected.<br /><br />It was the first post-Greatest Hits album I purchased, but I've heard most of the songs from Never Gone. Those are GOOD. THAT is BSB. Not this...crap.<br /><br />The only reason I'll keep listening to it is because I'm seeing them this summer.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I had originally purchased the music inspired by the film after seeing it in theaters.  It was great, but missing some of the key songs.  Thankfully, when the DVD released, the deluxe edition came out as well with the full soundtrack.  What's great about the soundtrack is that it is the same live recording as used in the film itself.  One of my absolute favorite soundtracks of all time!
0425263924|3.0|So I waited a year to start these books not knowing that it became a FIVE part series! Had I known I would've waited at least another year. Who wants to start a story with no end?<br /><br />The ending by the way is terrible. This whole book leaves you hanging. And nothing happens. All the info she gathers, all the twists in the investigations, all the secrets and lies and NOTHING!<br /><br />I was so disappointed and annoyed when the story didn't end. Two more books means we're garaunteed not to see any action til book 5. Whenever that will be.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable series, a little too close to 50 Shades but still pretty tasty. I will read the last 2 books but I will have to wait til book 5 has been release first.
1623420148|2.0|It wasn't the laugh out loud book that I was expecting.  The reviews made it seem like this was a funny and romantic book that would grab me and make me want to read it again and again.  It wasn't.  I didn't laugh or  even smile once while reading this book.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special either.  I don't feel the urge to tell my friends and family members to read it.  I don't want to relive moments from the book or reread my favorite scenes (I don't have any).  I don't see myself reading it a second time.  It wasn't a torturous read, but it was nothing to get excited over.  I guess I am still trying to figure out what all the fuss is about.  I guess it was good if you want to get a glimpse into a man's mind, but seeing as the book was written by a woman, take everything with a grain of salt.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|This app has everything. It is a Very comprehensive tool.  More information that you could ever fully utilize!<br />Which is great!
B001HLZMUE|5.0|Nothing like this has ever been done. It's absolutely classic! Tim Curry and the other lead actors give amazing performances.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I really enjoyed the concept of the arcade style games having grown up during those days . Great story, great villains and twists.
0810989956|5.0|My eight-year-old with a writing aversion loved logging his own thoughts in this diary. Overall, the writing prompts were appropriate for an older elementary school aged kid, but there were a few page topics that were probably better suited to middle school kids who've experienced life a little longer.<br /><br />I'd recommend this purchase, especially to encourage written expression in creative little boys who &#34;hate&#34; writing.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This was another great addition to the ice age collection. Great comedic talent. Would watch over and over again. Keep it up
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Very disappointed.  Just can't believe I waited so long for this book only to find out I have to wait...YET AGAIN... for a HEA.  And to top it off, this book wasn't that good. Not at all what I expected from Sylvia Day.<br /><br />I lost a lot of respect for Eva in this book.  Don't really like Cary that much anymore either. Gideon needs to leave them both and find someone who deserves his passion and love. Not sure I'll keep reading this series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a nice free calculator.  It's easy to use.  Just what I was looking for to do simple calculations.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|We Are Infinite &#60;3<br />This is an awesome book, easily read, great characters and an amazing plot.<br />An amazing coming of age story.
B005XOPEOU|2.0|I can't say I hate the album but I can say I don't like it.  I'm a fan of the old stuff, every album got worse as they went.  I love the first 2, like the 3rd and the 4th is ok.  I know they are heading in a more pop direction but this one was a giant leap.  Bands change over time and I accept that, some changes you like and some make you kind of stop paying attention to them.  Here is one for the latter.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a fantastic workout and I couldn't be happier to have purchased it.  I've never watched Biggest Loser, but I've heard so many great things about Jillian Michaels that I decided to try the 30-day shred.  I haven't gotten to levels 2 and 3 yet, but I'm determined.  I feel amazing after working out to level one, I can't imagine I won't feel the same way after levels 2 and 3.  She explains proper form, and what not to do, which is a good thing - I know I'm doing the exercise correctly the first time, fixing any bad posture or form right away instead of wondering WHY the workout isn't being effective after a month.  She's a great trainer, I highly recommend this workout.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|My family and I loved Pitch Perfect!  We have actually rented it a few times now and have watched it 3-4 times.  It is the right amount of silly and sweet, and the singing and dancing are entertaining as well.  My daughter loves to sing and dance along to the music and the funny parts are still funny after more than one viewing!

0399162097|5.0|Karen Fowler writes Science Fiction stories.  Great ones.  She's won the prestigious Nebula Award, not once but twice.  Now no doubt you are wondering, so what?  If you know anything about Fowler's tear-provoking, often hilarious, brilliantly realized new novel, \\"We are All Completely Beside Ourselves,\\" then surely you know that it isn't a work of science fiction.  If you've suffered the misfortune of reading most reviews, then you know this novel's great reveal.  Spoiler alert here: I will give you no spoilers.  If, as I suspect, it was the choice of some narrow minded, imagination-impaired PR-type in the publisher's marketing department to go ahead and splash right on the cover what by rights should be this summer's most delicious literary reveal, well I won't abed his sin by repetition.  Yes, that tidbit is the backbone of a great plot.  Yet at its heart, Fowler's novel isn't one of plot, it is a work of character.<br /><br />So why mention those great sci-fi stories?  Likely it is this author's practiced sci-fi pen that helps here in understanding no plot can overcome the need for great characters.  Starships, robots, alternate dimensions, and the most cleverly crafted aliens are no substitute for a character's essential humanity.  All Fowler's characters in this novel, from the narrator on down, exhibit just the sort of humanity which will make you laugh and weep.<br /><br />I worry that saying much more will reveal too much.<br /><br />One thing worthy of note is the excellence of Fowler's narrator Rosemary, as living, breathing a character as I've seen recently on the page.  Without mentioning titles or authors, reviewers recently heaped much praise on a novel that was written in a prose of extraordinary grace.  The problem with that novel was that the narrator often suffered a ventriloquist dummies' manhandling when the author stepped into her mouth to make every sort of social observation that strained credulity coming from a sexy motor cycle riding, recentcollege grad, want-to-be artist.  Fowler never makes that mistake.  No, Rosemary's observations all feel genuine to her character, as if this fine author summoned her to page, séance-like.  The descriptions are Rosemary's.  The jokes - and they are often just blisteringly funny! - are Rosemary's.  And the tragedy, which comes down on the reader's chest with the force of a fright train and the stealth of a ninja is likewise Rosemary's as well.  While obviously a creation of Fowler, Rosemary is no mouth piece.  Fowler's perspective characters, always artfully distinct, here add what may be the most elegantly constructed among their number.<br /><br />Beyond character, Fowler's novel is also one of ideas, giving thoughtful consideration to notions of love, loss, and attachment, and whether after suffering a great loss one can ever hope to again be made whole. While few if any readers will share Rosemary's most unusual upbringing, likely all will find much that is familiar in her struggles.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I will never look at a pair of boots or shoes the same way again. Kinky Boots makes me believe that shoes can truly be one of the most beautiful things in the world. \\"The Most Beautiful Thing In the World\\" is definitely one of my favorite songs.  These are all superb songs written by Cyndi Lauper.  Billy Porter shines in his role as Lola.  Stark Sands is equally excellent as Charlie.  Their duet \\"Everybody Say Yeah\\" is an upbeat number that makes me feel good.  Stark Sands shines on the musical number \\"Soul Of A Man\\".  Billy Porter sings a very moving song on the beautiful tune \\"Hold Me In Your Heart\\"  \\"Raise You Up\\" and Just Be are two songs that make me feel empowered.  This song celebrates a person's individuality and their right to do their own thing in life.  \\"Sex In The Heel\\" are \\"In This Corner\\" are two songs that pump me up.  Jennifer Perry sings on In This Corner.  She has a strong voice and really stands out in her role as Trish. I love the funky feisty spirit of these songs. Kinky Boots is the best musical in many years.  This cast recording is proof of that. I love this music.
B00C061I3K|5.0|\\"We, Robot.\\"  Two robot brothers time travel back to the 1970's in search of good feelings.  They go dancing and stay up all night hoping to get lucky. They are doing it right.

0143122916|5.0|North Korea is currently forcing hundreds of thousands of people to live their entire lives in horrific misery.  Shin Dong-hyuk is the only person born in the camps who ever escaped, made it out of Nort Korea and was able to testify to it.  Everyone should read this book to know the extent of the horrors of life in North Korea.
0767802470|5.0|This is what being in a submarine in wartime is REALLY like.  As opposed to the glamorous, gung ho, 'we sink everything in sight' genre of submarine movie.  As the movie points out at the start, 40,000 german sub-mariners experienced exactly this, and 30,000 of them did not survive it.<br /><br />That said, I was a little disappointed with the episode in the Straits of Gibraltar which I thought was not as convincing as in the longer version of the film.  And I am glad the film omitted the implausible episode in the book in which the submarine captain attempted to sink a large ocean liner of uncertain nationality.<br /><br />Lots of reviewers describe this as one of the very best war movies ever made.  I agree.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|I enjoyed reading Mr. Duhigg's book. There were many thought-provoking ideas that explained a lot in my life. I found that personally, there were many things to apply. For my business and in my community, I found the information interesting but less useful.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Pretty cool game just wish they gave you more aura.  Pretty fun all around good free app.  Recommend it to anyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I cannot believe that people are giving this a bad review. Returning the book; give me a break. I am ecstatic that the saga will continue. I read countless books with bad plots, poor writing, and awful editing. Sylvia Day is a great writer and I would rather keep paying for a well written book than books that aren't worth my time. I cant wait for the next book or hopefully for Gideon and Eva to continue for a long time. Thank you Sylvia Day
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I got this app because I usually end up wanting to check my linkedin.  I was skeptical if it would work well, but I really like it so far.  It's great for on the go just to check something.  I've had it for about 2 weeks and usually I would delete it by now if I found it useless or terrible. So far, I like it!

0805095535|5.0|As some of our best writers anxiously reach old age, we get to bask in the glow of their epiphanic struggles. For a recent example of this phenomenon in verse, see John Updike's beautiful collection entitled Endpoint. As for Paul Auster's Winter Journal, I only have tremendous praise and gratitude.<br /><br />The book avoids the sentimental pitfalls of many memoirs through its non-traditional and quite pleasing organization and through its initially bizarre 2nd person point of view<br />Organized as a sort of phenomenology of his body, Auster takes us through a series of vignettes interrelated in clever or surprising ways. There are a series of stories separated by decades but which all deal with having to urinate. I found the section of stories about places Auster has lived particularly interesting; no doubt, he's called quite a number of shady hovels home, but it made me think back fondly and humorously to all the dorm rooms, graduate school apartments, hotel rooms, and houses I've lived in over my own 36 years. What's compelling about Auster's recollections is his naked honesty (admitting that there was a part of him that was happy his mother died), and poetic diction. There was nary a page that went by without by without earning a post-it flag or other marginalia. To pick even a couple of the most beautiful is impossible.<br /><br />Initially, Auster's choice to speak of himself as \\"you,\\" is jarring and odd. But quickly, the wisdom of his choice becomes clear: his anecdotes are simultaneously particular and universal. His use of \\"you\\" begins teasingly to feel like you're the one being written about and that these loves, pains, losses, panic attacks, driving accidents, and marriages are communal.<br /><br />To be honest, I haven't liked much of what I've read from Auster. I LOVED the movie Smoke which he wrote, but I've often found his novels a little cold and flat. All the more reason I recommend Winter Journal: I wasn't PLANNING on liking this book. The reasonI picked it up was because of its glowing reviews and, frankly, Auster won me over. I'm debating whether to revisit his other books, but for now, I'm happy to recommend Winter Journal without reservation. While I'm not in my 60s as is Auster, at 36, I frequently feel the same \\"in between-ness\\" as my aches and pains increase, my metabolism decreases, and I find myself neither young enough for sustained frivolity nor old enough to qualify for communal empathy or a sense of accomplishment. So buy with confidence; if NOTHING else, the book will send you down your own roads of recollection and appreciation.
B004LTB5OG|4.0|This is the third Pendragon album I've bought, having enjoyed both The Masquerade Overture and The Window of Life.  Before Pure, I though of Pendragon as just a step up from amateur, though pleasant to listen to, enough so that I went on to buy my 2nd, and now my third album.  I'll start by stating that Pure is worlds above the previous two, and a lot of that is because of the drumming.  I realized that they had a new drummer only after purchasing and listening to Pure, and Scott Higham really steps up the quality.  Overall, the music on this album has a much harder edge, and it suits them well.  Higham's drumming adds focus and a hard driving  beat to a refreshing upgrade of song writing and vocals, also superior to their previous efforts.<br /><br />I'd rate their previous albums as three star albums, but this is a solid 4.  I'd give it a 4.5 if I could, but not quite a 5, which is reserved for epics like Close to the Edge, In the Court of the Crimson King, Dark Side of the Moon, Deadwing, and Milliontown.  I'll venture to say that if Pendragon stays on their present course, they'll soon have a 5 in their future.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, the vocals seem much improved.  More harmonies, the song melodies seem richer and well constructed, and Nick Barrett's voice seems to have matured to a great degree.  He almost sounded childish on the earlier albums, but here, it seems as if he's found his voice.  Stronger guitar riffs and solos permeate the album as well.  And Nick Barrett's keyboards appear to have been inspired by the improved vocals, guitar work, and drumming.  Even the sound quality of the CD sounds better.<br /><br />With the new metallic edge, Pendragon has come into the modern world of progressive rock music.  Move over Porcupine Tree, this is not your father's Pendragon.
1400067820|3.0|In the conclusion of this book, Taleb reports that a friend of his asked him to explain his core argument while standing on one foot. Obviously an allusion to the famous story in which a gentile promises to convert if Rabbi Hillel can explain Judaism while standing on one foot, Taleb offers, \\"the best way to verify if you are alive is to check whether you like variations.\\"<br /><br />I'll admit at the beginning of this review: there were sections of this book I had to skip. More on why in a bit.<br /><br />Taleb's thesis is that modernity is the attempt of human beings to turn the random into the predictable and stable, and that this attempt ironically causes MORE randomness and disorder. Taleb demonstrates that in evolution, economics, philosophy, ethics, politics and elsewhere, the \\"Antifragile,\\" things which BENEFIT and get STRONGER due to stressors are the rule, not the exception. He believes that modernity, and our attempts to make our lives predictable and orderly only bring FRAGILITY, which either gets WEAKER with stressors or at best, barely survives stressors intact.<br /><br />This seems very compelling. Given my personal medical history as a Crohn's sufferer who has undergone five surgeries, the prospect that all of this suffering is actually making me STRONGER and more resilient rather than broken and weaker is inspiring. Taleb doesn't pretend that this theory is novel; indeed, much of his evidence is derived from ancient and classical wisdom and cultures. He notes that the maxim \\"what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,\\" isn't NEW, just that it's almost completely ignored by policy makers, economists, parents who try to protect their children from all harm, and his previous colleagues in risk management positions.<br /><br />HOWEVER, and this is a big however, I find Taleb's tone and style incredibly off-putting. It's clear that he has an axe to grind with Ivy League educated leaders and policy makers. He even coins a particularly destructive pattern of fragile thought \\"Harvard/Soviet\\" something or other. In constantly trying to position himself as an Everyman speaking in the voice \\"Fat Tony\\" from Brooklyn, Taleb fails at every turn to NOT sound like an arrogant, long winded, elitist. Anyone whose short bio on the back flap describes him as \\"a flaneur meditating in cafes,\\" is going to have trouble connecting with the reader. Don't be ashamed, I had to look up \\"flaneur\\" as well. It's someone who spends his or her time WALKING in a meditative and philosophical manner in the spirit of Montaigne. Wow. Another reviewer, who actually LIKED the book, described Taleb as an a*****e. Unlike her, I find his personal \\"a**-holier-than-thou-ness\\" inseparable from his argument.<br /><br />So Taleb is QUITE in love with the sound of his own voice and his verbosity, intentionally obscure chapter titles, and inability to maintain a straightforward argument free of bombast is the reason I found it impossible to read this book from cover to cover.<br /><br />Perhaps the problem is as simple as this: Taleb's central thesis about antifragility is written on the cover. It's interesting. It's a compelling idea. And really, Taleb could have devoted 35 concentrated pages advising us how to better embrace random events and stressors (Black Swans he calls them in his previous book) at work, in raising our children, and with regard to our own health. That would have been a five star endeavor and could have appeared as a lengthy New Yorker feature. But the room that a book length work gives Taleb to stretch out his legs is to his detriment. He is in dire need of editor unafraid to be called \\"too stupid to understand\\" to reign in his oversized ego and overwrought style.<br /><br />I am left interested and disappointed. Not a pleasant feeling after devoting so much time and concentration following Taleb's circuitous verbal \\"flaneur-ing.\\"

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I LOVED and still love the first book; however, the last 2 books in this series have been horrible and I am left thinking what was the point of it? I was left feeling that their story should just have ended and not have to wait for another 2 books.  I am disappointed in the author and I doubt I will continue to read the Crossfire series anymore.  The excitement of Eva and Cross has diminished.  Don't waste your time on this book, just like the last one, it is a filler to draw things out.  I would wait till the last book comes out and read how it all ends up.  Such a disappointment.

Super excited for the RELEASE date to come ... well .. .I read it the day it came out .. in a day and half done.... Did NOT like the ending.. could of ended alot better... this book has no substance to it .. other than sex .. and fill in the holes of book one and two.. alot could of been left out and just told in seriously 4 chapters at most....  I really felt left down ... I love the characters ... i love Gideon ... but i feel there could of been alot more there!!  Of course if you read book One and Two.. you will read this one.. just because you need closure of the characters ...but you will feel disappointed .. as I was .. and as Most were from the rating of this book and the posts .... Im sure i will read book 4 ..but i wont be as eagerly waiting like I did for book 2 and 3 .... I hope Sylvia turns book 4 around to make up for book 3 !!!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B008602KQI|4.0|The script was pretty true to the book.  The actor chosen to play Peeta was not what I was expecting.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I liked this book for so many reasons, but probably most because of the brilliant way Landay captures the complexity of adolescence and the parental relationship with Jacob. As a parent of two teenagers, I often connected with the love displayed by both parents. A wonderful fast summer read and perhaps one of my favorites! Bravo.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Love this movie and the deal.<br />I am happy to find the items I want available at such great prices.
1451683405|5.0|Sam Harris, the author of The End of Faith, Letter to a Christian Nation, and the Moral Landscape, writes another thought provoking book about the illusion of free will. The idea of free will is an important part of our legal system and in this book, Sam Harris challenges that idea. I bought it because Sam Harris is one of my favorite authors and his books are never boring. I'm not sure that I like the idea that I don't have free will, that I'm not in control of myself. But Sam Harris makes the case in this book that free will is an illusion, that there is more going in our brains than we are aware of.<br />I would definitely recommended this book to anyone who is either a fan of Sam Harris or wants to read a book that will make them question one of the longest held beliefs in history, the belief of free will.
B0007LPLMY|4.0|I do not have anything more than any one else has already said.  It is crude and there parts I do not want to see again but then there are parts so funny and artfully done.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a good game and I play often. It is based on a simple concept yet it is still challenging. The graphics are  beautifully rendered and add a playful feel to the game. People of all ages can enjoy Pudding Monsters.<br />Not much else to say.
B004UQPM4E|3.0|I purchased this last year for a Christmas present, and my friend jokingly asked me a few days ago why I bought him the spanish version.  This isn't the only time where I received movies/video games with foreign languages on the cover.  Probably ended up with a lot of boot legged items from this site.
1452654417|5.0|I laughed and cried!  This book points out everything that is wrong with our current healthcare system. When will it change?
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Having lived in India for four and a half years, my wife particularly enjoyed the early scenes in \\"Life of Pi.\\"  Unfortunately, we felt that the movie had several flaws.  The behavior of the tiger, Richard Parker, was not believable, specifically when he inextricably stayed under the canvas for so long.  Also, his inability to claw his way onto the canvas after Pi did not seem realistic.  Why did not Pi succumb to sunburn after days of exposure?  How Pi and Richard Parker survived with so little water was not adequately explained.<br />We thought that far too much time was spent on the lifeboat scenes for no purpose.  On the other hand, the last 10 minutes or so of the movie really tied the loose ends together and got our attention.
B00BQ1D7X4|2.0|I have been a lifelong fan of Alice in Chains and when \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" was released back a couple of years, I reluctantly purchased it all the while feeling \\"guilty\\" about betraying Layne Staley's memory.  I was pleasantly surprised to realize just what a great comeback album it was and was eagerly anticipating \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here.\\"  Unfortunately, I was really disappointed.  I listened to it in its entirety about four times and came away liking three songs:  Hollow, Stone and Phantom Limb.  Short of that, the songs (at least to me) just had no tune that was stuck in my head (which Alice in Chains songs generally tend to be).  I just don't feel the passion on this one.<br /><br />Nothing will ever compare to the original lineup of Staley, Cantrell, Starr and Kinney.  Dirt and Facelift were by far their best work.  But again ... I guess my expectations were super high after BGWTB.<br /><br />Sorry to give this review about one of my favorite all-time bands, but its just the reality of how I feel about this CD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to load and easy to use.  That is the theme of my life...easy!  Now I don't have to go looking for a calculator everytime, it just available on my kindle!
0439023521|5.0|I got this for a gift for my God Daughter who loved this. well written and enjoyable for Jr. High and up.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Just stumbled upon this EP after daring myself to click \\"Hipster International\\" on Spotify. Royals was the first song that played and I loved it, so checked out the rest of what she'd laid down. Dig it. Totally :) Forward the YouTube link to all my besties and they feel the same. She's 16? Sounds fierce! Can't wait to see what else she's capable of! Definitely check this out. Go girl!
0452273331|5.0|Outstanding book, almost endangered final exams for our sixteen year old because he had difficulty putting it down. Highly recommend
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My niece loves this app when she comes to visit - we have the android and apple ipad version at home.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Where was the STORY? Let's go back to Writing 101...setup, conflict, resolution. There were heated sex scenes as there were in the first 2 books, but this 3rd book lacked the exciting story line significantly! I was actually bored throughout most of the book.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|This is a fantastic CD  with a great variety of piano guys amazing music.  Looking forward to the next CD.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This books helps you see that anything is possible.  I am ready to find solutions and change the world. Thanks
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I am a fan of John Greens YouTube and had heard from others this was a glorious book. Plus with the movie coming out I thought I would give it a shot. It's fantastic and sad and well-written but if I am honest I felt that the characterization of the teenagers was too sophisticated. Maybe I read this at the wrong time after a buch of other YA books with smart and sassy 16-18 year-olds. I have found myself thinking &#34;where are all the books about smart-sassy take on the world 20-year olds?&#34;.  I couldn't help but think that Hazel and the rest came off sounding very mature, very self-actualized and very knowledgable about random pop culture references. It rang false at times. I'm not saying teenagers like this don't exist just that I the ones in this book didn't feel real to me. But it is a fantastic book and well worth the read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I cannot believe all the bad reviews that have nothing to do with the quality of the book. A fourth book? More Gideon and Ava? YES PLEASE!<br /><br />This book picks up right where reflected in you leaves off. Gindeon and Ava finding trust in each other. After Nathan is my reserved they are trying to fill the holes they both have from being apart amidst all the chaos. Through jealous ex's, sibling rivalry and parents who are off their rockers (except victor who is one hot hunk of a man) and a relentless reporter who Gideon used for a night of fun they fight for the love/obsession they have been building.<br /><br />Gideon is a pushy powerful man but wears his heart on his sleeve for Ava. He's not always forthcoming but through the series and I this book he's been opening up to her.<br /><br />Ava is controlling her jealous streak and is showing it with this book. She stood by her man when most women would have walked away. Some of choices are a but childish but she's 24. Who didn't make irrational assumptions at that age? Let alone with what both of them have in their dark childhoods.<br /><br />Praise to you Slyvua Day! This series is by far my favorite and you've created characters I love to hate but hate to love.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Wonderful movie! it brings back such great memories of reading Tintin comics when I was a child. I was so happy when the movie was released!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is an entertaining app I downloaded to my Kindle Fire.  I play often and it's solitaire.  What more can you say?!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One kid who has severe genetic disease which get his face severely deformed goes through school life tougher than others'.<br /><br />Author's imagination gives this situation alive. And his skillful writing which describes story through different people's view was also creative and brilliant.<br /><br />I want to recommend this book all my heart.<br /><br />Check this out. It is totally worth.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Its a great show, I really enjoyed every episode. Such a shame there will never be a season 3. Alas poor Smash. I knew it well.
0812982622|4.0|Johnson's novel should be recognized for its unique format and style of storytelling. The work is certainly engaging, and a relatively quick read. However, despite his numerous allusions to real people in the North Korean system (think the late Kim Jong-Il) this book does not merit the label of a realistic fiction. Based on the limited and diverse information outsiders have of North Korea, this story should be regarded as a fantastical tale with occasional nods to real people and events. It should NOT, I feel, serve as a historical fiction, realistic fiction, biographical fiction, or any other label advertising this book as an accurate image of what life might be like in North Korea.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Bones, the complete sixth season is a continuation of a great series.  I couldn't wait to see this series and continue the show.
0385523912|5.0|I read this book in a college course about North Korea. Demick's writing style is very engaging; it almost reads like a novel. For anyone interested in getting their feet wet on the topic of North Korea, I would recommend this book as an easy entry-level text.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|I couldn't get through this movie.  I guess I just did not get it.  It is about two mentally reatarded young people who eventaully fall in love. I gave it a 3 star because I do think the actors are good but I just did not like the story.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This is a really good murder mystery. I read this type of book lot and can usually see the end coming.  This  I did not see coming, well done!!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|First let me say that I am not a fan of musicals but this was OK and had some great acting.  Very talented singers.  Sad story line.  I don't understand all the publicity this movie got but to those musical fans, I am sure it was great.  I hand it to the folks behind the scense such as the wardrobe and makeup artists.  They did a great job.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|After watching the BBC program on this subject, I downloaded the book and it filled in all the questions for me. I'm now preparing for a long and healthy life!
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|This story has been told before sometime during my life.  The movie is very predictable but I liked it.  It is a sweet love story and the actors did a great job.  It is a movie that I will watch again later and I am glad it is in my library of movies.
0762445262|5.0|I bought this as a goofy little gift for my sister in college. When it arrived in the mail I tested it out. It's totally cool. I have to buy one for my son now! When she got it in the mail she called me immediately. She was so happy. It's a cheap little toy but so much fun just to have it on your dresser.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|A beautiful case/book to store this series in. More than enough bonus features. Not too much to complain about besides it being a little difficult to get the discs out f some of the sleeves.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Play minecraft it is the best game in the universe and so I been told there's a legendary herobrine he is scary and also always tries to kill you so I 've been told by some people.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was a little slower to start than book one; however, once the story unfolded, the relationships that developed in book one grew deeper despite the Capitols attempt at tearing them apart. I love the honesty of Peeta and Katniss's friendship and I'm hoping that their fighting spirits bring about a satisfying resolution to this war.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|When the movie started I thought I was going to like it, but as time progressed I became more and more disenchanted with the whole thing. I guess it was an okay movie, but just not for me.
0553382179|5.0|This book has been helpful in my continual battle with perfectionism and procrastination.  De-cluttering and keeping my house clean 15 minutes at a time.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Watched this on Mother's Day with my sister and our families after a wonderful meal prepared by our son's.  How appropriate, we couldn't stop laughing.  The best, and we ALL agreed!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Unique and entertaining....you will relax when playing this cute game.  The price is right!  Why not give it a try?
006224454X|2.0|I had never heard of this and had no expectations. Our book club chose it. I did get into reading it straight away, but found myself getting very nitpicky about minor details. Others have mentioned the cell phone and how sche could know how to use it, and she also never seems to recharge it. I disliked that she threw herself at the doctor who she had only just met that day, in her mind. That was a pointless digression. I especially disliked that the devoted and loving husband quickly reappears when he hears the news, remembering to tell her that he lived with some one else for a while. And lets not forget he slept with her best friend. Both of those plot elements served zero purpose. And why wasn't anyone looking for her for the weeks she was being help captive? What about her son, who you would think would at least be checking in on mom, and should have been more than concerned to find out that Dad took Mom home, when Dad is in Italy. I was going to list some positives. Actually, the more I think about it, the less I like this book. Revising my three stars to two.
B007N8RULO|2.0|often have to restart because it dies between games.  sick of the ads i have to keep skipping and it is not always easy to get the control to display in order to skip the ad.  i pad version much better
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|A story of a family, a brother, two younger sisters and the parents. A story of love and loss. A beautiful and sad story well worth reading.
0316247545|4.0|This book's design is based on the book from the very first episode of the series. The first pages include the exact same story book pages featured in the first few minutes of the pilot.<br /><br />The book has no bar codes or tags on the hard cover to distract from the design of the book.<br /><br />I subtracted 1 star because the biggest section of the book are episode summaries. This would have been great if extra content such as commentaries or production art was included, but it is just a summary and a letter to the princess quote.<br /><br />Every other part of the book is perfect.
0307352153|5.0|Excellent book and research. A must read for everyone. A great learning experience backed by your own personal experience retrospectively  as well as daily experiences
B007TVANDM|5.0|my gran daughter loves this book and loves to sing with it.<br />Great for preschoolers and teaches them to keep going.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Fun book to read that has turned into a tradition- I read it to my kids & now I'm reading it to my grandchildren with on slight difference now it's digital. Now I have both this one & the 2nd one, \\"Another  Monster at The End of This Book \\" in one place =D !
B0017SWPXY|4.0|lots of insight from a dogs perspective...possibly.<br />touched my emotioins and kept my interest especially since<br />it was about racing.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|We were travelling for over a month &amp; the game kept us entertaint &amp; we also solved some difficult ones together. it was fun!
B007MB5OCE|3.0|there were parts of this book that kept my attention, but overall<br />way too wordy for me.  The concept was cute.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Very creative, good script, great casting. Embraces the past and gives the Star Trek franchise a new future at the same time. It lets us meet the characters anew.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I almost didn't read this last book because it got some crummy reviews.  Man!!  Were they wrong!!  This final Sookie book ended the only way it possibly could.  I think the folks that trashed it were hoping Sookie wouldn't stay true to her character.  Ha!  Charlaine Harris would never let that happen!!  I recommend this book to all the die-hard Sookie fans.  It was wonderful and left me feeling good about the whole series.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I so looked forward to the release of this book and was quickly disappointed when the storyline went from Gideon and Eva's problems to bringing everyone elses problems into the mix.  It didn't take long to figure out this wasn't the end.  Save yourself $9.99, this book isn't worth it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was curious about the book,  It had an unusual name which sounded rather mysterious.  It seemed to promise a little bit of the unusual & not ordinary.  IT  did not dissapoint
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|hafbrick studios have done another awesome game!<br />this is way cooler than fruit ninja; try it out for yourself and see:)
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Of course the book was better than the movie. The book eluded that Idgie and Ruth might be gay. That was the only thing g I didn't like.  I prefer it to be a friendship kind of love.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I Loved  this book a lot it was so loving  my favorite character is peata he sounds so strong and loving and handsome  I love him I want to each the movie I bet  that he is very  cut !!!!!!!!!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is so fun. I play it alll the time. I'm so glad this game was made. I have become addicted to it. I love it. Great for Kindle fire.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This game is okay i didn't know it was a kid's game when i selected it but it is lot's of fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book, read it about 5x already, it's funny, emotional, and lots of hot sex scenes. I hope there is mire to come, would love to see Christian's side of these stories.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|Good book.  Delivers what it promises.  I highly recommend it.  It has become my nightly review before I sleeping.  I am very pleased.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is very similar to the spider game on my desktop. It allows me to continue to have fun on the go.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book teaches you so many things about life . Cant stop reading it over and over again. So good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is great for skills and is entertainment for everyone and is great fun nice and very awesome that is hard to stop playing on your electronic
B001R60ESE|5.0|I really enjoyed this Chris Botti performance.  The clarity of his trumpet playing is amazing.  The array of musical genres he played highlighted his versatility and it was wonderful to see the mix of musical stars, young and old, those famous in their own right and those up-and coming, who performed with him.<br /><br />The musical quartet who played with him were outstanding.  Billy Childs playing on the piano and Billy Kilson on drums were superlative demonstrating both mastery and passion. Dominic Miller on Guitar and Robert Hurst on bass were also superlative.  A wonderful addition to my musical DVD collection.
B002U3CCBK|4.0|&#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34; is a brilliant book! So interesting from a scientific view; but also well written. A rewarding read - I recommend it!
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele simply has a beautiful voice and it was put on full display at the Royal Albert Hall.  I had heard only a few Adele songs before but after listening to this DVD I am a true believer.  This is not a manufactured voice, this is sheer vocal talent. She really engaged her audience and while sometimes I found it off-putting I realised it provided relief from the sheer intensity of raw  emotion conveyed by her music.  Her lyrics are so beautiful but often so sad......<br /><br />The quality of the sound on the DVD I found to be excellent.  This DVD is worth adding to your collection
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is fun an has good graphics. Plus it has guns that some people don't even know about. It's fun an worth while.
159463176X|3.0|I was a big fan of Mr. Hosseini's first two books and the first 150 or so pages of this one.  Of course, those pages included an assisted suicide and euthanasia, so everything was not rosy.  It was all downhill after that first portion, though.<br /><br />The book starts with a spell bounding fable told by the father.  The meat of the fable then comes true.  We get to follow the young daughter and then her uncle through the first half of the book in two separate stories.  Mr. Hosseini then seemed to lose track.  The last 250 pages are a collection of character studies of people only tangentially attached to the first two accounts.  He then tries to tie them all together at the end.  It almost seemed as if Mr. Hosseini had these very different character studies written and then tried to fit them together to make a book.  It didn't work.  The writing is good, but there was no plot or strong thread to connect the character studies.  Several of the studies were so short that the reader did not get a chance to appreciate or empathize with the character.<br /><br />I give this a three star rating only because the first 40% was so good.  Time would be better spent rereading KITE RUNNER or A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS.
B007QSNMS6|4.0|I love the conversational style of writing. Plenty of real world examples that help cement the principles that have the potential to propel your ideas
B008IJT0CE|1.0|Did not download!  So much for free...<br />Would have loved to receive, but it never down loaded. Tried two times.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I can't believed what just happened I started playing this game the day I received my kindle fire which was February I was on level 96 ranked 3 and it updated and I LOST everything I mean everything I even had to even download the game again. I am so so blaaaaa absolutely love the game it's a ton of fun just sad an update and I LOST everything. I would give a 5 if I would not have lost everything but only a 3 cuz I did.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|It's super fun when it works but it hasn't worked in months.  The support on it is pathetic they never fix anything your report.  Right now it says that is all my opponents turn but they say it's my turn so you can't even play.  I would gladly play it if the fixed it but right now it sucks.
B003ICWTTM|3.0|I am a huge Bruce fan.I was looking forward to see this DVD but i was a little dissapointed.Its not with the concert per se or Bruce's performance.As always they were great.The problem that i had with this concert is that i didnt like the set list.I mean, come on, Bobby Jean? Good lovin? Seeds? Jungleland? Out in the Street? Dont get me wrong,this songs are great and i have heard them lots of times.But that's precisely the problem.This songs should not have been included in the DVD because we have heard them lots of times before in other formats.For me it was a little tiresome to hear those songs again.Do i recommend this DVD? Yes, i will, but with a caveat: you have heard most of the songs previously.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|I cant stop playing this game! I am always trying to get a new highscore! also great for all ages. one thing where's the update?
B009NY43NY|5.0|The book was great. A great way to end the series. The show on TV is great too. Can't wait till the next episode.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think this is a great app and I'm super excited that it came out for the kindle. I'm just bummed it doesn't have the new update.
B000I3UAJ0|3.0|This was a good set up for the rest of the series but it is pretty slow moving at times.
0061714372|5.0|I have read many autobiographies about rock stars/bands and this one stands out as one my favorites. Even if you don't like Dave you might like this one. A brutally honest, well-written account of the history of Megadeth and Dave's life and he spares no detail. I am a fan of Megadeth and I may be a little bias on this one but if you want to read about his side of the Metallica story read it!<br /><br />I would highly recommend it to a freind
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good read, kept my interest throughout the book.  Decent character development and unfolding of plot. I did like the ending even though it solved lots of problems
0525952926|4.0|This book takes up right after the fall of the giants and it was very interesting in reading about five interrelated families America, German, Russian, English and Welsh enter time of enormous social, political and economic turmoil. All of this is taking place in the time when the rise of the third Reich and also Spanish civil war and the great dramas of world war 2. Very interesting and a must read and a good book to add to your library collection.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|great movie. I don't know what more to say, it'll bend and then blow your mind. Take with you the ideas of inception into your daily life...
B007JWKLMO|5.0|It was good to see George talking, singing and alive again. We lost him too early But he's alive again, watching this excellent film.
B0091THDOM|5.0|This case is perfect for what I need. It is small, lightweight, good quality and feels amazing. Definitely recommending it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Incredible series, the acting is supurb and the quality of the series in just fabulous I wish I had time to sit all day and just watch the series
B007A2O3FO|4.0|I am a great fan of Maggie Smith and bought this film simply because she is in it. The story is simple, but I enjoyed it a lot.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This movie is awesome to watch and the action is good and great to see Harrison Ford and some of the other actors in the movie with him. great movie to get and watch with family and friends.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Love this CD by the Lumineers. It's a great piece of artistry by a talented group. Hope they keep making music!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Very helpful to stay in touch with weather alerts, especially when traveling.  I have it on both my Kindle and mobile phone.
B007SGM084|5.0|A big change in what I normally read, I had to find out what all the hype was about.<br />Now I must go find me a Mr. Grey!<br />I hope she will continue this book series, I'm terribly sad it's over.<br />I have to admit this book put a nice spark in my flame!
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|Not having read the books, I have nothing to compare Tom Cruise too.  We enjoyed the movie but thought it a bit slow in the 1st half. Cruise was fine, did a creditable job. But we were glad we hadn't paid movie prices to see it.
B00C32REYI|3.0|Somehow, it is not what I expected, yet it is still truly James Blake. Retrograde is clearly an anthem for me now, I can't get enough of that song. And, I find myself with about half of them singing in my head at any point. There is still a vital component missing from the overall album. I listen to it a lot, but my attention is never held through the second half of the album.<br /><br />I am going to keep at it and see if it starts to sink in.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought they had taken another dear to my heart childhood TV show and turn it into a complete piece of comedy disaster.  Wacky comedy works for TV shows to movie like Saturday Night Live's Blue Brothers and Mchale's Navy but not on average. That why I skipped it in theaters.  When I came across it on HB0 last night I decided to give it a try. Much to my unexpected delight that first 45 minutes or so was dark with the Gothic under tones that my memories bring to mind of the old series without having reviewed the original stuff on You Tube. Course the movie is a bit camp but that is part of the films appeal to those who still love the drama of late 1960s and 1970s which one today would find a bit silly compare to modern Gothic horror works out there.  I did find some of the jokes dumb as you often get from a olden TV show turn movie like the McDonald's sign in the background after the vampire has fed in one scene considering you had Dark shadows in late 1960s and early 1970s, House of Dark Shadows in 1970s, Night of dark Shadows in early 1980s and Dark Shadows Revival in 1990s Tim had a lot of Dark Shadows material to try to fit into a working story plot for his film.

B008J34466|1.0|Except for one or two songs it is the worst cd I have ever bought. The language is SO juvenile. Why does Pink feel she has to use foul language in order to be cool. She should GROW UP.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I kept seeing this book on recommended lists.  I caved and bought it and fell in love! Travis Maddox is my new book boyfriend!!!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I appreciate the messages the producers have in the movie, look for them and you'll find them.<br /><br />The comedy is also pretty good. (A lot of Canadian style humor).<br />Its a good way to kill some time.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Dicaprio always seems capable of picking good scripts - I rely on his judgement when looking for movies worth watching. The story line is engaging, and overall it's an enjoyable view!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I think that it is the best book ever. I don't think it could be better! Hats off to Suzanne Collins!!!!!!!!
B005LAIHZY|1.0|As a 27 year old female who still enjoys kids movies once in awhile I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Merida is a disobedient girl who almost kills her mother and endangers the lives of everyone but still somehow we are supposed to forget this because she is standing up for herself. Being true to oneself doesn't mean casting a spell to be rid of all your problems. Dealing with them does. Learning how to communicate with your parents and peers effectively does. Please please skip this movie. Try Mulan or Pocahontas instead.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Good story got a real idea what slavery was  my favorite  character was the German Dentist, outstanding cast .On the negative very violate and the movie was very long.
B0083DJWGO|3.0|Antifragile has several good ideas and some interesting thoughts on how society, business, government, and people operate.  It's hard to summarize but its main thesis seems to be that interventionary tactics frequently do more harm than good, and exposure to risk and volatility may be a good thing.<br />Although the book is a worthwhile read, I have a few bones to pick.<br /><br />1. It assumes that the average reader has the freedom and ability to do everything the book suggests, like make enough money to be comfortable (what Taleb calls f***-you money), then spend your free time dabbling in the creative / entrepreneurial pursuits that interest you.  That way, if a recession comes or the housing market crashes, you'll have enough irons in the fire that you can adapt and benefit while others suffer.  Sorry, but the vast majority of people don't have this luxury.  They need their \\"fragile\\" middle class jobs to support their families.<br /><br />2. Its thesis can't be proven.  Taleb lists many scenarios in which there is no evidence that an interventionist strategy has actually worked - from the Fed adjusting interest rates to doctors screening for cancer - and concludes that it's better to do nothing and let nature / the free market / evolution take its course.  But the author doesn't feel the need to prove his alternate point of view because, as he says, data can only be used to DISprove a theory, not prove it.  So for him, the fact that there is no conclusive evidence that something works is reason enough not to do that thing.  And to call anyone who advocates the opposite view a fraud and a charlatan (which he does frequently).<br /><br />3. It goes to extremes.  For instance, I agree that society is overmedicated with unnecessary prescription drugs.  And maybe we don't really need SPF lotion to protect against the same sunlight that shone down on our ancestors.  But Taleb actually questions whether TOOTHPASTE is beneficial or merely a way for companies to make money.  I think I'll keep brushing my teeth on the off chance that those 4 out of 5 dentists were right and not just in the pocket of Big Colgate.<br /><br />4. It contradicts itself.  For instance, Taleb challenges an oil exec who argues there is no evidence that fossil fuels are harming the environment.  He says that Mother Nature usually knows best, we are disturbing the natural system by using so much gas and oil, and the burden should be shifted to show that such actions are NOT harming the environment.  Great, I agree.  But how would we do this?  Why, government regulation - precisely the interventionist strategy that Taleb says is ruining society and the free market.
B009MYARIK|4.0|A truly fun romp. Well write, funny, zany. Would make a really fun film, too! Read it super fast, was addicting!
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|So disappointing.  My almost 3 year old daughter loves Sofia and couldn't wait to open the package.  The King and James do not stand at all.  At least James can sit.  The king just falls over again and again.  Even Amber has very unsteady feet and falls over.  Her head popped off as I was taking her out of the packaging and fell off twice after that.  I just opened the package today.  I wish I had read the reviews before I did.  She gets so frustrated trying to stand these characters up to no avail.  The only characters that seem to stand properly are the mother and Sofia.  It's not a cheap product to buy.  Too bad it was apparently so cheap to make!
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Installed this in a new HP LaserJet Pro 400 Color MFP (M475dn) printer and it works perfectly and resolved several errors my users were getting when printing large documents.  HP genuine part was listed at $599!  That is almost as much as a new printer.
1451627297|5.0|I have never been a big Stephan king fan but i have followed the Kennedy assassination all my life so I was curious about this accounting story it took a while to read as this is a big book (about 4 inches thick) it was a page turner ! but he is very wrong in it nice story and it was fun reading but if you think this is a factual addition to the conspiracy theory I have news for you like I said earlier it has been proven by MIT (Massachusetts institute of technology ) that using models and  physics all of the facts point to Oswald easily committing the crime I am keeping the book which came in great shape and arrived in a timely manner because like i said it was fun to read
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|Package arrived one day early. The box appeared to be slightly crushed. This could've been done by the shipper and did not hurt the product quality. I am extremely pleased with this product. It is longer than any charger i would ever need. It is also a lot more durable than the oem apple lighting cord. It fit with no problem into my otterbox commuter series case.I would recommend this product to anyone with an iPhone 5 or iPad 4.
B002CVQAX6|5.0|I love this movie so when I found it in blue-ray on Amazon it was a no brainer came in better shape then described  and for the price you cant complain
0425263924|1.0|Thought I was reading one of those poorly written Fifty shades books. Was not smooth at all. If you want to skip all you need to know is they have sex get married and that's it. I kept expecting it to get good and now I'm pissed. I would almost believe that someone else wrote this one. I couldn't stand it when the release date got put off a month. Anticipation was going to kill me. Now I don't know if I will waste time on the next 2 books.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|I have loved this movie for years but had to watch it on vhs  because it was never on dvd  now that is history as this dvd is great
B008ROG6E0|5.0|Never gets old.  Get it? Cause getting old is the mystery here?<br /><br />Don't judge me.<br /><br />Seriously though, here's a movie that manages to transcend its 70s origins and be good no matter when you watch it.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|this cd is wonderful. I loved every song on this cd, I normally do not like every song on a cd, but this was an exception. Boz Scaggs still has it, that lovely voice especially on Georgia.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|No one does revenge porn like Tarantino.  People have complained that the N Bomb gets dropped a lot.  That's because its a movie about slavery.  The violence is brutal and, like other Tarantino movies, you find yourself laughing and yet horrified at the same time.

B00AZMFK3K|1.0|First let me say that before you read my review, that I will present a few spoilers so if you don't want to know what happens in the film, please skip my review.  Having said that I would like to also mention that I have been a fan of Star Trek, Star Trek The Animated Series, Star Trek The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise and even the comics while growing up. Being that I am of the first generation of fans who grew up watching TOS of Star Trek when it was in re-runs(I grew up in the 80's and 90's), I developed a strong sense as to what Star Trek is and as to why I have enjoyed it so much.  As such,  I would like to say that because I have enjoyed Star Trek in all its various incarnations that I am strongly against the work of what JJ Abrams has done with the franchise.<br /><br />As a fan, and even as a consumer, we all have an understanding of what brands are and the differences between brands.  For example, most consumers can tell the difference between drinking a glass of Coca Cola to drinking a glass of Pepsi. Or even the difference between eating a turkey Hungry Man TV Dinner and the taste of one's mother's Thanksgiving Turkey dinner.  As human beings, we all develop a strong sense of what is palatable and the difference between what we do not like and why we do not like something; as well as what our expectations are for things such as food, and for the purposes of this review, films.<br /><br />Well while watching JJ Abram's Star Trek Into Darkness, I can truly say that it left an awful taste in my mouth and it left my Star Trek palette extremely confused. Was I watching his future attempt to direct the next franchise of Star Wars films? Or was I watching a space movie that simply had the Star Trek name attached to it?<br /><br />I came to the conclusion that both answers were correct because when it comes down to it, the core of this movie is not Star Trek. For example the actor who plays Scotty seems to be doing a bad parody of James Doohan, the same goes for the actor who plays Spock, they seemed to be acting as not characters, but instead playing caricatures.  This is especially played out with Dr. McCoy's character, as he is essentially relegated to continuously tell us that \\"He's a doctor not a (fill in the blank)\\" caricature.<br /><br />The cast, the reboot, the story, it doesn't work and that is for several reasons.<br /><br />Why? For that I need to refer back to the writing as viewed in the original series.  Star Trek The Original Series at its core was not simply a recyclable tale of good vs. evil.  Gene Roddenberry wrote Star Trek as being very Shakespearean.  This doesn't mean that you have to be familiar with the works of William Shakespeare to enjoy Star Trek, but instead it means that Roddenberry used several stylistic elements borrowed from Shakespeare which translated into great science fiction drama that had a good mix of action, drama, romance, and most important, storyline.<br /><br />After The Original Series Ended and Star Trek The Next Generation, as well as DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise were broadcast, the writers of each of the Star Trek television shows continued writing Star Trek episodes in the same style of Roddenberry in order to match and be consistent with what Roddenberry wanted Star Trek to be.  This is what I have enjoyed most as a fan of Star Trek was that I could watch any of the shows and any of the movies(excluding JJ Abrams) and the style of the writing would essentially be within what Gene Roddenberry intended Star Trek to be.  Granted many Trek fans have differing opinions on the quality of the various writers of each of The Next Generation era series, I don't think that any Star Trek fan could say in good conscience that any of those writers attempted to remake Star Trek into something it wasn't (i.e. Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica).<br /><br />However JJ Abrams felt that he needed to remake Star Trek for \\"a whole new generation\\" whatever that means.  As a fan, I can honestly say that he has not remade anything instead he has copied the soul of Star Wars Episode I into each of his Star Trek Films.  In which case, I cannot understand how any true Star Trek Fan can enjoy Star Trek Into Darkness.  I came away watching the film feeling that the best parts of the film were the brief appearance by Leonard Nimoy and the original Star Trek music which is played at the very end of the film.<br /><br />ST Into Darkness had strong George Lucas feel to it in the beginning and then the movie began to deteriorate as it seemed as though the writers struggled to write all of the dialog as the dialog that is in the film seems rushed and felt as though it had no place.<br /><br />I was especially disappointed on the portrayal of Khan.  The original Khan from both Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan and his introduction in the TOS episode \\"Space Seed\\" showed us a very intelligent, calculated individual who came from a time when genetically engineered supermen fought to control Earth and did not appear until he was found by TOS Enterprise crew(go watch the TOS episode Space Seed if you don't know what I am referring to). Abram's portrayal of Khan tells us nothing of his origins(other than a few dimwitted explanations) and essentially portrays Khan as The Terminator.  I didn't like that because I felt it dumbs down the character.<br /><br />Another thing that I didn't like was the whole Spock-Uhura relationship.  When it comes down to it, it just doesn't work.  Uhura's character played by Nichelle Nichols, was that of a bright young woman whose role wasn't that of just someone who was played by a person of color, but whose role was essentially to the crew.  However JJ Abrams has also dumbed down Uhura to be that of a whiny, moody woman who is angry with her boyfriend(Spock).  That's just poor writing and a misuse of a vital Star Trek Character.<br /><br />Also, I had a problem with the character of Dr. Carol Marcus.  While I admit, JJ Abrams had more leeway with this character because this character doesn't appear until Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan so I can't fault Abrams for ruining her character too much.  However I felt that the scene where she changes clothes on Mud's Ship was completely unnecessary and did not add any sense of sexiness to the film.  Female Star Trek fans should especially take note of this because obviously the message that JJ Abrams was sending was that Star Trek can't have female characters without making them into sex objects in order to keep the interest of the audience. That particular scene made absolutely no sense whatsoever, again this is due to poor writing and poor directing.<br /><br />Other than the brief appearance of the real Spock and the original music played at the end of the film, I cannot say that this film has any redeeming or entertaining qualities whatsoever. So to the real Star Trek fans out there, don't waste your time or your money.  If you feel any interest at all in watching ST Into Darkness, wait until you can watch it on cable/satellite or for when it is shown on broadcast TV for free.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that I sincerely hope that this is the last Star Trek film directed by JJ Abrams.  In addition, I have completely lost faith in Paramount and I hope that one day they will sell the film rights to Disney. Paramount seemed to think that Star Trek needed to be \\"rebooted\\" just like many movie companies feel that other classic movies need to be rebooted(Conan, Clash of the Titans, etc.).  What they don't realize is that classic movies are classic for a reason, that's because they are better.  Making Star Trek into an action shoot em up kind of movie doesn't work because it turns Star Trek into Star Wars, and no disrespect to Star Wars or fans of Star Wars, but the reality is that those two sci fi genres' is that they are completely separate types of science fiction and they should remain separate.<br /><br />That is not to say thatKirk and Spock shouldn't be played again by different actors, I have no problem with that, but stick to what Star Trek is and with Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future and storytelling style. JJ Abrams has completely deviated from this vision and as such, his ST films should be avoided.<br />****************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Update: 9/13/13<br /><br />I wanted to share these quotes from both LeVar Burton and William Shatner about JJ Abram's \\"reboots.\\"  They essentially have the same problem with JJ Abram's \\"star trek\\" that I do.<br /><br />\\"At the end of the movie, I really care about what happens to the characters ... but I'm pretty much missing Gene Roddenberry in J.J.'s interpretation ... and at the end of the day, that's just not OK for me. \\" - LeVar Burton<br /><br />\\"The Star Treks we were in told a more personal story. Told a story that had more soul to it\\" -William Shatner<br /><br />Also as of today, I read on several movie related news websites that JJ Abrams has confirmed that he will in fact not direct the next Star Trek film.  Hopefully between now and the next film, Paramount will do the right thing and leave the alternate star trek universe where it belongs, in the the garbage. I hope that Paramount will return Star Trek to original universe and timeline continuing the story with a whole new cast of characters instead of producing cheap star trek parody films that have been forced upon us by JJ and crew.  Good bye JJ Abrams and good riddance!

B0031R5K68|4.0|As with all Dan Brown stories the action starts on page one.  In this story he delves into the culture of the Masons, with all the symbolism and secrets for which this society is known (or should I say not known).  It is a real page turner, with lots of action to keep the reader engaged.<br /><br />The story follows a formula of having two narratives being played out in alternate chapters.  This formula driven story along with predictable situations, kept it at 4 stars for me.  It is not as good as his previous books but it is still one hell of a good read.  If you are planning any long hall flights, then this is the book for you!
B0002V7OI8|5.0|Amazon needs to get some new editorial reviewers.  Their reviewer makes this movie sound kind of silly.  It's not!  Deep impact is the best movie of this genre that I have ever seen. The characters are believable, as is the story line.  Another plus is that the whole family can watch it.

My kids gave me a Kindle and so I have downloaded the book and am having a hard time putting it down, but am also learning to enjoy my Kindle. I have always thought I wanted the book in my hands and it is surprising to find that I can enjoy the technology and buy books for about the price of the paperback, but not have to wait for them to come out in paperback. (Can't wait to see how this latest novel ends!)

0307271080|4.0|Americanah is written for the present day African Diaspora; in it you get the feel of globalization of labor force, the quiet or rather loud desperation of those for who seem have access to plenty of opportunities and education, those with access to a good education, decent housing and food in Africa; and yet there is this inert discontent that places them in a state of perpetually looking to the West for some form of economic redemption. Given the view the West has of who an African is and what Africa has got, I am glad Chimamanda decided to write the story. In this she really stayed true to her Ted talk of the Danger of a Single Story.<br /><br />Ife's journey is peppered by present day realities of the economic immigrants of Africa, the role a decent education plays in opening some doors but it doesnt shield an individual from the empty and dark days every immigrant goes through before finding their footing on the US/UK soil. In America we see Ife reconciling with who she is as a Black person and as an African. She takes thru a journey of social commentaries and observations - which sometimes become too preachy to the effect that I start feeling that if she wanted to write race commentary she could have done that. Through her relationship with Blaine and Curt we observe the safest interface of race and class. In truth it is very watered down, because in truth what mostly happens with most African immigrants they find themselves dating across racial categories and class, and that makes for a murky navigation.  As an African who is a recent returnee diasporan onto the African continent I can identify with the characters. The mental inventory of what could have been had IFE stayed in Nigeria, or chosen to return earlier... refusing to accept the fact that some fiber of your being, mental and cuisine palate has changed.<br /><br />In Obinze you see a man who despite being conflicted and humanely flawed, he finally makes it economically and is redeemed by the fact that he has the luxury to question the status quo. A beautiful safe adoring wife - we all know makes for life without passion.... until he finally trades it for a life where he is fulfilled beyond the money. Through Obinze she paints the picture of how folks can climb the economic ladder in Nigeria, somehow forming a permanent upper class.<br /><br />In all its a very well written book, a naked look at the realities of immigration, at least something you can give a very outward looking teenager to prepare them for the reality of some of the choices we make.<br /><br />Its an amazing read. I gave it four out of five stars because the blogs became too preachy.
147674355X|4.0|***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog ***<br /><br />Hopeless by Colleen Hoover<br />Book One of the Hopeless series<br />Publisher: Self-published, soon to be published by Atria Books<br />Publication Date: December 19, 2012 (again on May 7, 2013, with Atria Books)<br />Rating: 4 stars<br />Source: Bought from Amazon<br /><br />Summary (from Goodreads):<br /><br />Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than believing the lies...<br /><br />That's what seventeen-year-old Sky realizes after she meets Dean Holder. A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her she's never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.<br /><br />Sky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing he's nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isn't at all who he's been claiming to be. When the secrets he's been keeping are finally revealed, every single facet of Sky's life will change forever.<br /><br />What I Liked:<br /><br />This review is not going to be very long because there is not much I can say about how incredibly powerful and intense this book is. I believe that to understand it, you need to read it. This book is complex on so many levels, and throws so many curveballs at readers.<br /><br />Hopeless has many parts, but the romance is definitely a good one with which to start. I love Sky and Holder together. Their relationship is rocky, undulating, and so sweet. I like that it was not love at first sight, and that they really explored their feelings once they acknowledged them (which was pretty quickly). There is no love triangle (YAY!), which adds to how much I love the romance in this book!<br /><br />Sky is an amazing herione. She so psychologically complicated. She lives with basically no social life, no internet, no connections. She is homeschooled. Basically, she is cut off from society, until her senior year of high school, in which she begs her adoptive mother to let her go to school for one year.<br /><br />I love learning about Sky's past, and why the stars on the ceiling are so important (trust me, they appear many, many times. Watch out for that). When her past finally came, it hit me hard. Terrifyingly hard. I did NOT expect any of that. Well, when I heard about her father, then yes, a little. But everything seemed so real and astonishing when I got to it. I know this sounds super vague, but you will understand if/when you read Hopeless!<br /><br />Holder is... well, not many words can describe Holder. Intense is how Sky describes him. He lives life passionately, and throws himself into whatever he wants with a fierce drive. Oh, and he's definitely a yummy male hero. I like him alot, but not because he is a pretty face. By the end, you cannot help but like him, after all the time he has stuck with Sky.<br /><br />Just read the book, guys. Trust me. You will not regret it.<br /><br />What I Did Not Like:<br /><br />Sky's decision-making processes boggled me sometimes. Again, you have to read it to know to what I am referring, but sometimes, I just had to put the book down and shake my head. BUT. There are so many reasons why she reacts the way she does. I understand. But I do not necessarily agree with her.<br /><br />You are probably wondering, why then, if you had barely any problems with this book, did you knock off a star? Well, to be honest, it just did not feel like a 5-star book to ME. I love this book, but I am not sure if I would read it again. At least, in the near future. It is so powerful, and so good, and it has that lasting effect on me, but it does not feel like a 5-star book. Again, to ME.<br /><br />Would I Recommend It:<br /><br />TOTALLY! Anyone could read this book and love it. It is a great contemporary read, light at the beginning, but complicated and heart-wrenchingly amazing from the second half and to the end. Great romance, great plot, fantastic writing. Colleen Hoover has it all in this book!<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />4 stars. WARNING: this book may make you cry :)ove it.

B00BESKTMG|1.0|I was given the impression this was a Tarantino film, but it turned out he was just a producer or something.  The whole movie just seemed like en ego-trip for RZA.  I guess he does music for Tarantino and let them use his name in the promotions, although he had little to no involvement.  I encourage you to make your own opinion, but I wish I could &#34;unwatch&#34; this one.

At the same time I liked that there were some unique twists like that he came to &#34;bury&#34; the guy not help him, or that he was kind of a retired drifter.  Probably won't buy it, but I did watch my rental twice.  I liked it, check it out.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|...that it was &#34;just the greatest love story ever!&#34;  Ugh.  They were wrong.  If I ever met a man like Christian Grey I would be immediately turned OFF.  I never respected Anastasia as a character, either.  The writing is just bad.  I understand the fascination readers are having, but a great piece of literature--even for this genre--it is not.  The sex is steamy, but even it becomes contrived after the first few scenes.  At times it is just ridiculous.  Additionally, I'm troubled by the overriding patriarchy of Christian and his objectification of his &#34;romantic&#34; interest (Anastasia).
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|This  book is an easy read and covers a lot of need to know stuff. I started building my own system out of what is in this  book and things are working nicely.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a great app because it allows you to see how much longer you have to wait when charging your kindle.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ugh! Left me hanging at the end! I need book four like now!!! I need to know more about Gideon and Eva.
B006ID01OS|5.0|A great read that provides invaluable insight and information about how and why to implement strategic planning within your organization. Clarifies misconceptions and provides useful information for educating others about this important, if not critical area of business.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Great return to form for the new Paramore. A lot of people were concerned that the Farro brothers leaving would signify a decline in musical and lyrical quality for Paramore. To be honest, I feel that both the sound and the lyrics feel less constrained now. This album is great and I look forward to what comes next.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another amazing installment. Ending wasn't what I expected, hoping for a little more conclusion. Def a great read tho. Thanks
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Nothing happened in this 3rd book , it was dull and literally boring !!!! Sylvia phoned this one in  !! She should of spent her valuable writing time writing a half decent ending instead of constantly updating her FB page in the lead up to release date !! She makes E.L James look like a literary genius after this half assed attempt ....
1439130833|5.0|I haven't read all 365 &#34;daily teachings&#34; yet. So far the daily teachings that I have read are very inspiring. It is a great follow- up resource for &#34;The Secret&#34; video or book. This book is a simple way to help get through some personal, tough times. It helps you to see the big picture that we all are connected and can help each other by showing gratitude.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Talk about an amazing cast and fantastic script. The best way to describe it is its about real estate salesmen, but its not only interesting, it is enthralling.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I play this CD all the time in my vehicle and in my home. This kicks ass and I enjoy turning up the sound level to hear Joe's guitar make it sing. This is a must have for all of Joe's fans or even if you are just a blues lover like myself. Beth Hart also sings an awesome \\"Take Care Of You\\" that is great listening to.
B002WQZHJO|5.0|Denzel delivers as a great antagonist. Chemistry is great. Tension is palpable. Really great story for a darker cop movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game but when is next update coming out I want to know<br />otherwise this game is awsome. :)
B000006NPY|5.0|I liked this album it's one of my favorites. My other favorites are Oceania and MCIS I found this album dark yet beautiful...
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love this book. What Max Brooks does is creates an alternative future that feels very real. I highly recommend this book to zombie fans and fan of political thrillers alike.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't care if this book is sad. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Not only is it well written, it has taught me more about life than any other book. I have read other books about people dying of cancer but none of the others touched my heart like this one did. All of the other books had the main character having the same out look on life. They all were hopeful and wanting the best for what time they had left. I was glad to see the author bring a new point of view on what it is really like to live with cancer. I enjoyed reading Hazel's view point on what it is like to live with cancer. I highly recommend this book to everyone. But I warn you, I did cry multiple times.
B00BPA2PEI|5.0|disc not 4K, but mastered in 4K, a great upgrade over my DVD. the Lossless Audio is great. Recommended. 5 stars.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|I bought all concerts who Ringo Starr and his friends, in all times.<br />This concert in 2012, is excellent, like the others one<br />I like it, and this in my recomendations for lovers of rock.<br />Hector Leon
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|FINALLY ,A game that all ages can be Triumphant.<br />HOURS of Fun that the whole family can enjoy.<br />And it puts the game back in gaming.<br />A 5yr old could be a champion over his elders.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|character development a bit thin; no difficulty telling the bad guys from the good ones. Excellent descriptions of the Welsh coal fields and the White/red confrontations in Siberia after ww1.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great fun if you like jigsaw puzzles.  Pictures are beautiful.  No concentration. No knowledge ~ just plan fun & pure enjorment.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|This is an excellent American adaptation of one of the best British dramas of the 80s and 90s. As such, while I enjoyed it, and marveled at the sheer joy of evil that Spacey's character found totally normal, it does pale in comparison.<br /><br />Summary: enjoy this, but get the British version and be truly impressed.
0099579936|3.0|I don't see what everyone is so excited about. I find I can't get past the first part of the book... I keep trying. All the people that love it, have to have a reason!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|So far, this is the best keyboard I have seen at predicting and correcting my typing. The swipe features never worked well, though and I have turned those off.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|Dawes has been listening to Jackson Brown and Eagles. And taken it to the year 2013. Nice! keep on guys!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Great film, Daniel Day Lewis took an amazing part, Great film right til the end. The packaging was good, the film in the condition it should and came well before the estimated delivery date. The film itself was fantastic.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|Not up to par vs. their previous work. The CD is a solid effort, and a worthy addition to my collection.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I think it's cute. All girls have a creative side. This helps bring out that creative side. There are a bunch of combinations to choose from. Lots of creativeness. I also like the fact that I can take pictures. I'm obsessed with taking pictures. But I really like this app.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Engaging and thought provoking life review narrative offering both the benefits of time spent with oneself on a literal and figurative journey as well as the optimistic premise that positive change is possibly just ahead of us. Additional whimsies are the myriad characters that weave their ways across our paths.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love the design much easier to see than the others. Wish I could undo,maybe I can and just haven't found it yet. I really do like the design.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a relly good app my son loves it I like this app I think it is a five star app
193700788X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It wrapped up the series nicely. Cameo appearances from characters in previous books add to the suspense of how the story will end. I may have to read the series again from the start.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Like the new birds & love the bouncing feature in some of the new games. Found it more challenging. More obstacles to deal with.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|After the opening 80s heavy rock salvo, Tom Keifer proceeds to give us a great demonstration of what a rocker really is.  Following an homage to rock country, something 80s rockers seem to be doing as of late, in The Flower Song, the rest is pure rock `n' roll.  The scream tells us that Keifer is still ready to rock even if his vocal chords don't always agree.<br /><br />A moment to point out that Keifer lost his voice after the last Cinderella tour, had several surgeries, plus a divorce and the loss of his mother to cancer.  None of the surgeries seem to help.  He finally discovered that he had nodes on his lungs (successfully removed) and a permanently paralyzed left lung.  He relearned to sing after his bout with depression and started writing.  He wrote for nine years, and toured off and on with Cinderella.  Finally, he realized that us rockers are not dancin' `gently into that goodnight'.  So, with the backing of his second wife and his daughter, he fought through his vocal lessons to record his first solo album.<br /><br />Every number is a fine rocker and does Keifer's voice justice.  No one can tell he has to warm up for hours before singing.  I would like to say I found one bad song, but I didn't. (What true music lover isn't looking for that `one' song to solo out and complain about?)  It sounded so good the first time, I played it straight through again.  And then proceeded to listen, just one more time, to my `already' favourites: Solid Ground, A Different Light and The Way Life Goes (and he oughta know).  I love the way he turns Welcome to My Mind, into min-duh!  Hey, I feel that way about my crazy thoughts, too!  Duh!<br /><br />Keep rockin' whenever you can, Tom, and blessing all your fans with more, more, more!<br />God does groove in mysterious ways, my friend.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a perfect alarm clock and weather app. I am glad I found this. I love that you get to choose the style of the clock, along with all the other customizations. I had another clock app that I deleted because I love this one much better. Highly recommend!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome!! It would be better if you start off with 2000,0$. And please add MORE VEHICLES AND UPGRADES because those are even awesomer!!

B00AK57N00|1.0|shameless ripoff of Stick Swing. Wind, gravity, landing on platforms and getting combos for hitting the middle. Its just stick swing with slightly different graphics
B002N44XSG|5.0|The exiting adventure continues to excite the fans. An awesome book with romance, confusion, and mystery.It was fascinating with the interviews
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series! Am looking forward to watching season 3, the characters are great. And it's fun to see how the rich lived in the past.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I don't get some of the criticism in the reviews that have a lot of feedback.  Yes, the male lead was a little over the top - agreed.  He would wear me out with the mood swings, anger, etc.  But this book covered character development, plot, backgrounds, and resolutions very well.  I loved the friendship of the two main female characters and the relationship of America and Shep.  I liked the involvement of family and backgrounds.  Travis was a little much, but in the end, Abby was probably the only one who could handle him given her background.  I agree with all of the other 5 star reviews, this is one of the more complete, emotionally charged books that I've read so far.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Each chapter was a separate story that eventually intertwined with the others. Hosseini writes so well. Wish he could have gone into more detail with each of the characters.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|If you've stopped believing that love is real and fate has a hand in it buy this movie!  It will make you believe in possibilities again!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|These guys are great. Good puzzles and lovable characters. I have completed the first set and really enjoyed it. Don't stop working on Cut The Rope though!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|These little books are a tease!! Let's have a real full length novel!!!!!#<br />Good read but sick of paying and waiting to happily<br />Ever after
B00CBKLO52|5.0|Haven't had much time to play this. Just a couple times but like Pilot it seems very fun and interesting. Again, once I get used to the controls it will be more fun. It is kind of a change forcing my mind to think the way I need to in order to control the plane.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book will suck you in from the first page! It is beautifully and masterfully written. Each character is clearly defined and the resultant story flows until the end. I cannot recommend the book with anything less than fanaticism! You won't be disappointed.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Well, it was a good device when it worked, but like another reviewer mine has died. Unfortunately for me, I don't use it very often so by the time it died I was outside of the return window.<br /><br />EDIT: Anker was kind enough to send me a free replacement for the bad item. It has a longer warranty period than what I could find on Amazon, so all is OK now. The new item is working so far and Anker's customer service was excellent after contacting me as a result of my first review.
1612183956|5.0|I have read literally thousands of books and not one ever like this.  Wow!  The ending and premise is both genius and shocking.  This book is full of shocks and surprises right up until the very end.  You feel like a passenger in an out-of-control cab driven by a a madman.  You just don't know what will happen next.<br /><br />Ethan Burke is a Secret Service agent who has been sent to the town of Wayward Pines, Idaho, to find two missing agents, one of whom he has been having an affair with.  Ethan just arrives in town when he is in a car accident ad wakes up in the hospital.  That's when things start to turn weird. Weird like he's not allowed to leave the hospital or call anyone and they take all his stuff and won't give it back. So, Ethan escapes only to discover that he can't!  The town is surrounded by an electric fence and the sheriff is not amused by his antics.  At all!  Ethan questions whether he is insane or whether everyone else it.  When Burke next discovers the mutilated bodies of the missing FBI agents, he knows he is in over his head.  And, that just the beginning of this wild ride!<br /><br />This is definitely a sci-fi read but you dont' find that out until later, at the end.  It reminded me of the recent Tom Cruise movie Oblivion.  The author said that one of his writing inspirations was the TV series Twin Peaks.  It has a very Stepford Wives-creepy feel to it.  It has that weird and off-kilter vibe to it.  It is the first in the series and I am ardently looking forward to the next installment.
B004K8WPUQ|2.0|THis piece of s***, I really didn't like it. Its not even worth the price and its made cheaply. I'd pass.
0375869026|5.0|great book  I recommend it  Highly to anyone  who is looking for answers  of a spiritual as well as physical nature
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is so awesome I play it every day idk what they could do to make it better that's how awesome it is
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|I love this show!! I watched all three seasons in less than a week. I am not a fan of BBC television, but I was hooked from the first show, Season 1. I was mortified at the horrible ending of season three, but, Actors come and go. I wish they would not have made it so final, so the possibility of Matthew's return would have been there. Oh well... Now, I will have to get my fix with Upstairs Downstairs, until Season 4 brings all of the wonderful characters back to the TV screen.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|I saw this live with Diana Damrau as Lucia and loved it.  Netrebko is not a tyypical bel-canto soprano for this role, and not as good as Damrau, who was stellar, but I think very effective dramatically.  Beczala is as terrific as always.  Personally, I liked the victorian ghost story presentation.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This is an excellent, intelligent and thoughtful book. Amidst all the junk best sellers today, this book is a refreshing surprise and gift to all of us. The narrative is smart, poignant and gives an enduring message for modern society. Give yourself a treat and read this book slowly and thoughtfully.
0340928654|1.0|This (Hodder Graphics publisher version) is an abridged version of the text on comic book like pictures-- NOT the real book.  The listing is confusing, as it appears to be the actual book by Steinbeck, but from my understanding only includes excerpts of the story.<br /><br />Amazon is wrongly lumping ALL the reviews for the title together-- even though this version is not the same as the classic.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book to help a student understand the text because he or she has reading or learning issues, or developmental challenges, this might be a good resource.  It also includes discussion materials.  Alternatively it could be appropriate for middle school students.<br /><br />My one star is simply a reflection of how little information the book listing gives about the actual contents of this book, and that it is listed as an \\"edition\\" of the book alongside other editions of the full text.  A book that is a \\"graphic text designed to support learning for the GCSE English Literature Exam (I think it's British?)\\" isn't the actual book and shouldn't be placed as a different printing of the classic.  I had a student order this on accident when he wanted the actual, entire book by Steinbeck.<br /><br />If you have no problems reading, it's difficult and confusing in the way that the text is organized-- essentially it's hard to read at times because of how broken up the text is.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This is a great thriller indeed. I loved it. Not so many writers are able to write this well nowadays. Besides, the story is pure fun. It gets you from the first page to the ending. I'm going to advise a lot of friends to read Operation Armada.

B000IZ4R1U|5.0|This is an oldie but goodie. This movie is what introduced the world to Angelina Jolie as a force to be reckoned with when it comes to an action hero. She definitely gives new meaning to the phrase &#34;Girl power&#34;
B002ZG997C|5.0|It's hard to praise this movie without giving something away.  So, I will just say this is a surprisingly uplifting action movie.

1476712042|5.0|This book is by far one of the best that I have read in a long time.  It's the story of two people that are meant to be, but she is trying to resist him due to her past.  It is a refreshing read to have a man in a romance chasing the girl and not having it be the other way around.  This book had the perfect amount of tension and chemistry.  The secondary characters added a lot to the story and helped make the story as good as it was.  At times I felt like Abby was too obstinent to Travis on principle.  But, I think it added some to the story.  After reading this, I ready Walking Disaster, which isn't a sequel, but a book from Travis' POV during the same time frame.  Which was awesome.<br /><br />Once you finish BD, you'll think, do I really want to risk ruining this lovely story and awesome ending by reading WD.  I guarantee you, that will NOT happy.  Run, don't walk, to get WD and devour it just as fast as you did BD.  It's awesome and love how you hear about Travis' unwaivering love for Abby.  Awesome reads.  I can foresee reading these books over and over and over and over again...already on #3 re-read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesomely epic and fun great hours of fun playing with my cousin but for some reason it won't update at all witch is really weird (considering my cousins did and mine didn't) but good over all
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I liked this book a lot.  I loved Bared to you and Reflected and this book was very good.  I feel that most of the bad reviews are coming from readers that are upset about the book taking so long to come out, and that is more about the publisher not Sylvia Day.  This book was very comforting - finally a solid relationship between Eva and Gideon.  They have joined forces and are taking on the world instead of fighting eachother.  I don't want to add and spoilers but I really liked how they committed to eachother and how quickly it happened.  And also that it happened so fast with no second thoughts.  My only complaint is like all others that there was not an ending.  No cliffhanger, the book just ended.  I was expecting at least a few more pages so when I turned my kindle page, BAM, the book was over.  I was pretty upset about that.  It's almost like once they decided to do a fourth book, they just stopped this one.  So strange.  I think the other issue was how long the wait was, that the suspense really built up the book and what it might hold.  I think it almost didn't have a chance of being as well recepted as the other two.  Too high of expectations on everyone's part.  Nonetheless, I'll be reading all future books, as I love Gideon and Eva and their relationship.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great. I have it for the computer and didn't think this could be as good. It needs some updates but is still really fun. You need and I mean need to get this game
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Toy Story 2 is a good family movie, the kids really loved it and so did we.  We need more movies like this.
B00A77II0U|4.0|The story was good but the game play was a bit redundant. Every time you turn around you need a key to open a door or you need to find an item that is missing to fix something. A little more story in between things would have been nice. All-in-all it was a good game.
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|I've never seen the movie so I can't rate it.  We wanted to watch the movie so we rented this but when we tried to view it, it stuck on one frame and all we got was the audio.  We waited and waited but never got to see the movie.  Granted, the problem was probably our internet service being too slow but I've rented from other sites that actually allow you to download the movie to your computer and watch it offline...then it magically disappears after the allotted time.  I think I'll stick to those rather than trying to watch on-line.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is very very addicting and epic the concept is to upgrade your car and get<br /> them all<br />plus I would recommend this for casual players who are beginner
0307474259|5.0|I read this book at the end of March 2013.<br />It is now the beginning of June 2013 and I have lost 30 pounds.<br />I started a ketogenic diet and this book helped me remind myself why I shouldn't eat all those things I craved.<br />This isn't a \\"diet book\\". This isn't a book of recipes. This isn't going to tell you HOW to do it.<br /><br />This book tells you WHY. And it does so very well.
B005FISBTO|3.0|We have been avid watchers of this series.  We love Dexter.  Until now.<br /><br />There's plenty of comments about the way the DVDs are formatted - it's horrible, and I don't feel the need to elaborate any more on that, except to say it was a huge error.<br /><br />Overall, we decided there's something just missing in the entire season.  The characters seem stiff, the writing doesn't flow the same previous shows have, and we suspected some changes in the writing/production.  On checking with IMDB there has been a big change with writers on the show, some new blood in, a lot of original writers out.  And for this reason, maybe, we can see a difference in the \\"feel\\" of the production.  There's also a couple of new directors too for this season, also why maybe the camera angles and the small nuances that we have come to take for granted as a part of the character of the series as much as the acting.  We tried buying into the new \\"baddies\\" but can't.  The \\"Intern\\" gets as much screen time as Angel Batista and Masuka!  And there's not been much suspense at all.<br /><br />We would say that if this had been the first series of Dexter, we're not sure it would have had such a great following.  Instead of buying this season, we wish we'd just borrowed it from someone.  It's not one we will watch again, and will be happy to lend this to someone else.<br /><br />Onto Season 7.  We hope it's better........PLEASE!!

B0080K3G4O|5.0|Well researched, well written. We should be especially grateful to the author for finally digging up the truth behind the much touted \\"Goal Study\\" from 1953 Yale--which it turns out never existed. It wasn't true that the 3% of the student body that had written goals, had more wealth than the other 97% decades later.  Never happened.  Antidote should be on every entrepreneur's shelf as the medicine that cures the moronic myth of positive thinking. The Power of Negative Planning is much more useful than the supposed \\"Power\\" of Positive Thinking.\\" [[ASIN:B00CXYUBYG THE POWER OF NEGATIVE PLANNING How To Succeed By Beating Murphy's Law]]

This game was well worth the wait and worth even the $15. This is the only app I have bothered to pay for because most of what I want or need can be done for free. This  is an awesome game even for someone on a tight budget, like me. I really hope to see more Final Fantasy games for the Kindle Fire and other Android devices, soon. More please!

1400069807|5.0|If  you're a person interested in improving your health, you probably know that salt, sugar and fat aren't always good for you.  This book, however, makes it glaringly obvious just how we've been duped by manufacturers into buying unhealthy products.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|well, it's broadcast TV .... but it's pretty good. Even better when they skip the commercials, like they do on the streaming or the DVDs.
0316247545|5.0|I bought this and Manvotionals: The Art of Manliness at the same time. When I opened the box my apartment flooded with light and I found myself transported to the Plains of Valour, which I later learned is down the street and to the left from the Fields of Elysium. There, the Marquess of Queensberry and Teddy Roosevelt told me that I had unlocked the key to Ultimate Manliness and that to ascend to the next plane of Nobly Moderated Testosterone I had to defeat the Minor Inconvenience of Woe. I thought that was worth a try and so accepted the challenge.<br /><br />Of course, in hindsight I should have guessed that to Teddy Roosevelt a \\"Minor Inconvenience\\" would of course be a nine foot tall suit of fire-breathing samurai armor animated by the combined visceral hatred and pettiness of a small country. Having already accepted the challenge, though, my honor was at stake and so I girded my sword (metaphorically, of course) and fought the demon-lord bare-fisted.<br /><br />Since I'm only about 125 pounds sopping wet, I had to use my head. To make a long story short, I headbutted the thing into submission. Anyone who doubts how I could take out an evil giant armor-golem should ask any of the people I've headbutted if I could do it. If they can respond through the flashbacks, they'd probably say \\"sounds like something Tim could do.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, while Roosevelt liked my never-say-die attitude the Marquess thought it was a rather low-born strategy. Due to their split decision I couldn't ascend to the next plane, but they did decide to crown me Master of the Art of Manly Friendship and told me to go forth into the world and evangelize the combined virtues of Friendship and Manliness. I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to assemble a posse to that end, and then we shall become noble knights-errant travelling across the world righting wrongs and proving that while haters will always hate they shall never prevail against the light of Friendship, Manliness, and the Equestrian way.
B005EHNEDO|5.0|I'm a big Wilco fan and they can do no wrong. This is a really good addition to my collection.
B002OG5GT8|4.0|I used this to amplify the sound between my iPod and a small speaker on my motorcycle.  It worked great.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Recommended by my dr. As a result of reading and following the book I have lost weight and my cholesterol improved. I also feel better!!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I've been waiting way too long to hear some fresh Daft Punk, and this track lives up to my expectations. Love the 70s vibe
B008KRJWEK|5.0|if my son likes it I like it. it is a cool game like I said my son is in love
B001CDLATE|2.0|I've no idea what this is like because it's the wrong zone! I probably missed the coding, buried as it is in the 'Details', but I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed that there wasn't a flag raised somewhere in the ordering process. I'm sure it would be possible to check the mailing address against the code and flash up a warning. Still, in the end it's my fault for not reading the fine print (who does that!). I re-ordered from Amazon UK, so I should actually be able to watch it in a couple of weeks. Hopefully it's good because I've now paid for it twice!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I was looking for a nice looking wristwatch with a canvas band.  So many of the options out there look cheap.  Not the case with this one.  It looks and feels great.  Very versatile - I wear it with jeans and a t-shirt as well as a suit.
0451232852|5.0|I could not put this book down at all!  Ken Follett is a great author and Fall of Giants is a great read!
0141040343|5.0|This book tells a wonderful story and I love the way Penguin has made such great bindings. It harkens back to a time when Mr. Darcy would have had fine books like this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My original review indicated it had no purpose and was more of Facebook and Twitter with pictures. Some of that is true since you never know who's pin you will find offense or who will send a response rebuke of your pin..lol.  Having said that I have found the app a fun way of spending spare time. I have learned some things, shared some things with little to no effort. It is another way to use the internet and if you don't take it too seriously it is fun.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I hate this app as it shuts my Kindle down completely and I have to wait for the battery to run out on the Kindle to restart my device.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|The film is a taut action thriller with Tom Cruise and team.  The scenes are blended well and their is never a dull moment.  A must see.
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|IT was good not bad thought it would have a lot more action but wasn't bad for a night in
B00005JLWN|5.0|Chritian Bale stars in this action film of little known around town.  Incredibly filmed. The cinematography and sound, yes sound are brilliant.  One of the best action films ever.  I have a copy in my video library.
B007JNR4XW|5.0|I reviewed this thinking it was for Step Up 3, which I also purchased here at amazon. I hit the wrong link. I wasn't going to review this one, but since I already did, I would rate it 3 stars instead of 5.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i like this game but it can be a little hinky. but if you can deal with a few minor glitches than you should get it
B001M0HGR2|4.0|my family loves all the Iron Man movies.  this movie has great action and it is fun to watch.  we recommend Iron Man.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the bomb! so much fun to play with friends a by your self!<br />non stop fun!  yes I admit, the game can be frustrating some times, but after you get over<br />that,  it's. soooooooooooooo much fun!  the only thing they could do to make this game better is, being able to go to the nether in creative, but other than that there's not much they could change.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|my whole family enjoys this movie, over and over again.  our kids from two to ten love this movie and so do we. we recommend this movie.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very quick and good read.  The movie was better in some aspects, but the book was better in others. Would recommend.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but once it got going I could not turn it off.  I'm a fan now.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is an excellent family series.  Each episode contains a very interesting story in a mostly accurate historical context. And, there is no gory violence or excessive cursing - just good, clean entertainment.  .
B000HSKUBE|3.0|did not live up to the hype.  I guess I get a little burned out on politics because it is such a depressing subject.  There are no great leaders left.
B006LSZECO|1.0|After reading this book I actually wonder what all the talk was about. Hated the ending. Absolutely hated it!  I work in a book store and I never recommend this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game alot.There is so much stuff to do in minecraft.I just don't like when I can't get the updates when they come out.But still it is a very fun game.I hope u like the game to.
0718178130|5.0|If you like Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory and the movie \\"As Good as it Gets\\" you'll love this book. A quirky love story with complex characters. I'm smiling as I'm typing this because its a book that will stick with me for a very long time.
B009C5Z112|4.0|The power and emotion in the music is amazing. I especially like the second track. This has less of the raspy vocals of ensiferum and a more human sound.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|June 7 2013 by. Wgaines<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Rick Riordan it used to be the only book I would read. There's is  lots of talk about detail \\"the giants hair was braided with swords\\" like that. This is a AWSOME  book I hope you enjoy it.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Well I have no clue about this item but my daughter seems happy with it. She and her friends are messing with it all the time. I guess like other bands from long ago they are a hit. Thanks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game amazing graphics and very fun there are a bunch of mobs and blocks but there are new updates for the game and Amazon has not yet offered the update(s)
B00746O3X8|5.0|well built with quality materials. takes the load off the neck and onto the shoulders. keeps the camera from swinging wildly about. its comfortable enough that i wear it under a lightweight photo vest to carry lenses, flashes, and batteries. also comes with a second camera holder for the waist that other systems charge for. the entire system is a great deal.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have watched The Good Wife since the very 1st. season.  I love the storylines especially, they always keep you wondering what's going to happen next?  Casting is perfect!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|This is to me the best in the Avengers style movies. Iron man and Captain America rank up there as well.<br /><br />In this one the pace is set and the movie keeps going forward. I enjoy seeing the teamwork in it.<br /><br />The ONLY problem I had with this is packaging. The discs are stacked on top of each other.<br /><br />Bottom line is BUY!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|everyone was looking for that app that had action and that it was controlled a<br />somewhat like minecraft and that you would be able to play online with friends and then it came.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|This movie was a nice set up for the world of Thor.  It builds the character a lot but not a whole lot of action in it.<br /><br />Thor does throw down with the frost giants in it and kicks some booty though!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is my 2nd time reading 13 Reasons Why and it is and will remain one of my all-time favorites
B000002OOY|5.0|This music is sooo good it is unbelievable. I use it for traveling music.  Pop this in your CD player and boogie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|AWESOME GAME! So addictive to play it! I love it!! I have to give this game 5 stars!! I don't know why some people hate it and gave it one or two stars! This is epic and awesome at the same time!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I loved the characters. Both the development of the plot went slowly and gave the bsook the country feel.  I can easily imagine how the two characters will live out the rest of there lives.
B003NB8KE6|2.0|i suppose it has used by another person when  it came to my hand ,because it smelled like some perfume on it.<br /><br />i have a A400 already ,but this one is too loose and dont give me any better feeling,it looks like a normal pant.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|This is an amzing story and really quite funny,I really enjoyed it.The author certainly has a sense of humour to place so many different people together.
B0074MTTEK|5.0|The author is very clear, and does not skimp on detail when needed. Perfect intro to the field for those interested in understanding the profound influences that molecular add ons to genes can have, and their direct relationship to early life trauma and deprivation. Astonishingly, this damage can be passed down from generation to the next one, perpetuating the legacy of trauma. The good news, certain experiences as adults can undo some of it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I just installed the i5 3570k in my new gaming PC build and this processor is fantastic.  I have it running in an Asrock z77 Extreme 4 motherboard with a Samsung 840 solid state hard drive (no moving parts, super fast), 16 GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR3 1866 ram and a Corsair Obisdian 550D silent case.<br /><br />GPU is currently on order, but even without the separate graphics card as someone that has been playing xbox360 for the past eight years or so the graphic detail this CPU alone can do with its built in integrated intel HD4000 graphics surprised me a bit.  I wasn't expecting to do much more with it graphically than some really basic games but I was actually able to play Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon with an acceptable frame rate.  That really surprised me.<br /><br />This CPU requires a Z77 motherboard as it is the unlocked version (K) of the Ivy Bridge chipset.  Being unlocked you can overlock this CPU (run it faster).  Most Z77 motherboards will come with software that makes this pretty easy.  Most users report getting 4.3 Ghz to 4.5 Ghz out of this chip, which is comparable to the i7, which is $100 more.<br /><br />This is a very solid CPU for a well balanced PC.  If you want to go crazy I would go for the hex-core i7, and a suitable motherboard that can run it (not a Z77 / 1150 slot), however, to be frank, any CPU faster than this won't really be taxed by today's games.  The CPU once you reach this level of performance is more than capable of running today's games, it is the graphics card that is still being stretched.<br /><br />My advice, get this chip and spend all you have left on the best graphics card you can afford, and get a solid state hard drive for super fast boot up and loading times.<br /><br />Excellent CPU, recommended.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Basically the same as Bejeweled but with 2 other levels to play to complete a round.  I love it &amp; play for hours.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|this cd has such great music on it i cant wait to keep listening to it over and over again
B003XFVSTG|1.0|Not what I expected from these fine actors.  The movie was hard to follow, very loud and noisey and the speech audio was hard to hear.
0316010669|5.0|Took a while to get here but the packaging was nice, no damages.<br />Absolutely brilliant read! Definately worth the wait! I would recommend it to anyone
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is far and away the best game I have played on my Kindle yet! All hail to the developers for a thought provoking genuinely good time. Hurry up with the next one, and please keep up the quality...the graphics and maneuverability throughout the game were awesome!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Expected different ending but it's sweet that they are finally happy together and understand one another. Can't wait for the next book!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|This is a nice app for seeing the most recent releases in music videos. It has a nice and smooth controls with easy operation over the newest videos.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very good game on kindle fire. I love it I could play all day buy I don't. great game for kids
B00AREIAI8|4.0|At first I was a bit hesitant to get this game because I had never had good luck with horse games.But I can honestly say that after only a couple of times playing I will definetly be continuing to play.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|I loved this Director's cut with all the extra scenes as originally intended.  The movie is still as thought provoking as when I first saw it.  In my opinion this movie, along with Dances with Wolves, is Kevin Costner's best work.  The additional doco's on the 2nd disc as very interesting and really enhance the viewing experience.  A movie I will definitely watch again and again.  Gary Oldman as L.H. Oswald is outstanding.  Overall a 5 star experience.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. I think this game is worth at least $1.99, and it's not like it's easy to get vehicles. You still have to work to get them. I'd like to see other games this company made, because this is one of the best games I've ever played.
B000O599ZS|5.0|This has always been one of my absolute favourite John Wayne films, along with The Quiet Man and Wake of the Red Witch.  John Wayne here is at the top of his game and it is lovely to see a very young beautiful Natalie Wood.  The quality of the print is gorgeous with bright colours and sharp crystal clear images.  Definitely a must have for your DVD collection.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|love the new combo of old and new graphics and sound it  makes a marked improvement on an old time faviorite
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I spent about 2 months reading this.  It is finely done, but maybe just not for me.  The beginning was great...the middle a bit of a snoozer (2 months to get past), but I like how it came together in the final quarter.<br /><br />I was annoyed by the timeline skipping around...which was confusing in places.  I was Unsatisfied with the fathers's fate.  Maybe a tad girly and arty (Shakespeare quotes you understand).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game it worth geting it this game also travels it go to different places like right now my is in Mimi. I wonder where it will go next you should get this game:):):)
B00C70FH7M|3.0|After the creative genius and the intensity of their last effort, \\"ONE\\"...I was rather taken aback by the lack of interesting compositions on \\"Altered State\\". Sure, it's metal enough, but hardly progressive enough. Just as something seemingly exciting begins to happen musically, it's taken away from my aural pleasure zone! How many times have we heard similar tunes? Go back a few years to The Receiving End of Sirens CD releases. That was far more fulfilling and much more interesting. Perhaps it's the overall ambience presented in the recording here. I'm not quite sure, but this album hardly stands up to \\"ONE\\". That was truly an exhilarating listening experience...hell, The Dear Hunter has been more daring! Yes! I think that's it. Tesseract has found a comfort zone with \\"Altered State\\". Don't get me wrong. The vocals are a dynamic new addition to the band, and the musicians are excellent, but the compositions lack constructive interplay between interludes.<br /> Although I find it commendable to enlist the efforts of a sax player, it just doesn't jibe with the style of music here!  Crimson, yes. Tesseract, no. What are they thinking? Hey...maybe they should have powered a distortion/overdrive pedal through it? The album finally begins to get intense on track 5: Exiled, and then boredom seems to set in again. Ya know...I really want to like this album, but I've heard it all before! There's hardly a complex moment here, with the exception of the syncopated rhythms peppered throughout the CD. Well, perhaps they'll at least be able to wrangle, and hold on to Ashe O'Hara, and finally find consistency with their vocals. Tracks 5: Exiled, and 9: Singularity, stand out as the strong compositions to listen to! Perhaps this third effort by Tesseract will begin to grow on me...and hopefully not like an exotic fungus.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I actually laughed out loud. She is as funny on paper as she is was on SNL and on the big screen
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book.  It was recommended by a friend, and I was hooked as soon as I started reading.  The mystery is great, and it keeps you turning the pages.  However, the end realllllllly disappointed me.  I'm sure that Flynn knew this would be the case for many of her readers, and maybe she was looking for a more realistic than satisfying ending, but it annoyed me nonetheless.  Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book brought me to tears.  I can't remember when a book has done that to me. I have read all of his books and I like this one the very best by far. Thank you, Mr. Sparks.
1400069742|5.0|My husband doesn't read many books but raves about what he is discovering in this book. He constantly says &#34;I didn't know that!&#34;
B00846REIS|5.0|This was an awesome story. I thoroughly enjoyed this journey of characters and can not wait for more of their journey.
1594204217|5.0|Very informative and a good read. The author was a little heavy on the male sacrificial ceremony idea.  The technical explanations of the chemical reactions and the processes involved in cooking are helpful.  Great cooks need to know the why and not just the results.  A must read for foodies.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was good and I thoroughly enjoyed the continuing journey of these characters. I'm off to read the next book.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I started watching this and it kind of reminds me of the X-Files.. Was a huge fan of that show!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I know this was going to be the last book but I love reading about Eva and Giedon.  I just wish that i waited until all the book where out. I don't like to stop in the middle of a story an wait six months or more to finish it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft pe. They need to get the updates at the same time as the apple and android products though.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|All the serie is beautifull. just like films old time made, special attentions to the lights, the sound. great film.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I have listened to all John Fogerty's music and this one is my favorite by far!! The classic Fogerty comes to life with the help of some very famous stars!<br />The combined classics come to life with refreshing vocals, power guitar leads, a never-ending energy keeps you feeling good all through this CD.  Love this CD and its about time something like this came out from who other, the Great John Fogerty!!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|A serie like a movie, good actors, superb photos. We love the dog, paradise not really a paradise, small town.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get this game there's Creative Mode it's really fun! But in Creative Mode you get unlimited resources! You can make a majestic castle in Creative Mode! And in Creative Mode there's no monster coming after you! Now for Survival Mode. You got to collect all your resources and build a house! Because monsters might attack if you don't have a house! And finally Peaceful Mode it's basically Survival Mode just there's no monsters coming after you the monsters don't spawn in Peaceful Mode. Now for Mods. Mods are a more fun of way to play MineCraft for e<br />Example. There's a Ather mod The Ather is basically a sky world and there sky island everywhere! Now for maps. Maps are a world that someone made into a map. For example. Skyblock is where you have to make  a successful world but not that much grass. You have unlimited cobblestone! You have one tree to start out with when you brake the wood off of the tree the leaves begin to brake and when they do some times you get a sapling. A sapling is basically a tree seed and you plant it to make it grow. If you used bonemeal it grows instantly. What is MineCraft it's a world of blocks and when the sun goes down you better have a house unless your in Peaceful Mode or Creative Mode then there's no monsters. This App is Absolutely Amazing!! Nice job MoJang!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Book was well written.  Very interesting spiritual experience and assessment of potential explainations by a scientist/physician.  As a medically trained scientist, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend this book to anyone but especially to those readers who are trained or interested in the scientific method who may doubt or question the existence of life after death.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|This game could be better with graphics, slender man himself, and maps. Some people need to watch grammatical errors in comments. People, that's why they invented spell check. Otherwise it was a good game for three stars.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The doctor did explain why this was not a dream and how it had to be a real journey to the afterlife, using medical terms.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I'm a QT fan but this one seemed too long and a little boring.  I liked the story and thought it had a lot of potential but it just seemed repetitive and stale in many areas.  I thought it was okay and entertaining but not something I would recommend.  In my opinion, this is not his best work.  I really liked Kill Bill 1 & 2 as well as the one with Don Cherry and Pam Grier.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Thought it was like the other angry bird games. Did not know I had to sign up to face book or what ever to be able to play the game.
1449433251|5.0|We ordered this for my daughter as a gift for her fourth grade &#34;graduation&#34;. She loves it, and it's very attractive in the slipcase. It came very quickly and was packaged well.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this in 3D.  The Hi-Def quality is also very good.  It is the true 1080 hi-def and not the 720 psi hi def.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I thought this was just ok, kinda boring. It froze at one point and i thought that I'd have to give up but it finally worked.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Well-made film and actor's performance. It was hard to watch torture scenes. However, if you wish to know how Usama Bid Laden was killed it's worth seeing.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Awesome read I have enjoyed the Clifton Chronicle triology.<br /><br />My only wish is that when Jeffrey Archer writes another of these Clifton Chronicles he will end it!!!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This is an all right game, i would enjoy it more if the vehicle in the game stopped \\"flipping\\" once in awhile. I also don't especially enjoy the little cartoon driver getting his neck snapped when the car flips. That's kinda gross. it would be nice if there were a 'check point' on the track so you don't have to start from the beginning each time...I mean, my old Atari system had that capability. But, it was free and I have a stressful life so sometimes it's nice to have a monotonous kinda fun game to play! :)
1476733953|5.0|I was very impressed with the way the book flowed from beginning to end.  It was a great story with characters you cared about, and felt completely believable.
1449410243|5.0|This was a gift for a cat lover and she and her partner cracked up reading this. A must for the cat lover in your life.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I liked the mindless reading after a long day at work, but the thoughtless ending was so poorly executed, I was left wishing I didn't read the whole book. Basically all the build up was fluffed with cheesy softness and sexual tension, with no movement on the plot or expansion of the characters.
B009NY43NY|5.0|So sad for the end but I always thought she should end up with Sam! It was great, thanks Charlaine!  :)
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The movie was a remake of an ancient story line and the out come very predictable.  Once you managed to work your way through the arduous chertier building process which labored through almost the entire first half of the movie, then we are treated to some nice little quarks along the way which served to quiet our spirits as we searched for the remote to change the channel.  Even though, in my opinion the plot was not allowed to live up to it's full potential, there were some nice moments along the way and the whole package ended up coming across as mildly entertaining.  I would recommend  this movie for anyone who had some time to kill and was not too picky about the iffy details in the storyline. The fact that I rented the DVD rather than purchasing it allows for my overly kind review, had I have paid full price, I don't think I would have liked it as well as I did...
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good game, I'm in the first chapter, it seems fun and challenging, i will buy it if keeps the same level of entertainment. Well done g5!!!!  So far I like it
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Not sure why there are so many complaints about the fact that the story didn't end at three books.  Keep writing Sylvia!  The drama of these codependent dysfunctional sexy characters is entertaining!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I was disappointed in Star Wars, enjoyed Seasons, but this one is my favorite one to date. I think playing the gravity curves really adds an extra bit of fun.
B008X8RSTM|4.0|So helpful with my job.<br />Use it everyday to get around NOVA and DC area.<br />Very. detailed local map areas.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I've read the reviews, I've heard the complaints about there being more books that originally planned, but if you love Gideon and Ana, this will just mean you will get to savor them even longer than you thought.  Believe me, I would have loved to have seen them get that HEA here in book 3, but oh we'll, I'll have to wait and see them through more emotional packed, sexy, suspense.  I absolutely love this couple and Sylvia's writing style.  I &#34;feel&#34; their pain, I &#34;feel&#34; their joy , I &#34;feel&#34; their intensity and I &#34;feel&#34; their undeniable connection and commitment to each other and I LOVE IT and will anxiously await the next books.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This truly is the best game ever. You can steal cars and fight enemy gangs.No matter what anyone says it is the best game/app ever.I would gladly play it whenever
B003R50AW8|5.0|a witty and unique novel.  the storyline runs along at a great pace leaving you wanting more.  there is a twist not many will see coming.
B0060D0Z0G|5.0|This is a great movie.  Although its outcome is predictable (true story), I love the way Secretariat blows all the competition away.
B004V9MU86|5.0|There is something special with this author.  He can create unique stories that are so easy to get lost in..Give yourself time to read his books as you won't want to put them down.
B00821OX98|5.0|Highly entertaining and great start to this show. I marathoned the show looking forward to each and every episode needing to know what happened next
0143118706|5.0|great chapter on the history of marriage - makes you think about the institution and mating for life - this is my 2 nd time reading
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|I LOVE scary movies, but do not like guts & blood gore in them. I rented this movie because I saw that people were rating it at 3.5-4 stars. I rate it at 3-- it's not so bad that I heckled it while I watched it, but not that scary either. I think the movie shows you a little too much of Mama, and where Mama \\"lives\\" is ridiculous. The story of how Mama came to be is very believable. But overall, without the \\"Boo!\\" scenes to make you jump, I didn't feel it was all that scary.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Useful information well supported. I think this is one of those books that can really change your life in a practical way
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Great price for a 5 pack of these 2032 button cell batteries.<br />fast shipping!! If you need more then one this is the way to go.
1579128149|5.0|Beautiful photographs on every page.  A great teaching tool for those interested in chemistry or biology.  I'm using it to teach my kids the elements and how to use the periodic table.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am in love with this love story, the love that they share and the unconditional love that they have for one another.  This can't be the end, I love this couple and can't wait for their next adventure.
193700788X|1.0|This book felt like it was written by someone else.  The way the book ended, hell the way it started was nothing like the author's writing style.  Then again anything after book 9 has been junk in my eyes.  Doubt I'll ever buy a book by this author.  So disappointed in the way she treated her characters in this book.
B000002LND|1.0|Don't risk your money! This was just a waste of money. It sounds horrible! clearly not original. So sad this happens when you are supposedly buying an original cd. Never will buy again from this seller again!

B000VWYJ86|5.0|It will be interesting to see how far they try to take the series without Matt Damon. Have enjoyed each movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It is an incredible book. You will fall madly in love with the main character Travis. Such a great story.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This was bought as a gift for someone else and she liked it, so it is good enough for me!
B000001DQI|5.0|this is easily Elton's best work----you can listen from beginning to end --no filler tracks and songwriting that rivals anything from that era--------a must have classic lp
B001E75QH0|5.0|I was a young kid when these came out and while I thought it was weird for Harrison Ford to play anyone except Han Solo, this set still rocks!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|If you love musicals and great singing, then this is a great series to watch! I really really like it.
630460291X|5.0|It was one of my favorites when it came out when I was a kid, and it has stood the test of time for me.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Not the page turned I'd hoped it to be. Written in sort of a juvenile diary-entry format. Decent read, but not one I'd recommend as highly as others.
B000063NPX|5.0|This was bought as a gift for someone else and she liked it, so it is good enough for me!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I loved this whole album, it brought back memories of Atlantic Crossing. I don't think I'll ever tire of listening to Rod Stewart and this album makes the list! It's Rod! Keep them coming mate.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This was bought as a gift for someone else and she liked it, so it is good enough for me!
B00CO8D3G4|1.0|This guy, whose interests are in tech/things the world writ large actually values, seemingly thinks that everyone who has ideas therefore must have ones that can be monetized. Plus, he doesn't actually refund your wasted money.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I can't begin to share how many times I watched Rocky IV on HBO as a kid. I enjoyed the whole series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is totally awesome and addicting you should totally by it and it's even free!<br />You get to go on different terrain and vehicles it's awesome.

0425263924|1.0|I've never written a review for the many books I've read but felt compelled to with this one.  I loved Eva & Gideon story and waited for the ending with the third book in the trilogy. As someone who pre-ordered I am disappointed that Ms. Day didn't do what her readers were expecting.  What makes an author successful is a combination of writing & the skill to know what your readers are looking for!!! Anyone who has read the series was looking for the ending!!! I think at this point I believe that your in it for the money and like shark tank I have to say I'm out!!!! I agree with the other readers who said you could have made so many other series from the other characters in the books that your readers have come attached to. Thumbs down to your shameless attempt to milk your readers.
0064430170|5.0|my baby absolutely loves it. good, simple, rimes very well. I have tried other books to see if it would work with my baby but he loves this one. Both my wife and I read this to our little boy and he stays calm and just listens to us. Other ones he fusses and gets really annoyed for some reason. My wife and I crack up every time we switch the book on him in the middle to see if he recognizes it. He is only four and you should see his tantrum when we switch the book on him.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game! It's the best game ever! Can someone tell me how to get the new update on my kindle fire? It won't let me. :-(<br />Recommend it to everyone!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just happened upon this book and took a chance.  A little slow at first but was sucked into an amazing read!  Two chapters in and I didn't want to put it down.  Great story that could so easily be made into a good movie(s).  You should read this!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion has created the best digital Bible out thus far in my opinion. There's a few tweeks I'd make, but that would be getting nitpicky if I docked a star. I've been so much more motivated to read my Bible with this App. I can even access through the website when at a computer.
1452115567|5.0|Wonderful, sweet photos that will make you smile, buy it for someone who, perhaps is under the weather......they'll LOVE it!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small, Light weight and fits in my survival knife pouch.<br /><br />Sharpens very easily and easy to use.<br /><br />&#34;The sharpest knife is not the most expensive knife, but the knife that has just been sharpened&#34;
0738737909|5.0|the artwork on this deck is wonderfully striking.<br />i love the gold guilding on the edges.<br />the book that comes with them i thought very nice.<br />it has full color pictures of all the cards.<br />the major cards have two pages for each card, while the minor cards have one page each.<br />even the box they came in is made nicely.<br />the cards aren't coated though.<br />when i first took them out of the box some of them stuck a little bit to each other, but no damage was done.<br />other reviewers stated they had sustained damage to their cards because of sticking together.<br />just be aware of this little glitch.<br />other than that i am happy with my set.<br />so, if your looking for something a little different than a standard deck get this deck.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Read it! It is simple, yet profound. A quick read that gives you insight into the processes of geniuses and how you possess the same necessary components to harness that same power and energy. Thank you Sean!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|got this app for free during promotions. it is very good with many different sounds. the best thing is that you can play the sounds together. interesting and useful for me.
B008HK3XYK|3.0|So the box my Kindle came in said Kindle FIre HD 7&#34;.  Apparently I do not have the HD version as this cover does not fit.  I will re-sell it or give it away. Too bad because it is nice and my favorite color.  :(
1401207529|5.0|My nephew had just discovered Batman comics by Frank Miller so I gave  him this as a present and he loved it.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The movie was very entertaining and had twists and turns I did not expect.  I think it is a very creative movie with good casting of characters and a very interesting story line!
