B000LZ6DM8|5.0|This is a very rare DVD featuring 9 hits of Talk Talk. The videos are clear and the sound quality is real good. There is a menu which allows viewers to jump directly to a specific video or watch all of the videos.  The video for Living In Another World is amazing. Good special effects for its time of release. There is some live footage of the band performing Give It Up. This DVD is worth the price.   I rate this classic DVD with 5 stars.
0688014291|5.0|A great and insightful resource for everyone - we all 'manage' others in our lives, especially moms and dads! Great management advice, grab a copy and pass it around work.

9626344369|5.0|Jane Austen's words come to life like notes on a page played by a musician.  That most capable \\"musician\\" is Juliet Stevenson, well-known movie and stage actress with the acting chops of the Royal Shakespeare Company behind her.  Her training and experience on the stage really shows as she creates individual and convincing voices for each of the characters and highlights the biting and keen observations of the narrator.  I had read the book before listening to this audiorecording, and I was amazed at how much I missed.  She really brings out the nuances of each character, fully exploiting every detail of each character (Anne's father's vanity, Elizabeth's self-absorption, Anne's self-consciousness and tiny glimpses of her emerging hope) and triumphs with the climactic passage toward the end where she brings Captain Wentworth's letter to life.  You can hear the passion and fear in her voice as if it were Captain Wentworth himself.  Treat yourself to a Jane Austen reading that brings the text to life.
B000WCDI64|3.0|I was very excited to get this DVD until the first song.  Amy Winehouse is loaded from he moment she steps on stage.  While yes she is a great artist and she has a good band, she gives a lackluster performance because of her condition.  At least hold it together for a DVD recording...  How addicted is she?
B000MV9026|1.0|Based on the cover, it appears to be a \\"happy\\" children's movie.  It is not!  ...  Following are some of the reasons:  1) I should have guessed  the theme when I opened the box and found a \\"Seafood Watch\\" \\"environmental\\" initiative\\" brochure.  2) I could not understand the words spoken and sung by \\"African and Mexican penguins\\".  3) The animated \\"dancing\\" is poorly done.  4) It is a frightening movie, especially for children.  5) The theme is that American/white fishing companies are causing the starvation of nice penguins.  ...  It may be the worst movie I ever saw.  ...  Do not buy it!  I'd like to get my money back.
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|After the first few minutes you still know that \\"L.A. Woman\\" is a monster of an album, a huge, roaring blast of blues and rock n' roll with all the force of a seasoned band that has come full circle. It was the last Doors album with legendary frontman Jim Morrison, and it is a dirty, mean, ghostly work. This is also the final release of the 40th anniversary remixes where sound engineer Bruce Botnick has taken every Doors album and remixed them from their original sources. The results have been impressive and \\"L.A. Woman\\" is no exception. The songs now race along with a sharper, cleaner sound, with their rhythms and elements brought back to new life. \\"The Changeling\\" kicks things off with a hard funk beat that here has a much clearer sound and rocking bass, \\"Love Her Madly\\" has sharper drums and Morrison's vocals come across more clearly and with powerful force, the same as in the song \\"L.A. Woman\\" which has a smoother drum beat and guitars, Ray Manzarek's keyboards also shine better here. You can also pick up sounds that were originally lost here, effects and background instrumentals which had been lost to the rotting effects of tape hiss and age. Purists have been huffing and puffing over these remixes, claiming they are different albums, which they are not. Botnick has simply taken the original tracks and remixed them, he's bringing up to the surface what we couldn't hear before. Now the music of The Doors sounds better than it ever has, and new generations of fans will be delighted to discover them this way, without the aging limitations of other artists' releases. As an album this is still a masterful blues work as The Doors produce a potent combination of blues and rock, giving us a beautiful, edgy hybrid, just listen to the menacing \\"Crawling King Snake\\" and rough \\"Been Down So Long.\\" And yet they never lose their haunting, dark poetic quality that made them famous, \\"Riders On The Storm\\" is still a ghostly recitation framed by a thunder shower. What comes across so well in this re-release is the stunning detail and quality of what The Doors created with this album. This was their first project without their long-time producer Paul Rothchild, who was simply burned out from working with a frontman who's wild antics and stage attitude preceeded Iggy Pop and Marilyn Manson. Independent and producing themselves, the band recorded an album that sounds and feels completely free and unrestrained with amazing lyrical and musical creativity. \\"L.A. Woman\\" is a masterpiece, and now it sounds better and louder, a must for Doors fans and a must for any rock n' roll library.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Once you start, it's hard not to keep watching Death Hunt. I think this and Hard Times are the best two Bronson movies.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|There's not much to add to the other reviews here--just that if you like this album, you'll love the remastered CD. I am very familiar with the recording from a well cared for original vinyl pressing. I've always loved most of the non-\\"Sultans\\" songs, especially \\"Down to the Waterline.\\" One could argue the album is uneven top-to-bottom, but it certainly shouldn't be described as \\"Sultans\\" and filler. These guys knew how to play and were creating tight songs from the beginning, something most groups have to work towards over several releases. Does anyone know how long they played the clubs before being signed?   Anyway, listening to this Bob Ludwig remaster is the best I've ever heard these songs. So much detail! If you thought Dire Straits was a one man band, think again. All are talented, polished muscians. I bet you'll gain a new appreciation for Pick Withers on drums, for example. With decent headphones, I feel like I am monitoring in the studio. This is one remaster that is definitely worth buying again.   BTW, in case your memory is incomplete, don't let Warner's sticker fool you: there isn't very much \\"original album artwork\\" inside. You get the great cover painting in minature, and the bandmate's headshots. The inside of the booklet only contains the song lyrics.
1581806574|5.0|Wow!  This book is such a value for the quality and content.  Gave this to my 12 year old son for Christmas and he loved it.  He couldn't stop reading it or drawing from it for the rest of the day!
1594489505|5.0|I read this book expecting it to be like his first novel, Kite Runner, but it is not.  It is just as good, however.  I highly recommend this to book clubs.  You will have plenty to discuss!
B000YI7MRM|3.0|After waiting for several years to see this movie I am a little disappointed, but I was expecting to be.  I love the books, those released in English, despite what I suspect to be problems with the translations.  And I was very excited to hear about the movie and thought Viggo Mortenson would be great as Captain Alatriste.  And he is.    The fact that it was not released in North America on either movie screens or DVD prepared me for a less than perfect movie.    Visually, the movie looks good.  The actors and costumes are just as I imagined the characters to be as are the settings and set decoration.  However, the film makers tried to cram too much into it leaving a disjointed mess.  The Alatriste books are rather thin on plot, but if one book does not a movie make, trying to film all of them does not work either.  I am not interested in a slavish recreation of the books.  But in trying to cram in so much, they have also left out too much.    A movie based on the first two books would have been suffcient.
B000065BPB|5.0|[[ASIN:B000065BPB Sennheiser HD-280 Professional Headphones]]  These are closed back headphones, no sound leaks out to annoy fellow passengers, co-workers or spouses.  Great product for the price (I shopped around and went to a few stereo shops before making a choice).
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|I loved it, it was a great movie. My sister and brother-in-law who read the book said it followed the plot satisfactorally.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|It was delivered timely and was the best price I could find.  I love it!
0375714839|5.0|Amazingly insightful into Persian culture and the difference between the common people and the mullah elite.  Satrapi is very frank, and I found myself relating to her suffering and admiring her integrity.  This book was intriguing from start to finish, partially because of its comic book form.  I think this would be a good book for a teenager to read to understand what life would be like in the U.S. without our personal freedoms.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|this 2 Cd ,book and DVD is the U2 that was catapulted to superstardom, yet all 4 of the guys just want the best for the fans and themselves- they are their own harshest critics...Merry Christmas and enjoy the flawless beauty of the Joshua Tree ....still relevent today as 1987.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|It was an amazing series, unbelievably beautiful and informative.  However, be careful that if you get the HD DVD series, the DVD player is HD, otherwise the DVD will not work, which we found out.  The TV was HD, but not the DVD player.  We had to switch to the regular DVD series, but now I would love to see them over again in HD.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|If you like Chevy Chase, you will cry (from laughter) for his frustration over what befalls his high expectations of the love and warmth of having the family for Christmas.
B000X5KSWM|5.0|What an amazing album! One of the best from this year from what I've heard. I'm not too fond of the cover of \\"Poison\\", it may have been better suited for a single track, but oh well. Overall though, these songs blow me away with their depth and power. If you're looking for fast-paced stuff, you'll have to pass on this one, but if you always liked the softer or more mellow Nightwish songs, where Tarja's voice and beautiful music compliment each other, then you will love this album. Furthermore, The track \\"Oasis\\", which Tarja composed herself, is stunning and brilliant, and it's one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. Five stars. Congratulations, Tarja, and best of luck to you.
B000MRA5EM|3.0|I bought this one just because it is narrated by Johnny Dep; my daughter collects everything by Dep. The move itself is very good, but the narration is wooden and disappointing. You can watch it without sound and enjoy it more. But we love nature films. If you love to watch the fish, you will like this. It has more of the fierceness of nature in it. I like some of you others better.
0688170528|1.0|my best friend absolutely loves picoult, so i decided to give her a try.  the only thing i can say is \\"what publishing company gave permission to distribute this book?\\" maybe its not my cup of tea, but i could not stand \\"the pact\\"...i struggled through the first couple of chapters and eventually gave up after realizing that it would never get any better.  i don't understand all the hype about jodi picoult's books...in my opinion, suburbanite American housewives need to find better forms of entertainment than reading this thoughtless boring trash.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I purchased this last season for my daughter. She and I have watched all the seasons together. This is a fond memory for the both of us, so I knew when the last season was coming out I had to get it. I didn't expect to receive it so fast!
B000LC55F2|4.0|the only problem i had with this film is that it progressed slowly...the plot and story were fabulous!  its on my list of favorite movies
0143038419|5.0|This was sent as a gift to me by my sister in law.  Since reading it, I have passed it along to three friends.  They then passed it along.  It's a wonderful coming-of-middle-age; meaning of life; exsistential crisis book.  Love it!
B000UGG39Q|5.0|I'd highly recomend Over The Under (or NOLA) to sothern rock, hard rock, and stoner rock fans. Awesome riffage and of course Phil.
B000VSBX34|5.0|This old movie is one of my favorites. I first saw the movie when I was a teenager and now that it is back -- I still love it.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|This film once again brings us Bruce Willis as Lieutenant John McClane, who gets involved in investigating cyber-terrorism and a young hacker named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) and cyber-terrorist Timothy Gabriel (played by Timothy Olyphant). At the start of the film, McClane is having some estrangement problems with his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who prefers to use her mother's maiden name of Gennaro instead of her given name. At the start of the film, 7 computer hackers are murdered when they hit delete on their keyboards, which sets off explosives. McClane is asked to escort Matthew to Washington, D.C. to the FBI's Washington Headquarters. Apparently, Farrell has unwittingly helped Gabriel, and Gabriel has his henchmen attempt to kill McClane and Farrell, but they fail. McClane and Farrell make it to D.C., but are immediately under attack from Gabriel, whose hackers control the traffic signals and cause chaos. They also hack into other systems and make it seem like there is an anthrax attack. All this occurs on the Fourth of July. Action abounds in this one, basically non-stop. The main hacker for Gabriel is Mah Lin (Maggie Q). After a series of narrow escapes, on Farrell's advice, he and McClane find the Warlock a master hacker, Farrell's contact, portrayed by filmmaker Kevin Smith. The action in this movie is VERY solid and absolutely thrilling. I will not reveal too much more, but it is an absolute thrill-ride that doesn't let go. A VERY worthy sequel, but make sure you get the Unrated DVD. 4 3/4 stars for this one.
B000TSIK14|5.0|The Scorpions album Humanity Hour 1 simply delivers on all accounts; and it may be, just maybe, their best ever. Now, the band has been around for a long time so it's pretty difficult to say one album is THE BEST, but this is right at the top of the list. The album has a \\"concept\\" that runs through it thanks to Desmond Child who works his usual magic in helping a band make some great music. The overall sound of the album is updated while maintaining everything that's great about the Scorps. The songs are typical Scorpions and range from rockers to ballads and are delivered with power from the start, Hour 1 is a crunching opener. Other highlights include: The Game Of Life, You're Lovin' Me To Death, 321, Love Will Keep Us Alive, Your Last Song, Love Is War and The Cross.    Fans of the Scorpions need to get this album and anyone wishing for the days of great riff filled rock will love it as well. Definitely one of the year's best albums.
159562015X|3.0|This fairly short book does a reasonable job of picking your top strengths by category and gives an interesting insight into what motivates you, however I found it a little light on in terms of \\"so what?\\" or \\"where to from here?\\" factor. Not a lot of depth beyond the quick assessment.
037571457X|4.0|This book traces the life of young girl growing up in turbulent times in Iran, beginning with life under the Shah, moving on to the revolution and continuing through the Iran / Iraq war. The girl narrates anecdotes from her own life that provide a thought-provoking window onto the way these events affected ordinary individuals. The choice of a comic strip to portray events of such significance and tragedy has some disadvantages, one being the limits it places on the possibilities of characterization. On the other hand, there are also numerous advantages. The illustrations can at times be quite powerful, the simplicity of the format is used effectively to highlight the stark brutality and poignancy of the events portrayed, and perhaps above all, the graphic novel format makes a story with such important themes accessible to people of all ages.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Came quickly as things usually do from Amazon.  Love the CD.  Wanted it for the for the song \\"Angel\\".  Had searched all over and found it in Amazon. Thank you for everything.  Have a Happy New Year.  Karen Heebner
0552998486|5.0|Joanna Harris creates a rich and vibrant description of a rural French village with all its petty rivalries and traditional, narrow-minded boundaries on thought and behavior. Each of the main characters is hemmed in by these restrictions and must keep certain devils from their past or present lives secreted away so as not to become more of an outsider than they already are and in particular so as not to incite the condemnation of the local parish Priest. Into this scenario comes Mademoiselle Rocher who, despite having her own devils to deal with, brings the promise of freedom embodied in the delights of the chocolate she sells.  The characters are inspiring, the descriptions full of life and vigour and the narrative sparkling. The way each of the characters deals with their respective devils makes this a total feel-good novel,  but one which is not only enthralling, but also thought-provoking from start to finish.
B0000A12H2|5.0|High Plains Drifter DVD<br /><br />High Plains Drifter starring Clint Eastwood is a great action cowboy movie. It starts out with the mysterious stranger riding through LAGO town on a pale horse with all the townsfolk staring at him. It's as though they sense something is coming. Kind of like the tingling before a lightning storm. Then he goes into the barber shop for a shave. The shooting is something to behold. There are flashbacks to when the town's marshal was bull whipped to death. The stranger gets the town to agree to give him \\"anything he wants\\", it's like a pact with the Devil.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Eastwood.
B000W4HIX6|2.0|Just slightly better than standard dvd five star collection version. Audio quality is better than the picture quality.
B000GFLE86|2.0|First of all I was given this disc as a Christmas gift, and had no idea who Madeleine Peyroux was. Still, I am into Jazz quite a bit, check my other reviews to be sure.     The jazz I enjoy is usually a bit more experimental, or historically significant. So, how to grade the CD when her music is perhaps, an \\"acquired\\" taste? First of all, I was intrigued by the fact that this album is produced by former Joni Mitchell husband and producer, Larry Klein. How is the production quality to the CD? Not very good. Many instances the gain on the bass parts or on drums in some of the songs pegs the meters and causes an un-wanted distortion. Her voice is suitably recorded with little processing, though, and that's a good thing.     So, what about Madeleine's voice? She obviously uses a lot of the Billie Holiday techniques, especially some shorter sustain, and lots of bends. When she does this she does sound very much like Billie Holiday, but never just like Billie. Billie had a purer sound, and her pitch was better by far. Madeleine is more pitchy, sometimes sounding like she lacks vocal control. I understand some jazz singers simply sound like this, and that's fine, but other singers exhibit much more control.     Someone mentioned that she is more pure jazz than Nora Jones. Perhaps she is, the songs are more standards than Nora sings, but Nora Jones has an incredible control and vocal depth that Madeleine completely lacks. Madeleine sounds like she simply doesn't practice her craft enough. This recording sounds very much like a polished demo rather than a finished product. Nora has control of her pitch. She is always in tune. Madeleine has some problems keeping it in tune.    Which brings me to the duet, the Joni Mitchell tune River, which is beautiful. But KD Lang outshines Madeleine. It is incredible the difference, KD has so smooth of a voice, and--even though KD tries to keep it down, realizing this is a Peyroux album rather than a KD Lang album--KD still sounds so goodI'm wanting to go out and hear HER latest release instead of plowing through this sleepyhead recording.     I must admit though, overall, I didn't fall asleep and I can understand why someone would enjoy the Holiday-isms on this album. It is nice to hear Holiday singing and Peyroux does a nice tribute to Billy in her stylings.     Madeleine Peyroux should be able to up her game by getting better production, and maybe getting some more original writing. Nicely packaged, though. Pretty music, but not really fantastic. 2 stars.
B000MTPAHW|1.0|The 2 Disc Special Edition is better than the HD version of this movie. It has less grain in it and plays with surround sound on digital.
B000WQW988|4.0|This new version of the classic - maybe the definitive - performance from MTV's \\"Unplugged\\" series finally gets the 5.1 surround treatment from Elliot Scheiner, and yet again his mix does not disappoint.  The imaging is superb with a very discrete mix indeed, giving you the definite impression you are there at the performance.  I wish that the Audio was full bitrate DTS instead of the half-bitrate on offer, as the video quality is not what matters - or at least it shouldn't matter. After all, this is supposed to be about the music, right? If it were full bitrate, this would get 5 stars. As it is, I have to give just 4.
B000002KNI|5.0|I watched this concert on T.V. I knew what I saw and the CD didn't disappoint. Anyone who even likes these guys a little will want this CD. It's live it's New York you can hear the crowd and it's almost like you are there. They weren't as polished as their studio albums but that's the draw for me it's like going to see them in person. A little slip here a little start over there and it takes me back to the times I went and heard these singers and others like them.I bought this because someone borrowed mine and not surprisingly never gave it back.
B000OONTFU|5.0|This is for the fans of the scifi genre and collectors.  Quality is very good, sound and video, lots of extras.  4 discs, combo hddvd-dvd: film/extras, and in the 4th with animatrix.    Totally recommended! 5/5
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Mothership is a greatest hits collection for the casual fan. Includes all the Led Zeppelin songs one has heard over the years on AOR radio stations. An absolute must for anyone who gets into the music of the band but doesn't have a greatest hits collection on them yet. Not for those desiring to own all of their studio albums. I suggest buying the CD/DVD combo.
0439882826|5.0|My son, who is 5, received this for Christmas. It is an amazing book with lots of features. He has been looking at it for hours. The only concern I have is that he is too young at age 5 to properly handle the book. I am worried that he will crush some of the pop-up features when he opens and closes the book. In general, though, the book is a great gift, full of pop-ups and information, with unexpected features. My son loves it and I would give it to any Star Wars fan (though fans above age 6 would probably appreciate it most).
B000WZAE1I|4.0|Like most other movies based on books, this movie left out several scenes that I would have loved to see on the big screen.  However with that being said, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I actually enjoyed it.  The casting (with the exception of Sienna Miller) was brilliant.  Robert De Niro is absolutely hilarious!  Its worth watching the movie just to see his character in action!  Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I'd be skeptical about watching with small children.  The movie isn't gory, but young kids won't follow the plot well, especially the situation with the seven brothers.  I give Stardust 4 stars!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I absolutely love the Gilmore Girls series.  It is so well done.  This rounds out my collection of this TV series.  Well worth it.
B000UFAURI|4.0|I had been a lukewarm Foo Fighers for a while, but when this record hit stores, it made me a fan for life.  This record is nothing too fancy; it is just a good old rock record with lots of hard rock riffs, catchy melodies all over the place, plenty of acoustic guitar, and a very nice overall sound.  I am aware that \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" has long been considered their best record, and it is very good, for sure, but I think \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\\" is better.  Maybe nothing on it will ever resonate with the masses the way songs like \\"My Hero\\" and \\"Everlong\\" did, but I judge how much I like a cd based on how much I listen to it, and I have gotten a whole lotta mileage out of this disc so far.      If you are already a fan of Foo Fighters, this disc is probably right up your alley.  If you are not a fan of theirs yet, this disc is probably as good a place to start as any.
0316067598|5.0|LONE SURVIVOR<br />By Marcus Luttrell<br /><br />Anyone who reads Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell can only be left with a deep respect and appreciation for the United States SEAL's.  In the book, Luttrell details their training which is brutal and sweeping in scope. It is clear that only the best of the best can survive the training both physically and psychologically.<br /><br />The recounting of Seal Team 10 in the mountains of Afghanistan grabs the reader and takes him into the middle of the fire fight in which the four members of the team fought one of the most valiant battles of all time. They fought on long after they should have succumbed to their many wounds. Only Luttrell survived to tell the story. The events that followed the fire fight,the seemingly miraculous way Luttrell's gun always ended up next to him, the disastrous attempted rescue, and the help given to Luttrell by some Afghan villagers will hold the reader to the very end.<br /><br />This is a story that had to be told.  America is so obsessed with movie stars and sports stars that the real heros of our nation never seem to get their due. Only those with no heart would not be moved by Luttrell's ordeal.<br /><br />This book had a huge impact on me and I recommend it without reservation.
B00004XONN|5.0|Following the success of \\"OK Computer,\\" Radiohead pretty much could have milked the sound they had mastered on that record for years, but instead, they did the complete opposite: they almost completely changed their sound on their next record; the rocking guitar leads were almost nowhere to be found, atmospheric keyboard flourishes dotted almost every song on the entire album, Thom Yorke's voice was used almost like another instrument, and, for the first time, their electronic influences were brought to the forefront.  The result was \\"Kid A.\\"     I know it is a cliche to say \\"this album has to be heard from start to finish to truly appreciate it,\\" but in the case of this record, it really is the truth.  \\"Kid A\\" takes each listener on a wonderful journey, musically, sensually, and emotionally.      And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the presence of one of the most powerful songs this music fan has ever heard: \\"How to Disappear Completely.\\"  One of the most depressing songs any rock band has ever penned, this song evokes feelings and emotions out of me that few other songs of any genre can do.  The next (or first) time you listen to this song, turn all of the lights out, and turn the music up as loud as possible, to get the full effect.  By the end of the song, if you are anything like me, your entire body will be covered in goosebumps.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I was pleased with the price of the complete set of DVDs for Planet Earth.  Your price was better than any place I checked online or in town.  With the free shipping, it was great not to leave the house for \\"one more gift to buy\\".  It arrived on time and in great shape. My son will be thrilled.    Thanks, C. Pool
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I have only had this record for a few months, but I can already say that it is one of the best cds I have heard so far this decade, and Arcade Fire is easily my find of 2007.      This band seems to throw everything at you, including the kitchen sink. They have managed to create a very unique sound, not to mention using a wide array of instrumentation.  Aside from the usual guitars, bass, drums, and keyboards, they utilize instruments such as the cello, French Horn, xylophone, violin, mandolin, and many others.      Getting to the record in question, \\"Funeral\\"...\\"Wake Up\\" is probably their most well-known song to date, and it is a keeper, but almost every song on this record is a winner, my favorites being \\"Rebellion (Lies),\\" \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere,\\" \\"Haiti,\\" and \\"Crown of Love.\\"  The only song I find to be less than stellar is \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika).\\"  It isn't a bad song by any means, but the quality of every other song is just so high, that it feels like a bit of a letdown.  Still, in the context of the album, it works.     In short, this cd comes highly recommended by me.
0439882826|5.0|This book is fantastic!!!  I bought this for my 6 yr old son, and we BOTH LOVE it.  There is more to this book than I even thought.  There are pop ups along with the pop ups (if that makes any sense).  It is just an amazing, awesome book that I highly recommend to anyone.  You will be surprised with this book for the price you pay for it, it is very worth it.
B00064WSN2|4.0|This album is one of Crimson's most maligned recordings, but I think it's as great as anything they recorded.  It does sound a lot like their debut, but that doesn't mean we should dismiss it.  The \\"Peace\\" trilogy is wonderful, and the song Pictures of a City is as complex and as intense as anything King Crimson has done.  Cadence and Cascade is wonderful, too, a moving and beautiful ballad.  I love Cat Food, with a great instrumental track and great lyrics.  It's a miracle that this album came out at all.  Ian MacDonald had already left the band, and Greg Lake left during these sessions (to join Emerson, Lake, and Palmer), leaving Fripp (who is the only member of Crimson to remain throughout all the incarnations) to keep the band together.  He did keep it together (thank goodness), and completed this album.  The album has a very coherent feel despite all the shifting personnel.  It is a testament to Fripp's genius (he wrote practically all the music here) to put out such a good album despite all the obstacles.  And Fripp kept Crimson going through 1975 when they broke up.  They reunited in 1982, and have basically been together in one form or another since.  This is a great album, the naysayers are wrong on it big time.
B000EK76K8|4.0|This Mini DVI to DVI adpater works well. It was purchased to connect my MacBook to a 23\\" Cinema Display. My only wish is that the adapter could be slightly longer. Otherwise works great.<br /><br />R. Joseph
B000YENUI6|5.0|Just in time for Christmas, comes this exquisite gift from David Cronenberg to moviegoers awaiting the best films of 2007 on DVD.  Eastern Promises thus joins Breach, The Hoax, and Zodiac on what is admittedly so far a brief list.         Reuniting with the supremely talented Viggo Mortensen, Mr. Cronenberg has found a leading man worthy of his own directorial prowess.  Another picture or two like this, on the heels of A History of Violence-far and away the best film of 2005, and for that matter the best picture of this still new century- and one can start making comparisons to Hitchcock and James Stewart and Cary Grant.  Mr. Mortensen's performance in A History of Violence was one of the best I've seen since James Stewart lit up the screen in his heyday.   And guess what?  He may have topped himself in Eastern Promises.       As for the new film itself, it doesn't quite reach the heights of A History of Violence, but it may in fact be a richer and deeper film.  Mr. Cronenberg seems to be drawn to groups within subcultures, and this relatively classically structured genre piece, brings a new exoticism to the gangster film.  Set in London, which harkens to Night and the City, this noir deals with The Russian mob and the sex trade.  Naomi Watts, as a mid-wife, provides our entry into this netherworld, as Cronenberg uses her to great advantage, as David Lynch did in Mulholland Drive.  Rather than wallow in the lurid details of the trafficking, Cronenberg instead focuses on an infant whose future is in imperiled, lending the film an unexpected tenderness.  The story is set at Christmas too, providing an allegorical dimension while simultaneously yielding delicious counterpoint to the often violent proceedings , further enhanced by the best musical score I've heard in a long while.         If many are expecting a typical thriller, some may be disapointed.  This is instead, an elegant, often brooding, quiet character study set in a most violent world.  I think you will find it utterly compelling, and that it more than delivers on its promises.

1930485182|4.0|I find this book very easy to follow, written in language I understand from taking classes in Iyenga yoga.  The illustrations are clear and accurate.  Each pose includes information on its benefits, and also information on when to avoid the pose.  Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their understanding of yoga poses and wishes to start or expand their yoga practice at home.
B000YENUIG|5.0|I saw this film three times in the theatres and am delighted to see that Viggo Mortensen's incredible talent is finally starting to get some of the recognition he so richly deserves.  The consummate method actor, Mortensen himself disappears so completely into the characters he becomes, it take a moment to recognize him when he first appears onscreen in \\"Eastern Promises.\\"  He has taken on the reptilian nonchalance of the Russian Nikolai so totally, he can steal entire scenes without saying a word.  The film is worth watching multiple times just to study his facial expressions.    David Cronenberg does not allow the audience to blink with this film.  If you do, you will miss something important.  The violence in this film is germain to the subject matter and is not gratuitous in the least, although it is hard to watch.      Far and away, this is Cronenberg's finest work to date, and he has found a most gifted partner in Viggo Mortensen!    This award season will be an interesting one with Viggo and \\"Eastern Promises\\" already winning and nominated for some of the film industry's most coveted awards.
140120306X|3.0|I'll confess that a lot of highbrow entertainment goes right over my head. I'd generally rather watch a major Hollywood release than a small art house film so it is with great regret that I admit that `The Black Dossier' just didn't do it for me. Time Magazine declared `The Black Dossier' the second best graphic novel of 2007. So am I just uncultured or is this a classic case of the emperor having no clothes?<br /><br />If you loved the previous League of Extraordinary Gentlemen... well, you may or may not like this one because any similarities are purely coincidental. Rather than a continuous storyline it's broken up into small chunks featuring different art, writing styles and even paper stock. In fact the final portion is done in 3D with glasses included. I love Alan Moore's writings. I consider Watchmen to be the greatest piece of comic literature ever but The Black Dossier had the feel of a great artist overindulging himself.<br /><br />The central story involves Mina Harken and Allan Quartermain who have de-aged and are wandering around 1950's England with The Black Dossier, a book that chronicles the existence of previous extraordinary leagues. So Mina and Allan essentially have the same Dossier which the reader holds. The dossier is written from the viewpoint of various members of other league's including a sex-shifting immortal and a woman who seems to do nothing but prance from one sexcapade to another while traveling with various historical figures including Gulliver. The stories are extremely verbose including many pages of solid text with zero illustrations. And the writing is often mind numbingly boring as if they were written just to demonstrate Alan Moore's peerless knowledge of literature. Alan Moore is a fantastic writer, perhaps the best writer in the history of comics but the dense prose he writes seems more like the Cliff Notes of a larger, better story. One portion borrows from the writings of H.P. Lovecraft and as someone who is familiar with Lovecraft's works it was kind of interesting to see how Mr. Moore incorporated it into the story but most references are far too obscure for me.<br /><br />I did catch Mr. Moore in one mistake. On the trail of Harken and Quartermain is none other than British superspy James Bond who is more of a bumbling charlatan in this story. Turns out Bond is a traitor and the evidence is in his first case codenamed `Doctor No' or `No Doctor'. In this the author is a little too clever for his own good. Doctor No was the first film but the first book was Casino Royale and since Mr. Moore takes all his source material from the literary versions I would consider this an error. Petty, I know but it's a complaint based on the fact that I think `The Black Dossier' takes itself WAY too serious.<br /><br />This is probably the most generous three stars I have ever given on Amazon but I keep asking myself who am I to judge Alan Moore. It may well be that this book is just beyond me but I really struggled to get through it. In one long section of text Mr. Moore wrote the entire length as one run on sentence. Besides the complete lack of punctuation it was written in a very odd style that made it difficult to read. At this point I said `No Mas'. I couldn't take it. It was mentally too exhausting to read and I gave up. I guess that's my take on the whole book. Too much effort is placed on the reader. I guess if I was a literati I might be able to pat myself on the back for recognizing Mr. Moore's references and that might be fun but for me the book just grew tiresome.Lovecraft's works it was kind of interesting to see how Mr. Moore incorporated it into the story but most references are far too obscure for me.<br /><br />I did catch Mr. Moore in one mistake.

1400079276|4.0|Warning: spoiler, skip this review if you haven't yet read the book.<br /><br />First, some general impressions:<br /><br />Nakata, Hoshino, cats, stone, Colonel Sanders: fantastic, genius, at times laugh at loud funny, very fresh.<br /><br />Miss Saeki, Kafka on the Shore painting: yawn<br /><br />Johnny Walker: whatever, this is the empty point used to move the plot<br /><br />Kafka Kamura - in the cabin, in the forest, on the move, with Sakura: compelling<br /><br />Kafka Kamura - when absorbed into the Kafka on the Shore theme: sigh, yawn<br /><br />I liked how much all the themes interlace. This seems to be one of Murakami's most tightly constructed novels. Kafka Kamura and Nakata (Kafka goes to a library just as Nakata longs to become \\"normal\\" (be able to read again), Nakata kills JW as avatar for Kafka). Kafka Kamura and Miss Saeki (as her lost lover, as his lost mother). Nakata and Miss Saeki (no past vs. no present). The idea of a \\"dream circuit\\", mentioned in passing, is realized in terms of the interconnections between these characters, the action at a distance (what I call avatars) is referred to the examples of living spirits (Tale of Genji cited, etc.). Sure some things are never explained, but they're the sorts of things better left unexplained (any explanation would've been a letdown) - sculptor dad / oedipal prophecy / Johnny Walker / labyrinth / intestines / soul flute, etc... that whole line is best left unexplained, no? Likewise, exactly why all those kids got hypnotized: isn't it better having that remain a mystery? I think so.<br /><br />I found the book sort of bogged down for me at around the halfway point, just as the Kafka on the Shore painting plotline begins to unfold. The scenes in which Kafka's living in the library, getting absorbed into the role of avatar for Miss Saeki's dead lover, were the dullest for me. Fortunately the action keeps alternating with the Nakata/Chohino storyline, so it never got too static. And then, past that speed bump, so to speak, things pick up again.
0060557818|5.0|This is a very absorbing read. It's the kind of book where you suddenly realize that you are already on page 70 but you feel like you've only been reading for fifteen minutes. The next time you notice the page number, you're on 230 and, the time after that, you see that you have only 20 pages to go to the end!    So, the only bad thing I can about \\"Neverwhere\\" is that it wasn't long enough.     I do think, though, that there is enough meat on the bone for a decent sequel. Door still has to look for someone significant to her and there is also still some possibility concerning the rat-speaker girl.    I would say that this book and Tad Williams' \\"War of the Flowers\\" are the two best examples of modern urban fantasy out there today. Read both of these and you won't go wrong.    \\"Neverwhere\\" isn't original. I have read a lot of Neil Gaiman and he basically begs, borrows and steals everything he does in terms of plot, both for his novels and his short stories. But, I don't mean that in a bad way. It's not that he's a plagiarizer, it's that he taps into the universal stories and myths of Western culture. So, the tropes he uses are very familiar. He's more of a folklorist than a SF or F writer.    Gaiman's strength is as a writer, period. Although he farms well-worn ground, he paints such vivid characters and settings that you get swept away and simply get the chance to enjoy a really good book.    I'll conclude by saying that parts of this book are truly scary and chilling. Gaiman has the power, which is rare, to create real terror. The villains here are people (I use that term loosely) that you would NEVER want to meet. So, start this book early in the day so that if you read it all the way through in one sitting (and you probably will) you'll be finished by nightfall.     Then, lock your front door anyway.
0374105235|3.0|A Long Way Gone is a tragic book of sorts about the growing problem of young people serving in war. Ishmael Beah wrote this book as a memoir of his own days as a boy soldier. Sporting his semi- automatic weapon and doping himself on drugs at any opportunity, Ishmael and his friends are transformed from innocent children into bloodthirsty killers. They reach a point where they love the act of death, seeking out new people to kill and deriving great pleasure from the pain they inflict.<br /><br />Beah wrote this book in chronological order and he recounts many of the days he, his brother Junior, and their friends first tried to escape the fighting, followed by their days as hardened soldiers praying for their next kill. Food was scarce, but the boys found ways to survive. They ate the edible food they could find in the forests and stopped at villages when the opportunity presented itself, both to get some food and to load up on supplies for their next adventure. They were often left wondering about their families and whether or not they were still alive. Once they learned that their families were wiped out, they decide that vengeance is in order. With revenge on the brain and a heart of steel, young Ishmael and his friends are ready to kill anyone who looks at them the wrong way.<br /><br />Probably the best part about this book is its overall message about the importance doing whatever necessary to eliminate the use of children in warfare. These young boys are transformed quickly from innocent lads who enjoy roughhousing and rap music into ministers of death. Ishmael recounts his days as a soldier in a matter- of- fact way. There is no feeling of grief over what he is doing. To him and the other boy soldiers, fighting and killing are normal parts of life. Later, when taken into a special United Nations center for rehabilitation, Ishmael and the others are resistant at first and continue to fight other boys in the center. They eventually turn their lives around, but only with a brave and determined staff of workers.<br /><br />While I appreciate the overall message of this book and I am happy that Beah took the time to recount his story, the book isn't written as well as it could have been. The author tries a little too hard to creatively \\"capture the moment\\" when he talks about the morning, night, the forest, etc., and it gets a little repetitive after a while. The book also lacks the element of suspense I was hoping for. We already know that Beah (obviously) survived the ordeal, but it would have been nice if he had offered a little more suspenseful narrative. Also, even though there is great sadness on the part of Ishmael and the others, it isn't expressed as well as it could have been. An experienced writer probably could have turned this book into something much greater.<br /><br />But this isn't to say that a Long Way Gone is a bad book, because it most certainly is not. I like the camaraderie between the boys and the transformation from ordinary kids, to savage killers, and back again. It shows how quickly someone's mind and heart can be changed, given the right circumstances. And, of course, I also liked the attention this book brings to a much larger problem: Child soldiers and what needs to be done to prevent this from occurring in the future.<br /><br />Overall, A Long Way Gone is a good book about a young boy and his life in an African army. Ishmael Beah isn't the greatest writer, but considering his age, this is a respectable effort from this young author and activist. It could have been better, but it is still a book worth reading for its tale of the horrors of war and one boy's eventual escape from madness.nly with a brave and determined staff of workers.<br /><br />While I appreciate the overall message of this book and I am happy that Beah took the time to recount his story, the book isn't written as well as it could have been.

0446577391|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year!  Once I started it, I didn't want to put it down.  Having read all three in this series, I have to say this is the best -- with \\"The Camel Club\\" being a close second.  I too agree with the other reviewers -- it is definitely recommended that you read the first two books in this series before reading this one.      I've read quite a few of Baldacci's books, and have enjoyed each of them very much.  I especially like this \\"Camel Club group\\" and hope that he plans more adventures for them in the future!    Highly recommended!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I had to force myself to spend the time to watch this lame piece of statist agitprop.  Hosted by the high priest of global warmism, Al \\"I took the initiative in creating the internet\\" Gore, the movie is a two-hour PowerPoint sermon hammering simple points: the earth is good; we're bad; redemption can only occur if we become poorer(1) and subject ourselves to the opinion of left-wing elites.<br /><br />I could point out that global warmism does have its detractors, that there are lots of counter-arguments, studies etc. with alternative conclusions about the existence, causes and effects of global warming.  Many other reviews point those out.  But let me ask a simple question, prefaced with reference to an AP article regarding the 2007 hurricane season:<br /><br />\\"Despite alarming predictions, the U.S. came through a second straight hurricane season virtually unscathed.\\"(2)<br /><br />My question is: if the hurricanes of 2004 and 2005 were caused by global warming, then can we say that the lack of hurricanes in 2006 and 2007 was caused by global cooling?<br /><br />(1)  See, e.g., Nicholas Stern, \\"Bali: Now the Rich Must Pay,\\" The Guardian, Nov. 30, 2007.<br /><br />(2)  Jessica Gresko, \\"U.S. is Virtually Unscathed by Hurricanes in 2007,\\" Associated Press, November 27, 2007.
0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein's \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" has transformed my understanding of the history of the world over the last several decades. It's not good news, but I have a much clearer understanding of events from South America's \\"dirty wars\\" to Russia's robber barrons to why the African National Congress's \\"Freedom Charter\\" was never realized in South Africa.     The economic theories of Milton Freedom and the Chicago School of Economics call for a radical program of privatization, deregulation and cuts in government services, a program we've been experiencing here in the United States, but which has also been imposed on much of the world directly by the U.S. military or through the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization.     This program is so devastating to the populace of countries where it's imposed that it needs the disorientation and fear of a devastating shock to distract the people while it's being carried out - a shock like the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Katrina hurricane, the tsunami that devastated Southeast Asian nations, the economic crash that wrecked Asian economies, or the military coups that imposed fascism on much of South America in the 1970s. Klein draws direct (and not coincidental) parallels between the theory behind torture designed to \\"break\\" prisoners, the \\"shock and awe\\" military attack on Iraq, and the slower but no less painful unfolding of this \\"neoliberal\\" (what we call \\"neoconservative\\" in the U.S.) economic social transformation imposed on countries all over the world.     The good news at the end of Klein's book is that the people who have been victimized by these drastic policies have had time to learn, and are now beginning to resist effectively starting in South America, where the first Friedmanite experiments were waged 30 years ago.     This book is key to understanding what's been going on in our world.
031286504X|5.0|Excellent book that has a twist at the end.  Something the recent movie version completely failed to capitalize upon among many other problems.  The only negative I have with the book is that it's comes across a little dated as far as setting is concerned.  That's easily overcome by the overriding arch of the story though.

B00004VVNB|4.0|Imagine a society virtually free of disease, no violence, harmony among the masses, casual sexual encounters, and an abudance of pleasure for those not too old to enjoy it. Of course, such a utopia can not even exist in the realm of futuristic worlds. The \\"Utopian\\" world presented in \\"Logan's Run\\" is alluring at first glance, but behnind the glossy exterior of faultless living, the clock is ticking...and the flashing color in your palm tells you exactly how much time you have left.<br /><br />In this world, Logan, (played by Michael York) is a sandman, who is essentially employed by the city to ensure that no runners escape the \\"renewing\\" process at the age of 30. This film had the misfortune of being released the year before \\"Star Wars\\" became the defining film of the science fiction genre. With that said, this film should not be compared to Lucas's opus, but the futuristic settings depicted in \\"Logan's Run\\" simply seem dated by the standards achieved during the prodcution of a film of this time. Nevertheless, the film is exciting and offers a brilliant score by Jerry Goldsmith (Planet of the Apes). The score is worth owning by itself, but it adds greatly to the overall presentation. Take a trip into sanctuary, and discover that the true paradise may in fact be the one we're currently neglecting. In this way, \\"Logan's Run\\" offers a prophetic message, while entertaining audiences along the way.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|It's hard to add anything new in reviewing this film, there has been so much positive press already. How do you sum up the magic that makes this film so great? Great script, amazing artwork, especialy the Paris skyline,a collection of characters that completely make you forget they are toons. If you love to cook, you will love this film,it captures the sheer pleasure of creating a culinary masterpiece and sharing it with others.           The subtle interactions between the characters are so special. The more I write, the more I worry it pegs the film as fun for kids and cooks only, but nothing is farther from the truth. For this 49 year old semi-cook, Ratatouille is the best film of 2007, period.
B000W00Y0O|4.0|My wife and I never got to know Freddie Mercury when he was alive.  We only learnt about him through what people had presented through the internet and through the tribute concerts we got to attend.  Seeing the concert in hi-def really brought the concert to our living room.  My wife enjoyed every minute of it and we got to see the through showman that Freddie Mercury was.  And to quote her \\"Freddie still rocks and he will sorely be missed.\\"    An in-movie menu allows you to choose the song in the concert to go to.  Pity that the extra material was not in HD, and the repertoire of songs did not include their iconic song \\"I Want To Break Free\\".  Else it would have really been a jukebox of Queen's best.  Well, at least in my books.  But all in all a keeper that all Queen fans should have in their library.
0316067598|2.0|Like a lot of the reviewers, I finished this book in a day. Unfortunatly, it was not because the story was so riveting. Instead it was due to the sophomoric content. The style of writing was that of a high schooler, and the editor certainly did not help any. I cannot believe that this book was published as is. It is loaded with improper grammar and poor syntax. Great portions appear to be copied verbatim from spoken interviews.    As to the story itself, the author does not appear to have a full grasp on military law, current affairs, or non-western cultures. There is no attempt at providing a neutral viewpoint to allow the reader to judge the facts. One almost expects the bad guys to be wearing black cowboy hats and sneering villainously. Blame for the failed operation is spread liberally to almost everyone short of those who actually planned and executed the operation.     For an excellent and factual account of mountain operations during the current war in Afghanistan, read \\"Not a Good Day to Die\\" by Sean Nayler. You'll find it heavily footnoted and full of accurate background. The clear authenticity leads to real respect for this nation's warriors.    I don't question the writer's patriotism or phsical abilities, but he simply isn't much of a writer, and all the back-slapping hoo-yahs detract from what surely could have been a great story.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|After years of creative void, this movie steps back up to the plate and hits a homer!!

Thank you Hollywood, I have faith in you again!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|If you are interested in spectacular photography, that complements \\"The Living Planet\\" - this one is for you.  But Planet Earth is not a set of pretty postcards.  It is a perfect mixture of geology, physical geography, botany and zoology.  But wait - that is not all; it exposes the current problems in the conservation or \\"green\\" movement - \\"Living Together\\" is the best, honest, open debate I have heard in years...    But you may be better off buying this item in BLU-RAY format.  Trust me, it is worth every penny!    What I Liked:  - The subject matter  - The photography  - The screenplay/narration  - The story-telling  - The sharpness of reproduction  - The \\"extras\\"    What I Did Not Like:  - The logic in which the disks are numbered, or the episodes are arranged on the disk!    The BBC could have chosen one path - from the pole to the equator, or vice-versa - I don't care... but one episode must lead into another... and that aspect is certainly missing :(

Plus, since he was in the service briefly, I think this WWII drama was of interest to him.  Would caution against any young children watching this as there is violence and blood and gore.  Great series...highly addicitive!  Makes you feel like you were there.

0374530718|1.0|This book is hardly a grand work of fiction, and surely not a proper example of how one should go about writing fiction either.  Gaarder seems to be trapped between writing a historical account of philosophy and writing a renowned novel.  The result is 500 pages of an unappealing flip-flop between textbook and novel.      Perhaps Gaarder would have been better off creating a masterful, easy-to-read textbook of the \\"History of Philosophy\\" and separately focusing on a basic outline of how one should go about writing fiction, than combining his ideas into one.  By delving so deep into both \\"worlds\\" in the novel, the author weakens the story with every passing chapter.  Gaarder then finds himself in a hole too deep to dig out of and is forced to conclude with a rather trite and pathetic ending.       This book was written in Norwegian and then translated to English.  The original text may have had the flow from page to page that the translation lacks.  For those of us unable to read Norwegian, or who are just unwilling to go through the unimpressive \\"Sophie's World experience\\" again, the book will remain a broken translation of mixed thoughts and subject matter one should rarely attempt.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|I really like this CD, but it doesn't live up to its hype. The best song on the album is hands-down \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" which was also the first single taken from the CD. The tune is fast and catchy, and as soon as I heard it, it became one of my favorite Bruce Springsteen songs of all time. I expected the rest of the album to follow suit, but it really doesn't. I think the biggest issue is that most of the other tracks on the CD are pretty mellow, so to lead off with \\"Radio Nowhere\\" kind of sets an inappropriate mood for the rest of the disc. Still, all that aside, the rest of the songs on \\"Magic\\" are very good. I especially like the breezy \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes,\\" the heartfelt \\"I'll Work For Your Love,\\" and \\"Last to Die,\\" which reminds me of a lot of Springsteen's songs from 20 years ago.<br /><br />Maybe I had unrealistic expectations for this CD, and considering the amazing Springsteen CDs of days gone by that I'm comparing it to, it's understandable why I'm a little critical. I think \\"Magic\\" is an excellent album, certainly better than many of Springsteen's more recent efforts, but it's definitely not one of his best albums ever. Still, it's a very good CD, and I recommend it.
0684803356|2.0|In case you stumble upon this review amidst all of the other droning articles, I'll try to keep mine short.    This was my first Hemingway, I finished it just recently, and man is he overrated.  There are moments of greatness within the pages, and as for the simple act of creating a story, placing characters and orchestrating a chain of events, the guy wasn't bad.      Unfortunately his pretentious writing style bleeds through on nearly every single page, so absurdly that it disrupts from the actual story.  I loved the characters, I was intrigued by the plot, but halfway through I realized that I was FORCING myself to continue reading because the poor old bastard kept getting so far gone on his cheesy tangents of love, and of the minor backstories of characters found only within the backstories of supporting characters (Pilar's matador's tale that consumed four or five pages) that the story suffered greatly.    Hemingway fancied himself a wordsmith I suppose, and therefore managed to crowbar the word \\"now\\" about fifty times into a single paragraph, often repeating the word up to four times in a row, and the truly funny part is that people regard him as a genius for it.    So after experiencing Hemingway I can honestly say that I won't be going back, and I can only envy his success.
B00079FUI6|5.0|If you loved Desperate Housewives from the start, this one is for you. Great behind the scenes footage as well as deleted scenes that give the viewer in sight to the creation of the primetime hit. Well worth the price if your a long time fan of the show.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you were a fan of Led Zeppelin from the start of their brilliant career,  then this dvd is a must for your collection.  The first disc features a 1970 performance from the Royal Albert Hall,  along with a few TV performances from 1969.  A digitally remastered classic moment in time.   This first disc  features Led Zeppelin in all their original power and glory.  Whereas the \\"Song Remains The Same\\" concert features them at the end of a US tour,  tired and worn,  this concert captures a band young and fresh and exciting.  The first disc makes this video indispensable.  The second disc of later performances is just a bonus to this remarkable document of a band about to conquer the world.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|\\"The Good Shepherd\\" is an interesting film about Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a bright young man who graduates from Yale University and goes on to become one of the founding members of the CIA. The movie is set against a variety of important events in U.S. history, which makes the whole government/political aspect of the film very detailed and accurate. However, there's no spark on the emotional side of things. Damon delivers a strong performance as much as the script allows, but his character is a hollow shell of a man who lacks any emotion or feeling, and therefore makes it virtually impossible for the audience to sympathize for him in any way. This movie is almost three hours long, which seems like a lifetime when you haven't developed any sort of attachment to the main character. The supporting cast of the film is very impressive and includes the likes of Angelina Jolie, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (who also directed the film). However, I don't think any of the characters were well-developed enough to allow the actors to display their vast talents, and therefore this film kind of missed its mark for me.
0201626632|5.0|For those like myself, interested in science policy, Fiebelman provides an unusually candid view of research life with the \\"Queen of the Sciences\\", physics. As an earth scientist I used to tell physicists I met that I figured that physicists could do anything that any other scientist could do - only better. Fortunately, they didn't want to do all those other things - leaving room for us.This is a joke - if other scientific types are taking me seriously and getting mad (hm, well there's some truth here, anyway).      Beyond the specifics regarding university science departments, such as the publish or perish syndrome, grantsmanship, and requirements for promotion and tenure, the book inadvertently, perhaps, touches on a larger issue: where does the research university's activities fit in with society and its needs? Some academic research departments place inordinate emphasis on specialized subdisciplines through peer-reviewed publications. They may operate in  invisible colleges in which participants communicate with each other but are isolated from the larger society both with respect to science as well as the nation's needs.     In such departments publication may come to serve competitive or self-preservation goals more than meaningful larger objectives. This kind of condition is one of the reasons for the enormous proliferation of literature a good deal of which may be duplicative in character. E.g. the keywords,  \\"intensity interferometry\\" in Google Scholar yields 77,000 scholarly articles or books. How does one extract meaningful synthesis or the best insights out of such accumulations?     This is where Fiebelman's suggestion that work in industry may yield  value in the early stages of academic careers is interesting. Almost by definition, work in industry must serve realistic needs. The research literature and methodologies to which individuals are exposed tend to reflect this. I got this kind of benefit with respect to geology in my first job, working for an oil company. I \\"sat on wells\\",  analyzing cuttings from rocks and cores in drillholes, experiencing  \\"backward trips in geological time\\". I became familiar with geophysical logs and other technologies that added valuable perspectives to my later research career.     To sum up, Fiebelman's suggestion to new graduates or others entering the job market that jobs in industry can yield benefits down the road are well worth paying attention to. From the larger U.S. policy perspective Fiebelman's book also offers useful insights.
B0000667RO|5.0|I was sold on this one alone with the Summer of 69 that I was dying to have in my music collection. I knew of a few other hits on the album that I knew where good as well. This purchase was well worth every penny, for it allowed me to really get to Byran's style and great songs that I was unfamiliar. If you want to add a well rounded Bryan Adam's Album to your music collection like I did, this is the CD for you.
B000YAA6AU|2.0|There's nothing like a good confection to go along with the holidays.  And there's nothing more that I'd like to do than enjoy a film like `P.S. I Love You'.  The previews show everything inviting:  A widow woman on the mend, a mystery with chain letters sent posthumously, the comic return of Lisa Kudrow, a heart-warming story about learning to live and love again after a loved one's death.  There's even a performance by Kathy Bates.    The movie starts with a likable premise:  Gerry (Gerard Butler), a fun-loving pub singer and Irish immigrant dies of brain cancer and leaves his wife, Holly (Hillary Swank) to grieve immobile in her Brooklyn apartment.  Sounds good so far.  I came into the story thinking I might get the female flick (or male sensitive movie) version of `The Ultimate Gift'.  There were some problems with that movie, but the aspect of mystery with a heart is a real draw.    Holly mourns for weeks, letting her apartment go.  Her mother (Bates) and her best friend (Kudrow) try to snap her out of it.  On her thirtieth birthday, balloons and a cake are delivered, complete with a tape recorder with Gerry's voice intact, telling her she's to follow the instructions from a series of letters meant to ease her grieving and move on in life.      At Irish Teddy's Bar where he used to sing, bartender, Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr.) is the kind of jerk women love to hate, but tries to make a move while Holly's on the mend.  She goes out on the town and takes a trip to Ireland and connects with Gerry's family, but the film mostly falters.  The trouble is time is needed for these wounds, and the movie almost makes the four seasons of her grieving in real time.      Unfortunately the movie didn't live up to the previews.  Here's why:  If the film were nearly as well edited as the trailor, it would flown better.  There's one speed they know best and that's slow.  Sometimes it's essential; at others it's deadly.  The material is drawn out; it's spotty for mirth and warmth.There's a joke here, a letdown there.  The movie lingers over every development.  The flashbacks don't help the film much, either.  The delivery mainly feels forced.      Swank gives a heartfelt performance that clearly identifies our sympathies for her plight, and Bates is as believable as ever as the hard-boiled mother, who underneath her exterior shines a true and loving heart.  Lisa Kudrow still has a likable return, even if the movie's timing gives her short shrift.  In comparison to his role in 'Bug,' Harry Connick, Jr. shows a real acting range.  Similarly, Gerard Butler shows his repertoire from feisty sword and sandal king in '300' to a likable character, worthy of grieving about.      Despite good performances and a good premise, 'P.S. I Love You' fails to connect with the audience.  Unlike movies such as 'The Notebook,' and `Ghost' it fails to deliver the emotional depth one would expect from the subject matter with a script and direction that need to be lively at the times the characters and audience need it most.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|My 19-year-old son doesn't go for trends and obsessions. So, when home from college on this Christmas break,  he agrees to spend two hours with us around the second of his preferred triad of films, we seize the moment by its skinny little cinematic throat.<br /><br />Two hours later ... Wow!<br /><br />Matt Damon's 'Jason Bourne' won't go away from the stained recall of compromised CIA operatives and Russian oil cartel-istas, won't go away from an amnesiac operative's self-identification-screen to let him get back to his original self, and now won't go away from our home-movie enthusiasm.<br /><br />Bring on the prequel, let us have the sequel!  I see some quick Amazon orders of used DVDs in our (very near) future.<br /><br />The plot will be well-known to readers of this review or, alternatively, available from myriad reviews. Let me point my minutes at softer targets:<br /><br />(a) The pace: this movie you up from start to finish. There is not a moment to rest. Plot-challenged viewers like this reviewer will want to make careful mental note of the spare fingerprint and such.<br /><br />(b) The music: John Powell's soundtrack cooperates beautifully with the plot. If you normally experience film music merely at the subliminal level, this would be a good film on which to bring it up the level of consciousness. I plan to buy (and review) the soundtrack. 'Very strong music.<br /><br />(c) Acting: Damon is superb. But don't miss Brian Cox as the tortured and slightly repugnant Ward Abbot, who just wants to enjoy his hard-earned influence for another year before retiring to a couple of consultancies. His life is oddly interrupted (and then, for that matter, ended) by the stubborn researches of Pamela Landy. Pay attention to this strong support role too, ably performed by the intensely attractive Joan Allen.<br /><br />I need to end this review now, perhaps a bit prematurely. I need to go get two other movies!
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This is one of the more recent concerts that the Placido Domingo opera fans have been craving.

B000YA82F6|5.0|I expected JUNO to be an exceptional movie--with reviews like 4 Stars **** by the USA Today, an \\"A\\" by Entertainment Weekly, an \\"A+\\" by the Detroit News... and it was exceptional, and then some! Ellen Page, so amazing recently in HARD CANDY, is beyond amazing in this. She plays Juno, a 16-year-old free spirit, who gets pregnant by her pal, Bleeker (Michael Cera)..and hilarity, among many other emotions, ensues. Give Page the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy, and give her an Oscar nomination!! An extremely funny movie, but, it also has it's share of drama, and parts that tug at your heart...for many reasons why people love movies to begin with. It has something for everyone-- therefore, not limiting the audience that the movie is trying to appeal to. My friend and I saw it (a couple of 'young dudes') and we absolutely loved it. Stellar performances by Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, etc! You can certainly see why it got all the nominations...Best Picture, [again] Best Actress by Ellen Page, Screenplay by Diablo Cody, etc. An outstanding ensemble, and a very enjoyable soundtrack. Go see JUNO...you'll love it!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Very entertaining movie. Young children may not understand all of the movie's message. The story line goes beyond a rat becoming a culinary sensation. The message is about people uniting together beyond honesty, pride, and differences amoung humankind....and animals too. Extras include the history of the rat and it being blamed for plagues. History made very interesting too!
0596007124|2.0|Year back when i looked at Head First Java Servlet series, i was amazed at how clear and simple the concepts were laid out, yea it was good for a starter i thought and did glance it here and there and was pleased.    However There are somethings in Head First Series ( especially with regards to Design Patterns ) that will never click :    1.) Information presentation style is for Kids whereas subject is NOT! ( definitely not, its for people who do some serious stuff everyday and need some recurring problems solutions which can be 'applied' ! )    2.) Examples are absolutely rubbish, For example, in abstract factory i'd rather see a data access object pattern example than say a Pizza ville =(    its a matter of personal taste, for me a subject such as this needs more of a serious introduction than all in \\"fun\\" one.     Do yourselves a favor, pick up the old  Gang of Four book, its still the best out there. ( and if you need some more specifics to language related problems, buy Core j2ee patterns ).

B00007CVSH|3.0|This production (the fourth I've seen) of Il Trovatore was a disappointment from the start with poor lighting throughout.  As for the sets and costumes, detail of which was obscured by the aforementioned lack of light, it was red for the gypsies and blue for the nobility. What a concept!  (This made it easy to spot the gypsy sympathizers in blue territory.)    I found it hard to believe that the pristine, blue-blooded Leonora would fall for the sweaty, greasy-hair, disheveled, gypsy-attired Manrico portrayed by Jose Cura.  Or that she would leave the church where she was about to become a nun and be found \\"rolling in the hay\\" with Manrico in the next scene.      Hvorostovsky's singing as Count di Luna was powerful and passionate and better than his acting.  The show stealer for me was Yvonne Naef as Azucena.  Her performance was emotionally gripping and believable, her singing top notch.  The other players were just adequate.  Except for Tomas Tomasson as Ferrando; I disliked his voice completely.    And yes, there were no anvils in the anvil scene and the gang rape of Azucena was really offensive.  And if you have pistols and rifles, why are you fighting with swords?  Is that a fair question?  And Hvorostovsky and Cura are complete opposites in appearance.  They are supposed to be brothers?  I know this is opera, but...
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A was way ahead of its time when it was released in 2000. While not as highly regarded as OK Computer, it is an infinitely more rewarding, and therefore challenging, masterpiece that requires multiple listens, if not years of familiarity, to truly appreciate. Even now, Kid A sounds like a classic album released decades too early.

B000V6S7VW|4.0|I must start off by saying I hated, absolutely hated Maroon 5's first CD. It may've been the fact the guys voice reminded me of Justin Timerlake, and it came out around the time that he was big, or not, I don't know. I just know I don't care for the first CD. This sophmore CD though is awesome. I find myself listening to this at the Gym when I'm on the treadmill.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|Like the title of my review says, the first Bourne movie is still the best, at least as far as the film itself goes. I did enjoy the final film in the trilogy quite a bit (especially when compared to the second movie) but the first film is still the most fun and the most impactful. With a story like the one surrounding the ill-fated Jason Bourne, it's tough to top the character's journey in this first movie, where he slowly discovers what he can do, what he is and finally who he is.    The movie tells the story of one Jason Bourne, found floating in the middle of the ocean with an pretty basic case of amnesia. After being dropped off in Europe, he discovers he has skills and abilities that no normal person should have. With the help of a woman whom he offers $20,000 to drive him to Paris, Bourne slowly uncovers clues to his past while being chased by CIA operatives and several black ops agents with skills similar to his.    The high-definition transfer of this fast-paced thriller is pretty darn good. It's not a pristine reference-quality disc, but it's not very easy to find HD movies that look a whole lot better than this one. The level of detail is high, the film lacks overt amounts of graininess, and there is nary a sign of compression artifacts to distract from one's enjoyment of the action unfolding. It's one of the better HD movies I've had the pleasure of watching. I have no trouble recommending a purchase.

B000V1Y43W|5.0|When I first heard about Cars, I didn't think much of it. I always loved Pixar's movies but I couldn't really see what they were trying to accomplish with a movie where there wasn't a single humanoid to be found anywhere. Plus, I thought another \\"talking cars\\" property would be as stupid as all the other ones. I didn't see or read much about the movie in the months leading to its release in theaters and so didn't have a whole lot of reason to expect a lot from the movie, which I was going to see almost out of duty (both because my younger cousins were in town and because it was a Pixar film).    After the credits rolled, I knew I had just watched my second favorite Pixar film and one of my top 10 Disney films of all time. I still like Finding Nemo the best because it has a more emotional and universal moral component to it. I also happen to think that Ratatouille is a better \\"film\\" in general but I had a LOT more fun watching Cars. Like with Finding Nemo, I can watch this movie over and over again and not get tired of it. It may have to do with the inner child in me - my young nephew can't get enough of Cars and Finding Nemo but isn't nearly as impressed with The Incredibles and Ratatouille, two films my wife and friends like more.    I liken Cars to Shrek in the sense that there's always something interesting going on in the background if you care to look past the core of what's happening. The world in which Lightning McQueen and Mater live is cleverly designed to be almost exactly like ours would be if there all organic life forms were replaced with motorized vehicles. Even many parts of the landscape are shaped like vehicles in much the same way we sometimes think that a mountain or tree kind of looks like the side of someone's face. And many aspects of the world are dealt with in the clever manner we've come to expect from the geniuses at Pixar - insects are VW Beetles, Lighting McQueen's two biggest fans love to flash their headlights (quite literally, for those of you with your mind in the gutter) and the racing commentators are named Bob Cutlass and Darryl Cartrip.    While the general premise of the story is nothing new and fairly basic - a hot shot rookie race car concerned only with himself ends up in a long forgotten midwest town where the locals help him learn to enjoy life and care about something greater than oneself - the movie is immensely fun to watch, thanks mostly to the personality quirks of the citizens (specifically a run down tow truck with a good soul) of Radiator Springs, \\"the cutest little town in Carburetor County.\\" It's always a joy to watch McQueen discover that there's more to life than fame and money.    If the movie being great wasn't enough, this particular Blu-Ray disc also boasts the hands-down best video quality I've seen in any high-definition disc. This is the first movie I've seen where I can say that if you haven't seen it in high-definition, you haven't seen it at all. CGI movies tend to have really impressive transfers because the studios can use masters stored digitally instead of on film, but Cars outshines all others... and it's not a photo finish by a long shot. There are tons of little details that I didn't even see when I saw it on the big screen a year and a half ago. One perfect example is Lightning McQueen's paint job. Before I watched the Blu-Ray disc last night (Christmas Day), I didn't know that there were all these little sparkles in the paint similar to the \\"jewel\\" or \\"pearl\\" type colors you see for new car models these days (if you've seen the red 2008 Saturn Outlook, you'll know what I mean). My jaw simply dropped when I noticed that because it was just a completel revelation to me, all thanks to Blu-Ray (and my television is just 1080i).    Another impressive thing about this disc is the \\"Car Finder\\" interactive movie game, a first of this kind on any home movie format. When you play this game, a special little heads-up graphical user interface comes on over the moviewhich shows your score, what cars to look for and how many you've missed so far. The premise of the game is that you basically keep an eye out for specific cars shown at the bottom of the screen. If you see one in any particular scene of the movie, you hit an action button on your remote control and a new car to look for pops up in its place. Even better, every car you find is added to a huge showcase gallery that has a close-up image of the car, the scene in which the car appeared and an audio background biography of the character (you can now find out what the actual name of the Apple-sponsored car in the opening Dinoco 400 race is). The only annoying aspect is that the normal controls for the movie (pause, stop, skip, etc.) are disabled - the only way to get out of the movie is to hit the \\"Pop-up Menu\\" button.    All in all, this is hands-down the best and most impressive high-definition release so far (this is coming from a staunch HD-DVD supporter). I cannot recommend this movie highly enough unless you either just didn't like this movie or aren't a fan of \\"kids'\\" movies in the first place. Otherwise, if you own a Blu-Ray player, do yourself a service and purchase Cars today... or even better, buy a Blu-Ray player to enjoy this movie in a whole new way!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone.  It teaches children not to steal, and is clean (moral content), creative, and has incredible animation.
B000WTZ784|1.0|Many classic rock bands \\"go alternative\\" these days, and have been doing so since the 90's. Some artists stay true to their roots, and never \\"turn into Metallica.\\" They include the true greats like Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, AC/DC, and even Black Sabbath. Genesis, however, did indeed go dark in 1997 with the inclusion of Ray Wilson as singer. The dark depressing lower key vocals tend to sound more like Nickelback and Disturbed than any of the previous \\"more upbeat\\" stuff Phil Collins provided for Genesis.   Even in the interview DVD, Ray Wilson claims he can sing, but I don't believe it. Singers can have pipes like Fred Durst, or Phil Collins, and I think Ray Wilson's the former. I'm not saying Ray Wilson should have sounded more like Phil Collins. I'm saying that he caters to a different crowd, and that certain music fans can't handle the stuff that metalheads live for.  So, if you're a fan of CLASSIC ROCK, than avoid this CD like the plague. But if you're into stuff like Korn, Audioslave, Metallica, or Pantera, than you will enjoy this CD thoroughly.
B000O59AF2|4.0|The Mission: Impossible television series was very much over my head when I was a kid. I wasn't even born yet when the first run (1966-73) ended, and I was 13 when the revival (1988-1990) began. Nevertheless, I knew the format and liked the teamwork concept enough that I was somewhat disappointed in the focus on just one agent, Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, in the film series, especially when thinking about how much cooler things would have been if the whole of the movies expanded on the teamwork shown in the opening scene of the first movie.    Having said that, the first movie is still a blast to watch if you can get past the somewhat convoluted storyline and the whole \\"Tom Cruise and his merry men\\" feel. With all the high-tech gadgetry and the explosive action sequences, it feels a lot more \\"James Bond\\" than \\"Jim Phelps\\" which in the end probably was the reason why the film and its sequels were such a hit with action-addicted moviegoers of modern times.    In any case, this is a review of the HD-DVD edition of the movie, so I should probably say something about the quality of said edition. The movie looks pretty good considering the print is from the mid-90s. There's a good amount of detail to be seen in most scenes of the movie but the color tone looks a bit warm (i.e. flesh looks like there's a bit too much red hue). It's not a reference disc by any means but the picture is quite good in general.    I'm not a big audio person so I can't really say much about that aspect of the movie.    Overall, the movie is not a bad one to have in your high-definition library, especially if you enjoyed the film or are just a fan of Tom Cruise in general. It fits the \\"popcorn summer blockbuster\\" bill perfectly and is enjoyable for anyone but the most picky viewer.

0316067598|1.0|As a veteran I have a natural great respect for our military and even more so for our 'silent warriors'.  What Luttrell does in this book to the fallen SEALs is shameful.  The constant bashing of the 'liberal media' and recurring 'I love Texas' and `Texans are the greatest' themes leave a bad taste in my mouth.  BUDs training is well documented and I can imagine that anyone who reads this book would know or be familiar with most of what he speaks about with regard to his training.  He does not seem to know much about tactical military procedures and his writing style is so poor it makes the book almost unreadable.  I commend his service but found the book appalling on many levels.
0316010669|4.0|Blink is a pleasant read of the extended magazine article type, with snappy stories and observations that move right along and can keep the reader engaged. I don't see making a big fuss about the content and conclusions, which are relatively straightforward. Most interesting were the examples, such as the married couples, where it may be possible for a trained observer to make quick and accurate judgments on little information, as long as it is the proper information. The marriage example is one of the few where a rigorous explanation is actually offered: if the analyst can flush out a tendency for one partner to show contempt for the other, that would certainly sound like a solid negative indicator.     Other stories work less well. Sure, people let their known and unknown biases affect their thinking and, sure, making snap judgments can lead to bad outcomes, as in the case where a man was shot when he shouldn't have been. Sometimes intuition is good and sometimes it isn't. Mr. Gladwell tries to distinguish what he's talking about from intuition, yet his argument didn't persuade me. He also easily condemns bias, especially racial bias, without addressing the context of such bias and whether in some cases there might even be some justification for \\"thin slicing\\" that  incorporates bias.     Gladwell's example of singer \\"Kenna\\" could probably just as well be balanced by artists he doesn't like getting lucky or unlucky. The Coke vs. Pepsi story doesn't seem especially relevant, because in this case the sip test was a bad idea. If you want to show how thin slicing has surprising power, why include this example?     I also don't see the big deal about the war game scenario. The \\"hero\\" of the story did what a creative leader should do: come up with a strategy that works well, given your opponent. When you are outmanned, try some unconventional techniques. When you don't have a lot of information, maybe gamble more than you would. To me, that thread was actually very interesting, but did not really fit with Gladwell's thesis beyond the need to focus on what information is important and not get buried by info overload. In this case, you still need creative thinking whether you have minimal information or excessive.    Because the book is an easy meal, it can be read for entertainment and as  motivation to examine our own prejudices and why and how we are either good or bad in reading people, using our intuition, or making quick decisions. If I'm not good at quick decisions under stress, why not? Do I have a history of effective reading of person-to-person clues? Do I give off vibes that I don't intend to? When I interview people, am I really making a decision in the initial seconds and then justifying that subconscious choice? Maybe these ideas could prompt some self-analysis at the individual or team level. You won't get much advice from Blink regarding how to go about the task, so true introspection and improvement will require guidance to be found elsewhere.    3.5 stars, with credit for style and entertainment value, not rigor.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|Most underrated film of 2007. And potentially the best Blu-ray disc of 2008.     Ground breaking director Danny Boyle has done it again with sci-fi action-adventure film \\"Sunshine.\\" It is something you have never seen before. The film takes place in 2057. The sun is dying and mankind faces extinction. The Earth's last hope lies in the hands of the crew on Icarus II. Attempting to fly to the sun and launch a massive nuclear weapon into it to ignite the fading star. Out of the radio contact with Earth, the mission begins to unravel and they find themselves fighting for their lives and the future of us all.    Fans of other Danny Boyle's films will not be disappointed. His fantastic films include; 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, Transpotting, The Beach and Shallow Grave. The films delivers in every aspect. Unfortunately, the advertising campaign wasn't very strong for this round of Danny Boyle's film. And \\"Sunshine\\" only played in about 4000 screens. I luckily, found this on playing in a theatre near me when it was released in July 2007 and fell in love with it.   Overall \\"Sunshine\\" was a great, great, sci-fi film that would be shown to anyone who enjoys a good movie. I wish the advertising campaign would have been better because this is one film that should not be missed.       Film itself: *****     \\"Sunshine\\" uses a 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 which is a great choice for the Fox Classic. This film has great visuals, mainly scenes in outer space. Without giving too much away, the last 20 minutes of the film are amazingly done and the visuals should be nominated for an Academy Award. The transfer to Blu-ray is very well done. When I saw it in the theatre, I was worried about some of the segments of the film because they are darker and could cause the screen to be grainy. But Fox pulled through and did a great job in transferring all the great visuals that I saw in July onto my HD TV at home.    Video: *****     \\"Sunshine\\" uses English DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 Surround (48kHz/24-bit) audio format. It is an excellent choice and again, Fox pulled through. The audio on this film alone is Oscar worthy. The films soundtrack, soon to be released, is done by John Murphy in an amazing way. Each scene in this film is memorable with the help to John Murphy's soundtrack (OST). The Blu-ray transfer is great. The disc also features French Dolby Digital 5.1 and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound which are a little disappointing but didn't affect the overall outcome of the disc. I would have liked to see the same DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 in the French and Spanish languages. But overall, the audio delivers past my expectations and I still plan on purchasing the \\"Sunshine\\" OST when it is released.    Audio: *****     \\"Sunshine\\" features a new Profile, called Profile 1.1 which is newly released in 2008. The Profile 1.1 allows you to view the film in PiP. The smaller screen being the director commentaries and the main screen being the actual movie. The PiP option allows you to switch back and forth between the screens without pausing the movie. Fortunately, Sony updated their PlayStation 3 to enable this option a few weeks ago. It works beyond imaginable and I really think that this will leave HD-DVD in the dust.   The Blu-ray disc also features an Audio commentary with the Director Danny Boyle which is above par. 21 Video Diaries, all with the Director Introduction. 12 Deleted Scenes and an alternate ending. Two short films: \\"Dad's Dead,\\" and \\"Mole Hills\\" which are mediocre. And the theatrical trailer.   The High Definition Exclusive content on this disc are probably the best I have seen on a Blu-ray disc yet. The \\"Enhanced Viewing Mode\\" which in the picture-in-picture video commentary are well worth the Blu-ray disc purchase alone (Profile 1.1). It also features a \\"Surround Sound Mixer\\" which you can take audio from the movie and listen to it by itself, or take your favorite parts and put them together. A subtitle trivia track, which isloaded will tons and tons of information about the movie, production, and actors. And a search content  index. These are probably the best HD and extra conent features that I have seen on a Blu-ray disc and are well worth the price.    Extras: *****      \\"Sunshine\\" is my favorite movie of 2007 and could possibly be the best Blu-ray Disc of 2007/2008. I can't believe all the High Definition content on this disc and it is well worth the price. Profile 1.1, also known as \\"Enhanced Viewing Mode\\" is a great addition to Blu-ray disc and I believe this is what will bring Blu-ray out in the end (also the fact that blu-ray has Disney). I would highly recommend this Blu-ray disc to ANYONE who ones a Blu-ray disc player. A must buy. If I could rate this any higher I would.  Most underrated film of 2007. And potentially the best Blu-ray disc of 2008.    Overall: *****
B000VR824S|5.0|Eric Clapton, and Steve Winwood.  That describes it all!  Be sure to check out Jeff Beck and his bass player Tal.   Tal is wonderful!  I like this DVD more than I do Crossroads 2004. This show will be remembered for a long time.
B000ZOXDFA|1.0|This was one movie I really hope that it will be impressive but as it turned out, it proves to be a really lousy movie. Cate Blanchett proves to be superb but she can't save a sinking ship like this movie.<br /><br />I am not going to get into details about the historical accuracy since like the first Elizabeth, this is more like a historical fantasy closer to the Lord of the Rings then history of Britain. But I would say this, the director really sucks and whoever wrote the script needs to be taken out and flog, and finally, who did the editing in this movie should not have any children of their own. Simply put, these three elements of the movie failed the paying customers badly.<br /><br />This movie appears to be a visual feast without a coherent story. We have poor Cate doing a lot of standing still, a lot close-up in her great costumes and a lot of staring. And yes, it quite visually fantastic and it would even be more if there was a developing script to all this. The movie appears to be over-edited as the plot move from scene to scene, each scene almost independent from other scenes. What you get as a result is a movie that don't make a lot of sense and where characters do things that don't flow with other scenes.<br /><br />Since the movie is a historical fantasy in the first place, I wondered why the people who made this movie make a pretense of history? If they are going to throw away the history books, do so and create a script and a movie that flow and tell a story - like the first Elizabeth did. That film is a total fantasy and that is why it worked just fine. This is why this movie was such a killer of time, for people who were making fantasy movie, they tried to turn it into some sort of historical epic!!<br /><br />This plain jane DVD (Amazon's description) won't cut the mustard. This movie really needs to be reedited and re-shot in-order to be save. I doubt if that will occur.
1878424750|4.0|I love to listen to Deepak Chopra, not so much as to what he says, but for the mere sound of his voice.  I always get something to enhance my life from a book or CD.  In this CD, I knew much of what he was talking about from previous books.  However, I did get some new perspectives and this makes me happy.  Often, if I am restless at night or wake up for some reason or another, I listen to Deepak and invariably go back to dreamland.  I think that people who accuse Deepak of quackery really miss the point.
0452286751|5.0|What an amazing and challenging read! I highly recommend some basic knowledge of Ayn Rand and her philosophies before picking up her books. It increases the readers ability to truly delve into characters and enjoy the depth that Rand creates. I was turned on to Rand by a friend and am so glad she gave me this to read. I will read it again I am sure. It is long and you will get much much more out of it if you allow yourself to open your mind and appreciate the characters as they are intended.
1401300529|3.0|It was a tragedy that David Halberstam died while this massive book was still in production, because I am sure he could have given it that final tight editing that it so badly needs.  From the title, one would think that the focus of the book would have been the battles against the surprisingly well trained and well equipped North Korean army and then the even stronger Chinese \\"volunteer\\" army during the terrible winter of 1950-1951. It is not.  Rather, this book places much of its emphasis on the political aspects of the conflict, and on how the war in Korea shaped subsequent relations between the West and the USSR and China. Indeed, the book's editors seem to have sensed the mismatch between the title and the substance by inserting at the very beginning a detailed description, complete with inset maps, of the series of battles in the area of Unsan near the Yalu River, at the point when the Chinese entered the struggle for the future of Korea. Those battles occurred several months after the initial invasion by the forces of North Korea, and the placement of their description provides a somewhat anachronous start followed by a lurching return to an explanation of the roots of the conflict.   The book deserves a respectful analysis at great length and in better detail than is feasible here. But I must point out my astonishment that nowhere in these 719 pages do the editors provide an accounting of the cost of the war in terms of the casualties suffered by the United Nations forces during the three years of combat. The facts are as follows: US deaths, 33,741; US killed in action 23,615; US wounded in action, 92,134; US prisoners of war and missing in action, 12,065; Republic of Korea (ROK) killed in action, 137,899; ROK wounded in action, 450,742; ROK POW and MIA, 32,838. Other UN casualties exceeded 1,200 dead, 4,800 wounded in action,and 1,500 taken prisoner or missing in action.  The number can be found engraved in marble at the Korean War Monument in Washington, DC and should also be engraved in the consciousness of anyone who thinks seriously about the War in Korea.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Much as though I'd like, I really can't find anything curmugeonly to say against this film. It seems perfectly balanced to please all, from children to adults and even food snobs...    My wife called it 'charming', which is spot on. And it never falls into the trap of overdosing on saccharine, regretfully one of the abiding sins of many US films nowadays.    Smart, fun and lovingly animated, this is definitely Pixar back at its best. Phew, glad 'Cars' was just a blip. So, recommended without reservation.     Jon Bower
B000XA5K48|1.0|one of the most asinine movies i have ever seen, ironically i saw this after \\"The last boy scout\\" and \\"Sideways\\"..:) , really goes out of your way to insult your intelligence.<br /><br />sad that actors of proper caliber like clive owen and monica bellucci are wasted in such a flick.
B00005JPLW|3.0|Okay, I'll start off by saying I actually did enjoy this movie. The plotline was decent enough to keep me entertained. However...    What was up with the overly dramatic dialogue? Everyone in the movie acts like a bunch of drama queens on roid rage. And please, can we not have anymore medieval matrix-style action sequences? It's just silly. The whole movie was silly.    I wish I had an Oracle, though!
B000053V7O|5.0|Lester Young never lived in France.  Lester's last gig was in Paris but he never lived there.<br /><br />Powell, on the other hand, spent years overseas playing.<br /><br />Great movie, definitely based on the lives of Powell and Young.  Gordon was brilliant in this movie.
B000ICLRIE|1.0|My comment is not about the movie (excellent) or the Blu-Ray transfer (also excellent), but the absence of extras on the Blu-Ray release.  Very disappointed.
B000000OMB|5.0|This is about as close to being an essential album as an artist can get without being rated as such. The line up of songs is near fantastic; it's arena rock at near its best. Best songs on here are \\"Heat of the Moment\\" \\"Sole Survivor\\", \\"Without You\\" & \\"Cutting It Fine\\". It's the song \\"One Step Closer\\" that keeps this album from being essential.    Asia was a \\"supergroup\\" with its members coming from other well established groups: Steve Howe (lead guitarist from Yes), Carl Palmer (drummer from Emerson, Lake & Palmer), John Wetton (vocalist & bassist from King Crimson) & Geoff Downes (keyboardist from the Buggles). With that lineup you just knew you were gonna get prog/art rock out of you-know-what! Surprise! They actually gave us a commercial, streamlined version of that. They still seemed to be pompous in their music.    This is probably the only studio album one needs to own on this group. The following albums fell off dramatically in quality. Liner notes are non-existent. But the album cover is sensational. Yes fans will know who I'm referring to!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Proving that good things come to those who wait, Ratatouille serves up a rich, funny, enjoyable, and most importantly, ORIGINAL story. The strength of Pixar lies not in its animation (which is revolutionary and sets the standard by which others are judged), but rather in its writers. The best animation is hollow without a strong story to place it in, and this is where Pixar excels.<br /><br />Instead of regurgitating stuff we've already already heard, they give us original, and sometimes off-the-wall, stories. I mean seriously, who would have dreamed up a story about a rat who aspires to be a Parisian chef?? This is supplemented by Pixar's ever superior graphics and animation. Like all of their films, the animators did a lot of in depth studying to see exactly what Parisian cuisine was supposed to look like.<br /><br />Like their previous films, Ratatouille appeals to both families with young children, as well as single adults. This balance is one of the film's biggest strong points. If I have any complaints, it would be the lack of lines by John Ratzenberger, who has been in every Pixar film to date and whose voice always stands out (this is even a running joke at the end of \\"Cars\\"). Ratzenberger is in Ratatouille as Mustafa the waiter; however he speaks in a faux-French accent and has hardly any lines at all. This is only a minor complaint, of course, though I would like to see (or rather, hear) more of Ratzenberger in Pixar's next film.<br /><br />For anyone who likes Pixar, Ratatouille is a must see. As always there is a short at the beginning called \\"Lifted,\\" about an alien abduction trainee. There is also another short on the DVD entitled \\"Your Friend the Rat,\\" which is also worth watching.
B000002JSH|3.0|Bad Company's second studio effort was a tremendous drop off from their first. Unlike their debut album, this one has some definite filler. And, honestly, after this album, there's no need to delve any further into their studio albums, you'll hear a definite thud with each subsequent release. Best songs on this album are \\"Good Lovin' Gone Bad\\" & \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\" (one of their best). Most people love \\"Shooting Star\\" but it's not one of my favorites (does trite come to mind?). \\"Deal With the Preacher\\" is a good album cut but the rest is filler. There was so much promise to this group that never happened, perhaps they were truly a dinosaur, already out of place before their eventual demise.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|Maybe not the best Gilmore Girls, but I'd rather watch this magnificent show than just about anything else on TV.
B000002LHX|5.0|Excellent soundtrack. Excellent movie. Jack Nicholson really shined as the flamboyant joker and really stole the movie with his performance. I always watch the movie for Jack Nicholson's performance and not Micheal Keaton's. So its no surprise that Prince, being a very flamboyant artist himself would choose the persona of the joker for most of the songs on the album. He chose the batman persona for the more serious songs - Scandolous, Lemon Crush. This album has a more industrial sound to it, especially on \\"Electric Chair\\", but to me it fits perfectly with the dark, brooding nature of the movie. With a few playful numbers - Partyman and Trust thrown in the character of the joker. Brilliant on Prince's part. I own this album on vinyl and cd. There's really no weak tracks on it. You can press play and listen to it all the way through. I enjoy the whole album. Prince is an artist in every sense of the word. He lives, breathes and eats music. This album is just another dimension of his vast musical creativity.  A must for all Prince fans.    \\"If a man is guilty for what goes on in his mind, then give me the electric chair for all my future crimes.\\" - Prince, Electric Chair
B000V8I2QU|1.0|I have to agree with other reviewers.  Maybe this has good lyrics, and I definitely hear the horn in places, but it sounds like Bruce is singing through his hands.  I can barely make out what he's saying, and the instruments don't ring out clear and true, as, say, in \\"The Rising.\\"  I can't recommend this recording.
B0000039PW|5.0|Will people ever stop comparing Biggie to Tupac and just enjoy them both as individual artists. They both had completely different styles so there's really no comparison. Its like comparing apples to oranges and it really gets on my freakin nerves!!!  Didn't both their deaths teach you that its not a contest or a coastal war anymore. R.I.P. to both Biggie and Tupac. Both were lyrical giants and both have made a significant impact on hip hop.    Sorry, just had to get that out of my system. With that being said, Ready To Die is a classic. From start to finish its a banger. I'm not even gonna bother breaking down each track individually. Its been done already by other reviewers so you can read their reviews if you want information on each individual track. Besides, Ready To Die is an album you have to hear for yourself to truly appreciate it. My favorite songs may not be yours and vice versa but one thing's for sure: there are no weak tracks on it. When I first bought it in '94 I must have played it well over 100 times. I've since owned the remaster but the sound quality doesn't match the original. However, the remaster does have the videos from the album if you want them plus two extra tracks - \\"Dreams\\", which was cut from the original release and \\"Who Shot Ya?\\"  Both are great songs but can probably be downloaded. In addition to the sound quality being better on the original '94 release, of note is that there are other certain subtle differences between the original and the remaster. The horns in \\"Machine Gun Funk\\" are absent in the remaster. This is probably due to sample clearance issues as Ready To Die was pulled from shelves for awhile because of sampling and lawsuit problems. Bad Boy resolved it with the reissue but probably had to leave out the horns on that song. As a result, \\"Machine Gun Funk\\", which is one of my favorites on the album has a bare, stripped down sound to it on the remaster. It lacks the extra bite and kick the original had. Good thing I've got two original copies of Ready To Die, he he he. Bottom line, if you can, then get the original '94 release. You may have to spring a few extra bucks but trust me its worth it. Get the remaster if you want the two extra songs and videos as this version is more accessible. Listening to the realness in this album now at the end of 2007 only shows me further how phony and plastic most rappers are now. They're studio clowns. I'm an old school hip hop head, so I guess you can detect some bitterness on my part towards todays rappers. Read my other reviews. I'm sure Big and Pac are turning over in their graves at the state of hip hop now. Anyway, if you are a fan of REAL HIP HOP, then you need to own this album. If you call yourself a Biggie fan and you don't own Ready To Die, well let's not go there!!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this for my child's Christmas stocking since she was always asking to see it.  It's one of her favorite movies.  We enjoy watching it with her because it even makes us laugh.  Mater makes the movie!  The bonus short is hilarious.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|A friend brought this video over and my 3 year old loved it so much I bought a copy for our family.  It is a great family video about a snowman taking a little boy on a magical trip while his parents are sleeping.  Great for the kid's imaginations.  Don't be surprised when there is no dialogue - just animation and music - but it works well.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out and I bought it for my child's Christmas stocking.  We've already watched it 2 times so I would say that it's looking to be one of her favorites too.
B00005JPTI|4.0|I'll get straight to the point- if you've read the book and are expecting a faithful adaptation, you'll be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're expecting a good post-apocalyptic thriller, then you'll enjoy it.    First, in response to what some other people have been saying, this is NOT a remake of \\"The Omega Man.\\" This is a re-interpretation of the original book \\"I am Legend.\\" It follows Richard Matheson's classic source material in its broad outlines. The human race has been decimated by a virus, and turned some of them into Nocturnal predators. Dr. Robert Neville, formerly a great Army doctor, may be the last man on earth and eeks out a living in deserted New York City. During the day, he gathers what food and supplies he can from stores and houses, and hunts deer. Neville has an alarm on his watch that goes off at a certain point in the day so that he knows when to return to his home. In addition, Neville has a lab in his basement with rats that have been infected with the virus, and injects them with various experimental serums in a desperate effort to find a cure to the virus. Neville's only companionship is his daughter's dog Samantha and news tapes from the time before the world went to hell. Before the sun goes down, Neville shuts his house up and sleeps with a gun to protect himself from the predators outside. One day while hunting deer, Samantha wanders into a dark building and Neville, frustrated, follows her. He then encounters a \\"hive\\" (as he calls them) of the creatures, and barely escapes with his life. Our hero then sets up a trap for one of the creatures so that he can capture one and test his serum on, and succeeds in his plan, though the serum appears not to be successful. Neville continues to struggle with his isolation, and begins to lose his sense of reality. He talks to the mannequins he has set up, pleading with them to talk back, and unfortunately falls into one of his own traps. Things take a turn for the worse after that, and I willstop the plot synopsis there.    Will Smith does a good job in the lead role, despite the fact that many say he was miscast. As I mentioned earlier, the movie does not follow the book very closely, so purist fans of the book will be disappointed. Briefly, here are some of the differences:    *The creatures in the book are definitely vampires, and in the movie they are simply nocturnal predators.  *In the book, the vampires can talk and recognize people, whereas in the movie the creatures have lost all human higher brain functions.  *In the book, the vampires are invulnerable to anything except a stake through the heart and sunlight. The creatures in the movie are still vulnerable to sunlight, but otherwise are as vulnerable as humans (even though they are much stronger).   *The character Robert Neville in the book was not a doctor before the outbreak, or a scientist of any kind.  *In the book, what turned people into vampires was a germ spread by mutant insects and dust storms after an implied nuclear war. In the movie, it's a virus that's the result of a cancer cure gone wrong.  *The reasons for the title \\"I am Legend\\" are very different in the movie than the book.  *The ending is not a complete cop-out, but is considerably more optimistic than the book's ending.     There are other differences, but that list should give readers a good idea. \\"I am Legend\\" does offer enough for sci-fi/horror fans to be satisfied, however. For instance, there's definitely plenty of suspense, particularly when Neville follows his dog into a dark building and discovers a \\"hive\\" of the creatures. Further, the theme of isolation is always present- Neville at one point tearfully pleads to mannequins to say hello to him. Overall, I would recommend this.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I purchased this video for my husband for Christmas, but I couldn't wait to view it myself!!!  So we did Christmas evening.  What a fabulous array of life, scenes and just sheer beauty!!!  We so thorougly enjoy this and plan to show it off, even at our group at church!!!  Thanks Amazon for having this so readily availble!
0440238609|5.0|I love these books and I think that everyone who likes fantasy will too. They are an amazing adventure for everyone. Starting out with a 12 year old girl named Lyra who's world is different from ours. In her world souls are on the outside and you can talk to them! All three books are great reads and should be read by anyone who is 9 and up.
B00005JPLW|4.0|I loved the movie, which is why i bought the dvd, it was cheaper than the store and columbia house specials.
B00012QLQ4|5.0|I got this gift for my boyfriend and when he opened up the gift he picked me up and swung me around yelling this is awesome!! I think that this is a great gift for the anime lover, and for the weird movie lover in your life. It is one of the 100 greatest films you have to see and one of the 100 greatest gifts I have given.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Although the Beatle's \\"A Hard Days Night\\" is classically comedic and a wonderful film, I believe that \\"Help\\" just went on to prove the abilities of those four wonderful lads from Liverpool.  Both films were beautifully filmed and scored.  \\"Help\\" had the addition of color and a fantastic little fantasy which, obviously, was helped along with some of the handier drugs of the day.  It is truly a marvelous film and a great remembrance of the \\"joys\\" of that time.  The smiles are adorable, the songs are great, and the \\"Ode to Joy\\" is so appropriate.  My 3 nieces have been watching it now for about 25 years when they visit and always ask to see it again.  It's a family tradition.  Buy it.  You'll like it.  If you don't, watch it again.  If you don't like it after three tries, you've got a problem!!
B00004YRQA|5.0|The card is in good working condtion and we are pleased with the shipping and totally experience. Thanks
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the colorful recreation of an ancient classic; foolish (and cowardly) young lad runs off with the wife of a powerful adversary and the subsequent battle between two nations for power creates opportunities for several characters to build upon and extend their reputations. Passion, honor and the struggle for immortality are the key dynamics. I lasciviously absorbed the amazingly rippling muscularity of Brad 'goldy-locks' Pitt as Achilles and definitely perched on the edge of my seat during the tense and athletic mano y mano fight scenes (particularly the one with Hector). I found the storyline detailed and comprehensive, simple enough to understand yet illustrated with attention to detail. All the characters were completely believable and well acted, worthy of a Shakespearian drama.     Top Notch, as my the old professor would say!
B000002KNI|3.0|I have been a Simon and Garfunkel fan for years now, and this is the compilation I like least. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderfully jazzy moments, a few fun times, but the evening was...drugged. There was some dysfunction in the air, that made the audience clap to the already dismal tempo of \\"The Sound of Silence\\", ruining it completely. I think that moment really defined the two's loss, how they went from the beautiful persona of ethereal/acoustic folk duo to a pathetically bouncy pop label, with songs that were fun, but not at all inspiring, and almost embarrassing when thought about too long. (\\"This song is MEANINGLESS!\\") It was a sad night, made bearable by the bluesy pleasures of \\"Late in the Evening\\" and \\"Still Crazy After All These Years.\\"<br /><br />Buy the 1967 concert; the recording is not great, but the songs, the moment, \\"Anji\\", \\"Richard Cory\\", \\"Sparrow\\"... THAT was a sweet concert by the old S&G.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|Rent is loosely based on Puccini's opera, [[ASIN:B0000041TD Puccini - La Boh&egrave;me / Freni, Pavarotti, Harwood, Ghiaurov, Karajan]]. In the opera's opening scene, the artists, musicians, and bohemians are torching their scripts, novels, and sheet music for heat because they are poor, desperate, and freezing. Ditto for the denizens of Rent. Update to Manhattan's Lower East Side, pre 9/11, pre gentrification, post AIDS; slight change to drug addict, stripper, musician, film maker, drag queen, performance artist, lesbian lawyer, gay philosophy professor, and yuppie developer, and voila! Rent: a film of a Broadway musical that took Broadway by storm in 1996.<br /><br />Aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's RENT to Benny Coffin III (Taye Diggs), a former friend, now a yuppie developer with dreams of gentrifying. He had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter, but now is pressuring them to stop a protest of evicting the homeless from a nearby property. Exotic dancer Mimi (Rosario Dawson), inexplicably has the hots for Roger, even though he never seems to actually finish writing a song. Mark's former girlfriend, performance diva Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia).<br /><br />Directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, [[ASIN:B000W74EQC Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Widescreen Edition)]]) who felt that though the Broadway version was 10 years old, a lot of the original cast could still carry their roles. All but two of the film's cast are from the original Broadway cast. Some of the songs are removed to make way for more dialogue, but the songs are still integrated into the movie in a clever way. The Broadway version was sung throughout, like a Rock Opera. In the film they sometimes break into song suddenly, with no warning, as in the scene where Maureen, the performance artist, and Joanne, her new girlfriend, have a commitment ceremony. It highlights her flamboyant personality, and the trouble that Joanne is having dealing with her flirtatiousness. The shock is also palpable on their respective parents, who seem OK with it, but are really pushed to their limits (I like to picture Lynne & Dick Cheney as Maureen's parents).<br /><br />But mostly the songs develop very naturally, and almost evolve from spoken to sung as the emotions heighten, as in the seductive \\"Light My Candle\\" sung by Mimi to Roger, or they grow out of actual performances in the context of the action, as in \\"Out Tonight\\" which begins with Mimi's dance routine. One of the best lines is from \\"Candle\\" where Roger says she looks familiar, and then Mimi says she is a dancer at the Cat Scratch Club. \\"I didn't recognize you without the handcuffs,\\" he sings.<br /><br />The musical was written by Jonathan Larson. Tragically, he died just before his show could be staged, of an aortic aneurysm. In some bonus footage he is shown proclaiming that he wants to write the \\"Hair of the `90s.\\" He also received some support and encouragement from Steven Sondheim. Though RENT is no [[ASIN:B0000AM6IY West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)]], it shows a lot more innovation than [[ASIN:B000077VR3 Moulin Rouge! (Widescreen Edition)]], in its attempt to revitalize the Musical form. That movie took familiar songs and recast them as plot stepping stones. RENT can at least claim that original music and lyrics were written specifically for it.<br /><br />For me, it was interesting to speculate how the film's cast and the people that Jonathan Larson was writing about were related. If their characters were gay, were the actors portraying them also gay? I wondered if Larson pictured himself as Roger, or perhaps more of Mark, the film maker? (Wouldn't it have been great to have Andy Dick in this role, Anthony Rapp's fine performance notwithstanding?) Maybe he most closely identified with Angel? An interesting bit of trivia was that Larson supported himself as a waiter at the Moondance Caf&eacute;, and later, Jesse L. Martin also worked there as a waiter, even being trained under Larson. His character, the philosophy professor Tom Collins, was very gay, and I wondered about him. He has played Dr. Greg Butters, love interest for [[ASIN:B0010ZDL82 Ally Mcbeal: The Complete DVD Collection [Region 2 Import]]], and also plays Detective Green on the long running police procedural, [[ASIN:B0002CX21K Law & Order - The Fourteenth Season (2003-04 Season)]]. I once saw him along with S. Epatha Merkerson, also of L&O, as she picked up an Emmy. Seeing him that night, with Merkerson, and two other seemingly gay men in her entourage, it really seemed like he was. An internet search could not confirm this, except at one point it said he was never married (was married to his career), didn't have a girlfriend--but then one gossip item showed him out on the town with Cynthia Nixon, of Sex & the City.<br /><br />Also dating someone from Sex & the City is Rosario Dawson. She was electric in RENT, and I saw that she had quite a varied career, from independent films to blockbusters to bombs. She is from the Lower East Side, and a mix of African American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Native American, and Irish. She was discovered sitting on a porch and asked if she wanted to be in a movie. That movie was [[ASIN:B00004YA6G Kids]], directed by Larry Clark.

She has also worked with Prince and Jay-Z, as well as been romantically linked with various and sundry people. Hard to keep up with them all. Even someone from Dawson's Creek, now wouldn't that be apropos?<br /><br />Taye Diggs, along with Jesse L. Martin, was also a love interest on Ally McBeal. He was linked to Ling Woo (Lucy Liu), and he was also not only a cultural reference, but also played Will Truman's love interest on a few episodes of Will & Grace. Jack makes numerous references to Taye Diggs, as in a birthday wish of someone for a hot air baloon ride over Taye Diggs' house, and he is also a prominent feature of the gay assistant's character's fantasies on Ugly Betty. His character in RENT is neither gay, nor particularly appealing as he is kind of the villain--a once idealistic friend who is now a cynical yuppie developer. It is just interesting how he has become such a cultural icon. He is even mentioned several times on Hannah Montana.<br /><br />What with the interesting cast, music, songs and story of RENT, I would have to say, RENT--no buy it, today!<br /><br />Bye-bye.losely identified with Angel?

B000TLTUL0|5.0|Sweeney Todd is one of the few perfect Broadway shows ever written.  If there was ever a person to bring it to the big screen, it would be Tim Burton.  The result - one of the best movie musicals ever made.  Burton gets the look and the tone right.  What's more, he has the ability to fully integrate the songs into the action.  In too many of the recent movie adaptations, the actors sing awkwardly as the try to make it more \\"cinematic\\" with stage business.  Burton has the courage (and the talent) to allow the camera to stay in an uncut close-up of Johnny Depp's face as he sings to his razors.    Now, there are some flaws in the film.  The one that most people comment on is that the actors don't really have strong singing voices; this is true, but it kind of works for the movie.  Also, the score has been slashed somewhat - most notably, \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,\\" which was my favorite song in the show!  On the bright side, it is kept as an instrumental piece throughout the picture.  Some people complain about the amount of blood in the picture, but I really can't give these criticisms much credence - this is Sweeney Todd after all...don't they know what the story is about?  I mean, it's not The Barber of Seville.      All that being said, I am still going to make use of my DVD of the stage production of Sweeney Todd.  Angela Lansbury's performance as Mrs. Lovett was one of the great musical performances of all time.  As the filmmakers are at pains to point out, this is not simply a filming of the stage show - it is its own entity.  That is a good thing - it means that Sweeney will be continued to be revived on stage for as long as people have, er...good taste.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|good price and received in a timely manner.  I would buy from them again.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Having seen this movie probably more times and in more different formats than most people, I thought it was time I write a few words about this masterpiece of filmmaking. Truly, I wasn't boasting with my assertion that I've seen this movie as much as I have (I watch this movie almost once a week and have done so for almost 10 years). I own several, still unopened, VHS tapes that for a large part of the nineties I did my best at collecting. I own the Japanese Laserdisc version, a rare bootleg VHS version that was distributed over the internet a handful of years ago that has the narration selectively placed back into the Director's Cut version of the film, not called the Esper Version as some would want to label it, the Director's Cut and now the HD version of the Final Cut. That makes 5, but 6 if you count the Workprint version that comes with this box set. So, I would say that's one more than most.<br /><br />Blade Runner first and foremost, is probably the greatest film ever made, from beginning to end and in all of its variations. A bold statement when the film doesn't even rank in the top 10 in the American Film Institute or on IMDb. Spots #97 and #104 respectively (ahem). But as these kind of lists are subjective and truly under the control of mere mortals and their own strange whims, and I take no offense that so many so-called aficionados have over-looked this film for so long. Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that `Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film.<br /><br />For years, Blade Runner was divided into two different camps, or rather four and they are: Those that preferred the narration and those that did not and the other camp was those that thought Deckard was a Replicant and those that thought he was either human or felt it was left ambiguous. Ridley Scott has very gracefully over the years, given homage to these thoughts and made many statements that most readers are aware of, chiefly - that Deckard was a Replicant. Unfortunately, due to the studios fingering with the film during post-production, Warner Brothers had the right to trim anything after the 120 min mark, and thus butchering the nuance of the film and leaving several things vague and forcing Scott to tack on the Happy ending and the narration - because as we all know ... we're all just too stupid to get it.<br /><br />The new and most refreshing part of the new argument, evinced in the 210 (wow!) min documentary `Dangerous Days' is that Scott gives equal time to those that enjoyed the film with the narration, with Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth / Hellboy) in the forefront, with his very candid telling of how Blade Runner changed his life and launched him down the road into filmmaking. We also get to hear a very lucid and warm retelling from Harrison Ford of the nightmare that he not only endured making the movie but the further commitment of having to do the Voice Over narration months later, which ended up having its own strange story as well.<br /><br />So, now with 5 versions available in this box set, you get to see Blade Runner in every single angle imaginable and it is engrossing every time. Ebert also said in the Nineties that the re-release of the movie for the Director's Cut gives you yet another version of the film, but fails to handle the main problems that were so apparent the first time around. As the film has changed Ebert has gone from student flippancy to utmost respect and enjoyment. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time if you're interested.<br /><br />There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Blade Runner is probably the high water mark of all films and will probably stay that way for quite some time. Internet voting puts the film as the 4th greatest movie of all time, according to AFI's own user polls - so that really puts perspective on AFI's and IMDb's so-called Final Lists.<br /><br />On a final note, when people watch this film, a lot of people come away with a strange feeling of familiarity regarding the content, the story and the character of Rick Deckard the protagonist, the Detective, the Blade Runner. You should know that Philip K. Dick was an incredibly huge fan of Raymond Chandler and absorbed every one of his stories on a personal level. Hampton Fancher, the screenwriter was privy to this when he penned the screenplay while making the adaptation for `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and did his best to not only pay homage to this for Dick but for Chandler as well. Movies like `The Big Sleep' really bring it home and make it evident to the viewer. The novel almost reads like the narration and in latter years I find impossible to not hear Harrison Ford's voice as I read `The Big Sleep'.<br /><br />\\"What do you think of my Owl, Mr. Deckard?\\"<br /><br />\\"Is it real?\\".

B000VR824S|5.0|For starters, this is the first concert DVD that I own where I was actually at the concert.  My wife and I saw the whole concert (with the obvious exception of dinner and restroom breaks) and it was one of the best concerts we ever saw.  The DVD itself is so well put together that we get to relive the day each time we watch it.  I'll start out by saying that I agree about Sheryl Crow not really fitting in with the rest of them.  We were actually sitting down eating dinner during her solo spots, and now I just skip over \\"If It Makes You Happy.\\"  I know she's popular but she is no guitar hero.  \\"Tulsa Time\\" isn't bad though since you get solos from Clapton, Lee, and Gill.  By the way, one of Vince Gill's backing guitarists looks like \\"Otter\\" from Animal House.  I notice strange things like that.  Anyway, there are so many highlights on this DVD.  Sonny Landreth is such an amazing guitarist and was the perfect show opener (\\"Hell at Home\\" for which he duets with Clapton is incredible).  Doyle Bramhall II does a fantastic job during his solo spots and plays great during Clapton's set.  Derek Trucks is such an amazing guitarist (watch \\"Anyday,\\" \\"Isn't It a Pity,\\" and everything else featuring him) and his wife Susan is no slouch on guitar either on \\"Little by Little.\\"  I'm so happy that they included Johnny Winter's rendition of \\"Highway 61 Revisted\\" (definite highlight).  John McLaughlin's song on this DVD, in my opinion, is better than his song on the first Crossroads DVD.  He is such a great guitarist.  I also feel that Jimmie Vaughan, B.B. King, and Buddy Guy are much better represented on this DVD than on the first Crossroads.  Jimmie does so much more on guitar for \\"Dirty Work at the Crossroads\\" than he did on \\"Six Strings Down\\" on the first Crossroads DVD.  And you get two songs from B.B. along with his tribute to Clapton.  And you get three songs from Buddy.  In my opinion, Robert Randolph is such a brilliant and unique guitarist, and there should have been one more song included from his set (maybe in place of \\"If It Makes You Happy\\").  He was better represented on the first Crossroads DVD (featured on 3 songs).  Still, \\"NobodySoul\\" is fantastic.  Vince Gill has better songs on the first Crossroads DVD, but \\"Sweet Thing\\" isn't bad.  I'm very happy with the inclusion of \\"Country Boy\\" by Albert Lee because I missed it at the concert since I went to get dinner at that time.  Willie Nelson was obviously going to be on the DVD, but only \\"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\\" should have been included.  \\"On the Road Again\\" doesn't deliver (should have had one more from Cray or Randolph instead).  Oh yes, Cray does a great job on \\"Poor Johnny\\" and backing Sumlin and King.  I've heard that many don't like John Mayer, but I feel that he is a brilliant guitarist (his solo on \\"Gravity\\" alone proves it and he plays a fantastic solo on \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\").  I didn't see much of Los Lobos when I was at the concert, but I wish that I had because they are a fantastic band (listen and watch David Hildalgo's solo on \\"Mas Y Mas\\").  I'm happy they included two songs from Los Lobos.  However, why do the producers feel the need to include shots of a girl in the audience sticking he tongue out while the band is playing (don't worry the camera work is still excellent).  And then there's Jeff Beck.  He stole the show in my opinion.  He's one of those guitarists that could play any song he wants and everyone will love it.  I too wish that they included \\"A Day In The Life\\" but I'm extremely happy with the two songs included on the DVD.  However, they need to release a really good Jeff Beck concert DVD.  Clapton of course is brilliant as always (\\"Tell the Truth,\\" \\"Little Queen of Spades,\\" and \\"Isn't It a Pity\\").  Clapton's playing is incredible as is Trucks and Bramhall's.  I was very happy with the inclusion of \\"Who Do You Love\\" featuring Robbie Robertson backed by Clapton, Trucks, and Bramhall.  Another definite highlight is Clapton and Winwood doing thethree Blind Faith songs and \\"Crossroads.\\" Clapton, Winwood, Trucks, and Bramhall play brilliantly on all those songs. Also, Winwood does an excellent version of \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" and plays a killer guitar solo.  Anyway, I've written way too much so I'll just say that this is such an amazing DVD and I have watched it many times already.  Buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.
B000000I0H|5.0|Originally released in December of 1978 \\"Incantations\\" saw a rejuvenated Mike Oldfield emerge after three years of relative silence, no longer the sombre, shy, and introverted young musician. He was ready to head into the punk wars, with his greatest weapon shining bright; his music. The romantic windswept cover saw a clean cut, short haired Oldfield brimming with new found confidence and musical ideas. Some could argue that the controversial therapy treatments he went through in the preceding years drove the creative spark of genius from his music. And even hardened Oldfield fans would concede that his music is markedly different post therapy.<br />  This is not to say that \\"Incantations\\" is totally different to his first three recordings. But this time Mike expands the canvas somewhat and presents a double album comprising four suites of interconnected music. This would actually be his last long instrumental album for 12 years, which was a great shame because on this record he shows that the promise of \\"Tubular Bells\\" had been completely fulfilled.<br />  This is a beautifully textured album, one which conjures up magical fantasy worlds, of epic struggles between the forces of light and dark. Ultimately with Oldfield's new found confidence the forces of light prevail, on a generally up beat album. This marks the album out from the darkness and chaos of previous records. This is a positive album, evocative, strange and undeniably British.<br />  Mike also extends his instrumental range with greater use of wind and string instruments to give this album a subtle touch of ethnicity. Synthetic instrumentation and the use of drums hint at the more commercial spectrum his work was to take with \\"Platinum\\" and \\"QE2\\". Amid its shifting sound-scapes in which the planets soar past, Oldfield created a fantasy epic, one which seems as comfortable in Middle Earth, as it is on our Earth.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|Season 4 of NCIS comes off as more a labyrinth than \\"The Season Of Secrets\\" as CBS promoted it.  The main characters all seem to start in different areas--Gibbs in Mexico, Tony as Team Leader, Tim no longer the \\"Probie\\", Ziva being Ziva...but as the season rolls on, all the lines start coming together.  Jethro's return from Mexico isn't exactly greeted by Jenny Sheppard, and Ducky Mallard's indifference to Gibbs is puzzling.  Tony is in a serious relationship (Or is he?), and it's driving Ziva to distraction.  Tim has suddenly come into money--lots of it, evidently.  Abby is falling for a little person.  Ducky's assistant Jimmy Palmer is finding himself in a hot affair with the new Probie.    And Jenny is running an off-the-books investigation that gets the Christians In Action (Initials, folks) upset at NCIS.     It's a complicated season where all the characters undergo some changes; mostly pleasant but some not.  Mark Harmon brings Gibbs back from Mexico a little softer (Though not to the team)--enough to allow himself a relationship.  Michael Weatherly gets to have Tony grow up--some--and have his well-known intrusiveness into his coworker's private lives flipped on him by Ziva.  Cote De Pablo allows the Mossad liason to fall for an ill-fated nuclear inspector in \\"Dead Man Walking\\", but Ziva starts having \\"Tony issues\\" that don't slap her in the face until the end of the season.  Pauley Perrette's Abby is as she ever is--the attempt to give up \\"Kaff-Pow!!\\" was classic.  David McCallum's Ducky allows some hurt to show through in his relationship with Gibbs early in the year.  Brian Dietzen and Liza Lapira's sequences in-and-around the morgue were wonderful asides, and made up for the missing \\"head slaps\\".     But Lauren Holly was most intriguing in this season.  She took a character which some viewers considered cheesecake in Season 3, and gave her a very uneasy edge.  The investigation of La Grenouille seemed legitimate, but as the season went on, Jen's personal stake--and what it could cost NCIS--became apparent.  This led to Sheppard not being cast in a good light through much of the second half of the season.     This season also became a good spotlight for many of the recurring characters.  Certainly key to the season were Susanna Thompson--Hollis Mann, the CID investigator who got Gibbs' attention--and Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit, the doctor who made DiNozzo settle down.  Joe Spano's usual visits as T.C. Fornell, the FBI agent/friend/rival to Jethro were a delight.  But Muse Watson's Mike Franks--Gibbs' team leader when Jethro first joined the then-NIS--was a treat; an old-fashioned type who got things done not within the rules (Wonder where Jethro got that from?).  We lose Jessica Steen's Paula Cassidy in \\"Grace Period\\", and that's a shame.  But Armand Assante's was insidious and slick as \\"The Frog\\", and David Dayan Fisher's turn as Trent Kort--the CIA operative in with La Grenouille--is also notable.     In it's run, NCIS has always had an ongoing storyline that gets buried in the usual action--the identity of the terroist who infiltrated the MTAC in Season 1, the return of Ari leading to the two words (\\"Sorry, Caitlin\\") at the end of Season 2, and the uncovering of Jethro's life story in Season 3.  Season 4 becomes about Jenny's   investigation/obsession, and how it affects the whole office.  It is an   interesting and ominous turn in the series.  It does require the viewer to follow along closely, but in the end, all the main characters find themselves at the center of the puzzle.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|I've never been a country music fan and I've never thought I will be a country music fan. But on the night of Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting Ceremony this year, a young but gifted girl made me change my mind. Taylor Swift performed a unique version of Silent Night, she rewrite the classic song then performed before 30,000 people. What impressed me most was not her \\"bravery\\" to rewrite the classic but how incredibly beautiful her version is! I rushed to store the next morning but didn't find her christmas special album, so I purchased this one. Now I'm pretty sure I'm a huge fan of hers. Every second of her music is great. I've never taken her CD out of my player since I put it in.  I hope the skyrocketing fame will never change her music, her unique understanding of music.
B000002UAR|5.0|magnificent. maybe not the beatles' most cohesive work, but for me the most intriguing and most beguiling.   i love harrison's contributions, i love the beginnings of their era-defining musical experimentation on my personal favorite track (tomorrow never knows), i love the complexity of the work as a whole.   maybe the most interesting beatles album, as it came during their transition from pop icons to bona fide artists. it doesn't get any better than this.
B00006CXSS|5.0|this was a christmas present for my husband. if he had not received another thing he would still have been happy. actually this was the only thing he did ask for.. ordering and receiving was easy and quick. thanks
B000ASDFJU|4.0|I purchased the Sex and the City - Collector's Giftset, for my mother this Christmas.  The casing is very nice, and we both like the short summary for each episode, as well as the photos.  I'm nervous about the DVD quality after reading other reviews.  We have only tried the first DVD so far, and it works.  Hopefully it will be the same for the rest!  As many others have mentioned, the paper envelopes that you must slide the DVDs in and out of aren't very conducive for keeping the discs scratch-free.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|A dvd with a true rock and roll legend performing his hits from the 60s, 70s and 80s backed up with today's stars in a small club, Roy will live forever!
B000053VAZ|5.0|The comedic genious of Johnny Depp and solid performances by what would today be considered an ensemble cast of what were then relatively unknown, up-and-coming actors and actresses make this movie a DELIGHT for the funny-bone as well as for the heart.  I watch this movie at least once a year and it never fails to be funny and pack those odd little moments into just the right delivery.  Amazing movie, poignant, sweet, and hilarious all wrapped up in sensitivity...one of my top 10.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I just received this cd for Christmas and it was well worth the wait. The Eagles music is timeless and their voices still mesh perfectly together like they did 30 years ago. I know there have been many \\"complaints\\" about the social issues brought up with this latest CD, but personally I would rather listen to music that has a message to it than some of the brainless drivel of today's music. The harmonies are unmatched on this CD as they always have been. Many times with artists who are aging voices become thin or the music isn't as good as it was in their \\"prime\\". This isn't the case with The Eagles, they are every bit as good as they were in the 70's. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who is a bonified Eagles fan.
B000O1799U|2.0|With all the hype about this film/musical being based loosely on the Supremes, I expected to be treated to some 60s music, or at least an approximation of the Motown sound of the period.  It seems as if the singers in this film have the talent to sell that sound, if in fact it had been incorporated into the movie, but it's not there.  With the many references to the events and culture of the 1960s in the script I'd think the film would at least make an attempt to emphasize that unmistakable Motown sound, but I guess the context here is the 1980s Broadway show and its made-for-Broadway musical schlock and NOT mid-60s soul music.  That is a shame and it ruins this film for me.  Cue up any Supremes song from  1965-67 before you watch this film and then decide whether this stuff has anything to do with the kind of music they made.    If this is not important to you, if you think a film succeeds based on extravagant costumes, big Broadway-Vegas production numbers, lots of attractive faces, and utterly forgettable but loud music, then you may enjoy this.
B0001I561E|4.0|i sent this dvd back the first time because the cover was not in good condition, but the second time it was good, but the velcro closer was a little bit offset for some reason.  but the dvd quality, itself, was just fine.  brings back some good memories!
0553573403|5.0|This amazing set of books will hook you right after the beginning of the first book. You'll love the character dynamics. I've never read any other fiction, let alone fantasy series that I've enjoyed more. It has been over a year since I've finished the fourth book (there are 7 planned books), and I have yet to find anything comparable. There are so many plot twists, you never know who will survive by the end of the stories. You'll be hating the bad guys, sharing joys with the good guys, and then rooting for the bad guys. No explanation can ever do these books justice. Just read them. :)
B00006879E|4.0|came quickly and just what i ordered!  great cd ... played it over 100 times already!
0689861133|5.0|This book is an all-time favorite of my sons!  He's had this book for about 6 mos, and still loves to read it on a daily basis.  He's 20 mos. and finishes all the pages.  I start reading, and he can tell me each of the sounds.  It has been a great way for him to explore animal sounds, and pick up different words for his growing vocabulary.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED along with many other Sandra Boynton books.
0066620996|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Jim Rollins research-based editorial on why the top companies continue to succeed even in trying times. The basic principles and concepts that make a company great, are in many ways the same as what can make your personal life great as well.    It was engaging and kept my attention throughout the book. If you are interested in actually \\"learning\\" from a book, and you like evidence and facts that back up a trend or a business practice, then this book is for you!  I highly recommend it as one of the best I have read.
B000A32KJQ|5.0|hey j, maybe if you weren't such a snob you would recognize good music, oh and by the way, sanborn is an artist that is never afraid to venture into new territory and has raised the bar for all those that follow. not bad for a kid who picked up an instrument as a child to save his life. he's an inspiration, your just a snob. peace
B000TGCR38|5.0|This Dutch-made WWII movie was in many ways done better than Hollywood WWII movies.  Very well researched and realistically produced, it has a story that will draw you in quickly and keep your attention.  This is one foreign film that should be on everyone's DVD shelf.
B000WC3864|5.0|The reviews for this edition of Evil Dead were all mostly written before the darn thing even came out!!! So don't pay any attention to them. I understand the complaints though. How many different editions of this film and countless others will Anchor Bay release before the fans revolt and turn their backs on these films and the company itself???     But this edition does come close to it being the Ultimate Edition. The only reason why it's not the \\"ultimate edition\\" is simply do to the lack of two things, not including \\"Within The Woods\\" and a new commentary with \\"the ladies of evil dead\\" Ellen Sandweiss (Cheryl), Betsy Baker (Linda), & Theresa Tilly (Shelly), and of course Richard DeManincor (Scotty). If these two things would have been included, I don't think anyone would have complained at all.      We all know that \\"Within The Woods\\" will probably never have an official release do to the fact that it contains products used in the film and the companies either refuse to allow their products to be used in a horror movie or have asked for too much money. I honestly don't know why a new commentary wasn't recorded.      This release does contain some new footage never seen before at all!!! That's pretty cool to have if you're the hardcore fan. And the fact that the film was released in it's original Fullframe version (the movie was filmed in Fullframe) and the cropped Widescreen version. The extras are so many to list but they are definately worth the $20 or so dollars folks! The packaging is also really cool too! So if you've thought about getting this film, ignore the other releases and get this version. It's close to being the true \\"definitive edition\\"!!!      renobrown

B000001FBS|4.0|This album has a really bad reputation because it failed to chart and according to Gene, the album still hasn't reached Platinum status, which is hard to believe since the album came out in 1981!!! But this album definately has its flaws. Making a \\"concept album\\" is really difficult to begin with but making an album when the band is breaking up and with a producer who wouldn't show up and \\"Produce\\" really added to the problems! Peter had just left the band the year before (1980), Ace was ready to leave the band, and their producer Bob Ezrin at the time had a drug problem. I honestly believe this is why Gene & Paul speak so poorly about this album. It reminds them of all of the pain they were going through as a band at the time so they just disregard the album.       There a few \\"stinkers\\" on the album. Of course everyone has a difference of opinion but here's mine. I think the worst songs on the album are \\"Odyssey\\", \\"Mr. Blackwell\\", and \\"Escape From The Island\\". \\"Odyssey\\" is just so melodramatic! It has an awesome lead vocal by Paul but the song just doesn't work and it's not even a Kiss song! \\"Mr. Blackwell\\" is simply musically, a weak song. It's the most boring part of the album for me. This song should have been kept in the vault! A song that was around at the time that was better musically and probably would have fit better on the album was the song \\"Nowhere To Run\\" (sung and written by Paul). It was included on the Kiss album \\"Killers\\" and on the recent \\"Box Set\\". \\"Escape From The Island\\" is just simply a filler track in my opinion. It doesn't showcase the talent of any of the members of the band. Anyone could have written and played this song.       I feel the worst Kiss album in their career has to be \\"Asylum\\". It's just simply a wannabe Part II to \\"Animalize\\" which is also a weak album compared to \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" and \\"Lick It Up\\". This album is not an example of the \\"KISS\\" we all love and enjoy but pick up the album and judge it for yourself! The rest of the songs on the album have beautiful vocal melodies, and or awesome riffs and awesome leads, which I believe were mostly done by Paul, and not ACE!       RenoBrown.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|\\"Miss Potter\\" is a beautiful, delightful film. Full of life, joy, sorrow, and friendship, this movie works its charm on those who love Miss Potter's books and drawings, but also on those who appreciate the quality of the human spirit in facing life's challenges. Renee Zellweger is radiant as Beatrix Potter, and Ewan McGregor is wonderfully charming as her publisher. Pride of craftsmanship is evident in every frame. This movie is whimsical, warm, and true to the life of this woman. It is a quiet and lovely revelation of a life well lived.

015603283X|1.0|I enjoyed the author's Captain Alatriste, a nice change from the formula mystery, so I looked for another of his novels.  The Club Dumas began intriguingly enough, but soon became bizarre.  The female character, Irene Adler, is utterly superfluous; did Perez-Reverte think he needed a romantic interest?  And why on earth a \\"guardian angel\\"???  Then the hints of supernatural evil are, well, beneath the abilities this author demonstrated in Captain Alatriste.  I will try one more of his novels, but if it resembles this one, I'll pass on the rest of his oeuvre.

0790731924|5.0|With the success of the original film, Warner Brothers knew they had a good thing going and brought back Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and Riggs (Mel Gibson) for another go around. Like all of the LETHAL WEAPON movies, LETHAL WEAPON 2 has the duo trying to bring down a drug cartel. Like the group in the first movie, this group is international in scope, but this time around the ring leaders also happen to be diplomats of the South African government and are seemingly immune to the local laws. Still, just to be sure they do everything they can to get rid of Murtaugh and Riggs so that their thriving and extremely profitable business survives.<br /><br />The film also has a couple of subplots. Early in the film, Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect a federal informant. That man turns out to be Leo Getz (Joe Pesci). Getz's role could easily have been a minor part, but Pesci pours on the charm and steals almost every scene he is in. Getz provided Pesci with a character that seem to have a perfect balance between the edgy Pesci characters we see in films such as GOODFELLAS and his comedic talents. The other subplot involves Riggs romantic involvement with a secretary of the South Africans, Rika van den Haas (Patsy Kensit). Their relationship doesn't last the film, but is important because it shows that Riggs is beginning to live with the death of his wife and move on with his life.<br /><br />LETHAL WEAPON 2 built on the success of the first film and just made everything better. There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie, such as the famous &#34;toilet scene&#34; or the scene where Riggs &#34;brings down the house&#34; which have become classic movie moments. The film also proved that the chemistry between Glover and Gibson wasn't just a fluke.<br /><br />LETHAL WEAPON 2 also had something that the first movie didn't: a message. The film was made at the height that apartheid in South Africa was on the verge of coming to an end. It's the only movie I know of that used the bigotry of the government establishment of old South Africa as the source for film villains. The movie tries to point out how bad apartheid is. Of course, the message is really just superficial because this is an action movie after all. Probably the real reason the bad guys were South Africans was because the Cold War was coming to an end and you can't pick on the Russians when they're not your enemies anymore. Which also partially explains why the bad guys in the 3rd installment turn out to be ex-cops.d the bigotry of the government establishment of old South Africa as the source for film villains.

0786868694|4.0|This was a great book of recipes.  A little too much seafood, as I do not eat this.  Apart from that it is great.
630469654X|2.0|The movie itself is pretty good. More of a \\"chick-flick\\" than I'd like, but it still has a compelling storyline, and will be loved by romantics. Good acting too. The soundtrack, however, leaves a lot to be desired. Very dated and tired.    However, the biggest problem by far is the DVD menu, which is terrible to the point of being almost unusable. When playing this on a brand new Samsung upscaling DVD player it defaulted to English subtitles, and wouldn't yield the disc menu. Turning those subtitles off proved extremely difficult, as the DVD constantly got locked up. At one point I had to unplug the player just to get it to respond. After 10 minutes of messing about and three more freezes the subtitles finally went away.    I know it's not my DVD player, as I've watched other discs with no problems. So be warned, this DVD is not well structured, and might freak out newer players, regardless of their quality.
0333382846|5.0|Worth every penny. And worth the awkward fit on a bookshelf. Not that it would spend much time shelved anyway. Comprehensive informative text that breaks down a GREAT DEAL of minutia about the dressmakers craft. Includes information on the different processes that were carried out to create a piece of clothing for an individual. Like pattern theory, how things were roughed out before a finished product, fitting, style adaptations, how and by whom garments were fur lined. This is a very historically helpful book that provides too much information to possibly cover in review. It also includes pictures of period garments inside and out. And has pattern layouts. For the historian, re-enactor, or costumer bent on authenticity. This is a must have! Not for the weekend Renn-festival goer that just wants something fun and fanciful. Unless you're interested in greater authenticity for your garments.

0307346617|5.0|A friend of mine had recommended this book to me, and I wouldn't say I am a die hard fan of the zombie story sequence, since they all appear to be of a similar nature from my perspective.  However, I looked this book up on Amazon and saw the overwhelming response and high rating.  I am merely writing this review to further that momentum because after reading this book it worked it's way into, probably, part of my top ten books I've ever read, and I'm a fairly avid reader.<br /><br />I even made sure to read the reviews that were more negative on here and some of them do bear merit, but where they found disjointed work, I found uniqueness.  Their points are dead on, in the sense that this is not a story that flows through the book and has memorable characters throughout.  This book holds none of that for the reader, so if that is what you are looking for, I highly recommend you give this a chance and if you don't like the format give up on it.<br /><br />Most zombie related story lines seem to have a very similar theme.  Like I am Legend, 28 Days Later, or Resident Evil, the stories all focus on a predominantly single area.  About a small group of characters and their single resilience to survive against insurmountable odds.  World War Z doesn't really have that.  The format of the story is one of the more unique I have come across.  It is written in interview format (granted they're all fictional, of course), but that format didn't bother me.  Rather it intrigued me!  I found it to be a very engrossing book from start to finish in this format.  The names of the characters are not memorable, but I do not think they are supposed to be, the world and it's plight are memorable and that's what the reader should focus on.  Where those other story lines I referenced above focus on a single group, World War Z is exactly what it's title says, \\"World\\".  This is one of the first Zombie scenarios I've encountered that was practically a full Global onslaught.  Maybe I haven't read enough in the zombie genre, but this is the first I've encountered that tried to cover all the bases.<br /><br />That's where this book becomes fully engrossing, it's interesting to see how different areas of the world fought against the plight.  Such as it goes into detail about the Redeker plan that started to turn the tide.  I found this absolutely fascinating in concept.  I think this bears more similarity to a collection of short stories, but the stories all tell a part of the same global story.  I honestly can't think of a better way to give the reader that full global feel.  The other part fans may expect, and others have complained about, is the horror factor.  This book isn't exactly a \\"scary\\" novel, it's not even a thriller or suspenseful most of the time.  It's an account, and it's written in a recollected manner.  I think the fact that the threat has already passed is what takes away from the real \\"scare\\" factor.  I, for one, didn't find this to be a detriment to the books format, but others might.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is one of the most unique books I've ever read.  It takes you through interviews from specific time frames as the threat of the zombies grew, became all out war, and then as the tides turned; mankind had to pull together and clean up the mess.  This book is a global effort at it's best and anyone interested in reading something in a very different format, with quite a unique twist on this kind of a tale will find this immensly enjoyable.<br /><br />Many of the stories could be fleshed out to become their own tale.  I think one of the best mediums to present this would be in comic book or graphic novel format.  I think in that format you'd get the necessary cinematic feel that the stories would require.

B0002IQMKM|4.0|This is an excellent collection. It's missing 'I, Zimbra', 'The Big Country' and although it wasn't released as a single, I wish it had 'Drugs' on it, but it has all the other hits. This is a great collection for most Talking Heads fans.
B000VWYJ8Q|1.0|This is the last combo disc I ever buy.  Not only are they more expensive and lacking a printed side, they often work very poorly..  I had numerous pauses with this movie and at one point it completely froze forcing me to have to exit to the menu and restart that scene.  I would recommend avoiding the combo discs and getting the 3 disc set.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|If you feel there are inherent dangers in the governmental process and are worried about where that could lead us all - you absolutely must see this film.  It's a thinking man's film - not for the mentally faint of heart.  Nor is it for someone seeking a light-hearted romp.  What this film IS is a viewing must.    If I were a high school or college instructor, I would make viewing this film a required part of any Law, History, or Government course.    Perhaps the most important thing to remember when watching it is that no society or government lasts forever - not even your own.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This 2007 Victorian-era fantasy took me by surprise and most pleasantly, as the original ads make it sound like it would be a CGI-saturated conglomeration of [[ASIN:B000BKVQTS The Brothers Grimm]] and [[ASIN:B00005LOKQ The Princess Bride]] with a little [[ASIN:B0000844JJ Time Bandits]] thrown in for good measure.  What it turns out to be is an adult fairy tale that doesn't make the mistake of taking itself too seriously. Even though much of the credit belongs to the source, the highly acclaimed [[ASIN:0061142026 1997 graphic novel]] by Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess, director and co-screenwriter Matthew Vaughan (along with co-writer Jane Goldman) does an impressive job balancing the comically ribald and pitch-black elements into a compelling albeit rather convoluted plot gift-wrapped in a romantic adventure.<br /><br />The fanciful tale centers on Tristan, a gawky shop boy who is completely smitten with the beauteous Victoria, who is naturally to be engaged to the more dashing Humphrey within the week. Tristan and Victoria strike a deal whereby she will marry him only if he can deliver a falling star to her before Humphrey proposes. In order to do so, Tristan must pass through the sacred wall into the magical kingdom of Stronghold, his birthplace and where his mother may still be held captive. There in a newly formed crater, he finds Yvaine, a star that has fallen out of the firmament against her will. Now vulnerably earthbound, Yvaine also elicits the attention of two unsavory characters - Prince Septimus, Stronghold's remaining heir, who wants a jewel necklace she wears in order to ensure his ascendancy to the throne, and Lamia, a 400-year old witch looking to reclaim her youth and beauty by taking out Yvaine's heart...literally. Their paths criss-cross throughout the film in ways both dazzling and scarifying. To Vaughan's credit, the movie never feels overwhelmed by the special effects necessary to sustain the fantasy, including airborne galleons, mystical creatures, and all the magical shape transformations due to witchcraft. Moreover, it's the sharp wit of his and Goldman's script and the quicksilver pacing that really keeps the story aloft in an unexpected manner.<br /><br />The casting is close to ideal. As Tristan, the reluctant hero, Charlie Cox elevates a potentially callow role into one with genuine romance and indiscriminate vigor. At first, with her contemporary sensibilities, Claire Danes' ironic take on Yvaine feels a bit off, but she transitions nicely into the heartfelt aspects of her ethereal role. Making her venal Velma Von Tussle in [[ASIN:B00005JODK Hairspray]] look like a suburban amateur by comparison, Michelle Pfeiffer has a grand time playing Lamia switching back and forth from her stunning beauty to decaying harridan, all the while plotting and conniving her way to her end goal. She has obviously entered a phase of her career where she feels comfortable acting malicious without remorse and sending up her incredible looks. In brief roles, Sienna Miller perfectly captures Victoria's capricious and superficial nature, Rupert Everett epitomizes gallows wit as the splattered Secundus, and Ricky Gervais goes for the funny bone as the opportunistic Ferdy the Fence. Even Peter O'Toole shows up as a dying king (perhaps coincidentally, he played an actor playing a similar part in last year's [[ASIN:B000NOKFHG Venus]]), and Ian McKellan provides the stentorian narration.<br /><br />However, the real scene stealer is Robert DeNiro, doing little to hide his Bronx accent, as Captain Shakespeare, who maintains a surprising dual identity to keep up appearances for his crew. It's hardly his finest hour, but he is far more amusing here than in [[ASIN:B00005JN5T Meet The Fockers]].  The technical aspects of this sprawling, imaginative world are first-rate, in particular, Gavin Bocquet's meticulous production design (he was responsible for the design of the latest [[ASIN:B00003CX5P Star Wars]] trilogy) and Ben Davis's stellar cinematography. The 2007 DVD is relatively sparse on extras. There is no director's commentary, but there is a half-hour making-of featurette, \\"Good Omens: The Making of `Stardust'\\", which summarizes the commentary from the filmmakers, as well as the movie's cast and crew, into one program. About five minutes of deleted scenes and another five minutes of bloopers are also included, as well as the original theatrical trailer.

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by just how much content is loaded on this two disk DVD package. Not only do you get the complete concert but you get three other bonus features that are all about or over an hour long.<br /><br />First, the concert. I've seen it twice in Vegas. This one was pretty good although, to me, she seemed a little tired during some of the performances. \\"I'm Alive\\" in particular wasn't very good. She pretty much doesn't care how \\"Love Can Move Mountains\\" turns out anymore. She just goes out there and sings whatever. But there are two fantastic performances and those are the Italian song and \\"River Deep.\\"<br /><br />The bonus features start with a \\"Tribute to the Fans\\" which is touching and also a little creepy. Some of the stories are heart warming and others make the people look a bit sad. One woman says she's had two miracles in her life and one is beating cancer and the other is meeting Celine. I mean...she's had NOTHING else happen in her life more important than meeting a celebrity? And the people that got Celine tattooed on their bodies need some kind of therapy. I think even Celine was creeped out by that.<br /><br />Another bonus feature is the complete concert but back stage and it is absoutely fascinating what goes on back there and just how much energy is put in to putting on each show every day. The dancers all work extremely hard and Celine is running around non stop and never gets a break. The time she's off stage is spent rushing to put on the next dress. And you almost get to see a naked Celine in this.<br /><br />The last feature is an hour of interviews with everybody who put the show together and everything that happened. Celine talks about her ugly blonde hair period. They also show some of the performance of the night when she lost her dad.<br /><br />Great DVD. A must buy for any Celine fan.
B000WS4PCO|3.0|(Commenting solely on audio quality - I love the album.)     I hate to disagree with the other commenter, but the remaster job here has resulted in (at best) only a very slight improvement in audio quality. Where I think the earlier commenter went wrong, is that the new version is mastered substantially louder. Unless you match the levels, you'll be fooled into thinking the remaster sounds \\"better.\\" In addition, the previous commenter was listening on an inexpensive mini-system, and had engaged an EQ feature (which, on this sort of system, is likely to reduce audio quality).    I did my listening on a pair of Sennheiser 650 headphones ($550), being fed by a Mark Levinson 390S CD player ($6000) and Headroom Blockhead balanced headphone amplifier ($4000). After matching the levels of this remaster against my late 80s original CD, I found almost no difference between them. The new version lets you hear slightly deeper into the mix, but it was a very subtle difference, and unlikely to be audible on anything but the highest-end equipment.     Upshot: keep your original CD, if what your interested in audio quality alone.

B000I2J6K0|4.0|I bought this DVD after reading several of the reviews published on this site. I wanted a home workout DVD since winter was here and I knew I couldn't get out as much because of weather and demands of my current children.  Let me state that before I got pregnant, I was extremely physically fit and active. I exercise at a gym probably 5-6 times a week. I was able to run 4 miles a day and workout with weights. Once I got pregnant, I was able to keep up my physical activity, but once I hit 14-15 weeks pregnant, I could no longer run and I would get light headed when I was weight training, so I knew I needed to tone down the workouts. I walked outside from 16-21 weeks, but I started to get very severe round ligament pain in my abdomen as I got larger (this is my fourth pregnancy) and it would start up about 10 minutes into my walk, so walking was fast becoming a workout I could solely do for my exercise.     I searched and searched for pregnancy DVDs that would provide a workout challenge for me (so I could stay in shape), but didn't cause any pain or discomfort. Often, I would rent pregnancy workouts from mail/online DVD rental sites to test them out first. This DVD workout has become my new favorite type of exercise and so I bought the DVD since I do it several times a week. I don't get ANY round ligament pain (RL pain feels like severe cramps on the sides of your belly, but once you stop the physical activity, they go away). Erin's workout is challenging - in fact - I could not complete the whole DVD workout the first few times I did it - I could only finish 20 minutes of it or I would skip certain parts. Now, I can finish the whole thing and I don't get out of breath because she is really good at pacing and providing breaks - yet she keeps you up on your workout. You get some cardio - not a lot - but enough to get you sweating. You get a workout of squats, leg lunges, and kicks, but don't let that scare you away - they are completely doable for a pregnant woman andthey make me feel really strong and able when I am done doing it. I enjoy the floor workout which consists of several Pilates-type leg lifts. There are some modified yoga stretches, but not a lot. All in all - if I do this workout 3-4 times a week, I really feel good physically because I got to workout, but I don't feel stress or strain on my body.     I will say that the video producation quality is more like a home video, but that doesn't bother me. She keeps it really simple - she herself is in a living room area of a house with the furniture cleared to the sides of the room, so it demonstrates that you don't need a lot of equipment or space to do this workout. The music is TERRIBLE so I just crank up my Ipod on my speakers and march to my own music.    The workout also contains a separate \\"partner\\" workout and she includes her hunky husband (Mike from Desperate Housewives). I just watched it for a few minutes and I found it cheesy, so I haven't actually done the workout - but it looks like a good supplement to the other workout if you want to adapt some of the moves.    Overall, this is a great home workout option - buy a separate yoga DVD for streching and stress relief, and try to get outside to walk, ride bikes, or swim and you have yourself a great balanced pregnancy workout program.
0143038419|4.0|I read this book in 48 hours.  It was really fun to read, although I wouldn't call it great writing. It is amusing and sometimes witty, even the sad parts. It is the perfect women's book club book, as it addresses the major concerns of most women that I know:  food, yoga, and sex.  The three main sections of the book deal with food (in Italy), yoga (in India), and sex (in Indonesia).    Some people think it's odd that I think yoga is a principle obsession of women.  But a lot of women I know these days talk about their yoga practice a lot; it is pretty central to their lives. The yoga in this book, though, is not Hatha Yoga; it is guru yoga, where you go to an ashram and devote yourself to meditation and the teachings of your guru.  Liz's guru is a beautiful Indian woman.  She doesn't name her, but you can easily  find out on the eat-pray-love-fan blog who she is.  I looked her up on wikipedia, and she could be the leader of a pernicious cult if you believe some of the stuff about her on the internet, but Liz seems to have had a wonderful, uncultish time at her ashram in India.    This story is a kind of romance novel, in that it ends with the heroine finding true love.  In fact, Northrup Frye would call it a comedy, as it ends in a \\"marriage,\\" or a promise of one, just like a Jane Austen novel.  You could say that it's a Jane Austen novel for the aughties:  the heroine, battered and bruised by a bounder boyfriend and husband, finds true love at last, but only after trials and tribulations.    Liz's main problem, to my eye, is that she doesn't have a very evolved feminist consciousness.  She can't always spot a patriarchal lie.  For example, in her ashram, a lot of the chanting revolves around a patriarchal Hindu story that she hates, until she \\"surrenders\\" to it.  The main mantra at the mantra  is \\"Om Namma Shivaya,\\" meaning \\"Hail to the (male) god within me.\\"  Why not Om Namma Shaktiya? (meaning \\"Homage to the goddess within me,\\" which would be more appropriate for women anyway.)    But to her credit, she resists boyfriends for at least eight months during her year of finding herself, and the boyfriend she finally falls for seems to be a genuinely good and caring fellow. \\"Reader, I married him,\\" she more or less says in the end.  And she finds her inner goddess, and a more fun way to meditate, in Indonesia: just sitting and smiling.  Hurray for Liz! I look forward to the next installment.

B000PC8AFU|4.0|Judging from the spate of negative reviews posted here, you would think that Solos, Sessions and Encores is the biggest piece of musical garbage to be released since Justin Timberlake's latest CD. But if you read closely, what you'll find is that most reviewers are just mad that the record company is squeezing yet more profit from the storied legacy of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Listen closely to the CD then ask yourself \\"Is it really that bad?\\".  I own just a half-dozen or so SRV CDs, so in no way could you call me a completeist. I saw him play in San Antonio before the release of Texas Flood brought him national then international fame, so I am not at all a newcomer to his sound. I followed him religiously for a while but then after his untimely death I kind of lost track of what was issued in his name. I was attracted to this when I saw it on sale partially because of the price, and partially because of who he appears with. Also, I did not yet own any of the songs except Marcia Ball's Soulful Dress. It took me only a couple listens to decide that this was money well spent.  If this recording was made by anyone but SRV, I have a feeling that the ratings would be skewed in a more positive direction. There is some great music here including five out of the six songs that the record company claims are previously unreleased. If you like the blues, you should enjoy this regardless of your feelings about the profit motive. My favorites are: The Sky Is Crying, On the Run, Albert's Shuffle, Change It, a live Texas Flood, and a magnificent Pipeline. About the only ones I don't care for are the silly Oreo Cookie Blues (which is not one of the better Lonnie Mack compositions) and the awful disco of Let's Dance, which served to remind me why I was never into David Bowie. SRV joins such luminaries as Paul Butterfield, Albert and BB King, Jeff Beck, Albert Collins, surf music legend Dick Dale, and some excellent but lesser-known blues musicians to deliver almost 70 minutes of mostly very listenable music.  My complaints? The cheap booklet, though informative, was miscut so I am missing some information. Then there is the inclusion of that Bowie tune, so out of place on a blues album even if SRV did play in the song.  Nearly two decades after SRV's death, none of us should be expecting anything new to appear in his name. When a \\"new\\" SRV recording does appear, of course its because the record company is trying to make a buck. That's what they are in business for. From the sales ranking, it appears that despite the negativity that the record company in question is going to make money on this too. If you are a blues lover, you should find that if you focus on the music itself and not the motivations of its release that this is worth owning.
0142004413|5.0|This book, ironically, was on one of those horrible \\"summer reading\\" lists so many of us are forced to do in high school.  It's the only one I was ever forced to read that I truly, genuinely loved.  I laughed out loud literally every two or three pages, and though I have no natural interest in animals (especially insects), Durell makes his descriptions of the nature on Corfu as gripping and as touching as his descriptions of his family.    It's been ten years since I first read this book, and when I get together with my old friends, we STILL argue about our favorite scenes, the best character, the most troublesome pet.  This is a book you won't be able to put down the first time you read it, and will want to re-read the moment you finish it.
B000TLTUL0|4.0|Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd<br />His skin was pale and his eye was odd<br />He shaved the faces of gentlemen<br />Who never thereafter were heard of again...<br /><br />The long-awaited adaptation of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" from stage to screen has finally arrived and Tim Burton is reaping rave reviews, Christmas cheer and the joy of the birth of his second child with longtime girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter.  With an already extensive body of work, Burton has most certainly completed his largest project to date and not only is it his magnum opus, it is Oscar bait as well.<br /><br />Returning for his and Burton's sixth collaboration, Johnny Depp shoulders the role of the title character, a barber of good repute whose beautiful wife Lucy is stolen away by the conniving Judge Turpin (Rickman).  Returning to London from a 15-year exile, the woeful and bitter Benjamin Barker (Depp) assumes the moniker of Sweeney Todd and in cahoots with the wily Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter) begins slicing men's throats en masse with his prized razors.  He soon discovers that his daughter Johanna (Wisener) is a virtual prisoner in Turpin's home and is determined to exact his revenge, all the while providing the main ingredient for Mrs. Lovett's re-popularized meat pies.<br /><br />Depp looks like Beethoven on crank (or Edward Scissorhands if he'd gotten a perm) and Bonham Carter is a Raggedy Ann doll from hell.  Both give admirable performances but singing-wise, they're sub-par.  Yes, yes, I know that Depp never got a single singing lesson and coached himself and he's to be commended.  Bonham Carter did get singing lessons and even studied baking to prepare for her performance as Mrs. Lovett but she still manages to do nothing more than carry a tune, and that's my assessment of most of the other castmates as well.  I found myself more than once thinking, \\"No, no, no...SING, DAMMIT!\\"  To hear these songs sung by the 1979 original Broadway cast has Depp and Bonham Carter PALING in comparison to the likes of Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou. The only voices that rise slightly above mediocre are Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony (\\"Johanna\\") and Ed Sanders as Toby (\\"Not While I'm Around\\").  Broadway material most of these people are NOT, especially when trying to bring to life the music of Stephen Sondheim but their acting makes up for it, thank goodness.<br /><br />Of course, most of the youth who will flock to the cineplex are fans of the \\"Pirates of the Carribean\\" films and they won't be disappointed.  Depp faithfully emotes with utmost excellence and gives Sweeney a snarling intensity worthy of another Oscar nod.  Bonham Carter brings a certain sweet psychosis to our dearest Mrs. Lovett and Alan Rickman makes us smile as well as squirm with his portrayal of the perverted Judge Turpin. My personal favorite is Sacha Baron Cohen as the flamboyant Signor Pirelli - he'll get many chuckles as well as ovations with his overwrought Italian accent and surprising operatics.<br /><br />For those who are fans of Tim Burton's dark and gothic vision, you will salivate over his version of 19th-century London.  He paints a fantastically dank and dirty metropolis awash in smoke, fog and pestilence.  Renowned costume designer Colleen Atwood (Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands) joins Burton's crew once again, draping Depp in frills, thrills and leather and appareling Bonham Carter in playfully daring couture.  Hair and makeup are superb and the violent nature of the story has not been sugarcoated in the least - \\"Sweeney\\" is fully saturated in gore, blood literally spraying from people's throats and corpses plunging into the dungeon-like basement of the pie shop with a sickening thud.<br /><br />On a scale of one to ten, \\"Sweeney Todd\\" rates an 8.

B000URDEB0|5.0|The immediate comparison to Evanescence leapt to mind, but was dashed to pieces within ten seconds of my first hearing of Nightwish.  The songs by this group are far more creative, and do not answer to the sensibilities of the Pop masses.  There are things in here for everyone.  Granted, some of it is strategic--you do want the casual listener attracted to your music.  What is the point if no one hears?    The other comparison I thought of was Jim Steinman, and the stuff he's done obviously with Meat Loaf.  Say what you will about Meat Loaf and the tongue-in-cheek motif he goes for, but Jim Steinman knows how to write a song.  It's got a symphonic/rock thing going on, but Nightwish carries far more interest for me.  Lyrically they are far deeper.  Where Steinman relishes in the modern stage musical feel, Nightwish is far more Operatic.  There is thematic depth, resonance in the soul, changes in dynamic and feel within the songs themselves.    It is all at once everything Evanescence, Jim Steinman, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Metallica, Led Zeppelin and Queen wish they could have been.
B000W0NO5Q|5.0|This is an eloquently written story with colorful characters that takes the reader on a relaxing journey.  The writing and story flow smoothly throughout the book without any dullness or letdowns.  Smith has created an enjoyable main character that is a lady detective in Botswana in Africa.  She gets involved in interesting situations that provide stimulation and entertainment without overdoing it.  Although this is about a ladies' detective agency, the book is not just for ladies as I had imagined.  I found it delightful reading and look forward to reading the remaining books in the series.

1932100385|5.0|Can you answer the question: Why are people still so confused about what \\"good nutrition\\" is?     Reading this book provided so many reasons for the things I already believed but an unexpected, and invaluable, benefit was an in-depth description of how disinformation is disseminated through government, industry, and scientific channels (remember tobacco and cancer, Exxon and global warming).     Vegans should read this book so they understand that you can't just stop eating animals and expect to be healthy. In addition, you must eat a diverse selection of unprocessed foods. After reading this book, you should be able to confidently defend your choices and accurately answer questions.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers book by Steven Ambrose was a hit, the series with the same name is an excellent film that continues to impress.

0316166685|3.0|Susie Salmon, narrator, is a 14 year-old telling her story from heaven. She has been murdered by a neighbor. She watches her family deal with their loss in different ways. Her father instinctively knows who killed her, but no one believes him. Her mother has an affair. Her sister toughens herself up. Her 4 year-old brother just tries to understand what happened, continuing to ask, \\"Where's Susie?\\" I really enjoyed her style of writing, but not necessarily the subject matter. There was a segment that felt like someone else started typing when the author went on a coffee break--it went off into left field. The ending felt surreal and too neat, like everything had been solved, but I didn't think it had been.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I'm hoping JUNO helps make Ellen Page the star that HARD CANDY should have made her.  She was completely unknown to me when I went to see that harrowing piece, and her performance was Oscar caliber.  I've been eagerly awaiting more work from her, but other than a tiny part in X-MEN: LAST STAND, I've had a pretty long wait.    But she totally steals JUNO...which is saying a lot, because almost everyone is pretty terrific in this highly entertaining film.  But Ellen Page is some sort of unique energy source.  She seems to do so little, but the tiniest facial tic or change in tone conveys so much.  She's clearly a super-intelligent actress and her characters are also intelligent (probably almost to the point of stretching credulity...but who cares, it's so much fun), and they are funny and in JUNO, sensitive.    Juno is a sixteen year old who has just discovered she's pregnant, after one encounter with her longtime friend Bleeker (they are mostly just friends...not really girlfriend/boyfriend).  June at first considers abortion as her only option, but she quickly decides she'd rather carry the child and pass it on to a loving but needy couple for adoption.  She does this knowing full well that she'll be an object of much discussion at school, AND she'll have to tell her father (JK Simmons) and her step-mother (Allison Janney).  And she'll have to tell the baby's father (Michael Cera from SUPERBAD and ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT).      She finds her immediate family to be shocked but supportive, and her dad comes with her to meet the couple Juno has selected (from the \\"Penny Saver\\" no less!).  These childless yuppies are played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, and at first we think Garner is a bit of a control freak, and Bateman is the \\"cool\\" one...but this movie plays with our expectations of this couple right from the start.  I won't say much more, because much of the richness of the film comes in the changes Juno sparks in this couple.      Juno is a whip-smart almostloner, who we find early on, is probably secretly pining for the love of goofy Bleeker.  And Bleeker certainly loves his old friend...yet these two have never faced these feelings...because they are both so confounded by them.  Juno is accustomed to having her act very much under control, and I believe she has a hard time admitting she has feelings that make her vulnerable to another person.  And Bleeker (played sublimely by Michael Cera...who is now officially in danger of being typecast for the rest of his life) is just too shy, goofy and flummoxed to believe his feelings would ever be returned.      There isn't a lot of plot to the film.  It follows Juno through her voyage of discovery, at the child growing inside her, at her own feelings towards the boy who may become the man in her life and at what she discovers about the family she wants to give her child to.  What makes JUNO so much fun is the crackling dialogue (from current hot screenwriter Diablo Cody) and the equally snappy performances.    (I appreciated too that Juno made the choice not to have an abortion.  Not only would there have been no film if she had...but it was refreshing to see a major film character make the choice she did.  Not because she was against abortion, but because she was able to make a reasoned decision that was not only great for her child, but great for another couple and quite enriching for her.  It also serves as a reminder that there are other choices besides abortion or deciding to raise a child yourself.  I don't feel the film was trying to make a statement...except to say \\"whatever you decide, think it through a little bit.\\")    The dialogue is the kind that no one would ever speak in real life, yet it hews close enough to realistic that it becomes its own style of \\"hyper-realism.\\"  Ellen Page has the aura of someone who might actually speak in this very cynical yet open and intelligent manner, and thus she pulls it off.  Therefore, everyone else (none of whom are quite sosnappy as Juno) seems positively normal by comparison.  Thus, the dialogue works!    The performances are very good as well.  As I said, Cera is wonderful at the type of part he plays...I hope he gets to stretch soon as an actor...but for now, seeing him work is a delight.  Janney is very good as the stepmother, who both loves and is exasperated by Juno.  Garner is touching in her smallish but important role, and Bateman brings interesting shadings to what could have been a one-dimensional role.  He underplays, and this is in keeping with the style of the film.  It's no wonder that his character and Juno's hit it off so well.    But to me, other than Ellen Page, the MVP of the film is the always fantastic JK Simmons.  Can someone please sometime give this actor an award!!  From the over-the-top newspaper editor in the SPIDERMAN films, to the hilarious thief with irritable bowel syndrome in THE LADY KILLERS, to competent Dr. Skoda in \\"Law and Order\\" to the chilling white supremacist in \\"Oz\\"...this guy may be the best character actor around.  He plays Juno's dad so well, and their scenes together have a true warmth that spreads to the whole film.  He's a blue-collar guy...no doubt perplexed by Juno's immense vocabulary and her way of speaking...yet we can also see in his manner that he's a big inspiration to how Juno turned out the way she did.  It's a well-written part, and he knocks it out of the park.    The movie is not perfect.  Again, the wonderful screenplay is a bit mannered.  It struck me that way a Woody Allen or Neil Simon script might strike an audience...these characters are too witty to be believed.  So while I thoroughly enjoyed the script and while it was well-executed...it still did not 100% elude the \\"hey, no one in real life would think to say that\\" syndrome from time to time.  It would say it was more like 95% of the time.      Jason Reitman (who also directed the excellent THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) keeps the film moving nicely...but he's not a super-inventive director.  He finds good scripts and a good cast (90% of the battle) but there's nothing inspiring about what he brings to the film as a crafter of beautiful imagery or masterful framing.  He lets his actors do great work, and that's most important.  Some day, I hope he tries his hand at something that doesn't really on Aaron Eckhart's or Ellen Page's masterful delivery.    But this is certainly a film high on my list for 2007.  I truly love Ellen Page, and I predict some more great things for her.  Her performance alone makes the film worth seeing...but thank goodness there are so many other great things as well.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|Though I gave this DVD as a Christmas gift, I saw this movie at the theater when it first opened.  I must say that it had everything that the other 2 seemed to have missed....if you are going to watch just one of the \\"Ocean\\" movies....make it Ocean's 13!
B000OVLBGC|3.0|First of all, this is not only one of the best foriegn films I have ever seen, but one of the best films I have seen period!  I have nothing to add to the other five star reviews here that hasn't already been covered.      That said, it pains me to report that this DVD release has a serious flaw and that is the subtitling!  Some other reviewers have commented on the poor quality of the translation in the subtitles, which may in fact be true.  But even more of a detriment is the fact that if you watch this film on a widescreen TV you will not see ANY subtitles at all!  This is because the disk was encoded to display the subtitles in the black dead space area, outside of the letterboxed region where film frames appear.  Widescreen TVs don't display this dead space, they actually fill up the screen with the letterbox frame which means that the subtitles are completely lost!  The disk offers no option to display the subtitles properly on a widscreen format television set, i.e. inside the letterbox frame.  This is particularly ironic considering that SONY, the distributer of the DVD, is the same company that manufactured widescreen TV on which I discovered the problem!  You'd think that they would have had a clue about how to format the subtitles on the DVD to work on all of their television models!  If you have a conventional TV set, then you won't have this problem since it will display the letterbox with the black boundaries intact.      So if you are a widescreen television owner and are fluent in German, then I can heartily recommend this wonderful movie.  If not, then make sure you have a conventional set on which to watch this DVD or wait for SONY to fix this embarassing mistake before you make the purchase!
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|The picture on the HD-DVD is just breathtaking.  The audio is fantastic as well.  This movie doesn't look like something that was filmed 25 years ago.  If it wasn't for the fact that Harrison Ford looks so much  younger, you would think that this was a newer movie.      Obviously, it is a great film with dark sci-fi themes that was way ahead of its time.  But seeing how mind-blowing the special effects look in HD just makes this a totally new film.      I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  In fact if you don't have one of the HD formats (I have both) you should upgrade simply to enjoy this film as it should be enjoyed.
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|This is SOOOO 80's. I'm sure if the songs were produced in the 80's they would have been hits. Good (although predictable) story.
B0000DZTIW|1.0|Great soundtrack, but be warned: if you listen to your CDs while working on your PC, this CD is \\"protected\\" with a buggy Macromedia overlay that hides the songs and prevents the CD from playing on computers. I looked online for a solution to this problem, and found many, many others with the exact same complaint for this and other albums from Elektra.  It doesn't matter if you are running Windows or Linux, standard players will not work and file browsers do not snow the song list.      The solution unfortunately is that you have to rip your own CD to a file format like MP3. This is covered under fair use, but is obviously a lot more trouble than one should have to go through to listen to a standard generic audio CD, let alone the 100MB of drive space if you want the universal MP3 format with 320Kbps quality.  I did not want to rip my CD, but apparently Elektra wants to punish their customers for using computers.  I for one will definitely check the label in the future, and never buy from them again.

B00008J2PG|3.0|The video brings to light little known facts concerning the refuge of the Vatican during the Nazis occupation of Rome.  There were may stellar moments, some tense others more light-hearted as the church struggled to provide refuge against the strangle-hold of the forces of evil.  The acting by Peck was wonderful but what became a little tiring were the numerous 'disguises' the priest assumed in order to escape the bonds of his Vatican prison in order to meet with operatives outside the walls.  One wondered why a lesser known individual could not have done this task causing less attention to himself and danger to the mission. These numerous disguises seemed a bit too much and caused the film to run 30 minutes too long.  All that said the film is still worth seeing.
1569242739|4.0|I bought this book as a small x-mas gift for myself.  I had been told by numerous vegans I know that the recipes are really good.  I've tried 3 recipes so far and other than a little tweaking to reduce sugar in some of the icing/frosting recipes, these cupcakes rock!  And the funny thing about eating them is that they are very satisfying.  They're not loaded or burdened with heavy, fatty animal products like milk, eggs and butter that make you crave more.  One recipe even called for ground flax seed which gave me a big boost of energy.<br /><br />The only con (in my opinion) is that many of the ingredients are not standard household items unless you are a Vegan (I'm vegetarian)... so you have to do a pretty good grocery shopping and spend some $$ to make sure you have what you need.  The finished product is very worth it!  No one eating them would ever know that these cakes are vegan...  They are delicious.  Enjoy and happy baking!<br /><br />** ADDENDUM ** March 10th... I made the chocolate, gluten-free with chocolate buttercream frosting cupcakes this weekend and they were to die for.  GLUTEN-FREE VEGAN CUPCAKES THAT ACTUALLY TASTED FANTASTIC... So much chocolatey goodness... ;)
B000VWYJ86|5.0|2007 was a year filled to the brim with trilogies coming to their end, and while some proved disappointing there is one that stands towering above the rest as pure excellence.  Yes, I am talking about `The Bourne Ultimatum', a film that can rightfully be considered one of the best films of this year.  It's breathtaking, heart pounding excitement that is, get this, smart.  The first two Bourne films were amazing as well, but this third installment is notches above the rest.  So, if you've been let down by the bigger, showier trilogies that were wrapped up this year (namely that Spider Mess) then `The Bourne Ultimatum' may just be the cure for that undeniable itch.<br /><br />Picking up where `The Bourne Supremacy' left off, and subsequently where `The Bourne Identity' left off as well, `The Bourne Ultimatum' throws us in the heat of the chase with our hero Jason Bourne being pursued in Moscow.  Bourne is still tracking down the people responsible for his condition (not to mention the death of his girlfriend) and they are in the same respect hunting him down as well, in order to tie up lose ends.  Heading the man hunt is CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen, a man determined to kill Bourne and any who aid in his pursuit.  As Jason comes closer to learning the truth about his identity he is helped along by Pamela Landy and Nicky Parsons, two people who have seen the corruptness surrounding the pursuit of Jason Bourne and have made the decision to help Bourne expose it.<br /><br />Taking the reigns once again is Oscar nominated director Paul Greengrass.  Greengrass has perfected his execution of Bourne, relying heavy on fast-cut editing and scene splicing to create an effect of standing right beside Jason Bourne as he races atop buildings, tears up gravel or pummels the enemy.  There are moments within `The Bourne Ultimatum' that could literally stop your heart with its pure intensity.  A scene where Bourne is racing to find Nicky before an assassin does is one of those scenes, so intense that I literally found myself refusing to blink.<br /><br />The action sequences are out of this world, eye popping spectacles that will keep the viewer entranced until they are through only to quickly throw you into yet another heart racing scene.<br /><br />Matt Damon has been one of those actors who I never really got.  He was impressive in `Good Will Hunting' but nothing mind blowing, and then he was mind blowing in `The Talented Mr. Ripley' but aside from that he never really made an impact on me, at least not a lasting one.  I was ready to write him off as a one of those actors who lucked into a good role and then he did `The Bourne Identity' and I thought to myself, `maybe this is his calling', and then `The Bourne Supremacy' made me believe that thought and now `The Bourne Ultimatum' makes me invest much faith in the fact that Damon is much more than a lucky actor.  I just hope his future roles reflect that.  As Jason Bourne Damon did what many actors try to and so few succeed and that is to make an action movie hero a real and identifiable human being.<br /><br />I was very happy to see Julia Stiles get more to do here.  I often wonder what happened to her career.  Back in 2000 she was the new face, the new star who was supposed to blow up big and then she kind of disappeared and all the roles that should have gone her way went the way of everyone else.  She's appeared in each and every Bourne film with little or nothing to do but her character is finally given some breathing room here and she does as much as she can with it proving once again that she needs to get bigger and better roles.  Joan Allen is always a delight, and she proves to be memorable here as well, but the scene stealer to me this go around is David Strathairn.

B000001Y2U|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I don't listen to much hard rock, metal, or grunge. In fact, other than Nine Inch Nails, Manson is the only one in the genre I listen to. So, things might seem biased since I am not too familiar with some of the best metal/rock albums out there.    Still, \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" is one of the best albums I've ever heard in my life. I bought it some time in 2002 but really didn't dive into it until a few years ago. Needless to say, I felt a bit behind. But I digress. Every single track on this record is fantastic, catchy, and worth the listen. I usually grow tired of listening to albums from top to bottom- but this is one album I can listen to all the way through without skipping a track.     Most people in my life are surprised that I listen to Marilyn Manson, basically because I don't fit their own stereotypes on what a Manson listener is. I rarely defend myself to them because they just won't understand it if they didn't already. Manson's simple title is \\"shock rocker\\", but any avid listener knows that he is one of the world's best spokesmen, theorists, and musicians. He's had some amazing albums, but there's no denying that \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" is his gem and it always will be. So, if you're one of those people like myself who missed this glorious era of his over 10 years ago, do yourself a favor and experience this record. It will change your life. And much to the surprise of some of society's idiots, you'll still be a decent human being who has a heart and doesn't worship Satan.
0765318741|2.0|This book was a real letdown. I did enjoy the story but when I came to page 159 I was shocked to see that it ended. I think a lot more of the story could have been told. I looked over the entire paperback to see where it stated that it was a book of short stories. Nowhere does it state that. Even the narrative on the back cover only talks about the \\"I am Legend\\" story. I've been robbed!!!

When Chronicler seeks him out to find the truth of his story he is told it will take 3 days to tell the tale and it will only be told once, and this is that story.      This book is a real pleasure to read.  Its thick and that might be a turn-off for some people, but you should seriously pick up this book if you love a well written fantasy.     It's hard to believe this is the first book by this author its so good. I'm eagerly awaiting part 2 of this series - it looks to be one that anyone who truly loves fantasy should not miss.  Even with part one alone I think this is looking like a classic.    [[ASIN:0756404738 The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle, Day 2)]]

B000HWY5MK|5.0|This book changed the way I approach (or decide not to approach) many choices in my life. It delves into the psychology of choices, specifically how an abundance of choices can have many negative effects on us, contrary to what we may think. To quote the book, \\"Having too many choices produces psychological distress, especially when combined with regret, concern about status, adaptation, social comparison, and perhaps most important, the desire to have the best of everything -- to maximize.\\"<br /><br />While focusing on consumerism, many of the points apply to any time a choice is made, such as careers and even romance. Points are made with fascinating anecdotal evidence, and are clearly explained.<br /><br />Definitely a great read.

0375842381|5.0|It's sad to see all of the bashing of this wonderful trilogy by Christian fundamentalists since word of The Golden Compass' film release drew near. I don't understand why it is that anything that doesn't elucidate the 'wonders and accuracies of religious beliefs' is automatically deemed a direct blow to all faith and morality. Is that faith so worn that all contrary to it is damaging? It seems that way...with all of the unwarranted uproar.<br /><br />This book is great. There are times that you will read a book and realize the magnificence of it, and the unimaginable talent of the author as you do, to the extent that you become awestruck. That happened to me while reading His Dark Materials.<br /><br />I recommend it to all, Christian and Atheist, Buddhist or Agnostic. It is simply a great series, and you'd be doing yourself a great disservice by condemning it before you've experienced it.
B000WCBMA8|5.0|The hives have learn how to make give their music variety. This album is a bit different that the usual hives, but nonetheless these tunes are still catchy and great. One of the best albums i have heard. Bought this album when it came out in Nov and i still cant get tired of it. Wish we had more bands like them, then again, no one can ever compare to the Hives.
B000002KO1|3.0|I have always been a fan of the Pretenders' radio hits, and wanted to start listening to their original albums.  The only other one I heard so far was Learning to Crawl, which I do recommend highly.  Learning to Crawl is essentially a different band with the same songwriter, Chrissy Hynde.  This album, on the other hand, could use improvement.    \\"Mystery Achievement\\" is certainly the crowning uh... achievement on this album.  It's a poignant, tense track that WILL still give you goose bumps near the end, even after multiple listens.  Other songs, however, could use improvement.  \\"Brass in Pocket\\" is a nice song but is overplayed and a bit too bland; \\"Precious\\" is a good song, but suffers from poor production, even during this day.  Actually much of the album really does suffer from garage-quality production.  I suppose that should be the charm of music rooted in punk, but this was produced in 1980 and now sounds quite dated.  Contrast this to their contemporaries - Steely Dan comes to mind with their albums \\"Gaucho\\" and \\"Aja\\" - and you have polar opposites on the production spectrum.  What can I say, I am a fan of detailed, perfected production, and this album does not even have acceptable production.  It just sounds too raw and scratchy.  I do have to admit, I have a copy of the original album and not the remastered.  And this album HAS been remastered, so I recommend you do try that out first.    And therein lies the problem.  Songs that could have been great like \\"Precious,\\" \\"the Wait,\\" and \\"Private Life\\" are marred by poor production.   Several other songs like \\"The Phone Call\\" and \\"Up the Neck\\" really are too generic and don't stand out at all.  \\"Private Life\\" especially suffers from poor sound volume mixing, so the whole track is very quiet and there are intermittent bursts of loud wails lasting about 5 seconds.  I have not tried it, but if you can, try the remastered copy first!

B0009R1T7M|4.0|Sufjan Stevens and his toss-off-an-album-for-each-of-the-fifty-American-states gambit is like collecting stamps, baseball cards, fountain pens, or--say--old beer bottles. From a distance, you say 'Oh,  yuck!' if in fact you get close enough to the enterprise to say anything at all.<br /><br />Then, in an unexpected moment, the sheer methodical, meticulous glory of it dawns on you like an epiphany. After that you pity the people who don't.<br /><br />Stevens and his ILLINOIS album were urged upon me by the two Murdy daughters of Medford, Massachusetts, two wildly intelligent young women who read and listen to all manner of off-the-track stuff, convinced that people who stay on the track have been sucked up by a pop culture flood that is fourteen  miles wide and on a good day perhaps a quarter inch deep.<br /><br />It took me *many* listens until the beauty of it finally dawned. Prior that that moment, Stevens' voice seemed unappealing, his musical tastes lurching from one unfortunate corner of the room to another. It was hard, in truth, to find rhyme or reason.<br /><br />Then something happened and I stepped inside of his brain to take *his* look at Illinois--a state in which I once lived and which I now frequent on business--and *bingo!*. You can see what the man is doing.<br /><br />I suspect loyalty to the Sufjan Stevens-ian genre is going to be intense and spotty until he reaches a critical mass of, say, a dozen states. Then this thing is going to take off like a rocket and he's going to be receiving hand-written, death-bed missives from states he hasn't chronicled yet pleading with him to do so before the imminent you-know-what happens to the writer.<br /><br />One of those may come from Indiana ...<br /><br />He's not a fantastic singer and the music itself will not grab you by the aesthetic throat and drag you helplessly away. But once you look at *Illinois* or *Michigan* through this music.<br /><br />I'm tellin' you, you're gonna' be a collector.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|Kudos to Amazon-ians for focusing on what really matters about this set: The sonic quality.  I own the original CD-singles on which many of the B-Sides were released, as well as the I-Tunes \\"digital box\\" set, and I can confirm that both the album AND the \\"rarities\\" are vastly improved.  Those of you on the fence about the \\"remaster\\" upgrade probably know that most of the JOSHUA TREE starts so low that you need to crank your car stereo to hear the nuances and beauty of the intros... But by the time the song is up to its 2nd chorus, you're nearly going deaf.  Having to play intermediate mixer was always an annoying distraction to the experience that is the \\"JOSHUA TREE,\\" and fortunately that issue was addressed straight out on this release.  From the gentle opening bars of \\"With or Without You\\" to its passionate crescendo, you won't have to touch the volume.    As for the DVD, it's a duller version of Rattle and Hum... and should not be perceived as anything other than a mild bonus.  It is the booklet that should be incentive for buying this set... It is beautifully realized and adds some insight to the process of recording that even their opus book \\"U2 by U2\\" failed to cover.   Even without the DVD, it's worth the price.
B000UR9TQE|4.0|This movie deserves four stars simply because it is Led Zeppelin, and I am always transfixed to the screen when I am watching anything relating to the mighty Zep - the greatest rock band that ever existed or will ever exist.  In terms of  excitement and entertainment value, it scores big.  Since there is not a whole lot out of the Zeppelin history out there on video, it remains a relatively iconic portion of the Zep legacy.  Most of the decent video footage that has surfaced has already been released by the band (in part at least).  A notable exception is the Seattle 1977 show, which is definitely being held back by the band due to the difficult performance offered by Page that night (although Page looked like he was having a great time on stage at least).  I think it is apparent that, to the members of Zep, the maintenance of the Zeppelin image for posterity overshadows all other considerations, including satisfying freaks like myself that want to see it all, the good and the not as good (I subscribe to the NBZ idea - No Bad Zep).  This unpredictability and playing on the edge of pandemonium are part of what made Zeppelin so interesting.      I have a bootleg of one of the 1973 MSG shows and the playing is probably average or slightly above average for a Zeppelin show at that time.  1973 is when the first signs of strain started to appear in the Zeppelin live experience.  The (bootleg) shows from 1968-1972 are all very consistently good, I think peaking in 1972 which simply put had some of the most powerful and well-executed live performances ever given in the history of rock music.  Even the British swing of early 1973 was still at or near this level.  By the American tour of 1973, I think the strains of the constant touring were taking their toll on the band and the playing began to become more inconsistent.  I also think real indulgences by the band were starting to factor in slightly, but were a long way off from creating the serious problems as they began to do a couple of years later (1975 there being discernible signs of it, and by 1977 the cat was out of the bag, for Page at least, and also Bonham to some extent who just seemed to overcompensate by playing more \\"over the top\\" than on previous tours - leading to some fantastic executions of Moby Dick).    The thing to remember with this film is that it is a movie, and some of the stage performances are as much a fiction as the fantasy sequences.  It is apparent to anyone watching closely that occasionally the activity you are seeing on the screen does not match the sounds you are simultaneously hearing.  Quite a bit of it does match, but a fair amount of it does not.  The parts that do match, particularly some of Page's wizardry, are worth the price of admission (whatever this means) and are primarily why the movie gets 4 stars.  But it is tough to watch certain parts, as the idea that much of it was overdubbed in the studio is hard to get by.  This bothers me even more than some of the abrupt edits which definitely could have been done more smoothly (most notably during No Quarter and Whole Lotta Love).  Also the fantasy sequences in No Quarter and Dazed and Confused prevent us from seeing the display of some of the most amazing guitar sequences ever played.  Now I have heard that it has been said that they did not have complete video footage, and had to make do with what they had and thus could not match the audio to the video in many cases.  This might be true, but nonetheless, for a hardcore Zep fan like myself, it is frustrating and one gets the feeling they could  still have somehow done more to make it at least feel more authentic.      The thing about Zeppelin is they were experimenters on stage.  No two shows are alike in the sense that a Rush concert, or a Clapton show might be.  You can listen to ump-teen bootlegs and not find two shows that are even close to being identically performed.  The same songs would sometimes only vary slightly from night to night,but vary they would.  A great example of consecutive shows that are each markedly unique from each other are the Los Angeles shows from June of 1977 (6 nights in 7 days I think).  On what was an otherwise inconsistent tour, Zeppelin managed to string together a set of really fine performances over this week, and each show having something remarkably unique about it (or at least the three that I own are this way, but I have read reviews of the other three).      But back to experimenting - this is what made them the most interesting live band around.  The problem with experimenting on stage, is that, by definition, not all experiments work, but when they do the rewards are great.  The detractors like to focus on the times when they do not work.  However, claims that Page or Bonham are sloppy tend to focus on the rough spots a bit much, where they might be in unchartered musical territory, and ignore the other large portion of the time when what you are witnessing are almost supernatural displays of talent and precision playing - by all members of the band, Plant (vocally) and Jones included.    By the end of the 1973 tour when the film was shot, Zeppelin were clearly a bit worn out.  Page did his best to look and act like the rock-God he was, but it almost seems a bit forced or manufactured.  He seems much less relaxed than he does during other live performances I have seen, especially from before 1973.  But Zeppelin had painted themselves into a hole with the time frame of the filming.  Due to financial or other considerations, this film became something like a Zeppelin version of Operation Barbarossa - started too late and hoping for some good fortune.  What they got, however, were a series of average performances at the end of a tour that seemingly had lasted for 60 months.  So what was Page and Co. to do?  Well wave the magic wand of technology and try to make it better!    The fantasy sequences are revealing as to the band members' mentality.  The weakest of them is Plant's sword fight and maiden rescue.  His easy demeanor does give the feeling that this is how Plant spends his off days - consuming fungi in dark arboreal settings and then riding about saving maidens, all the while thinking of lyrics.  Jones' sequence is a bit more interesting, as his true Jeckyll and Hyde nature is revealed.  You always knew he had it, I mean no one can be in a band like Led Zep and really be so mild mannered underneath it all.  Page's sequence is cool, not because of the supremely trippy encounter with himself as the Hermit, which is actually a piece of great cinema, but because it proved that the fragile appearing Page was still in pretty good physical shape.  I mean I was concerned he was going to fall off that cliff he climbed up - seems kind of risky behavior if you ask me.  But the best sequence, without a doubt, is Bonham's.  That scene where he is revving up his car and then takes off, as all the while the drums are matching the activity of the engine, is just freaking amazing.  Seriously, this is the best piece of artistry that the movie had to offer (other than the artists themselves performing live on the stage of course).    I first saw the movie when I was 13 years old in 1982 at a midnight movie (back when you could smoke J's in the theater and no one cared).  It was like a religious experience for me.  And it will remain so for legions of hardcore Zep fans around the world.  And the video and sound production on the new film is far superior to the previous edition.  And the bonus tracks and other materials really round out the experience.  I just wish that the band was willing to give Zep fans a little more credit and just give us the real goods.  Unfortunately for every understanding fan, there is some jerk off who bemoans some flaw to the point of absurdity.  Just because Jimmy did not execute some reverse-arpeggiated pentatonic scale or something, perfectly...  (I do not even know if these are valid guitar terms - I playdrums).   The truth is Page opened the door for all of the (mostly boring) blazing fast precision-meisters.  This is why guys like Satriani for example, feel compelled to record the live version of Dazed and Confused from TSRTS, and I must say it was pretty damn good (a friend made me listen to it against my will), but still missing something, a presence, if you will, that Page had that others lack.      The main thing that The Song Remains The Same reminds me of is that Zeppelin was about energy above all else.  This is not to say that Page did not have the natural talent of a Clapton or a Beck, but if he did not, he certainly made up for it in sheer will, determination, and energy.  The main reason why for at least a five year period, Page was the best guitarist on the planet, was this energy.  And this can be said of all the members of the band at this time.  So ignore my purist ramblings and go buy the damn thing.  Shut the blinds, grab a draught, turn up the speakers, and take the journey.  Nick nickf314@cox.net.     P.S. - one last bit of advice for first timers - this movie is rated PG most likely in no small part due to Robert Plant's member starring as the sixth member of the band (closely following Peter Grant).  It probably could have been rated R.  Unless you are real secure in your manhood, do not watch with your girlfriend (or maybe you should as she might get all wokred up - it's a coin flip). One of the most awkward moments of my adolescent years was forcing my Mom to watch the movie with me.  When the sixth man took center stage, there was an uncomfortable silence and I think I got up to make some popcorn.  >> I debated whether to add this comment, but hopefully it will do somebody some good...

B000003NA3|4.0|I can't speak to the genius of any artist. Music -- like literature, a painting or a sculpture -- either speaks to the listener or it doesn't. I've been listening to jazz most of my adult life and understand that its very improvisatory nature, especially in live performances, often results in hits or misses when it comes to exploration of a theme. I've heard eight or ten different live versions of some of Monk's classic tunes -- Blue Monk, `Round Midnight, Misterioso, Straight, No Chaser -- each rendition different. Some were hit out of the ballpark, while others left men on base. I've seen Brubeck perform three times and he almost never failed to hit for extra bases.<br /><br />When it comes to musicians like Monk and Coltrane, a listener either gets them or they don't. I received this boxed set as a Christmas gift, and while the uninitiated might care more for the Master Takes single disc version, I very much enjoyed this complete recordings.<br /><br />Recommended, but perhaps an acquired taste.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This will be short and sweet. This is a truly GREAT motion picture, Sci-Fi or otherwise. The Final Cut is very satisfying. We all know the various versions of the film--they're all there. Pick your favorite. The Final Cut is now mine. You must have this film if you consider yourself a film buff, a lover of sci-fi, or just a lover of finely wrought, well-written, superbly acted, gloriously photographed films.    The HD-DVD transfer is incredible both visually and aurally; the difference in clarity, depth, texture, and immersion from the non-HD versions is remarkable. This film has become almost a tactile experience. Just buy it.    Now, the box. I opened my box, and what do I find inside the shrink-wrapped DVD case? A notice from Warner Brothers that my BLU-RAY player may have been manufactured so long ago it may need an upgrade to play this disc! All the discs, THANK GOD!, are HD-DVD and play perfectly. I would never buy Blu-Ray. Who packed this box? Some sad and increasingly discouraged Blu-Ray mole? After I checked my discs thoroughly, I laughed. This format war is nuts.    This HD-DVD version is terrific. You will not be unhappy (unless you haven't bought an HD-DVD player!). Amazon has them on special promotion.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I had this on my wishlist for christmas and got it!  Someone in a previous review mentioned that the quality of the transfer was bad and their DVD's were scratched. I didn't experience any of that, I carefully checked all of the DVD's and not one scratch was found. The quality of the video is better than I've ever seen on broadcast. My wife even noticed the quality and commented to me on it.
B00000K19E|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet, you are missing out. It does fall under the cyberpunk genre, but I think it has appeal to quite a few people. The movie makes you wonder about what's real with your own life. It is kind of easy to be critical of Keanu Reeves' acting ability, he does alright in this. If you have seen this and not seen The Matrix Reloaded or Revolutions, then just stop now. The Wachowski brothers got it right with this movie and should have left the remainder of the story up to the imagination of the viewers.

B000R6PKP2|5.0|For anyone who has just picked up a Blu Ray or HD DVD player, Blade Runner would be an excellent movie to start with.  The movie, which is twenty five years old, looks like a brand new release and comes with a spectacular sound mix.     This boxed set includes.   1) The Final Cut  2) The original 1982 theatrical cut  3) The 1982 international cut  4) The 1992 directors cut  5) A work-in-progress cut    There are also over nine hours of extra features such as documentaries, deleted scenes, and outtakes.      Not only should this set appeal to fans but it may appeal to a new generation that has yet to view this science fiction classic.

B000929AJQ|5.0|I was first introduced to Nine Inch Nails when I saw a Quake 3 trailer which mentioned that it had music composed by NIN. I never really got to hear the Quake 3 music but the association was enough to make a good first impression. At that time, I hardly knew Rock, let alone Industrial.<br /><br />Incidentally, NIN was never played by any of my friends from whom I used to get my music in the early days, around the time that I discovered Rock and Heavy Metal. A few years later, The first time I heard their music was when a fried pushed some of it on to me. Yet, I didn't take much notice. Instead, I got four discs of Ozzy/Black Sabbath stuff, none of which I really like. On my last trip to the store, I noticed With Teeth on the stands. It was selling for... hold your breath... INR 750! Gave up on the purchase.<br /><br />Recently I made my first purchase on Amazon and the experience turned out to be so good that I went back on a shopping spree. I ended up ordering four Audio CDs and three movie DVDs. With Teeth by Nine Inch Nails was one of them and it arrived along with Prodigy's \\"The Fat of the Land\\". The first day I listened to With Teeth only once and then totally tripped on Prodigy. But somewhere in the back of my head, the notes from With Teeth's first song, \\"All the Love\\" got stuck.<br /><br />Over the next few days, the notes kept strengthening. They made me listen to NIN while I wanted to listen to Prodigy. And the more I listened, the more I got hooked. Now I'm hooked bad! With Teeth is a very dark and depressing album. With the slow industrial tunes of gloom (I never thought it was possible to make gloomy Industrial, though this album is probably their least synthetic), you've got gloomy lyrics too. Sample this:<br /><br />> no one's heard a single word i've said<br />> they don't sound as good outside my head<br /><br />or<br />> you can live in this illusion<br />> you can choose to believe<br />> you keep looking but you can't find the woods<br />> while you're hiding in the trees<br /><br />Hyper stuff.

B000X1Z0BU|1.0|At Gitmo, one of the things the interrogators do to `break' prisoners is to subject them to prolonged exposure to songs from TV's Sesame Street.  It turns out that even when it's designed to be benign or even therapeutic, being forced to listen to certain music truly is torture.  Also at Gitmo, if a `detainee' tries to end his suffering by means of starvation, the U.S. military will force feed him so as to prevent this.<br /><br />'Once' is a force-feeding of folk music.<br /><br />The musical performances are characterized by an affected earnestness and a self-styled soulfulness.  They are self-conscious without being self-aware: in other words, a pre-ironic mindset.  Watching them made me uncomfortable in the way that one is uncomfortable when a naïve, sensitive, and bad poet insists upon reading you his work and asking for feedback.<br /><br />This film is photographed with a blurry, hand held camera, and to say that the script is minimalist is an understatement. It is possible to momentarily forget that this film is fiction, that someone scripted this.  In my opinion, this is a deliberate cheat, a gimmick to conceal the thinness, corniness, and improbability of the plot.<br /><br />This is `The Blair Witch Project,' but with music.<br /><br />There is a sense of arrested development with Glen Hansard's character, a self-pitying 36-year-old still living at his father's house.  It's creepy to know that when this movie was made, Marketa Irglova was just 18.  The pair are reported to `dating' nowadays, and it is reasonable to suspect that the relationship was probably not `platonic' when they were composing and performing together prior to filming.<br /><br />In short, this film feels like the fantasy of a college sophomore, neglecting his classes in hopes that music will be his ticket out.  If you have ever wondered what it would be like to have a street musician move in with you, I strongly recommend this movie.  It makes 85 minutes seem like a month.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If you like the play, the CD is great. If you aren't familiar with either I recommend both.  The songs are entertaining and well sung.  The story gives an interesting twist to an old favorite.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|I ordered this watch for my 4 year old, and he LOVES it!  It's very fun to put the links together, and it's extremely comfortable for him.  He even wears it at night.  I like how the minutes are lined on this one, and it really comes with 2 different link lines to clip.
B00006FDCD|1.0|At first when I started watching this *movie*, I thought it was some sort of joke.  Surely I had stumbled onto a satire of the real movie or something odd like that?  Was I on comedy central by mistake.  No, it was actually the movie version of IT and it was really really bad.  I haven't seen this kind of overacting outside of soap operas before.  What more could I expect from a movie starring the one and only John Ritter.  Don't waste your time with this movie.  The acting is over-the-top, the story is rushed, the only saving grace is Tim Curry, who is a crazy sicko that does wonderful portrayals of odd vilanous characters (e.g. see the lord of darkness in Legend).  I shudder to think what goes through that man's brain in real life.  Aside from his performance, this movie is C-rate garbage (that's right, it's not even worthy of being called a B-movie).  It's TV-after-school-special bad.
B000VR824S|5.0|What a superb concert DVD! Wonderful artists and songs, with excellent audio and video quality. I have now watched this DVD four times and I just know that it will be played again and again over the years.    Here are some brief comments on the various artists and their performances:    * Sonny Landreth - A top performance from a top slide guitarist.  * John McLaughlin - John is not 100% my cup of tea but I know quality when I hear it and John oozes quality.  * Doyle Bramhall II - Great to hear Doyle playing with his own band and not playing second fiddle to Eric (he's a regular member of Eric Clapton's band, as is Derek Trucks).  * Susan Tedeschi with The Derek Trucks Band - Susan has a great voice, plays competent lead guitar and is a hot babe too. Derek Trucks (her husband) is a lucky man.  * Derek Trucks - Always excellent whether he's playing slide or conventional lead guitar, and as usual the guitar is his cherry red Gibson SG.  * Johnny Winter - It was sad to see Johnny in such poor physical shape and playing such an uninspiring and meandering song.  * Robert Randolph - What a hot performer! Robert (who plays pedal steel guitar) was just a boy at the Crossroads 2004 concert and now he's a man. One of the standout performances of the concert.  * Robert Cray - Robert is a rather ordinary lead guitarist in my opinion but he does have a very good voice and provides excellent support for other artists.  * Jimmie Vaughan - I'm not a big fan of Jimmie's (his playing is not a patch on his brother Stevie Ray) but this was probably the best performance of his that I have experienced. He is obviously much loved by the other performers.  * Hubert Sumlin - Hubert must be in his mid-80's and he noodles along these days. He was so happy to be there it was a pleasure just having him on stage.  * B.B. King - B.B. can still play guitar beautifully and sing very well too even though he's now 81 and weighs about 20 stone. He gave a lovely tribute to Eric and said a few things that sounded like a farewell speech to me. If so, it will be the end of an era.   * Vince Gill - Vince may be a country artist but he's a fine guitarist and easily held his own in this high quality line-up.  * Albert Lee - A much underrated lead guitarist (country rock) who can still strut his stuff.  * Sheryl Crow - Now who's going to complain when the lovely Sheryl comes on stage for a song or two?  * Willie Nelson - Willie is looking pretty ancient these days. His duet with Sheryl didn't work for me as I'm sure they hadn't rehearsed it. He's a legend so I forgive him.  * John Mayer - This guy is a star with both lead guitar and song writing, and he demonstrated both skills admirably at this concert.  * Los Lobos - A solid set from a solid band.  * Jeff Beck - Wow, what a set! Jeff's lovely young bass player Tal Wilkenfeld plays a great solo and is definitely worth a wee look too.  * Eric Clapton - Eric just gets better and better. Amazing. Steve Winwood can take much of the credit for inspiring Eric to play so well.  * Robbie Robertson - Robbie just wasn't up to the same standard as the other musicians on stage. I can only think that Eric was paying Robbie back for inviting him to play at The Last Waltz all those years ago.  * Steve Winwood - The standout performer and the best set of the concert. Winwood is a genius. His song \\"Dear Mr Fantasy\\" was worth the price of the DVD alone. At the end of his set, which involved Eric, Doyle and Derek all playing guitar, you could tell that all of them knew they had just produced something special.  * Buddy Guy - This was the most focussed I've seen Buddy for a while. He also lead the finale \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" with lots of stars on stage. The song was a bit of a shambles but who cares?
B000TLTUL0|2.0|Bearing in mind what Tim Burton films are like, I was still disappointed with the end result of the film adaptation of SWEENEY TODD. Most of the problems lie in the fact that Burton makes an already dark and gory tale even darker and gorier. This is precedence over plot and character detail, even cutting songs from the original show that greatly helped these areas.     In discussing the film with my fellow moviegoer, we agreed that the movie does suffer from having \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\" excluded from this version. By including any passerby that the camera zooms by (which in this day of CGI, such editing was inevitable) or lingers on, Burton could have easily made this work, too - what a shame. Some cuts and changes, do better the story, such as the toning down of Johanna by making her less freaky a person and less shrieky a singer.     Unfortunately every plus like the aforementioned instance, is met with more than one minus, such as the way the character of the homeless woman in brought into the movie. By introducing her so late into the story (also by cutting an earlier song of hers), we wonder, why bother at all? She becomes a tacked-on subplot, an afterthought of the screenplay. It's no wonder Johnny Depp looks to feel almost nothing for her at the end of the film.     I am also on the ilk that thinks principle characters should not be shown gruesomely dying in the picture frame, unless it serves a clear purpose (e.g. Janet Leigh in PSYCHO). If not, then it only becomes pure exploitation (and hopefully I've given enough hints as to which character I'm speaking of without totally giving it away). This only becomes more apparent as you watch certain characters die and ask, \\"how come they got an explicit death scene and not this character?\\" What is the point, indeed...     The movie also highlights contrivances in the story itself: how, out of all the people in London, could this homeless woman have encountered all the characters in the story on separate occasions? It's because she's there merely to keep the storytelling wheels turning, and when the story is slimmed down to a stage presence, it seems to make more sense. Likewise, the absence of police, who appear at the end of the play, but not the film. With townspeople disappearing left and right, how could they not have intervened sooner? The movie leaves us with these questions of logic, which, even for a musical, should have been addressed.     As for the principles, they all do an okay job. If any criticism is to be made about the restraint in their singing and acting, the finger should be pointed at how the film was directed. Burton seems to think that he can counterbalance each person by giving them an overly cartoony exterior (Sweeney's Bride-Of-Frankenstein hair) and a very, very subtle interior; subtle to the point of shallow character depth and a communication barely audible (and God only knows how many lines I missed because the actors spoke so quietly). The play seems to have worked successfully with these values reversed - underplayed, but period costumes with bombastic personalities.     Timothy Spall -- whom I hold in high regard, but know he accepts bad scripts sometimes -- is sadly reduced to nothing more than a sniveling rat, complete with bulging eyes and gnarly teeth. I pictured Beadle the way he's seen on stage and thought Spall would fit in so seamlessly. Here his craft is wasted on a one-dimensional, stereotypical villain - another sad, shame of the movie.     Sacha Baron Cohen, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him kind of role, is almost totally pointless in being cast. So long as the film had a big name like Depp to draw audiences, any person could have been cast in the role of Pirelli. Most of his songs and lines are reduced to nothing, coupled with an accent that is too difficult to understand. Visually, the moustache bit worked quite well on the stage in revealing his con-artistry, which is not used in the film. Burton only wants to make it known that Borat was cast in his film and wears a ludicrously funny wig before he might be bumped off.     Kudos are to be given to Edward Sanders, the child who was rightfully chosen to play Toby. It's nice to finally have someone who is close to the age of the character because, judging from the stage version, I seemed to have it in my head that Toby was just supposed to be a dwarf. His confident singing voice and charismatic involvement makes an impact over the course of the picture.     It seems that the movie seems is solely impressionable to people because it is opera-like in its music and jarring in its horror - \\"the perfect horror musical.\\" These extremes are only due to the fact that the music has been slimmed down to just under two hours and the dark comedy is stripped to be just, well, dark. You could really just watch the opening credits and know everything about everything that follows. You could just stop watching altogether, and not have to ask yourself questions like, \\"why is Sweeney on a boat with that guy?\\" To anyone who knows the story, you'd know Sweeney was a prisoner, but that seems to have been rushed in the movie if you don't pay close attention.     Another question to be asked is, \\"when is Burton going to NOT use Depp to be some glaring freak in his movies?\\" Hopefully the same day Burton decides that making every movie to be a moving Edward Gorey illustration has placed him in a rut. SWEENEY is not a complete waste of time, but it is not half of what it could have been, and Burton most definitely needs a change of scenery.
B000YABV90|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. If you can't look beyond the seeming fantasy of it all, look to the deeper expicit and not so explicit messages about harmonics and connectivity and what this means for your own life. There is joy in this movie,the kind that kind nutures your soul and lifts your spirits. Enjoy.
B00000294R|5.0|Flash back to 1995. Hip hop has become a coast dominated music where the \\"beef\\" between mainstream stars of New York and Los Angeles have dominated the casual hip hop fan's attention. But somewhere deeper, beyond the headlines, the underground scene is as vibrant as ever, and the genre is being powered by underground crews who don't have huge sales figures but have respect beyond any chart-topper's wildest dreams. Diggin' in the Crates, a New York collective, was just one crew that helped make this era the finest of hip hop history. Beginning with classic releases from Showbiz & AG, Diamond D, Lord Finesse, and OC, the group established themselves as creators of pure, musical, and lyrical hip hop that was too deep for the mainstream to appreciate.<br /><br />In early 1995, a guy by the name of Lamont Coleman, who had already turned heads with some D.I.T.C. guest appearances, dropped his debut as Big L, \\"Lifestylez ov da Poor and Dangerous.\\" Backed by some classic D.I.T.C. beats, Big L created one of the best battle-rap masterpieces in history, and sadly, it would not be fully appreciated until his murder in 1999. His name is often just thrown around in the group of \\"legendary dead rappers\\" like Pun, Pac, and Biggie, but it shouldn't be. His music isn't their brand of epic, dramatic hip hop, it's gritty battle rap. Big L is a lyrical wizard. His freestyle-brand raps utilize his peppy, staccato flow to philosophize on his hometown Harlem's street life, and everything he's witnessed firsthand. But he's not really a gangsta rapper; he spends most of his time bashing sucker MCs and using hilarious references to describe himself. He is a punchline master, and he quite honestly has about five lines on any given song that would be better than the best most rappers could muster in a career. The songs here are so good; he has a few posse cuts thrown in with emerging stars (see a young Jay-Z and Cam'Ron go at it on \\"Da Graveyard\\"), but mostly you get to see the clever genius of Big L. L is raw and realistic, and he always demands your full attention. The listener can always understand where he's coming from, and that among other factors is part of his charm. Production is outstanding and part of what comprises this album's greatness, courtesy of Buckwild, Showbiz, and Lord Finesse. The beats are bass-heavy and raw, but the subtle jazz samples give them a classy tastefulness that is D.I.T.C.'s trademark. If you've avoided \\"Lifestylez\\" to this point, do yourself a favor and pick it up, because you'll find it well worth the purchase.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Put It On,\\" a Kid Capri-aided opener where the fellow legend acts as both DJ and hypeman. L's rhymes are goodnatured here, and he uses a lightning-quick delivery to make his performance memorable. The beat is totally on-point and it's a great piece of mid-90s classic hip hop. Then, over Lord Finesse's nice beat, which uses a sample that would soon be immortalized on Notorious B.I.G.'s \\"One More Chance (Remix),\\" Big L asserts that \\"If rap were a game, I'd be MVP, the most valuable poet on the M-I-C\\" with a wonderful performance. Other one-line gems here include \\"Brothas be mad, cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to\\" and \\"Every time I'm jammed, I always find a loophole / I've got a crime record longer than Manute Bol.\\" He combats a trend of gold-digging females on his too-true \\"No Endz, No Skinz,\\" which features more great production, and the posse cut \\"8 Iz Enuff\\" features verses from L and seven guests, a crew of then-unknown New York underground MCs. \\"All Black\\" is another head-nodder, featuring a particularly vicious L with some of his hardest threats (\\"I'll kill your mama with a shovel just like Norman Bates did\\"). This continues on \\"Danger Zone\\" (\\"There ain't no food in my fridge, just body parts\\"). \\"Street Struck\\" has a gorgeous beat, and L's rhymes have a great message. He talks about the dangers of urban temptations and how he's witnessed their negative effects. Thencomes an awesome posse cut, \\"Da Graveyard,\\" which has young Jay-Z and Cam'Ron, then undiscovered, trading verses. Who would have thought that 13 years later the two would be embattled in a vicious feud for king of New York? In any event, this song's awesome, and each verse is sick. He chronicles the rough-and-tumble Harlem lifestyle on the title track, and on \\"I Don't Understand It\\" he accurately reviews the shady ways of hip hop. He vents some more frustration on \\"Fed Up Wit da Bulls...,\\" and the album closes with the energetic \\"Let 'Em Have It 'L'\\" (\\"I knocked out so many teeth, the tooth fairy went bankrupt\\").<br /><br />\\"Lifestylez ov da Poor and Dangerous\\" is an East Coast classic that reigns among D.I.T.C.'s finest. If you think it's only so well-regarded because he died, well, it's not, it's really that good. I'm always a little saddened that this one is so much more recognized than D.I.T.C.'s other classics, and I know that had Big L not so tragically died at a young age that it would probably still be only revered in the underground. If you like this, consider Showbiz & AG's [[ASIN:B000001FH6 Runaway Slave]], OC's [[ASIN:B000009NL9 Word...Life]], Lord Finesse's [[ASIN:B000IHXZRK The Awakening]], Diamond D's [[ASIN:B000001DX5 Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop]], and any of the other D.I.T.C. classics from this era. Although \\"Lifestylez...\\" is certainly among the best of the best, it is by no means their only piece of greatness. In any event, this album is a lyrical masterpiece with great production that showcases an MC who, sadly, only had the chance to show a glimpse of his genius. This is that one-of-a-kind LP.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I am absoultely in love with this album and believe any Britney fan will be too. It is full of all that Britney spark we are all used to. I believe she really pulled it together to get her best work. The best songs on the album thought to me are \\"Piece of Me\\" and \\"Radar.\\" If you are a real Britney fan than you should buy this. You will not be disappointed at all. I know I wasn't.<br />  Penny Lane
1569242739|5.0|This is the book for you!    There are so many cool and fun cupcake recipes and ideas in this book. It is a must for anyone who entertains. Not only do they taste fantastic, they are adorable. I have made them for many occasions to rave reviews. The Mucho Margarita cupcakes are great for Cinco de Mayo or tamale making parties. I'm personally in love with the Chocolate Stout cupcakes. I recently made the Tiramisu cupcakes for a four course sit down dinner (served on a fancy little plate dusted with cocoa powder). The smores cupcakes have become a staple for parties.    This book is a great gift for anyone who likes to bake. The cupcakes are a great gift for anyone who likes to eat!
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Kanye is a great artist and this is a good album.  I would reccomend all his albums especially the previous two.  I thought this one lacked lyrically and didn't flow very good but was still worth the purchase.  I hope future albums will be more cohesive and thought provoking or funny.  He's a great contribution to the art and a talent i'll always keep my ears open for.  Thanks Kanye for working with Common.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Rarely now do you actually see a good action movie, that has actual plot and isn't just about the next big explosion.  I have watched this movie twice now and it continues to be better every time I watch it... mostly because there is SO much going on that you have to watch it a few times to catch all the details!  Definite buy!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|You'd think that when you get such a great deal, surely there'd be something wrong with the item...NOT THE CASE HERE! Plays perfectly and it cost half the price as I've seen it in the stores. Thank you AMAZON!!
0143038419|1.0|First off this book is a waste of money!  I cannot believe someone paid Elizabeth Gilbert to write this book.  It's sick and horrible. She cries at night and wishes she died. She does not want kids. It's obvious she has some kind of mental issue with herself. She never appreciated what she had. She likes men who do not care about her. I mean if you want to read about a thirty something year old getting divorce, who is horney and globe trots around the world good for you. She is just very sick and depressing.
B0000T6JH4|5.0|It doesn't get any more 5 star than this folks !!! If this had really been released during the year it came out, it would have easily been the best album of the year; with the possible, and I stress possible, exception of \\"Abbey Road\\". As far as the comparisons with the original go... I love that \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is included here, as it should have been on the original. While it is great to have this live rooftop version, I still prefer the other original studio cut. The new stripped down \\"Across the Universe\\" may be the best version yet (there are now 4 versions out there of what I consider as high a water as the greatest band of all time ever reached), and it stands out as the albums  most shining moment. I did like Spector's arrangement on the \\"Let it Be\\" version; especially his choice of slowing it down about 5-10%. \\"I Me Mine\\" is greatly improved here without all the string/horn overdubs (which was Spector's worst work on this project), while still retaining it's artificial lengthening; which was a very clever Spector move. \\"Let it Be\\", and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" are both stripped down here as well, and come off great. Those two tracks, and McCartney's lasting resentment about them, are the real reason for this release. I certainly understand preferring the barer versions. Spector's choices for the McCartney tunes could be called a bit heavy handed, but to my ears they really were melodic and truly worked very well in both cases. It is quite ironic that McCartney complained so vehemently about this, when you take into consideration McCartney's own terrible rearrangement of Long & Winding on his awful Broad Street soundtrack album  (truly inappropriate ond disasterous; sounding like Macca Las Vegas style), and the fact they he also chose a similar arrangement during the \\"Wings Ove America\\" version from 1976. My only complaint about those two Macca tracks is that I miss the ripping, non-effects laden solo that appeared on the \\"Let it Be\\" album version of \\"Let it Be\\" (though not the single version that is on \\"Past Masters Vol.2) version of the title track. George initially recorded both of them overdubbed, and that combination has never been released. This is what I'd hoped they'd finally do here, alas...-this remains a project for the bootleggers, or some talented cyber remixier to take on.         The rest is pretty darn similar, some minor differences version wise/sonically, but no as severe as the aforementioned tracks that received the Spector treatments. I confess that I like having the little humerous asides, and shorter goofy works, that peppered the original: \\"Maggie Mae\\" & \\"Dig it\\" and all the funny chatter at song starts and finishes- especially from Lennon. While I appreciate having them, \\"Naked\\" does feel more like a proper album now.         \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" was a collection of \\"the other stuff from '67\\"  and film soundtrack songs. Song for song it certainly stands up well to Sgt. Pepper, but it was an oddity, and not considered a \\"proper\\" release by many, so it too remains overlooked in comparison' especially if you take it track for track. \\"Let it Be\\" Like the aforementioned, MMT, has been overlooked by many, because of the particular circumstances surrounding it shelving, and stalling of it's final release; not to mention it being handed off to Phil Spector. Again, taking it song for song, track by track, it certainly is the equal of what came before, (The White Album), and after (Abbey Road)it.           Start with as great a Lennon song as there ever was, \\"Across the Universe\\", and then add as moving and soulful a ballad as can be imagined, \\"Don't Let Me Down\\". \\"Dig a Pony\\" is a psychedelic rocker standout that feels very White Albumish to me, and would've been a highlight there as well. I do wish they had restored the \\"All I want is you\\" beginning like they did on \\"Anthology III\\". They stressed how important that was on one project, and then ignore it altogether here? The Lennon-McCartney collaborations, \\"One After 909\\" (mostly all Lennon actually), and \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" (more McCartney but with a gorgeous Lennon interlude) are both scorching rockers, albeit of very different stripes, and the live versions here are incredible proof of just how vital and powerful a band these guys were. McCartney gives us two sweeping unforgettable ballads, \\"Let it Be\\" and \\"The Long & Winding Road\\", a classic rocker, \\"Get Back\\", and the wondrously unique \\"Two of Us\\" (which may be my favorite of his here). Harrison's \\"I Me Mine\\" (later covered by Elliot Smith no less) is just fantastic, and \\"For You Blue\\" is a nice enough tossed off rocker with some fine slide work by John (great Lennon solo on \\"Get Back\\" too). Throughout the album the guitar interplay is on par with the albums that surround it (meaning a peak of peak in that era), as is the absolutely perfect rhythm section work. They had a huge amount of material to sort through, during the Winter of their collective discontents, but it would have been amazing if Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" (one of a number of eventual solo tracks that were tried by the full ensemble), which appears on \\"Antholgy III\\" in full demo form, has made it here as well. It would have made a nice bonus cut,   and would have put Harrison's contributions more on par with Lennon & McCartney's. As his White Album, \\"Abbey Road\\", and solo \\"All Things Must Pass\\" tracks prove, George was certainly working on level with anyone at that time, and it was only the breakup that kept him from becoming as prominent as voice as John and Paul with the group.                   There is also some griping about Lennon having less material ready (\\"One After 909\\" being from '63, and \\"Across the Universe\\" from early '68 really) but there were enough other tracks by him attempted here, and what is on the final album here is nothing short of amazing. It's wise to remember that lots of tracks get recycled, or lay about until it's \\"their time\\". The Beatles ran through \\"Child of Nature\\", a White Album era outtake which appears on the \\"Fly on the Wall\\" disc here in abbreviated form, and that didn't come out until 1971, when it was reworked into \\"Jealous Guy\\" for the \\"Imagine\\" album. It's also worth noting that he released no less than 3 solo singles in 69-70 (\\"Give Peace a Chance\\", \\"Cold Turkey\\" & \\"Instant Karma\\"). Further proof that this was a project that was cut short, was that there was no Ringo feature either; though her was working on some numbers- one of which is featured in this sets second disc.       While this isn't as big a deal as it's being hyped to be, as far as how great the differences are...It is a big deal, a huge deal actually, because it takes what was (and still is) a criminally underrated, and overlooked work by the greatest band of all time, and brings it back to light. That is a welcome fact, and this is certainly worth a listen in any incarnation.      Some final notes...1)Remember this was originally titled \\"Get Back\\" (plus \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and 9 other songs), which mimics their first album \\"Please Please Me\\" (plus \\"Love Me Do and 12 other songs). The cover for \\"Please Please Me\\" is the same as the \\"Red Album\\" or \\"Beatles 1962-1966\\". The \\"Get Back\\" cover parody was supposed to be the same as the cover for the blue album, or \\"Beatles 1967-1970\\". Why they didn't use that cover is just an amazing missed opportunity. 2) The \\"Fly on the Wall\\" disc is a frustrating missed golden oppurtunity. They could've released so much more, and in such better form...yeah there are neat conversations, and funny asides, but the snippets of songs are such a terrible tease, when you know there is so much more. Hopefully we'll see better work done with the outtakes concerning the, \\"always just about finished and ready to be released any day now\\" \\"Let it Be\\" DVD project. I\\"m hoping that there will be a proper box set soundtrack with the complete rooftop concert, and loads of full outtakes.
0525950079|2.0|While I like the concept -- detailed descriptions of common life in the past -- I felt more than a little cheated by the book.  Although stylistically well done, with good and exciting prose, the detachment from historical reality becomes too much of a distraction.  His main characters (particularly the women, who are portrayed generally in a much more favorable light to the brutish men) are 21st century people, stuck in Follett's \\"way back machine\\" and plopped in the 14th century.  Their ultraliberal views, obviously inherited from Follett, seem anachronistic in the extreme.   This is particularly noticeable in how religion and the Church are treated.  Are we to believe there were no truly devout and sincerely religious people living at that time?  None of the characters in this book who are associated with the Church are sincere or admirable.  At least in Pillars of the Earth there were some sincere religious, like Prior Phillip.  Their complete absence from this book belies Follett's personal distaste for religion, and renders this story unrealistic at best.  Coupled with the marked increase in graphic and \\"alternative\\" sexuality in this book, I sense that Mr. Follett is exorcising some personal demons here, and I wish I had not been part of it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|It doesn't get any more 5 star than this folks !!! If this had really been released during the year it came out, it would have easily been the best album of the year; with the possible, and I stress possible, exception of \\"Abbey Road\\". As far as the comparisons with the original go... I love that \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is included here, as it should have been on the original. While it is great to have this live rooftop version, I still prefer the other original studio cut. The new stripped down \\"Across the Universe\\" may be the best version yet (there are now 4 versions out there of what I consider as high a water as the greatest band of all time ever reached), and it stands out as the albums  most shining moment. I did like Spector's arrangement on the \\"Let it Be\\" version; especially his choice of slowing it down about 5-10%. \\"I Me Mine\\" is greatly improved here without all the string/horn overdubs (which was Spector's worst work on this project), while still retaining it's artificial lengthening; which was a very clever Spector move. \\"Let it Be\\", and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" are both stripped down here as well, and come off great. Those two tracks, and McCartney's lasting resentment about them, are the real reason for this release. I certainly understand preferring the barer versions. Spector's choices for the McCartney tunes could be called a bit heavy handed, but to my ears they really were melodic and truly worked very well in both cases. It is quite ironic that McCartney complained so vehemently about this, when you take into consideration McCartney's own terrible rearrangement of Long & Winding on his awful Broad Street soundtrack album  (truly inappropriate ond disasterous; sounding like Macca Las Vegas style), and the fact they he also chose a similar arrangement during the \\"Wings Ove America\\" version from 1976. My only complaint about those two Macca tracks is that I miss the ripping, non-effects laden solo that appeared on the \\"Let it Be\\" album version of\\"Let it Be\\" (though not the single version that is on \\"Past Masters Vol.2) version of the title track. George initially recorded both of them overdubbed, and that combination has never been released. This is what I'd hoped they'd finally do here, alas...-this remains a project for the bootleggers, or some talented cyber remixier to take on.         The rest is pretty darn similar, some minor differences version wise/sonically, but no as severe as the aforementioned tracks that received the Spector treatments. I confess that I like having the little humerous asides, and shorter goofy works, that peppered the original: \\"Maggie Mae\\" & \\"Dig it\\" and all the funny chatter at song starts and finishes- especially from Lennon. While I appreciate having them, \\"Naked\\" does feel more like a proper album now.         \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" was a collection of \\"the other stuff from '67\\"  and film soundtrack songs. Song for song it certainly stands up well to Sgt. Pepper, but it was an oddity, and not considered a \\"proper\\" release by many, so it too remains overlooked in comparison' especially if you take it track for track. \\"Let it Be\\" Like the aforementioned, MMT, has been overlooked by many, because of the particular circumstances surrounding it shelving, and stalling of it's final release; not to mention it being handed off to Phil Spector. Again, taking it song for song, track by track, it certainly is the equal of what came before, (The White Album), and after (Abbey Road)it.           Start with as great a Lennon song as there ever was, \\"Across the Universe\\", and then add as moving and soulful a ballad as can be imagined, \\"Don't Let Me Down\\". \\"Dig a Pony\\" is a psychedelic rocker standout that feels very White Albumish to me, and would've been a highlight there as well. I do wish they had restored the \\"All I want is you\\" beginning like they did on \\"Anthology III\\". They stressed how important that was on one project, and then ignore it altogether here? The Lennon-McCartney collaborations, \\"One After 909\\" (mostly all Lennon actually), and \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" (more McCartney but with a gorgeous Lennon interlude) are both scorching rockers, albeit of very different stripes, and the live versions here are incredible proof of just how vital and powerful a band these guys were. McCartney gives us two sweeping unforgettable ballads, \\"Let it Be\\" and \\"The Long & Winding Road\\", a classic rocker, \\"Get Back\\", and the wondrously unique \\"Two of Us\\" (which may be my favorite of his here). Harrison's \\"I Me Mine\\" (later covered by Elliot Smith no less) is just fantastic, and \\"For You Blue\\" is a nice enough tossed off rocker with some fine slide work by John (great Lennon solo on \\"Get Back\\" too). Throughout the album the guitar interplay is on par with the albums that surround it (meaning a peak of peak in that era), as is the absolutely perfect rhythm section work. They had a huge amount of material to sort through, during the Winter of their collective discontents, but it would have been amazing if Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" (one of a number of eventual solo tracks that were tried by the full ensemble), which appears on \\"Antholgy III\\" in full demo form, has made it here as well. It would have made a nice bonus cut,   and would have put Harrison's contributions more on par with Lennon & McCartney's. As his White Album, \\"Abbey Road\\", and solo \\"All Things Must Pass\\" tracks prove, George was certainly working on level with anyone at that time, and it was only the breakup that kept him from becoming as prominent as voice as John and Paul with the group.                   There is also some griping about Lennon having less material ready (\\"One After 909\\" being from '63, and \\"Across the Universe\\" from early '68 really) but there were enough other tracks by him attempted here, and what is on the final album here is nothing short of amazing. It's wise to remember that lots of tracks get recycled, or lay about until it's \\"their time\\". The Beatles ran through \\"Child of Nature\\", a White Album era outtake which appears on the \\"Fly on the Wall\\" disc here in abbreviated form, and that didn't come out until 1971, when it was reworked into \\"Jealous Guy\\" for the \\"Imagine\\" album. It's also worth noting that he released no less than 3 solo singles in 69-70 (\\"Give Peace a Chance\\", \\"Cold Turkey\\" & \\"Instant Karma\\"). Further proof that this was a project that was cut short, was that there was no Ringo feature either; though her was working on some numbers- one of which is featured in this sets second disc.       While this isn't as big a deal as it's being hyped to be, as far as how great the differences are...It is a big deal, a huge deal actually, because it takes what was (and still is) a criminally underrated, and overlooked work by the greatest band of all time, and brings it back to light. That is a welcome fact, and this is certainly worth a listen in any incarnation.      Some final notes...1)Remember this was originally titled \\"Get Back\\" (plus \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and 9 other songs), which mimics their first album \\"Please Please Me\\" (plus \\"Love Me Do and 12 other songs). The cover for \\"Please Please Me\\" is the same as the \\"Red Album\\" or \\"Beatles 1962-1966\\". The \\"Get Back\\" cover parody was supposed to be the same as the cover for the blue album, or \\"Beatles 1967-1970\\". Why they didn't use that cover is just an amazing missed opportunity. 2) The \\"Fly on the Wall\\" disc is a frustrating missed golden oppurtunity. They could've released so much more, and in such better form...yeah there are neat conversations, and funny asides, but the snippets of songs are such a terrible tease, when you know there is so much more. Hopefully we'll see better work done with the outtakes concerning the, \\"always just about finished and ready to be released any day now\\" \\"Let it Be\\" DVD project. I\\"m hoping that there will be a proper box set soundtrack with the complete rooftop concert, and loads of full outtakes.
B000067FP8|4.0|Gremlins 2 existed in a time when sequels were running rampant.  Some were good, some bad, but all were big Hollywood fare, ruling the multiplexes in the summertime.    Gremlins 2 could have easily succumbed to being a formulaic sequel, but instead takes a very different, somewhat absurd direction. In fact, its easily classifiable as a piece of very bizarre cinema - that is there are few words to describe it and even fewer movies to compare it to.    To be fair, there is something formulaic about the film - placing our heroes in the middle of Times Square, our young hero working for a big shot in Manhattan, and later sequences full of tons of our title characters.  But the film has such strange bits that its in a class all its own.    For starters, Bugs and Daffy introduce the movie.  That should set the mood right there.  The movie is self referential, featuring a sequence where Leonard Maltin is reviewing the original film.  The straw that breaks the camels back, however is when the Gremlins break the fourth wall.  Well, they don't just break the fourth wall, they break the film.  The second half of the film just screams \\"look what they let us get away with!\\" and is equatable to biting the hand that feeds you, poking fun at hollywood film excess.    What's nice is that the DVD keeps the theme going, inviting viewers to see all the little jokes they placed in the film, including a very notable easter egg involving the video release of the film.  Joe Dante is in for a commentary and there's some deleted sequences to boot.  If you're a fan of Gremlins or just a piece of strange cinema, check this out.  This is a surefire cult classic.  The fact that Christopher Lee turns in a performance as Doctor named Doctor Catheter should say it all.
B000FA57US|3.0|This film is not the worse of the series, that is the next Halloween movie. H-5 was ok before I saw Halloween- Curse of MM, and it explained all the confusing things in H-5. Now I look at H-5 and blame it for creating the trash to come.    The film is not as bad as I am making it sound. It has it's moments of being fun mindless entertainment, but nothing ground breaking or amazing. I think the film was rushed and it shows in the movie. The guy in black running around was just stupid, and the ending sucked to this movie. That is just saying it bluntly. It will have you wondering what the hell is going on. And you discover Michael's tattoo, when did he get that? I didn't like that in the film either. It was almost like they were hinting he was in a cult... oh no...    But if you love the Halloween series, and think you will miss something if you dont see this movie, you wont. You can skip 5 and 6. Halloween Resurrection ignores 4,5,and 6 anyways. But H-5 does have it fun moments, as I said. But don't expect the first three (ignoring H-3) Halloween films.
B0000024R8|5.0|In my opinion, his best record.  It was my first exposure to Dylan, and has been my most played since I bought it.  I am a huge fan and own all of his albums, and many bootlegs, but this remains my favorite.  The raw talent you hear on this album is incredible, and indicative of the bounty of music to come from this musical genius.
6305291446|5.0|With Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers, the Halloween series seemed to be heading to hell. The background story to Michael being a part of a cult, is just plan stupid. I owned Curse of MM, and I still havent watched it all the way through. That movie killed the series for good... well until 1998.     Halloween H20- Twenty Years Later was released and made us forget the oops of Curse of MM. It erased all the other sequels besides Halloween 2. This film is a gem and really did the impossible. Seriously Curse of MM is trash and should of killed the series, but H20 saved it.     The film brings us into the world of an older Laurie Strode. It has been 20 years since her incounter with her brother. Well he has finally found her. The film feels like the first two Halloweens, and is simply awesome. H20 also has one of the coolest character development with Laurie. Lets just say, she fights back.

1878424505|5.0|The Four Agreements is one of those books you'll want to read over and over again.  The agreements themselves are pretty straight forward:<br />1 - Be impeccable with your word (i.e. speak with integrity)<br />2 - Don't take anything personally<br />3 - Don't make assumptions<br />4 - Always do your best<br /><br />It's the kind of advice our parents give us when we're very small.  But few of us go on to live our lives that way.  Don Miguel Ruiz explains that the reason life is so difficult is because it is ruled by fear.  If we would instead practice unconditional love, life would be much happier.<br /><br />Some key points regarding each of the 4 agreements are:<br /><br />First, that the truth is the most important part of being impeccable with your word.  Only the truth can set you free.<br /><br />Second, that when you take things personally it is an expression of selfishness because it means you're making the assumption that \\"it's all about me.\\"  Nothing other people do is because of you; it's because of themselves.<br /><br />Third, the problem with making assumptions is that we believe they are the truth.  It's better to ask questions than make assumptions, because making assumptions just sets us up for suffering.<br /><br />Fourth, if you always do your best in any circumstance, then you don't have to judge yourself.  Regardless of the results of your actions, you won't have to judge yourself because you'll know you did your best.<br /><br />Finally, as with his book, Mastery of Love, Ruiz ends the book with prayers.  There's a prayer for freedom and a prayer for love, which is a great way to end a book!

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I purchased this for use with my Nikon D40, and absolutely love it for what it is.  It is very compact, so that my D40 doesn't feel horribly top-heavy when it's on, and it fits well in a pocket.  The increased flash power, faster recharge time, and especially the ability to bounce the flash have been wonderful.  I have taken several pictures with this flash set to bounce off the ceiling that look much more natural and avoid red eyes, shadows behind heads, washed-out faces, etc.  And while it doesn't rotate sideways, I have found a \\"sideways\\" bounce off the wall in portrait orientation to produce acceptable results, certainly better than a direct flash.    Pros: compact, bounce flash, fast recharge, good power, low price!  Cons: no sideways rotation for ceiling-bounce in portrait orientation, no on-flash controls or remote capability (if you need that)    In short, it's a great flash for what it is.  Much better than the built-in flash, but not as flexible as an SB-600, etc.  For a non-pro like me that just wants a little more flash flexibility, it fits my needs perfectly while also fitting the compact size of my D40.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Jack Nicholson has become a great actor. His  fluid facial expressions  and theatrical features are unmatched by any other  player in Hollywood. I  thoroughly enjoyed this movie, set mainly in Long Island, which is classified in the \\"melodrama\\" section of my film library. The movie allows Jack to  act  himself  to the maximum as the clown of tragic  comedy.  The effect was a little tarnished by the traditional, \\"They all lived happily ever after\\" ending, but it was still pure entertainment, a film tailor-made for the aging baby boomers. Even had it had the more philosophical end I was expecting, it would have  not been  depressing , unlike About Schmidt  or The Crossing Guard.  This movie is more akin to As Good as it Gets, which I believe  is Nicholson's finest as well as been an excellent  little melodrama. Yet between these two fine movies something's gotta give between the two, indeed not in quality of cinematography and acting which are equally good but the script of this movie is inferior to that of As Good as it Gets (which for Nicholson's acting is, indeed, as good as it gets). Nevertheless, Something's  Gotta Give  has its own fine merits. The theme  is good, Jack Nicholson has been lucky in playing with good co-stars in both films, Helen Hunt  and Diane Keaton respectively,  as well as an outstanding supporting cast in each case. The highlight, or turning point of the movie, as it occurs nearly halfway,  takes  place in  a comfortable double bed  during  a very wet afternoon. I recommend that if any  DVD viewer has  a partner that you really love, spend it in such  a bed in such an afternoon, while partly  watching the movie. You miss a bit, so what? That's what  fast return buttons on the remote  and scene selections are for.  Just  snuggle up cosy, share  some  fresh hot (but unbuttered)  popcorn  (and don't spill the crumbs) if you will,  and watch this movie. I doesn't require the same degree of concentration to appreciate  as in As  Good as it Gets, but you will both  enjoy it.  Love yer!, but you will both  enjoy it.  Love yer!
0307387178|4.0|First off, any book that garners over 1000 book reviews means the author is doing something right.  What I find disturbing are the numerous reader reviews that rant endlessly about McCandless' arrogance, self indulgence and disrespect toward the Alaskan Wilderness.  The insinuation that he deserved what happened to him is ludicrous.  Let's not forget, Chris McCandless was a flesh and blood human being who endured an agonizing death.  It's easy to sit at home and wax poetic on how he should have lived his life and the actions he could have taken to prevent his premature demise.  Nevertheless, I applaud Mr. Krakauer for composing a work that clearly elicits such raw emotion, whether annoyance, anger or incredulity.  It sure beats apathy any day of the week.  Whether one thinks of Chris McCandless as remarkably astute or remarkably stupid, Mr. Krakauer has crafted a captivating depiction of his life and death that is both insightful and thought-provoking.  Well written and masterfully constructed, McCandless' saga is illuminated by personal journal entries and pictures in addition to first-hand accounts told by the friends and acquaintances whose lives he touched as well as the family who was devastated by his estrangement and ultimate tragic death.    My suggestion: take this journey willingly without pre-conceived notion or judgment.  You may just find yourself identifying with McCandless on some level, whether it is the irresistible pull of wanderlust, coming to terms with strained familial relationships, struggling with the youthful fervor of moral absolutism, or simply overzealous adolescent chutzpah.    Bravo to Mr. Krakauer for the tremendous effort he put forth in capturing the essence of a fascinating and surprisingly polarizing individual and producing a page- turning work to boot.

With that in mind, Every song Alter Bridge has is good.  Some better than others, but all are good songs.  This band has a body of work in two albums that will stand for a long time.  Few bands can match their skill and ability to bring their musical styles together for great tune after great tune. If you do not have \\"Blackbird\\", stop reading this and go get it now.  This is a very good rock album !!!
B000K15VSA|5.0|the \\"final cut\\" of blade runner is superbly executed. video and audio are the best of any remastered film with two glaring scenes finally fixed (the abdul bin hassan scene and the death of zhora). the limited edition case is largely gimmicky although the unicorn is a nice touch. the \\"dangerous days\\" documentary is totally excellent too! but the coolest item has to be the \\"deleted and alternate scenes\\" feature - these scenes are edited together to form a mini-film of its own of about 50 minutes with good video and audio quality. in fact, i think this feature is so good that it actually forms an extension of the \\"final cut\\" itself. all in all, a great definitive version of one of the best films of the second half of the 20th century!

B00005JPKE|4.0|Clint Eastwood's \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" is an interesting departure from the traditional American war narrative that presents the Japanese army as merely a bunch of ruthless, fanatical, implacable killers who made life a living hell for the American troops that fought them in the Pacific theatre.  Here, we see gradations and nuances among the Japanese soldiers that are not typically part of the story -- draftees, sad sacks and proto-pacifists, pitted against martinets, fanatics and sadistic officers, as well as officers and high commanders who had different philosophies and different kinds of military training from one another, and who did not always agree on how best to fight the war.<br /><br />Although it is not by any means a perfect film, it is powerful.  It's certainly much better than the companion piece, Eastwood's \\"American\\" Iwo Jima film, \\"Flags Of Our Fathers,\\" which I found muddled and often trite. \\"Letters\\" is clearly the film that was most important to Eastwood to get right -- he pours more feeling into it, and gave it a much stronger and more cohesive narrative.  I agree that it's not the greatest war film ever made, but it does open up a new dialogue on some important historical issues, and presents, however obliquely, a tragic picture of the death of Japan's vestigial bushido honor code on the pyre of modern mass warfare.<br /><br />I think this film does an adequate job of presenting Japanese wartime society as a spectrum of opinions and temperaments -- it's simplistic, yes, but that is the nature of a feature film script, and to the degree that Eastwood does *not* present the Japanese as a monolithic culture, I think the film is a success.  The portrayal of Iwo Jima as a doomed, desperate last stand -- an Asian Alamo, if you will -- is interesting as well, although Eastwood may oversell this point, and gives little indication (in this film) of how tough formidable the Japanese soldiers were, or the degree to which they had an efficient, modern military.  By the time of this battle, their fleet had been crushed and their supply lines and command and control were breaking down so looking just at this moment in time is a little misleading, although not entirely inaccurate.  I'm not a big WWII buff, but I think its obvious that Eastwood has walked a fine line between different factions who choose to view history in various ways.  And, yes, it's a Hollywood film, so it resorts to melodrama and simplification... Yet it still presents a viewpoint that has rarely been seen, particularly by American audiences.  It's worth adding to our historical repertoire, and gives us some new shadings of understanding about the war, putting a more human face on was has been traditionally portrayed as a near-inhuman foe.  It's worth checking out, and seems to have been a labor of love on Eastwood's part.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|In a conversation with a Chinese professor about \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" he surprised me by saying the Capra classic helped him better understand banks, capitalism, and oppression.  He had obviously focused on \\"Mr. Potter.\\"<br /><br />I replied that the film did provide some lessons in banking history -- how there were bank runs before there was federal deposit insurance, the differences between banks and what we now call credit unions, bank examining, and how credit and financial institutions could help make the dreams of a home or a business come true.<br /><br />I said, though, that while banking gives the plot its frame, the film is not about banks.  It's rather a reflection on the worthwhile life.  That an individual can lead a worthy life in a small town as well as a large city.  That helping others is a mark of character.  That money has little to do with being \\"the richest man in town.\\"<br /><br />Right now, upwardly mobile young people in China want money. After so many decades of poverty, it's a natural social development that Chinese have focused on material things.  It's gone so far, though, that young upwardly mobile Chinese look down on their cousins and classmates who have stayed back in the small town where they grew up.  These young people may even look down on their schoolteachers, who gave them so much, because they don't make much money.<br /><br />This means that \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is a film for Chinese as well as for Americans.<br /><br />-30-

033041836X|4.0|I read Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" several years ago and liked it quite a bit - save for the random paranormal body-switching sex scene - and I'd always meant to read Lucky, not really knowing what it was about.  I finally snagged it from a friend's collection and it turns out it's a non-fiction memoir about Sebold's rape as a virgin college freshman and the aftermath - from the heady trial and prosecution of her rapist, to the heart-wrenching effect her rape had on her relationships with friends, family, and boyfriends.    Overall I thought the book was quite well-written.  Some parts seemed a tad too autobiographical as opposed to focusing on the specific aspect of rape in this memoir. However for the most part Sebold did a good job of focusing those autobiographical parts to relate to the context of her rape...but there were still easily a few filler parts, particularly when describing her childhood life/family life.      The structure of the book was set up so you are plunged right into her rape in very graphic and gruesome detail, and even if that's hard for you to get through, the rest of the book is a fair bit lighter, almost empowering, despite the horrible topic it deals with.  I found it interesting enough to be a page turner, especially when learning the fate of her attacker, so for that, I'd recommend it.    In general I can't say this was a FANTASTIC book because it's really just a quite good book.  The one thing I really enjoyed about it was getting to know Sebold as a person, it truly helped contextualize the characterization and plot of The Lovely Bones.  If you're planning to read TLB, I'd recommend giving Lucky a read first, or at least reading it down the line as I did, as the two books are connected despite their differences (ie fiction vs non-fiction).
B000UR9TRS|4.0|First off, I love Zeppelin and The Song Remains the Same is an excellent live album and film.  But let me just pose a question:  Why is Amazon advertising this HDDVD if according to them it's not being released for 2 more years?  Huh??!!  By that time we could be downloading movies directly into our heads - a little \\"Led for your head,\\" so to speak.  Seriously Amazon, either figure out what's going on or take down this item.
B000RJO57I|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Nicholas Angel, a cop form London, is moved to a smaller town.  While he's there he discovers an organization of murderers and tries to stop them.  This is a funny movie because the blood is extremely exagerated and the reasons the murderers kill for are so stupid it's hard not to laugh.  Even thought this movie is great the murder scenes are a little distrubing.  For example at one part a giant stone spike is pushed off the top of a building and it lands in someone's head.  At this point blood is spraying and gushing out all over the place.  It was funny yet absolutely disgusting.  Don't let this one scene ruin it for you though.  The movie isn't only about blood and violence.  There are tons of other funny parts.
0201433079|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read about UNIX and programming.    With its unique style, it serves as both a reference and a tutorial, and at the same time, it provides amazing detail and insight, always  making the reader understand what's happening \\"under-the-hood\\". Fantastic job, Steven Rago and Richard Stevens!    The only problem I had with this book was with the source code. It doesn't compile under MacOS X 10.5 Leopard, which is a certified Unix 03 system. It is a only a one-line change in the includes, so it's no big deal.
B000002UA0|5.0|This album came out at a time when Sgt Peppers came out. Both albums were being recorded at the same time in EMI studios, Abbey Road.<br /><br />It definitely sounds dated, like psychedelic rock from the late 60s can, but there is also a playfulness and lack of \\"self-importance\\" that later Pink Floyd albums would almost completely lose, when Waters started to dominate the proceedings.<br /><br />For that reason, many contend that this is Pink Floyd's BEST album. There can be an argument to that end and I would say all are different, but it is incredible, and if you haven't heard Piper at the Gates Of Dawn you are missing the cornerstone of Pink Floyd. I haven't heard Sin Barrett's solo albums but I believe the other reviewer who states that this is a Sid Barrett album as much as a Pink Floyd album. His influence is undeniable. What this does is put a stamp of artistry, playfulness and whimsy that serves it well over all these years. It almost renders later releases embarrassing to hear, due to their self-importance.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love all of Pink Floyd, and certainly the early periods up to and through Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Animals.<br /><br />Pink Floyd is one of those bands that stands alone and all their music is so incredible that they deserve 5 stars. Still, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, with Barrett at the helm, reveals a fragility and lack of ego that will continually make it the innocent birth of a great band. If you don't have this, GET IT! Also recommended is the anniversary release with 3 discs, a Mono and Stereo Piper, and studio outtakes. Can't get enough of it!
B000IAZPKM|5.0|First off Kamelot is one of the very few truly talented metal bands. Having been around for almost 20 years now.    This DVD is spectacular. Completely raises the bar for music in the metal genre. The picture and sound of this DVD are nearly flawless. I consider myself a very picky videophile and audiophile and I found it hard to find really any true annoyance in picture or sound. I'm sure insane audio and videophiles would have no problem finding a couple minors things here and there. But if your not an audio or videophile you'll never notice.     My only complaint about this DVD is that I wish the second disc contained more extra features about the band. I would have given this a 4 star rating for that if the actual concert itself hadn't completly blown me away.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|Although the Killers aren't my favorite, I thoroughly enjoy this album. I have listened to this more than any of their other albums.
0374105235|5.0|What an amazing story! I had to keep rememinding myself that this was all happening to a boy of 12 years old.   Excellent descriptions of the surroundings, the good times, the bad times, and the thoughts that run through a young boys mind as his life is collapsing around him. I couldn't recommend it more highly.
0312360266|3.0|This book is a very nice novel. yet, it was bit unoriginal. When I was reading it I kept seeing to many parallels to other stories such as Harry Potter or the movie Mean Girls. However, in the middle the story began to take on a life of its own and proved only to have the same ideals as different stories and none of the same plot. If that were the only thing I would have givin this novel a 4 star, but it was a bit to sarcastic. It seems as if the main character hated everything and everyone. She was  a bit to cynical  for my taste but the plot kept me hooked to entire time.
B000GW8OAK|4.0|This movie is pretty brain dead, but a fun ride anyway.  It looks and sounds phenomenal on HD DVD--a bit step up from the already decent DVD release.  I now have the other two movies in the series on order on HD DVD.
0140187650|5.0|This is a book written in the late 1960s on the occasion of Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem. The book however is not only about the trial. It is an effort to make sense of the Holocaust. Why did it happen? how could it be possible? This is a much needed book that should be taught in schools as part of civic education courses. The book reviews what each of the occupied countries did or did not do to save its own citizens of Jewish origin. It questions what the Jewish community leaders did to save their communities. It reviews critically the evolution of the Nazi view on the Jewish question and how the \\"final solution\\" came up. It questions how it was ever possible to send to their death several millions of people within a rather short time span of 2-3 years. The book is about responsibility, ethics, ideology and the nature of the human kind. It is not a complicated read although it is not a novel either. It is a book that we should all give our children to read when they grow up to understand history and to create their own sense of ethical and political responsibility.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I've always been skeptical about making purchases online, but this Christmas you have made a solid patron!  Everything I've ordered, including this particular dvd arrived quickly and in excellent condition, as well as a fantastic value!  I'll never think twice again about coming back to you.  Keep up the excellent job, especially the security of your site!
B00005JPTI|2.0|This movie is slow, dull, and boring with injections of adrenalin to keep you from falling asleep.  Will Smith does a good job but good acting cannot salvage what is a poor screen play.  The deserted New York is very well done but the entire film drags plus it has some serious logical flaws.  Where are the bodies and/or skeletons?  If the surviors have resorted to cannabalism why are they only preying on the sole survior? Shouldn't some be starving? If they are eating abandoned food why are they attacking the one survivor?  If they are irrational and preying on humans why are they not attacking each other?  Where is the electricty coming from?  The first time he enters his safe house he hides his tracks but doesn't do that at any other time yet that is how he is tracked down.  Who set the trap for him?  That was left open -- why were cars used as counter weights when it would be easier to use something more easily handled?  Why was he constantly driving at high speeds?  Shooting a deer would have been easy yet he chose to chase them in his car -- why not run one down?  This whole sequence was contrived and sort of dumb.<br /><br />The film has long draggy sequences which were punctuated with attacks by over active zombies who appear to act irrationally and with no clear motive.  I watched this film with my sons, nephews, and grandsons -- none of them liked it and all of them thought we should have selected a different movie -- and I hardily agree.  This was a poor movie but the fault lies not the stars but in the screen play.  I would say don't bother with this one.
B000001FV1|5.0|This 1973 album by Traffic is an exceptionally solid release that finds the core of Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood continuing their involvement with accomplished studio musicians.  The overall feel of the album is a bit more solid than the fantastic Low Spark of High Heeled Boys (1971) and has less in the way of short, psychedelic tracks.  Overall, while Shootout at the Fantasy Factory did not get the favorable critical reception that Low Spark of High Heeled Boys did, I especially like the somber mood of the album and it may very well be one of my favorite albums from the group.<br /><br />The lineup on this album includes Steve Winwood (vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, piano, organ); Jim Capaldi (percussion and backing vocals); Chris Wood (flutes and saxophones); Rebop Kwaku Baah (percussion); and session aces David Hood (bass guitar); and Roger Hawkins (drum kit).  Additional musicians include Barry Beckett (keyboards on Tragic Magic) and Jimmy Johnson (clarinet on Tragic Magic). I think that overall, this was a great lineup and the group playing on this album is very tight and at times, fairly powerful (as on the title track).  Everything is just very carefully performed and I especially like the use of acoustic instruments on the album, particularly the piano.  The use of various bits of percussion add an earthy texture to the music, which is another thing I like about this album.<br /><br />The five tracks range in length from 5:19 to the newly restored Roll Right Stones (13:40).  The music on this album consists of a smooth mixture of rock, jazz, folk, with a tiny smidge of progressive rock that is seamlessly blended together.  There is great consistency with respect to the texture of each piece (slow to mid-paced tempi), and all of the tracks work well together.  The instrumental passages are especially fine and I think that Roll Right Stones presents a great jam session in spite of its structured nature and the use of pre-composed solos.  There is somewhat of a gloomy feel to the album, and minor keys are used a lot.<br /><br />This remastered CD is fantastic and features a restored full-length version of Roll Right Stones (apparently, 2 minutes were lopped off of this track on previous versions of the recording) along with the original (surreal) cover art and informative liner notes.  I have to say that I like this CD version better than my old LP, which had the corners of the record jacket cut off just to emphasize the cube pattern on the cover! Furthermore, the sound quality is wonderful and features crisp highs, full midrange and deep bass - there is also excellent separation of individual instruments.<br /><br />All in all, this is an exceptional album by Traffic and is highly recommended along with [[ASIN:B0000639A3 Low Spark of High Heeled Boys]] and [[ASIN:B000096FSZ When the Eagle Flies]] (1974).at of a gloomy feel to the album, and minor keys are used a lot.

B000MZHW1S|4.0|I'm only reviewing the HD-DVD version of the disc as other reviewers have commented on the movie itself. Blood Diamond is another strong HD-DVD title that delivers great interactivity while viewing the movie. There are numerous branching production videos that show how a particular scene was shot. The running Picture-in-Picture commentary is fantastic too. Although it's not continuous video commentary (like Mission Impossible III), it's well worth watching. Another interesting aspect of the video commentary is that many of the comments were taken on-set between takes. So you have DiCaprio, Connelly or Hounsou talking about their roles on location. As with most modern movies on hi-def disc, the picture and sound is stellar. Recommended to show of your HD home theater system!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Everyone, you have got to remember that these films are homages to the old films of the 70's. Thats why the script is the way it is, thats why the acting is the way it is. Especially the ending of Death Proof. Some feel cheated, but if you ever saw films of the 70's, a lot of films had great build up and BOOM just ended. Thats what it was. It is understandable why people give the films negative reviews, if you're not familiar with those types of films you wont get it. I believe Tarantino and Rodriguez tried to bring back a long lost theatrical experience, and unfortunately it didnt work out. I still believe these films fit well into the GRINDHOUSE experience and its too bad that todays generation didnt catch on.
B00005AREQ|4.0|I'm almost embarassed to say that I've been playing guitar for over 40 years and never really listened to Jeff Beck, until purchasing this CD.  Yes, I did listen Truth but there is just so much more to Beck than that work suggests.  Now I know.  Beck is not a shredder and technically, there are better out there.  But in terms of imagination, of creativity and uniqueness - there are few who can compare.  He reminds be a bit of David Gilmore.  No one gets more out of a single note than Gilmore and Beck.  Nothing is wasted and nothing more than what is needed is added.  His music is smart and inspired.  What I particularly enjoy is that he is a risk taker.  He creates a sound that is unique and stylish.  There is no sound-alike here, he is his own man.  This is a CD that gets better with each listen.
B000002OX7|5.0|Nine songs, all of them rock classics- now there's an album. Released in 1971, Who's Next is a damn good record by a damn good band, full of great riffs, anthemic choruses, and beautiful ballads. This is \\"hard rock\\" as it was meant to sound, and the world is all the better for it. \\"Baba O'Riley\\" is a classic rock `n' roll anthem, with that brain-bending synth line and a chorus the size of Mt. Everest. \\"Bargain\\" is a similarly crunching rocker, and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is an epic politically charged masterpiece, with a strong cynical edge and some great guitar playing. \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" is an eerily pretty, folk-driven stroll, and \\"Going Mobile\\" a rollicking postmodern car song. \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" is a bitter and introspective ballad, and \\"My Wife\\" is one of the funniest rock songs ever written. And it's catchy! \\"Getting In Tune\\" and \\"The Song Is Over\\" are lush, gorgeous piano driven ballads. Now that's what I call a great album!
1594489505|3.0|\\"Kite Runner\\" was a story that touched me as a reader in a very significant way. A very beautiful story from a totally different place on this planet. \\"Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is not giving me the same experience. The book describes a very violent family situation, that only turns as the pages goes by. It is a painful journey that should have ended a bit before it actually does. Khaled Hosseini's language is extraordinary, but his story is a bit to dark, concentrating on abusement and conquering techniques, and the hole thing is a dark journey with absence of light. It is not a documentary from Afghanistan, but I am sure that there is some good moments for the Afghans as well. The book ends like it normally does in a movie produced in Hollywood. At least close. Hosseini manage to straight the story to a good ending. Well, it is worthy to be read, do not hesitate, and have a good \\"journey\\"!
B00004VXF2|4.0|In a way, Lou Reed is the only type of person that could've made an album like Metal Machine Music: He's got a sick sense of humor, a strong masochistic streak (not to mention a strong sadistic streak), and a back catalogue beguiling and eclectic enough to make people think he might actually approach a project like this seriously. The project: it's an album (in the old days, a double LP) of nothing but guitar feedback. That's it- no lyrics, no melodies, no instrumentation, no funky old skool beats, nothing. Which begs the question, is this serious artistic statement, or the ultimate practical joke? Different theories have popped up about the meaning behind MMM, as I'm sure they will until time ends (or everybody forgets that this album exists). I, for one, think it's a joke, intended to be a gigantic \\"f*** you\\" by Lou to his label, his audience, his critics, and his imitators. And it's a hilarious one at that, made even funnier by Reed's poker faced delivery. It takes a lot of guts (and a well-developed sense of misanthropy) to pull off something like this, and Reed does it admirably.    Okay, so that's all fine and good, but does that mean you should actually pay money for the damn thing? Well, here's the deal: MMM can actually be a surprisingly good listen at times. There's a certain appeal to hearing those guitars' stratospheric howl. At times, it can make for a cathartic listen, and even when it overstays its welcome, it's good background music. No, this isn't a work of genius, but we should al be thankful that it exists.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I loved this film.  Just when Bree thinks she is set to have her M-to-F surgery, she discovers she has a teenaged son she knew nothing of, the greater snag being that he's gotten himself in trouble and needs bailing out immediately.  At the risk of interfering with her surgery date she travels cross country to deal with her son, only to find that he has no one, is deeply troubled and has some dangerously skewed perspectives on his self-worth and life.  While the pitfalls of her adventure are somewhat predictable, the crux of the story deals with Bree making decisions around putting herself first after a lifetime of catering to the expectations of the world around her, reaching out to someone who isn't sure he wants help, and having to bear the cruelty and prejudice of her own parents to accomplish all of the above.<br /><br />The widespread cultural assumptions of third gender people being oversexed and heretically life path inclined are dealt with head-on in TransAmerica.  In contradiction to the popular myths, Duncan, the film's writer, puts an incredibly personal spin on Bree, creating her as the insecure and eternally hopeful soul one might realistically imagine many who feel biologically displaced to be.  Felicity Huffman's stellar performance as the very subdued Bree only gives more credence to her quiet need to create balance in her life the one way that feels completely right to her.  The hallmark of this film is that regardless what branch of the gender tree you grow on, we all go through much of the same life experiences. We all have to make selfish and selfless choices around dealing with someone who is destitute.  We all have to decide how much influence our parents have over our life choices.  We all have to decide whom we allow to see our deepest fears and ambitions, forsaking the rest that would threaten them.  This film has sadness and humor and a whole lot of reality check.
B000Y44LBG|4.0|This is the story of the American Dream taken to its bitterly ironic conclusion, a tale of greed and moral bankruptcy, of capitalism's most dangerous pitfalls, of the grim outcome of unchecked ambition and utter complacency. The saga of heroin kingpin Frank Lucas is a darkly compelling story, and it's told brilliantly in American Gangster. The movie is raw and tense, uncompromising in its depictions of both the drug-driven underground and the society that allows it to exist. Indeed, one of this movie's biggest strengths is that it manages to create the only kind of context in which someone like Frank Lucas can be a hero, and even a sympathetic character- in the film's world of greed, blind ambition, and bottomless corruption, Frank is just another guy trying to make a living. He just happens to be really good at it.     Of course, it doesn't hurt that Denzel Washington is absolutely stunning is Lucas, playing the part with a hypnotic- and utterly heartless- charisma. He oozes raw cool and restrained magnetism, moving and speaking with a kind of quiet (but utterly acidic) grace. Russell Crowe (as Richie Roberts, Lucas' policeman rival) doesn't even come close to topping Washington, but he's still fantastic.     To be fair, the movie isn't perfect- it's a bit longer than its story allows, filling out its running time with a few too many Roberts scenes. It's not that he isn't a compelling character, but the finer details of his personal life (a custody battle, a messy divorce, etc.) aren't nearly as interesting as Lucas' megalomaniacal rise to power, and as a result they cause the film's energy to drag. In general, there's a lot of unnecessary setup, and a few ideas that aren't as well developed as they could have been. But really, these are pretty small gripes when compared to American Gangster's best features- this just might go down as a classic.
B00005JPNW|3.0|I don't usually see a film then read the book.  I like to have the literary influence first--I don't care if they're separate art forms.  This time, though, I'm doing it backwards.  Pullman's worlds are interesting places, if not original in how he creates them.  Conceptually he's not doing anything new, metaphorically indicating the mind control of organized bodies exerting control over children.  What is a bit new is that neither in his discussion around the text nor in the progression of the film, itself, does he hold back that he's doing just that.  In no way is it veiled, the influence of life-altering mind control through the vehicle of a children's story.  If that is unsettling or rouses your ire, this is not your world to explore.  Apart from the challenging concepts driving the film Pullman's very obvious plays on words as charged language reclaimed is remarkable.<br /><br />On to the pretty: Chosen \\"orphaned\\" girl saves lives against all odds, with lovely graphic effects and shapeshifting daemons.  The deeper emotional implications of her journey were fairly lacking, which I thought a bit thin.  The visual impact of the film was lovely, coupled with the psychological leaps viewers are expected to make solely based on sheer images.  Speaking off--when did Nicole Kidman gets her lips fluffed?  And Dakota Blue Richards is Tilda Swinton in a time warp, I swear it.<br /><br />I did come away with one question that I couldn't decipher if it was related to the book or the film.  How was Lyra reading the Alethiometer?  There were the tactile mechanics of the device, yet the special effects of the film indicated she was having an internal experience rather than merely reading the compass.  For me this was problematic in following the base logic of the premise, which is that Lyra is the only one who can read the Alethiometer.  I always have issues in fiction when technology is required to fuel the knowledge of the soul.  In this case it made me question if Lyra was a tool for the Alethiometer, or if it was a tool for her.  Perhaps it doesn't matter, but for me, if it's the former I'm again frustrated with the lack of the imagination to rest knowledge confidently on intuition.  To that end I will chalk it up as refined divination and read on.Alethiometer, or if it was a tool for her.  Perhaps it doesn't matter, but for me, if it's the former I'm again frustrated with the lack of the imagination to rest knowledge confidently on intuition.  To that end I will chalk it up as refined divination and read on.
B000009HF2|2.0|You probably know the story: Frampton Comes Alive sold about a gazillion copies upon its original release in 1976, catapulting the formerly obscure artist to international stardom, and why not? The whole package is such an appealing chunk of pop product that it really is hard to deny its power- there's that almost iconic cover portrait, the inviting exclamation point in the title, and that trusty Rolling Stones cover towards the end. There's \\"Baby I Love Your Way,\\" one of the most radio-friendly songs of all time, with its perennially hummable melody and fiercely inoffensive lyrics. There's even an extended version of \\"Do You Feel Like We Do,\\" with that signature talk box guitar solo. I mean, never mind that the song is repetitive, unoriginal, and unbearably overindulgent, the guy makes his f***ing guitar talk! Never saw Jimi Hendrix do that, did ya? Probably because he was busy being, y'know, innovative.    The whole album is covered in a layer of gloss so shiny that it's hard to remember anything about any of the songs. The instrumentation is professional, the songs have hooks where conventional wisdom says they should be, and the lyrics are pleasantly forgettable. It's music that sounds nice and feels nice, and when you play it, it melts into the background and doesn't get in the way of whatever you're doing, even if you play it kinda loud. And there's a place in most music collections for that sort of thing, but in the end, I can't really imagine anybody playing this thing for pure listening pleasure very often.
B000MQC9H4|2.0|I admit, I got ganked into watching this film.  I've got nothing for Diaz.  Nothing personal, I just find her to be a one-trick pony and don't run out to see her films.  I am however keenly fond of Winslet and Law...  and yes, Black.  So with 3:1 odds I was rather easily wrangled into this cute little romantic comedy.  The plot is not particularly intense:  two women on the international skids of love swap houses for two weeks, each embarking on new personal revelations and...  new love.  I enjoyed the comedic flare of Winslet, as she's known more to be a dramatic actress.  Many people balked at the idea of her starring opposite Black, but the two actually worked quite well together.  While Law was convincing in his role, and Diaz was equally so in seemingly playing herself, the two had no chemistry.  Again, it's a romantic comedy.  As long as you're not looking for engaging dialogue and witty drama, this film rocks ;)
B000003TAW|5.0|For a little while, at least, Weezer were one of the great bands of the 90s- their sound was a delicate and irresistible blend of crunching power pop, fragile indie introspection (with, admittedly, a few hints of emo fluttering in the background), and amped-up guitar rock. The whole thing was shot through with a delicate vulnerability and a disarming sense of humor. Weezer were the shy, nervous, and secretly brilliant souls who somehow managed to out-cool just about everybody else.    This aesthetic is very present on the group's self-titled debut (referred to by fans as \\"The Blue Album\\"). It features some of the band's finest songs and most beautiful performances- there's \\"My Name Is Jonas,\\" which opens the album with a churning flood of melody and guitar chords, with some great lyrical imagery. \\"No One Else\\" is a chunk of ragged, bitter pop, and \\"In The Garage\\" is a disarmingly offbeat and genuinely touching anthem for loners and outcasts everywhere. \\"Only In Dreams\\" is a quietly and unstoppably hypnotic rush of melody and nervous energy, while \\"The World Has Turned And Left Me Here\\" has a lulling, irresistible melody. \\"Undone (The Sweater Song),\\" is a subtly barbed kiss-off with a weird little guitar line, and \\"Buddy Holly\\" is a catchy, hilarious, and heartwarming classic, an unapologetic nerd-rock anthem that deserved ever ounce of its success.     This is a just plain great album, and it belongs in every half-decent music collection.
B00005JPTI|3.0|Not a seasonal pick-me-upper.  Despite that it ends on a reasonably upbeat note, this film is distressing and difficult to watch.  Another in a string of apocalyptic fear-based family films, the cure for cancer has had an undesired side effect and wiped out the human population.  One man and his dog remain to combat this grave twist of events.  As if the setup of dwindling life isn't bleak enough, the solitary life of Smith's character and the daily effort to survive while seeking a cure creates some heart stopping moments and really creepy psychological provocations.  I went into this film assuming Smith would hold his usual action hero poise, and he does to some degree.  While he is a wonderful action hero in his career, Smith is at core a gifted dramatic actor and that talent comes through in this role.  The usual running scenes, blazing fires and such abound, but they are rooted in an emotional backstory that helps viewers to understand the main character's motivations.  In that light the story is very well-rounded.  Viewers receive the action-packed thriller laced with some fairly intense emotional scenes.  Then begins the second half.<br /><br />The scariest part of this film is the deserted streets of NYC.  All in all the film is well done, acting, direction...  but something about it was really off for me, which I can only assume was the writing.  Smith spends a lot of screen time alone and despite the challenge of having to hold the momentum of the story solo, he pulls it off.  I can't in any way fault him for my feeling that the film was incomplete.  It moves very slowly, adrenaline its only initiator of plot movement in some cases.  I do like that the writing showed the main character's struggle to remain sane under such circumstances.  Most often our end of days films focus more on the hero's feats than his assured flaws.  Still, there were such leaps in the plot that I was unconvinced of the direction it took.  The finale, though realistically suited to the story, felt rushed, thus lacking.ory, felt rushed, thus lacking.
B000000W5L|5.0|A rock `n' roll masterpiece if there ever was one, Exile On Main Street is a raw, nervy double shot of ragged musical goodness. Like Chuck Berry before them, the `Stones have distilled rock `n' roll to its glorious essence, serving up track after brilliant track of wild, edgy, evocative, and cathartic music. It's a gorgeous alchemy of blues, country, rockabilly, soul, and gospel, performed with the kind of beat-down mud caked boogie rock savantism that made the Rolling Stones' music so great in the first place.  People who complain about this set's lack of standout songs have obviously never listened to \\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Rip This Joint,\\" \\"Shake Your Hips,\\" \\"Casino Boogie,\\" \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" \\"Sweet Virginia,\\" \\"Torn & Frayed,\\" \\"Sweet Black Angel,\\" \\"Loving Cup,\\" \\"Happy,\\" Turd On The Run,\\" \\"Ventilator Blues,\\" \\"I Just Want To See His Face,\\" \\"Let It Loose,\\" \\"All Down The Line,\\" \\"Stop Breaking Down,\\" \\"Shine A Light,\\" or \\"Soul Survivor.\\" Not while they were in the right kind of mood, anyway. Highlights include all of the aforementioned tracks plus... well, that's the whole album, isn't it? This is pure sweaty, paranoid genius, and one of the greatest albums in history. Buy it.
B00005JPTI|2.0|Will Smith stated in a recent 60 Minutes interview that when he and his agent were mapping out his career strategy, they noted that most of the top ten films of all time were those with lots of special effects. Films like Independence Day, Men in Black and Wild, Wild West followed. After seeing I Am Legend, I have to say that it's time for Mr. Smith to drop the popcorn movies and put his talent to much better use.    I've seen both of the previous film versions of Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend. I saw the Vincent Price version -- Last Man on Earth -- when I was young and don't remember it that well. But I have seen The Omega Man several times and, in fact, own a copy of it on DVD. The Omega Man is dated, to be sure -- 70's hipster language and Charlton Heston do not mix. However, the opening sequences of the film, showing a deserted Los Angeles, are eerily effective. In one shot, we can see nothing moving for miles -- no people, no cars, no traffic helicopters ... nothing at all. Anyone who has been in Los Angeles can tell you what an accomplishment an effect like that really is. With good supporting performances by Rosiland Cash and, especially, Anthony Zerbe as the ringleader of the vampires/mutants, The Omega Man is flawed, but in the end, very, very effective.    I Am Legend, similarly, has some fairly effective opening shots of a deserted New York City. However, on closer inspection, the viewer can see that a lot of the effect is due to CGI. The weeds growing out of the streets don't look quite right and the delapidated look on the buildings is very unconvincing. This flaw is hammered home when Smith chases a herd of deer in his Mustang. When a lion attacks one of the deer, the effect is so artificial looking, I was wondering if Yogi Bear was going to appear next.    Nowhere, however, do the CGI effects fail more completely than with the vampire mutants. In contrast with The Omega Man where the mutants are played by live actors, all of the creatures in IAm Legend are CGI. The effect is ridiculously cartoonish and wholly unconvincing. And what kind of killer virus actually makes its victims more agile? These creatures were once human beings and now they're able to climb up walls of Manhattan brownstones like mountain goats? Instead of being frightened by the creatures, I found myself rolling my eyes and wondering when Hollywood was going to realize just how bad some CGI effects really look.    However, the film's shortcoming aren't just technical. The Omega Man had an extended flashback sequence showing how the virus overtook civilization. Many people drop dead right before our eyes and the horror of the situation is hammered home very effectively. I Am Legend, in contrast, gives up dribs and drabs of flashbacks -- mostly as Smith's dream sequences. The most impressive shot in the film shows fighter jets blowing up the bridges leading into Manhattan -- one of the times where the special effects are really up to the task. However, we never get the same sense of horror watching civilization collapse that we do in The Omega Man. We see a couple of infected people fail a screening and that's about the extent of it. We don't see anyone mutate into one of the creatures. We don't see dozens drop dead from the virus. The fall of civilization doesn't deliver the dramatic punch to the stomach it should.    Smith is alone for most of the film. Towards the end, a mother and her son rescue him and briefly move in with him. In The Omega Man, we learn about Rosiland Cash's character and her infected nephew. In I Am Legend, however, the two characters are merely a plot device. They're basically there to move the plot to its conclusion and nothing more. The parts are so badly written, I wondered why they were necessary at all. Instead of caring about these new characters, I spent the final part of the film thinking about what a weak job the screenwriter did on that portion of the script.    The only really good thing about I Am Legend is Will Smith's performance. He is excellent at portraying a man who is slowly going mad from lonliness. His heart is in the project even with the numerous flaws and his acting is the only really convincing thing about the entire film. Throughout the film I kept thinking that Smith's performance deserved a better film to showcase it. I felt bad for him, but that sympathy has to be tempered by the knowledge that it was his career goal to seek out projects like this.    I'll grant Smith that some of his \\"prestige projects\\" like Ali and The Legend of Bagger Vance didn't do that well at the box office. Hollywood, for all the talk about creative expression, is driven by ticket sales and money. However, The Pursuit of Happyness did do well at the box office and showed that Will Smith, given a good script and a good director to work with, can combine artistic excellence with financial success without having to resort to loads of stunts and special effects. Leonardo DiCaprio chooses to work with name directors on films with good scripts in lieu of the summer blockbuster films and he still has as much influence and industry muscle as anyone in Hollywood. There is no reason why Will Smith can't do the same thing. He is supremely talented and intelligent (I'm positive he could be a terrific writer, director and producer as well as actor), should minimize his participation in films like I Am Legend and should choose projects that take more risks and aspire to more than just box office receipts. I Am Legend and other films like it are just a waste of his talent.

6305546789|5.0|Halloween was one of the first & best slasher movies of the 70's.<br />John Carpenter & Debra Hill were some of the originators of a low budget<br />horror flick that became one of the most well known slasher flicks of today.<br />I would say the main reason it did so well is cause at that time no had seen a movie like Halloween.<br />As graphical killing sense, a serial killer that didn't make much noise,<br />and usually snuck up on his victims.<br />To me personally Halloween & Friday the 13TH are the best 2 horror flicks mainly from the 80's!!<br />I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!
B000I5YCCO|5.0|When I first heard of Taylor, she was just another Dixie Chick, another Carrie Underwood. But then when I actually listened to the album off iTunes, it was a country masterpeice- a mix between Carrie Underwood's first album and Marinda Lampert's hate. Not too country cliche like Leanne Ryhmes type songs but a good mix between joyful and soulful like Our Song and sad soulful like Teardrops On My GUITAR and Tim McGraw. Other times she vicious which usually equal a good thing for her.   Here's the list from best to Worst:    Teardrops On My Guitar  Picture To Burn   Our Song  Should Have Said No  Tim McGraw    and pretty much everything is country cliched. But HEY, SHE WROTE OR COWRTOE ALL OF THIS!!! SHE'S IN HIGH SCHOOL!!! We Love you Taylor!!!!
B000Q6GXW2|2.0|I loved this movie and own it on standard DVD. But when I bought my Xbox 360 HD DVD attachment, I had to get this movie in HD. Only store that stocked it had a HD DVD/DVD combo disc. HD DVD owners: this is the only combo disc that didn't work in my 360 HD DVD drive (and I was so annoyed at Major Nelson's interview video from Xbox Live after I realized it didn't work--did it somehow work for him and why didn't it work for me?)    I tried to access Warner's customer support both online and by phone and neither gave me a satisfactory answer (a live person couldn't call me for at least 4 weeks). I also went to Microsoft Xbox support both online and by phone, and the phone operator had me troubleshoot every hardware option but no success. Finally, I tried downloading to CD the May 2007 HD DVD update from Xbox Live and updated the HD DVD player firmware. Popped in the disc--success! The next day when I tried it again though, it just kept coming up on the Dashboard as \\"Unplayable Disc.\\" Tried updating firmware again but was unsuccessful. The standard DVD side worked throughout all of this trouble though. I even tried returning the disc at the place of purchase for another one and experienced the same problems.    My recommendation is to purchase the straight HD DVD disc and skip the Combo at all costs.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Director David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen reunite for another intriguing meditation on the place of violence following 2005's [[ASIN:B000CQLZ0Q A History of Violence]]. \\"Eastern Promises\\" submerges us in the underworld of the Russian mafia, or \\"vory y zacone\\". When a teenager known only as \\"Tatiana\\" dies giving birth in a London hospital, her midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) hopes that translating the young woman's diary will help locate the baby's family. This leads Anna to an imposing Russian restaurateur, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who would be happy to translate the diary. But it soon becomes clear that Tatiana was a victim of the Russian mafia, and her diary incriminates Semyon and his alcoholic, uncontrollable son Kirill (Vincent Cassell). Kirill's inscrutable driver Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) is asked to retrieve the diary but grows fond of Anna.<br /><br />Truth be told, there is nothing exceptional about this script. The storyline is simple and improbable. Most characters are underwritten and fulfill roles more than they represent three-dimensional people. At times I felt like the landscape was populated with cliches. But where \\"Eastern Promises\\" succeeds, it is unforgettable. Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai walks a fine line, exploiting an odd relationship with incompetent, delusional Kirill, who seems more like his ward than his boss, to advance his own ambitions. Vincent Cassell also deserves praise for Kirill's brutal and pitiful dysfunction. But \\"Eastern Promises\\" will surely be remembered for its extraordinary fight scene, where a nude, tattooed Nikolai fights for his life in a protracted struggle with two fully-clothed assailants. It is so striking and affecting that it qualifies as one of cinema's great visual triumphs. In English and Russian with subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2007): There are 2 bonus features. \\"Secrets and Stories\\" (10 min) interviews director David Cronenberg, writer Stephen Knight, and the cast about  the meaning of \\"vory y zacone\\" or \\"thief in law\\", the while slave trade depicted in the movie, story, characters, themes, and the language issues. \\"Marked for Life\\" (7 min) discusses the significance of tattooing, which acts as an identity card or resume in Russian prisons, their symbology, and applying tattoos for the movie.

0060888695|5.0|I had to read 9 books for a class this semester and this was the last book. I was burnt out on reading and I could not get into it.

I enjoyed this book very much!
B000YABYSS|3.0|First of all I wanted to give this movie another 1/2 star.  I really respected the idea of this film and had very high expectations-that was foolish of me.<br />  In the era of political correctness, the concept of using your mind, ideas and logic as weopens against the status quo seemed worthy of Orwell. Just the idea that there might be a truth to search out and fight for, shines a light in our contemporary relativistic darkness. However the culminating \\"debate\\" of this film seemed like little more than a righteous preaching/sob story contest, even a propaganda contest.  Very funny how none of these \\"great debators\\" (those of Harvard or our protagonists) seem to have any awareness of things like logical fallacies, or any of the other integrities (now long lost) of classical debate.  Both teams indulge in emotionalistic ad hominem and reuctio ad absurdium attacks and more.  The lead actress whines and moans as if she is at a pentecostal meeting worthy of Borat, yet the audience gushes and claps at her as if on exstasy.  More laughable, one of the debators of the harvard team makes an argument ad Hitlerum-keep in mind this is the thirties, Hitler would first become Time magazines man of the year, before becoming the post world war II totem of all evil.  So in addition to it showing the ridiculousness of the debate, it is anoachronistic.  THe whole movie is so.  Silly soap opera romances and love triangles are tacked on, which only distract and seem out of character for the female lead.  Hollywood type narrow escapes and dramas here just seem all too convenient and cliched.<br /><br />Yes I respect Washington, and again the idea of this film, but it is all too much a product of present day.
B000Y179KO|3.0|If this were newcomers, you would consider it a pretty good -- four or five stars.  But the Eagles are capable of so much better than this, it's a shame.  Pretty tame and boring -- the CD smells like one of those \\"aging rockers running out of money so we better do something\\" efforts.  Not what you would expect or hope from the Eagles.  If hell refreezes and thaws again, maybe the next time they should take some of the money they made on this one (via the deal with Walmart -- how Un-Henley-philosophy-like is the whole Walmart concept? -- now we see that those principles have a price, Don), make nice with Don Felder, and let Joe Walsh loose on guitar.  The result would be much better.

055357342X|3.0|I was blown away by the first two books in the series, and all of the positive things that have been said about books are true: riveting story lines, amazing character development, beautiful writing style.  But by the middle of the third book, I was beginning to have enough, enough of the lengthy descriptions of family colors and crests, enough of the requisite twist at the end of *every* chapter, enough of Martin thinking I have the time to waste sitting around watching his dazzling display of verbosity.  By the end of the book, I just wanted to get it over with.  For book 4, I found a detailed plot summary online, and let that suffice.  I may do the same for book 5, if it ever appears.  I guess I'm not sure there's a point to investing my time and emotional energy in a storyline where at the end, there probably won't be any characters left, and the land will be so ruined, it won't be worth claiming by anyone.  There are plenty of far more satisfying reads out there.

B000UFAURI|5.0|The Foo Fighters have been able to remain a huge rock act even after so-so albums In Your Honor and One by One.  And it's no wonder, after huge radio hits Big Me, Monkey Wrench, Everlong, Hero and Learn to Fly, this group created massive staying power, even when songs such as Best of You didn't create the same vibe the others did.    Now, flash forward to this year, when The Pretender became such a wow song that it made everyone stand up and listen; the Foo Fighters once again created a magical song that screams a must-buy album.  And this time it does not disappoint and even dares to be a little different for them.  Standouts include The Pretender and Long Road to Ruin, of course, but also Let it Die, Stranger Things Have Happened, Cheer Up Boys (Your Makeup is Running), Summer's End and Home.  I've also heard the Once and For All demo, though I'm not sure which version of the album it's on, but it's vintage Foo Fighters.    Only drawbacks are Erase/Replace and Come Alive because on both of them, Dave Grohl sings the titles of these respective songs over and over and over again, so they're kind of boring.  Otherwise, they don't make em like this anymore in rock this popular and the Foo Fighters deserve every penny they make off Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace.

This holiday season was a breeze picking up the fallen evergreen leaves from the tree, small bits of syrofoam, paper, hair, dried mud, dried food, crumbs of all sorts, even paper thin onion skins! I ordered the swivel sweeper from the info mercial...it was every bit as good, no it was better than the commercial.  This will not do deep down cleaning ...it cleans up everything thats dropped and its fast and light...I have 2 one upstairs and one down...my husband tried it and he wants one for his office... it empties easy -pops out and dumps tray contents in trash. It glides on small plastic casters and has 4 brushes that catch everything!!! It cleans corners and under furniture better than my $400 vacuum!!! It cleans up broken glass -picks it right up. My grandchildren clean up after their playtime ...it picks up crayons and any sort of child crumbs. If you read a review from someone that compares it to a monster vacuum they don't know what there're tallking about...it's made great for the price and my house at Christmas was so neat and tidy with no bits and pieces of anything laying about!!! I highly reccomend the Swivel Sweeper a great little gizmo!!! I love it!!!  Paula Amityville NY

B000WCBPOG|5.0|Julie Taymor's \\"Across The Universe\\" is one of those artistic, daring musicals that fell under the radar upon release but has still managed to catch many hearts and fans, becoming almost an instant cult classic. The same will no doubt be true with this stellar, gorgeous soundtrack that isn't a Beatles tribute at all, but a re-imagining of the material for a story set in the turbulent era in which these songs were born. This \\"Delux Edition\\" is vastly superior to the previous single disc set, it includes an almost complete set of the film's songs (curiously the film's version of \\"I Want You\\" is missing). Purists are of course scoffing at the notion of a musical featuring Beatles music sung and performed by artists other than John, Paul, Ringo and George, but purists will of course never been satisfied. For the open-minded and open-eared, this is a very creative, entertaining take on the material. The actors have powerful voices and there is a fine selection of invited names such as U2's Bono and Joe Cocker. The main production here is done by composer Elliot Goldenthal (Frida, Interview With The Vampire) and T-Bone Burnette (Robert Plant and Alison Krauss's \\"Raising Sand\\"), they give us rich, exciting arrangements that give the songs new life. Just listen to the tender rendition of \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand,\\" which here is turned into a rock ballad full of ache and tears. \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" are scorching rockers while Bono's take of \\"I Am The Walrus\\" is a great psychedelic freak-out. Songs like \\"It Won't Be Long\\" and \\"Hold Me Tight\\" have snapping arrangements that retain a nostalgic 1960s pop feel. \\"Blue Jay Way\\" touches on the classic mix of rock and Indian music that stamped a lot of Beatles music during the Summer Of Love. Some of the songs like \\"Girl,\\" \\"Because\\" and \\"Across The Universe\\" are turned into beautiful, ghostly numbers while \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" is a menacing crawl. Bono and U2 guitarist The Edge close the show with a wonderfully spacey \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.\\" \\"Across The Universe\\" stands strong as an original, creative attempt at molding a story around these classic songs, which is more original than anything else we've seen from Hollywood recently. With lush orchestral arrangements and some great rock showmanship we have here an album that does justice to The Beatles, the music is elevated to new heights, and maybe a new generation of listeners will be tempted to discover the original masterpieces for themselves after experiencing Taymor's musical.

1563890410|5.0|I've heard much about The Sandman series for many years, and so last summer I finally decided to experience it for myself.  The first volume was adequate, but it didn't \\"wow\\" me as much as I expected.  Probably because, by this point in time, Gaiman's concepts had been copied and recopied so many times by so many other writers that the original held little distinction.<br /><br />I took solace in the fact that Volume III of the series was to be the one that set The Sandman beyond anything else in the comic book medium that came before or after.  Sadly--for me--it didn't electrify.  Good?  Certainly.  Great?  No.<br /><br />So, believing the opinions of several friends can't be wrong, I still pressed on.  Volume IV, Season of Mists, proved to be the one.  This is the volume that completely and utterly \\"wowed\\" me.  From the beginning to the end, this was a tightly woven story packing emotional, philosophical, intellectual, and conceptual punches that did not fail to capture both my imagination and respect.  The character of Morpheus is visually interesting, but it was not until this volume that he began to fascinate me as a well-rounded character.<br /><br />The premise is simple in Season of Mists.  Morpheus realizes he long ago made a mistake for which he must atone.  It is how he deals with coming to this decision and the ramifications of going about executing it that astonished me.  Gaiman's imagination is limitless in Season of Mists, pulling from established myths and legends as well as creating his own.<br /><br />The art, like all of the volumes, is rather hit or miss.  Luckily, the image of Morpheus is so striking and the stories so good that the art is easy to overlook.<br /><br />Finally, I wouldn't consider myself a fan of Harlan Ellison by any stretch of the imagination, but his introduction to this volume is delightful and is alone worth the price of the entire book.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:B000Z9VWI0 Dr. Nekros: The Tragedian (Volume I, Episode I)]]

B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Like some out there, I'm a fan of Vangelis and Blade Runner.  Simply put, the Vangelis fan inside me won out with this release.     Let's face it.  It's been a while since there was a new Vangelis CD out.      Disk 3 of the Blade Runner Trilogy set, for me, was worth the money alone.  To have Disk 2 is great as well.  And to listen to the entire compilation together is just a wonderful experience for me.  In fact, the reason why I decided to write something is because I believe Disk 3 deserves more description then it has been getting.      First off, this disk has pretty much new material.  The material, though, is very original.  At the same time it seems to carry on with the Blade Runner concept very well.    There are some surprising pieces here.      \\"BR Downtown,\\" followed by \\"Demetri's Bar,\\" is shockingly fresh.  It is very hard to categorize the first especially.  Almost like an ambient reggae-techno.  You have to hear it for yourself.      \\"Perfume Exotico\\" is a very seductive alteration of \\"Rachel's Song\\".  I was not prepared to hear Vangelis put something like this together, but it works.    Included are some very good pieces as well.      The piece \\"Piano In An Empty Room,\\" which is solely piano, is full of romantic vibrancies.  Anyone who has empathy for his music will come back to this piece many times over.      \\"Sweet Solitude\\" reminds me of the days when Vangelis was in his prime in the early 80's.  Starts out with a simple keyboard tune, carries on with some percussion, and then becomes complete with a wonderful sax (reminiscent of \\"Love Theme\\").    Keep in mind, there are some rather hard-pounding sounds here.  \\"No Expectation Boulevard\\" is the prime example.  But that is to be expected, considering the overall theme being presented.     I think my personal favorite here is \\"Up and Running.\\"  It is just bizarre.  It not only carries an unorthodox re-mixing of \\"One More Kiss, Dear,\\" it has sounds similar of \\"Nerve Centre\\" (from his 1990 release \\"The City\\") along with the familiar strings from \\"Main Titles\\".  It then ends with an uplifting piano piece.  What an amalgamation!    And that's how I would define Disk 3.  An amalgamation of sounds associated with culture, urban lifestyle, subconscious narrative (which aren't distracting and occur mainly during the transitions), and reflective meditation.    It is fairly safe to say Vangelis fans will overall enjoy this release, regardless of your fondness for the Blade Runner franchise.  I'm glad I purchased it.

I have made several recipes from this book and have been delighted at how well they came out and how delicious they were.

The title track is a big dig on the current administration, \\"Gypsy Biker\\" recounts a family celebrating their dead solder relative/friend by getting his bike out and polished, \\"Livin' in the Future\\" seems like regret about the present and pretending to be living just a short while into the future (after the next president has been elected), and \\"Radio Nowhere\\", while not political but basically it is saying there's crap out there on American radio.

Back in 1993 I assembled my own COMPLETE soundtrack of the film using the best sound elements available at the time, the LaserDisc of Ridley Scott's Director's Cut. What I ended up with was absolutely the definitive, complete soundtrack to the film. Every note, bleep and hum. I loved it. I still love it, still have it, burned for eternity on CD. Now with the 5-disc DVD collection, any serious Blade Runner fan could easily create a superior audio version to mine. Instead they complain.<br /><br />This 3-disc collection is a welcome alternative to the soundtrack I created. Expanded, like experiencing the whole thing from a new, different point of view.<br /><br />You BR purists need to relax. Stop talking, stop typing, and start listening. What Vangelis has created here is BEAUTIFUL and HAUNTING, something NEW for all Blade Runner fans. Let yourself be open to its possibilities and you'll be pleasantly surprised.
1582701709|1.0|Honestly, I didn't even make it past the 25% mark in this book. It sounded interesting at first but it's like some of the other one-star reviewers have said: it's like an infomercial. Oh, and here's The Secret -- if you think good thoughts, good things will happen to you. Okay, I actually do believe in positive thinking, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking that we're going to win the lottery just because we keep having thoughts about this happening. Yep, that's the whole book, a bunch of testimonials from those who are already successful and claim it's because of The Secret.

B000O5AYCA|5.0|This was my favorite album of 2007 and made it to the top of my \\"Best Albums of 2007\\" list ([...])<br /><br />I saw them in concert because I liked their album and their last one, Alligator, was amaaaaaazing. They are my favorite band of the moment and I just can't seem to get enough of them. Oh, and be sure to buy the B-sides to the singles from this album as they're top-notch as well. \\"Apartment Story\\" off of Boxer is my favorite song of the year.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to be released on DVD.  I am a HUGH Matthew Macfayden fan so that made me want to see this film.  I have to say that this movie is beyond funny.  There were times I was laughing so hard I was crying.  This will be a movie I will watch whenever I need a good laugh.  I highly recommend this film.
B000TFINY6|5.0|Lost is the perfect show to showcase the amazing picture and sound only blu-ray high def can offer. Seeing Lost on blu-ray takes the show to a whole new level. With 6 times the resolution of  DVD, everything just seems to pop out at you in this amazing 6 disc set. From the grass and trees on the island to the blue sky and the facial expressions (including seeing the actors pores), every detail just pops out like nothing you have seen before in a TV show. Lost Season 3 blu-ray is truly breathtaking and is one amazing experience to see it in blu-ray high def. This is one of the best TV shows to come out in a long time, and is one of the few shows that hook you in, gets you addicted, and takes you on this emotional journey with the characters. Sometimes after each episode you are lost yourself by what is going on, but it is that mystery and suspense that keep fans coming back for more.  In season 3 we find out more about the others along with some answered questions on some of the characters pasts. Disney/Buena Vista put a lot in their DVD and Blu-ray sets and Season 3 is no exception. Lost The Complete Third Season -- The Unexplored Experience blu-ray is presented in 6 blu-ray discs with all 23 episodes and is presented in full 1080p high definition with a 1.78:1 widescreen transfer. This blu-ray looks even better than the over-the-air high definition transfer which is broadcast in 720p. This is without a doubt the best looking TV show ever in high definition to date. The audio for Lost is great as well.  You get a PCM track which sounds the best and has more impact than the 5.1 dolby digital track. The sound along with the pristine picture just make this set that much more enjoyable. Lost is one show that was truly meant to be seen and appreciated in high definition.<br /><br />The bonus material is as follows<br /><br />·  \\"The World of the Others,\\" which explores the crucial role of \\"The Others\\" in season 3 and what the world of Lost holds for these characters in the future.<br /><br />·  \\"Lost Flashbacks\\" - Never-before-seen glimpses into the past lives of the castaways<br /><br />·  \\"Lost in a Day\\" - Fans of Lost will have a chance to see what it really takes to create the show each season.<br /><br />·  \\"Lost on Location\\" - A behind-the-scenes look at the making of 10 episodes from season 3<br /><br />·  \\"The Lost Book Club\\" - Learn about the role of literature in the story of Lost in this exploration of the books featured in the series.<br /><br />·  Deleted Scenes<br /><br />·  Bloopers<br /><br />·  Audio Commentaries<br /><br />·  Exclusive, interactive BD-Java Feature - Fans will rethink what they know about Lost and change the way they watch the show.

B0000648WZ|5.0|I guess one should never take a Paul Verhooven movie as social commentary -- but why not? Verhooven is a wildly under-rated filmmaker who as a keen sense of satire and social analysis. In Starship Troopers, he uses Heinlein's take on how the military mind works one step further and establishes a world (and society) where the military mind is everything. Only the military are qualified to be citizens because they, unlike others, are the ones to make the survival of the species their personal responsibility. Great, and I'm sure that rationale is the path to a better world. But let's apply this ethos to the present time. We have service personnel all over the world, at this moment, fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and many other places. Their mission: to defend civilization and take personal responsibility for its survival. We are reminded over and over again, by politicians and the media, that they are making the greatest sacrifice -- one that few others are willing to make. It is for that reason that they are considered the best among us. Indeed, they are the only ones among us who know what citizenship really entails. And on the flip side of that, we have these same soldiers blamed for the Abu Grab torture incidents, accidental civilian deaths, the failure of the mission in Iraq, and a host of other mishaps. In the end, our service personnel are less than the warrior heros they have been painted to be.  They are less than perfect. Actually, they are more like everyone else, except they are stuck in situations that few of us in in our right minds would want to be in. So, watch Starship Troopers with an open-mind for satire. And while your at it, watch \\"Three Kings\\", \\"Jarhead\\", \\"M*A*S*H\\" and \\"Catch-22\\" and get the whole picture of what it really means to be a soldier.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|[[ASIN:B0010YSD7M Stargate - The Ark of Truth]]<br /><br />Like most loyal Stargate SG-1 fans, I firmly believe that this show could have continued, at least for one more season.  But MGM's greed and SCiFi's poor management  forced it off the air before its time (yes, I'm talking about you Bonnie...how you worked out in your head that ECW wrestling belongs on the SciFi Channel remains a huge mystery to everyone).  I am glad that the powers that be have at least seen fit to provide us with this and the next Stargate movie and I hope that they will be the first of many.
B000WQW988|5.0|For those who know Nirvana, you already knew of the legendary MTV performance and this DVD does not disappoint. The visual and sound qualities are excellent, the extras add a bit more for your dollar but the actual performance footage is more than enough. The DVD contains the entire recorded performance except for Sweet Home Alabama which I don't believe the band plays completely in any case. For people who know Nirvana only as a rock band and Kurt Cobain as the more often than not raving singer/guitarist, his performance will stun you ear drums with the beautiful sounds his voice shows when singing in a different style and format. All of the musicians, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl (drummer, now lead singer guitarist of Foo Fighters)display a dexterity in musical style that I really enjoyed. The slower pace & different key of the music played here allows you to hear the lyrics better, and the instruments more individually played. The solos by Kurt are sometimes heartbreaking      when heard in the hindsight of his untimely death. Oh Me, a Meat Puppet  cover, Something in the Way, Pennyroyal Tea, and Dumb, are particularly poignant. About A Girl, Come As You Are, All Apologies, Polly are equally excellent. There isn't a song on here I didn't like. It's said Kurt was under the influence at the time, or indulged afterwards with serious consequences--whatever the tongue-waggers wanted to make of it, he & the band put in an excellent, professional performance irregardless of any extenuating circumstances.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|Some reviewers on this and other sites have said that it was great that Amanda Tapping has taken over the reigns of the Atlantis expedition, but complete episodes of season 4 go by without even seeing her.  I realize they don't want to overshadow McKay since they are both scientists that have a penchant for coming up with galaxy-saving ideas at the 11th hour, but don't stick her in a corner and bring her out long enough to tell Shepherd's team that they \\"have a go\\" and then send her back to her office!  She was a huge part of Stargate SG-1 and I think that the writers are making a mistake by not giving her more screen time.
0143038419|1.0|Ugh, This book I was hoping would be good, as chosen by my book club, but it was nothing but a huge let down.  I wanted to like the reader, I myself was fresh out of a divorce so I wanted to identify with her.. but I just kept thinking \\"Oh, honey you already ARE crazy Aunt Liz\\". Her note book spoke back to her as she sat on the bathroom floor crying....truly truly pathetic.<br />Her so called wonderful insights weren't anything grand, and they just seemed very shallow, self absorbed, and rather dull and ignorant. After then seeing her on Oprah and watching all these bored housewives talk about how insightful she was it felt cult like, like all these people needed to be told by some wack-a-doo that they are worth it?  Please...
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I'm not quite sure why the single DVD set is $12.99 and this, the 2 DVD set, is almost three times that at $35.00, but I can tell you it is worth every penny.  As is pointed out in this excellent program, back then there were only 3 channels; the Johnny Cash show was on ABC, which we didn't get (that's right, there were only 3 channels, and we got CBS and NBC, and sometimes, when the weather wasn't right, NBC would be snowy.  I'm 52, in case you're wondering how many centuries ago that was).  Which means that I missed it the first time around, and as far as I know, it NEVER was syndicated.  So this is my first look at a program that, as far as I'm concerned, was both revolutionary and unique in that it was all about music.  No stupid skits (I don't think), no bad comedians, no amazing plate-spinning.  Just music.  But not just any music....all music!  Be it country, rock, pop, bluegrass, jazz, soul...he had the biggest and the best.  Too bad the Beatles were busting up when this show started, because he would have no doubt tried to coax them out as well.    And no lip-synching on this show, no sir (and ma'am).  Real live.  Just to have all of these amazing performances collected would be a treat and a treasure.  But this is really so much more.  It's the man and the stories behind what made these amazing performances happen.  I have to think that at that point in the history of music, only Johnny Cash could have made something so amazing as this happen.  Only Johnny Cash could have served up such a rich and varied musical program to the American public, all pretty much straight up and unadulterated.  No one else could have beat down the censors; no one else could have convinced a real country fan to actually sit through a performance of Stevie Wonder.      But Johnny Cash could...and did.  He was at the absolute apex of his career.  He's always walked a fine line between rock'n'roll and country, but his crossover was made complete by the enormous success of A Boy Named Sue and Ring of Fire.  I was barely in my teens and did NOT like country, but I did like Johnny Cash.  It was hard to find people who did not like him.  ABC lucked into a masterstroke.  I'm assuming they gave him great license and I'm assuming he followed his heart in assembling this glorious showcase of talent from the entire landscape of American music in the late '60s and early '70s.  I certainly hope so.  It couldn't have been a calculated marketing move, could it? Nah!      Without getting too deep into musicology, this was a remarkable time for \\"pop\\" music, when you could hear almost anything on your top 40 AM station.  That time,sadly, was quickly drawing to an end, and, thanks to The Johnny Cash Show, it has been brillaintly preserved for posterity.  I don't think anything else comes close.  Ed Sullivan was great, but didn't hold a candle to this.  The Smothers Brothers Show was also great, but the main emphasis was comedy, not music (both on CBS, see, so I did watch those shows).  Music was not incidental here, it was aimed at music lovers, and that's what I am.  I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to watch it when I was a kid.  I don't know that it would have changed my life, but I do know it would have enhanced it a great deal, and exposed me to many artists that I didn't discover until many years later, if ever.    Anyway, these DVDS are magic and actually it's a miracle that they exist.  You cannot take miracles lightly and you certainly can't afford to be without one that costs a mere $35.  Cheap price for a piece of magic but an absolute STEAL for a miracle.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Some people think that she has lost her touch on this CD but I really don't hear that.  I still think that she is pretty awesome.  I will continue to buy her music.  She changes up her style and experiments with different sounds.  I think that all artists should do that.  Not just do what is always popular.  Kelly is great.  This CD is great.  Just like her other CD's.  Worth the money at full price.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|This set was a great value for the price and aside for the cursing in the films (all rated R) I am satisfied with the films quality.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I have to say that I am a huge fan of the book and the BBC version with Colin Firth. Sadly, I absolutely despise this version of Pride and Prejudice. Of course, I expected much of the story line to be abbreviated given the 2 hr running time, but I did not expect the blatant disregard for the integrity of Austen's characters. It was bad enough to see Jane's sweet disposition misrepresented, but the oversimplification and shallowness of the Eliza and Mr. Darcy characters is unforgivable.    Eliza was silly and flip without any of the depth, thoughtfulness, and complexity that her character merits. Mr. Darcy was sullen, brooding, and dull instead of being aloof and reserved. Neither character demonstrated the depth and range of character portrayed in the book, perhaps because the movie doesn't ring true with the formality and strictness of British society during that time that is conveyed in Austen's novel. Instead, the movie overly glamorizes the period and indulges the characters with glitzy, unrestrained, and sappy romantic conversational tripe. I couldn't even finish the last ten minutes of the movie!    If you have any love or respect for Austen's story, I would not watch this movie.
0679879269|2.0|I enjoyed the first two books, well written, fun and wonderful stories.  However, it's clear Mr. Pullman could not decide if he wanted to write a treatise on the Catholic Church or if he wanted to write a great fantasy.  It seems he tried to do both, and failed.  If one was to spend so many pages creating a power point about how evil and weak 'god' was, at least do it well.  Unfortunately, in the end neither the story nor his atheist rant were left unscathed.  Too bad, such a great start.
B000YENUIQ|5.0|Amazon, why won't you post my review?   This is a good HD movie.

B000VR824S|5.0|Forget the All-Star lineup, if you're a fan of the blues, or slide guitar, the first 20 minutes is worth the price of the 2-disc set.
0765318741|5.0|A cult classic that has been revitalized by the Will Smith movie.<br /><br />The movie and book differ in several significant ways, but each still has at the core the concept of isolation of man, and overcoming a massive change in the world order.<br /><br />The movie was decidedly more positive in the final outlook for \\"humans.\\" The book has a darker undertone to it.  I found both interesting, and enjoyable. Horror does not have to be thrust in your face, and this is a good example of that - not that it lacks in death or blood, but that is not the core of the story. One man's battle, against external forces, as well as against internal ones, comprise the essence of this well done story.<br /><br />The book is a bit short, but complete in its narrative. The added short stories in this collection run from serious to comedic, but all have some supernatural or otherworldly aspect to them. I Am Legend is by far the superior story in this, but the others certainly well crafted stories.
B000YA82F6|5.0|This movie is full of wit, charm, and humor, all nicely balanced with moments of vulnerability.  It is without a doubt one of the best films of the year.
B000W93CXQ|4.0|I thought this story was well told and showed just how much one action could change a person's life forever.
B00005JPNW|4.0|I viewed The Golden Compass completely unaware this might be the first in a series of three movies, fully incognizant of the three books the series is based upon, and supremely ignorant of the religious controversy swirling around the books. I did not notice anything controversial in the movie or anything thought-provoking for those looking for serious enlightenment. The flick is mostly fantasy with some pseudo-scientific gobbledygook thrown in to make you think you're seeing something of import.<br /> The first thing that puzzles naïve viewers like myself is that everyone is accompanied by some kind of a personal animal, some of them very weird looking and all apparently capable of morphing into other creatures. These are individual daemons, and if one loses one's daemon, one can be radically altered by bad guys. There always seemed to be a lot of creatures underfoot. Does one have to take them out for a walk so they can do their business?<br /> The movie has well-known actors, often playing small roles. Sam Elliott plays a cowboy with an airship. Derek Jacobi, Tom Courtenay,  and Ian McShane are on hand as is Ian McKellen's voice as the good polar bear. Nicole Kidman is a baddie, and why she was chosen for this non-romantic role is a mystery. She has a particularly vile monkey daemon.<br /> At the beginning of the movie I thought I saw Radcliffe Camera, a round building that is part of the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. Other scenes seemed like Oxford and a Victorian-looking London. At the beginning with the gang of boys there was a distinctly Dickensian and Victorian feel to the story. And were they trying to remind us of the Harry Potter franchise? Jules Verne, anyone?<br /> The computerized special effects in the movie will get your attention. The huge polar bears are an important element in the movie. My advice would be just sit back and enjoy this as a fantasy-adventure with clever special effects, and a story which may or may not make any sense to you. The cliffhanger ending is a lead-up to the second in the series which may or may not get made depending upon how well this very expensive effort fares.nger ending is a lead-up to the second in the series which may or may not get made depending upon how well this very expensive effort fares.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|This album is like having every single Daft Punk album put into a blender, blended on intense, poured out and served chilled on a sweet breezy spring Saturday afternoon.<br /><br />So good. So musically tasty. Daft Punk has mixed all their songs magnificently.<br /><br />And the second CD with the 9+ minute encore featuring \\"Music Sounds Better With You\\" is amazing.
B000PFUAO6|1.0|Every band has that album that you ask yourself, \\"What were they thinking?\\"  Joe Satriani had \\"Engines of Creation\\".  Yngwie Malmsteen had \\"War to End All Wars\\".  Queensryche had \\"Operation: Mindcrime II.  Dream Theater has \\"Systematic Chaos\\".  This album is by far DT's worst outing and by a long shot.  I am probably the biggest Dream Theater fan you will meet.  I have John Petrucci's actual autograph (obtained in Cleveland on their Octavarium tour) tattooed on my left arm.  I have the DT logo tat on my chest.  I get every album the day it comes out and I've seen a show on every tour since Scenes from a Memory.  However, I was extremely disappointed with this album and for that matter, Score (but that's another review).    Problem #1:  Lyrics.  The lyrics on this album are just plain stupid.  What happened to songs like we heard on Images and Words or even Octavarium that had depth and substance?  Where did the lyrics go that had a deep personal or political message that were thought provoking?  This album is singing about vampires and fantasy creatures.  That sort of thing belongs in a 400 page book for Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter nerds, not a DT album.  The songs on this album truly lack lyrical substance.    Problem #2: It should have been titled, \\"An Album With John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess\\".  Just too much Petrucci/Rudess going back and forth at each other.  I love both musicians.  Please don't get me wrong.  Petrucci is one of my biggest guitar influences and Rudess is an absolutely amazing keyboardist, but he's become the Yngwie Malmsteen of keyboard to me where there isn't a powerful melody or message to his solos, it's just hitting as many notes in a scale as possible.  John became like that on this album too.  It felt like a competition to see who could hit the most notes within a measure and while it's cool in a song or two...it doesn't hold the substance a guitarist would find with someone like Satriani or Vai.    Problem #3: Borrowed music.  Ifyou take the lyrics completely out of the equation, the music itself isn't bad.  It shows flashes of old DT brilliance with changing time signatures, changing keys, the \\"fingers should always be moving\\" philosophy, and some really cool instrumental progressions.  The problem is that it falls short of the progressive brilliance that DT has shown in the past.  There isn't anything new, which makes it not...well...progressive.  The modes seem to be borrowed from Lamb of God, Iron Maiden, Queensryche, and Metalica.  It's not the new and different sound that we're used to hearing from DT so for this reason alone, long time DT fans will be disappointed.    Problem #4: Mike Portnoy producing.  I will admit that I have a bit of a personal grudge against Portnoy as I have never been able to personally get an autograph from him because he's flat out turned me (and the crowd with me) down.  An example of this was in Cleveland he walked by us four times and every time someone asked for an autograph he flat out said \\"no\\" or \\"not tonight\\" and kept walking when every other member of the band stopped to talk with us and sign anything we wanted.  When you watch the DVD of the production of this album, it's Mike's way or the highway.  He thinks that he's God's gift to music and even though that may be true when it comes to drums, let's leave the producing to the professionals.    Overall, Dream Theater needs to go back to the plays from their own book and revisit albums such as Images and Words or Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  Those were truly progressive substantive albums.  I miss the old Dream Theater which sorely need to come back.  The great thing about Dream Theater is that they're not past their prime in terms of musical ability.  John seems to be getting faster, not slower, Portnoy more complex in his beats, not less, and LaBrie can hit the notes he could 10 years ago.  The potential is there to be brilliant again if they go back to their roots and bring back the old Dream Theater.  Even with this debacle, I'm still looking forward to the next album.  Just like die hard Miami Dolphins fans this year.  Even though they're 1-15 and have seen better days, you still gotta root for them because you hope to be there when they recapture their former glory.
0810993139|3.0|Kind of disappointing. The web journal is way better, and it has a lot more pages. Didn't like it.
0345438205|2.0|I've been a big fan of Clark and the 2001 series for a long time.  2001 of course was monumental and both a great book and movie.  2010 (both book and movie) was just as good if not better. 2061 was not quite as good as the first two, but still a great read and worth the time.  I had high hopes for the series finale, 3001, but it only greatly disappointed in the end. It starts off great with Poole awakeing 1000 years after the incidents on the Discovery, and Clark paints a beautiful picture of life in the far future.  However, the story quickly nosedives with insanely goofy descriptions of dinosaur janitors, personal flying recreation in micro-gravity, implausable computer-virus as-weapons, and ho-hum descriptions of societies on Europa and Ganymede. Very little effort was made by Clark to produce an engaging storyline, especially one that makes use of \\"the astonaut odessey\\" which he did so well in the first three books.  The dialog with Dave Bowman entity sounds about as poetic and profound as an over-the-fence conversation with your next door neighbor.  Clark's explanation of the monoliths purpose greatly cheapens their awe - would have been better to keep some of the mystery behind them, or at least visit their society or point of origin. Clark's writing also greatly suffers in this installment.  For example, take this excerpt, which I felt was both corny, and implausable Poole would have such a thought: \\"It was more like a rounded hill than a sharp peak, and he could well believe that one of the local pastimes was bicycle riding to the summit. Until now, none of those sportsmen and women could have guessed at the secret hidden beneath their wheels: he hoped that the sinister knowledge would not discourage their healthy excercise.\\"  Poole was worried people would be discouraged from riding their bikes?  Groan.  I give this book more than 1 star only because the first third of the book starts off quite captivating.  If you've read the others, you might as well read this one, but be prepared to be disappointed.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|Iris (Kate Winslett) is still in love with a man who constantly cheats on her and is now engaged to another woman. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a cold-hearted workaholic who just threw her cheating boyfriend out of her house. Both of these women need a vacation, and via an online search, they agree to switch houses, for two weeks over Christmas. This is the premise of THE HOLIDAY, a too-long, sometimes sweet, occasionally funny romantic comedy.<br /><br />Iris travels to LA to live in Amanda's glamourous mansion while Amanda journeys to England to stay at Iris's quaint cottage. The movie then switches back and forth between the stories of the two women. After a few fish out of water scenes, both women begin getting involved. Amanda meets Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) and they instantly sleep together. That right there is a turn off in a romantic comedy, even though Jude Law's character is later vindicated. Iris, meanwhile, makes friends with a sweet old neighbor as well as some of Amanda's friend, inclucing the composer Miles (Jack Black). The rest of the movie is the standard love story.<br /><br />My wife loved this movie of course, and I didn't like it. It was too long for me, and the format and the telling of the two stories gave neither story as much time as it needed to develop. Each character had a story to tell, and Graham and Miles got the short end. Jack Black, especially, was underused. Kate Winslett shines and Diaz was okay given how annoying her character was. Guys, your women will be impressed if you watch this with them, but you should look elsewhere for a strong romantic comedy that you can both enjoy.
B00005NRO3|4.0|Scream 2 is on a par to its predecessor. Its as scary as part one and dialouge is more witty. The cast members are also eye candies to viewers. Even I was actually quite surprised when I noticed Rebecca Gayheart, Heather Graham, Jada Pinkett and Sarah Michelle Gellar have small roles in the movie.     The story continues as another killing strikes again after the horrific events in part one. All the 3 main characters have grown to a more serious and the writers put a more in depth personality rather than one-dimensional. Sidney (Neve Campbell) have grown more stronger this time. She's no more the \\"I-Am-Helpless\\" lady. Gale (Courtney Cox) seems more sensible and less sacarstic to get whatever she wants. Infact, she outgrown herself and her character are more in depth. Same goes for Dewey (David Arquette) no longer the idiotic hobo but a macho man.    Some of the guest roles are interesting too but rather too short. Sarah Michelle Gellar is on example who own her death scene. Its the 2nd best chase sequences in the Scream series and Sarah's 2nd best in all of her horror movies she's in (1st being I Know What You Did Last Summer) (1st being Rose McGowan death scene in Part one and Drew Barrymore's gutted scene). Jada Pinkett smith opening scene was a jaw dropper as well.    This movie is well crafted just like the 1st and the story line doesn't gets confusing for viewers. The writer's just keep it simple and stick to where part 1 left off and also twisting some characters which you didn't expect them to be what they are.    This is one of the most entertaining horror flicks of the year 1998-2000.  Scream series is definitely original, lots of slapsticks and lots of eye candies for viewers to google at and have them playing a guessing game of who lives and who dies.
B000P0J024|4.0|It just seems like a stronger collection of songs, I especially love The Devil's been busy. It's quite an underrated song. On Vol I I really like Handle with care, Not alone and End of the line but I'm not that impressed by the other songs on it. Well that's what I think, my review.
0393324818|5.0|As a long time baseball fan, I have been a keen follower of how the Oakland A's have consistently been so good despite having an incredibly small payroll while big-spending teams like the Texas Rangers and Baltimore Orioles consistently flounder.  This book helped me understand why.<br /><br />The use of statistics to predict future behavior is not a new practice.  Hedge fund models use these statistics every day.  Moneyball shows how statistics can be used in the most unusual places.<br /><br />One thing that befuddled me throughout the entire book was how a sport so in love with statistics did not use statistics to judge and select players for teams.  I know Lewis \\"fell in love\\" with the story, but the story is still a good one.  How could so many teams consistently spend so much money for such poor results while the A's won on a comparative shoestring budget?  The sports world is the greatest example of imitation in the world, but no one seemed to bother benchmarking how the A's won so efficiently.<br /><br />As for the story, it moves very quickly.  Lewis does a good job of explaining the history of sabermetrics and showing how Billy Beane learned from the writings of Bill James.  The interplay between the A's \\"old-school\\" scouts and the \\"quant jocks\\" like Beane and Paul DePodesta shows how hard it was for the quants to gain acceptance.<br /><br />Baseball is the ultimate endurance test, and 162 games usually shows the true nature of teams and systems.  If you are a sports fan with an understanding of business, you'll be able to understand how the use of statistics in baseball can be applied to other business settings.  If you know business but have a passing interest in sports, you'll wonder why more teams didn't try the A's approach.  If you are a fan of both sports and business, you'll make the connection.  All in all, a fantastic and enlightening read.
B000W4KT6E|4.0|More proof that Hollywood has run out of original ideas. A remake of [[ASIN:B00006RZ9Y Hairspray]]?<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />Regardless of Glamour City's lack of originality, this new Hairspray is a glitter-rama of song, dance, music and the battle over racism, and it fills the screen with enough enjoyable moments to make it a film worth your while.<br /><br />Comparisons between this 2007 update and the 1988 version abound, so we won't travel that overdone road here. What we'll do is give you a few glimpses into what awaits you if you should choose to pick up a DVD copy of this newest remake.<br /><br />Racial integration is the focus once again. Newcomer Nickki Blonsky fills the screen as the plumped-up Tracy Turnblad, a teen in love with dance and the social changes surrounding her. Her mother Edna is played by the sexually changed and fat-suited John Travolta ([[ASIN:B000QFCD7W Wild Hogs]]). Most movie-goers probably haven't heard Travolta sing since [[ASIN:B00006B1HH Grease]] and his voice doesn't shine through here because he's acting as a woman and moving his voice up in octaves to stay in character, which made his singing a painful event. But much of that can be whisked aside due to the fact that we get to watch he and Christopher Walken ([[ASIN:B000XPU66U Balls of Fury]]) do a fantastic dance number through a myriad of clothes lines. The production is so well done here that Travolta's over-the-top singing fades. Walken plays Wilbur Turnblad (Edna/Travolta's husband) and this aforementioned dance number harkens Walken back to his early acting days when dancing was his forte. You can really tell that he was enjoying himself here.<br /><br />The all-star cast also helps move this movie up a notch thanks to its star power. James Marsden ([[ASIN:B000YA9R64 Enchanted]]) stars as TV personality Corny Collins and hosts the dance show that Tracy thinks is totally neat. His desire for racial change matches that of Tracy's. But both are stymied by the twisted Velma von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer, [[ASIN:B000WZAE1I Stardust]]) who helps run the Corny Collins show and also cheats, connives, and misguides in order to ensure her only daughter Mandy (Brittany Snow) wins every televised competition.<br /><br />Queen Latifah (STRANGER THAN FICTION) stars as Motormouth Mabelle, a black dancer who's \\"Negro Day\\" on the Corny Collins show is in jeopardy of being cancelled when the white-bread Velma decides that Corny's show would be better off without the colored element.<br /><br />The battle between long-held beliefs of racial separation battle the new integration sweeping the nation, and the songs, dances, and physical attractions can't be put off any longer.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky is to be commended for doing such a fantastic breakout role as the plumpy integrationist Tracy Turnblad. Her singing, swaying, and acting were spot-on for the referenced movie times, and she carries the weight of the entire production perfectly. But strangely enough, most older generation watchers might enjoy more the scenes with Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, and John Travolta as they watch them return to a time when their acting careers were just starting.:B000WZAE1I Stardust]]) who helps run the Corny Collins show and also cheats, connives, and misguides in order to ensure her only daughter Mandy (Brittany Snow) wins every televised competition.

B00005JPTI|3.0|Oh look, another remake. Wow. Woop. What fun.<br /><br />Do I sound overly cynical? Maybe I am. But can't we see a few more original films on the big screen rather than mulling over the same ones year after year? Is that asking too much? Perhaps it is.<br /><br />The post-apocalyptic science fiction genre has been done to death ([[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]], [[ASIN:B000MDFTHE Night of the Comet]], [[ASIN:B0002IQNAG Dawn of the Dead]], [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]], [[ASIN:0790731401 Outbreak]], [[ASIN:B000EZ908Y The Quiet Earth]]). And here in I AM LEGEND, we get a remake of the Charlton Heston film [[ASIN:B000VAHR1E The Omega Man]]. Growing up, I loved The Omega Man. I often wondered what it'd be like to be the last man on Earth; at least the last \\"normal\\" man on Earth. The genre wasn't yet tired in 1971 and I wasn't even into my teens. But since then not-just-a-small-number of similar cinematic films have come out, bombarding movie watchers with the same ol' theme over and over and over again (see my partial list above).<br /><br />Will Smith ([[ASIN:B000N6U0E2 The Pursuit of Happyness]]) takes on the lead role as Dr. Robert Neville, the seemingly sole survivor of a plague that has wiped out 99% of humanity, turning the remaining 1% into cannibalistic zombie-vampires who burn up if exposed to sunlight; they roam New York's desolate streets at night in search of fresh meat. A cure for cancer has sparked a new virus that started humanity's die-off, and these scenes are given frequent flashbacks during the movie. We also get to see Dr. Neville's responsibility for trying to find a cure via the military (whom he works for before everyone keels over).<br /><br />With Dr. Neville is a trusty sidekick named Sam, a German Shepherd with acute senses. His canine abilities extend to detecting vampire-zombies, and to helping Neville battle the complete aloneness that rattles around his psyche. This is undoubtedly one of the strongest elements of the film. Watching Dr. Neville walk into a video rental store and speak to the mannequins he has set up is an honest portrayal that would hit any human who had only a dog to speak with.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />When Sam-the-Dog dies (or rather when Dr. Neville is forced to kill him), it is a blow too deep and the good doctor goes out to meet up and kill as many of the nightstalkers as he can before they kill him. That's when he meets up with two young people (an older sister and younger brother) who save Neville from himself and tell him of a fantasy safe zone somewhere in the hills of Vermont. Neville has to decide what to believe in as the monsters close in on his home and threaten not only himself, but his two new god-fearing humans. The ending is pretty weak but set up nicely in a visual way.<br /><br />END SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />Having hoisted such terrible news as \\"unoriginal\\" on I Am Legend, one cannot deny two key elements that make this film a positive experience. First is the extremely creepy feeling one gets when looking at a vacant New York City. The weeds growing up from cracks in the pavement. Wild deer migrating through empty car-riddled streets. Everywhere there's a vision of what once was human inhabitation and is now just a rotting shell. That was a painfully great set of scenes. Secondly is Will Smith. Similar to Tom Hanks' [[ASIN:B00005V9IJ Cast Away]], Smith carries the entire film and does so with effortless precision. The losses he experiences are tremendous, and Smith pulls us in and forces us to feel the pain of one man left alone for far too long. This is most evident when dealing with Sam-the-Dog and his encounters with a pretty mannequin that he starts to humanize in his mind.<br /><br />Some might be able to wiggle past this film's unoriginality factor, and if they can, I applaud them. They probably enjoyed the movie (minus the ending) much better than I was able. But if you're like me, and desire something fresh in the cinema, you'll probably have similar feelings.

B000Y1ZXU2|4.0|I just wanted to say that i think this is a good DVD. It's not exactly what I was expecting but it is very well though out and has lots of information that any fan would enjoy about the band. Lots of Adam Jones' work has been put into it and the video is amazing. You have to watch it more than once!<br />Also if you people are complaining about watching live shows there are two things you can do a)go to a Tool concert and it will be the best concert you have ever been to. i have been to two and they have left my jaw on the floor  and most people that judge concerts and all put it up there with Floyd concerts. amazing light shows, loud music, what more can you ask for..B) search the internet for live shows..there are recordings out there either from people smuggling in cameras or the venue recorded it..youtube has a bunch for one, lots of torrents also..<br /><br />Again, good DVD, worth watching lots of times, especially if you like vicarious.

B000M4RG42|3.0|Was the film supposed to be a war movie in the \\"war is hell\\" mold, a biting social statement on wartime and post-war ethnic prejudice, a cynical commentary on the policy of funding war and maintaining popular enthusiasm for war, or a multi-stranded biopic?  Like Rodenberry's constantly-transforming Martian, it tries to be everything, and therefore succeeds at nothing.

B000YENUI6|3.0|Critics made quite a buzz out of this picture and while I certainly would not say it is bad, I do confidently say it is overrated. The acting is excellent (by all, even though Naomi Watts's character has little more to do than introduce us to the Russian underworld) and the story is tightly woven into a compact 1 hr and 44 mins. Anna (Watts) is a mid-wife where she has just delivered the child of a 14 yr old girl who dies on the operating table. Among her few personal effects is a diary, which Anna is compelled to translate (it's in Russian) in hopes of finding the newborn's family ties. The diary brings her to a popular restaurant that is owned and operated as a front for the Russian mob. And so begins her journey into London's underworld of immigrant organized crime. Viggo Mortensen is at his best as a lizard-like tattooed driver/cleaner for the Russian mob who shows us just enough human emotion that you can't help but admire him (at least to some degree). I'm not sure too many leading men could handle this roll the way Viggo does. And to top it off he takes on two knife-wielding assailants while in the complete nude. What really makes this scene work is the lack of machismo Mortensen displays while fighting for his life. We sense that he is simply surviving the only way he knows how. A scene that will be talked about for years to come, I guarantee it.     Now with all this praise, you may wonder why I only grant the film an average rating. My reason is because one of the several twists that occur is simply unnecessary. In fact, I took as a cop out. I can't say what twists or why without giving away too much but I just felt the film would have been much more compelling without this reveal. The picture poses as a moral tale but without this turn I feel the story would have transcended the norm of \\"good and bad\\" and instead falls short to cliché.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|\\"Seven samurai\\" (1954) is arguably Akira Kurosawa's best film, and my favourite of those made by that wonderful Japanese director. The plot of this movie is simple enough, but it is developed in a way that enriches it, by adding depth to the characters and making the spectator realize that there is more to them than meets the eye. The rigid cast division that characterized 16th century Japan is shown, and the whole period is brought to life thanks to outstanding cinematography and excellent acting.<br /><br />The story begins when the inhabitants of a very small rural village start discussing what to do about the bandits that attack them from time to time, taking everything of value with them. The farmers have very few resources and hardly any food left, but need to find a solution to their urgent problem or face certain death. An old and wise man proposes an unorthodox idea: to hire wandering samurai in very dire straits to defend the village, paying them only with food.<br /><br />The others farmers deem that suggestion outlandish but, having no other options, decide to give it a try. That is the point when we accompany them in their quest for salvation to a nearby town, where they look for samurai willing to work for almost nothing. Will they get hold of some? And what kind of people will the farmers be able to tempt with such poor offer?<br /><br />The answers to those questions, brought to life thanks to Kurosawa's mastery of the silver screen, end up giving us the opportunity to watch one of those very few movies that truly deserve to be called \\"classics\\". Highly recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B00005JPKE|2.0|I don't object to an alternative point of view on the Battle of Iwo Jima.  American students of the War in the Pacific respect the Japanese soldier's martial spirit in general and the Japanese on Iwo Jima in particular.  What's objectionable is the portrayal of U.S. soldiers casually shooting prisoners of war.  Did such a thing happen in the War in the Pacific?  I'm sure it did, but there's no record of it happening during the battle of Iwo Jima, and it's a distortion to include that scene, which is hypothetical in this case and is given a prominent place in the movie's plot.*  In a small way it's like De Palma's \\"Redacted\\": based on some truth but leaving out so much context that it becomes a de facto lie.  Shame on you Clint!  Shame!<br /><br />*  Do people judge FDR prominently on his treatment of Japanese-Americans during the War?
B000VT6FAO|1.0|it's hard to believe that after all these years of being the frontman of Depeche Mode and working next to the genious of Martin Gore, Dave Gahan would dare to come up with such a low calibre \\"work\\". It's hard for me to fully understand why someone his age and long experience would write such dated and teenage cliches lyrics (unless the lyrics were written by an 18 year old girl who secretly works for Gahan) not to mention that the album's sound it's plain boring and uninteresting, his attempts on creating dark, painful and sexy moments fail, almost all the time. It's like the rest of something that could've been good, but it will never be, it's like something that would've sounded cool 10 years ago!.It's plain self loathing \\"rockstar pose\\", and we need another Dave Gahan album like we need another Nine Inch Nails album or another stupid solo album from Thom Yorke. PEOPLE WAKE UP!, you can't possibly listen to this more than once.Only tasteless people would enjoy a famous name without really questioning inspiration and talent; so Dave if you are reading this; PLEASE NO MORE SOLO ALBUMS, PLEASE!. We all know that without Depeche Mode Dave Gahan would be a coke addict bartender in the lower east side of NYC!
B000FSME1A|5.0|They don't make 'em like they used to, or at least there aren't as many movies these days that are as good as this.  At this point Coppola was still interested in directing epic, groundbreaking movies, and this may have been the last great movie in which Brando appeared.  Martin Sheen did an excellent job too.  Another appealing aspect of the story is the transformation of Joseph Conrad's classic novel, Heart of Darkness, into the modern, southeast Asian wartime setting.  Dennis Hopper also has a cool part.  I understand that in making this movie, Coppola was nearly driven mad by all the setbacks during the filming and the claustraphobia of the jungle setting, adding to the mystery of the whole thing.  Definitely recommended viewing.  Author of [[ASIN:1846940559 Adjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health]].

B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's Wintersong rises to the top of the holiday releases. Like a fresh coating of pure white snow on a crisp morning, Wintersong dazzles. Searching for meaningful artistic expression at this time of year--or any? McLachlan conveys a range of material, from carols to contemporary, with an authenticity that is too rare today. While breathing life into O Little Town Of Bethlehem, McLachlan bends notes and navigates intervals that draw us in. Perhaps the track that will last for many Christmases to come will be her rendering of Joni Mitchell's 1970 composition River. Mitchell seems prophetic in penning lyrics for which the world today is now ready: \\"I'm so hard to handle<br />I'm selfish and I'm sad<br />Now I've gone and lost the best baby<br />That I ever had<br />I wish I had a river I could skate away on...\\"<br />The honesty is enhanced by McLachlan's timbre and enunciation, and makes Wintersong feel balanced and experiential.<br />- Tim Brown

He has two children, a young boy named Ben (Liam Aiken) and a teenage girl named Anna (Jena Malone), with his ex-wife Jackie (Susan Surandon).<br /><br />Jackie does everything she can to undermine the kids relationship with Isabel short of coming out and telling them to hate her. But it is implied. When she finds out that her breast cancer has returned she's worried about the kind of mother she's leaving her kids with. It comes down to deciding if she's going to continue to sabotage Isabel or help her to be the best Stepmom she can be.<br /><br />Surandon is inspirational as the grief stricken mom trying to drink up every blessed moment she has left with her children while leaving them with fond memories of their mother. This film is a roller coaster of emotions: love, jealousy, hate, anger, regret, loss and so much more is portrayed within a few hours.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite dramatic comedy films starring two of my favorite female lead actresses. It makes me laugh and cry every time I see it. This film is so relevant to today's families showing that children and parents don't have to choose sides and that all members can have an enriched involvement if everyone chooses to give a little, accept one another's uniqueness and realize that life is a rocky road no matter who you love. If you haven't seen it yet I highly recommend you do so and if it's been awhile then definitely revisit it.

Can't wait to invest in some of his other solo albums. Wouldn't have known to even check out his solo efforts if not for satellite radio.  Why don't the crappy local stations (Dallas-Ft.

B000Q6GXW2|1.0|Although I am unable to properly judge, this film might be passable as homoerotic pornography properly suited to sticky floored theaters.  As cinema, it is a sad symptom of a juvenile society that embraces cartoons as art and spectacle as narrative.  The Spartans, whose existence depended on helot slavery and the crushing of individualism, are portrayed as freedom's founders and there is no word to describe how the Persians are portrayed.  While dehumanization of the enemy is common in war and war propaganda, never has it been so literal; the Persians appear to be another species.  The Athenians, who may have some rightful claim to giving birth to democracy, are insulted as `boy-lovers,' despite not appearing to spend nearly the amount of time in the gym as the Spartans.  Fundamentally, the battle of Thermopile is an inherently dramatic event that should lend itself well to dramatization.   Nevertheless, the filmmakers chose to pornographize rather than dramatize and we are left with a series of meaningless battle scenes tied together by nothing other than their own increasing absurdity.  More upsetting than the sheer lack of quality in this movie is the reception it has received and what that indicates for our nation.  It has been said that `War is the health of the state;\\" it is distressing when it becomes the health of art and culture.  A civilization can survive the production of many bad movies, yet it is certainly vulnerable to a citizenry that has replaced thought with stimulation.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Okay, so this is a pricey set, and those who more or less would just like to watch the film and the extras on it shouldn't necessarily spring for this deluxe set.  On the other hand, I not only grew up following The Beatles as they released their albums, eagerly anticipating each release, but I am also a fan of film in general.  I love reading film scripts.  I also like looking at memorabilia.  This set contains a whole lot of stuff that greatly appeals to me in addition to the film itself.<br /><br />For one, there is a beautiful reproduction of an original large advertising poster for the film.  This is no cheap quality repro, either.  Secondly, there is a series of original lobby card reproductions - these would be small posters done on cardboard stock to advertise films within the theater lobby.  I think there are a half-dozen here.  If you add up the cost of a quality poster reproduction plus the cost of high quality lobby cards, the cost of this deluxe edition doesn't seem so stratospheric.  Add to that a beautifully bound hard cover book of photographs of the filming of the movie, plus a bound copy of the original screenplay/script -- all of this in a slipcase -- well, this is a high quality release.<br /><br />Again, if you don't want all of this and just want to watch the film, just go for simple DVD -- the price is right.  But for big fans of The Beatles, this film and filmmaking in general, I don't think you'll regret springing for the deluxe edition.
0307387151|2.0|The book is terribly boring. I had heard how amazing it was, and was extremely disappointed when I was reading it. Which is another thing, it took me so long to get through this book, I could have been reading something better. The book had its moments, but it needed more from Cecilia's point of view. She was hardly ever mentioned after the first part! I'm sure some people will enjoy this, but I bet the movie is a lot better, don't bother reading the book, just go see the movie, at least then you'll get to enjoy James McAvoy.

The desk scene with his boss was just so gross that I didn't enjoy the rest of the movie.  Then it got a little too dramatic for a movie that it doesn't know what to be, a comedy or a drama.

B000002I77|5.0|I got to see Billy tour for the 30th anniversary of this album in a small club a few years ago.  It was a great concert!  I had a great time, despite the fact that the only original band member he could retrieve was bassist Lee Sklar.  Even the guitarist did a reasonable job of covering for the late (incredible) Tommy Bolin.  Let's face it: Tommy's phenomenal guitar work is a large part of why this album is a true flagship in the realm of '70s fusion.  Even considering Tommy's work in Zephyr, The James Gang and Deep Purple (not to mention a few solo albums), THIS album is by far THE BEST TOMMY BOLIN GUITAR ALBUM EVER!!!  When I first heard the opening song \\"Quadrant 4\\" during my early introductions to fusion, my first response was, \\"This is supposed to be a JAZZ album???\\"  Quadrant 4 is one of the greatest instrumental rock guitar anthems ever...even if it's supposed to be jazz!!!  Tommy's playing is incredible on 4 songs on this work.  Even the title song and \\"Le Lis\\" which are more jazz tunes with brass and flute (and do not include Tommy) blend fabulously with the fusion songs, making this a wonderful album!  Billy's friend from The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jan Hammer is spectacular on the keyboards, and all band members do fantastic work.  Now, let's get to Billy himself.  A drummer friend of mine had the fortunate chance of seeing The Mahavishnu Orchestra back in the day.  He said he wondered why they set up 2 drum kits for just 1 guy....but he didn't wonder for long!!  He said \\"they NEEDED 2 drum kits to hold the guy down so he wouldn't float away, he was so unbelievable!!  He sounded like there was at least 2 drummers going at the same time....one kit couldn't contain the dude!!\\"  And when I saw him touring for the 30th anniversary of this album a few years ago, I can still heartily agree.  They still need 2 drum sets to hold this dude down!  And, Billy's drumming as well as his surprising gift at writing all the music on this album, is a great part of what makes this album sparkle as the MUST HAVE album it is!!  Get this album for Billy's unbelievable drumming!!!  Get this album for Tommy Bolin's phenomenal guitar work!!  Get this album, because it is truly a flagship for instrumental rock and brilliant '70s jazz fusion!!!
072325804X|5.0|This is the complete collection of Beatrix Potter's books, with all of the original illustrations, in a beautifully bound slip-cased treasure of a volume!  I can't express enough how thoroughly pleased we are with this book. It is very sturdy and yet beautiful and graces the bookshelf! In the format of the little books I'd seen before, many of the stories were not printed.  It was good to become acquainted with the stories we weren't familiar with and read the ones we have always loved. And this wonderful volume will be a treasure for years and years to come, and I am sure read by my grandson's own children someday.
0393327345|5.0|Fight Club<br />I often wake up in the middle of the night screaming. When I can sleep after reading this book, let me explain. Fight club Fight Club where should I start. Okay here it goes I'm going to first start by saying I saw the movie first, in fact the only reason I started reading this book is because of the movie as did most people. This is a really distinctive style of writing hound by Chuck Palahniuk. I love how he sets up situations and expresses the inner feeling of the characters. It reads like the man character talking directly to you.<br /><br />Okay I hate novel. Because there boring. However, Chuck you save the day. One of the reasons why I like this book so much is because he doesn't use the characteristic of other novels for example. Theses words may seem familiar \\"Then jack said to Jim\\"  \\"she said\\", \\"he said\\" things like that. It doesn't follow in that path ,which is why I love this  book. However there are other reasons. For one the story line in excellent (I love to fight Club). The first rule of fight club I cannot talk about fight club............  I've said to much. Bye

1560100842|4.0|This book is a must for all would be animators. I have dabbled with cartoons for years but this book helped me bring them to life, I used the walk sequences as templates and dressed them with my own characters, thus enabling me to focus on the character and not worry about the position of the legs.  There is plenty of help and advice on character building, movement, mouth shaping for speech, hands, expressions, I could go on but I won't.   If there is nothing in this book to help you.........then you should be working for DISNEY.

1594489505|4.0|I read this book today and felt that it really picked up for me, once the author began to explore the relationship between the two women characters. Prior to this discussion or part of the book, I was reading out of sheer hope that the book would hook me in. I had heard so much about this book that maybe that ruined the first few sections for me.<br /><br />The shared bonds (and bondage by Rasheed) that the women had was poignant and powerful. The author did such a great job of conveying the hardships that they faced in and outside the home. This book sheds light on the human condition before, during and after the Taliban. Of course, we know that the Taliban still exists, but that is another story.<br /><br />The ending was believable and gutwrenching. I would definitely recommend this book, but I do think that everyone has now read it!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|First, I am a Tarantino fan. Second, I realize he was trying to mimic a genre. Third, this is an awful movie. A lot of really bad acting, some really awkward dialogue, and no real Tarantino story made me want my money back. The dialogue is terrible in the first 20 minutes. Somewhere between heard it already and yawn. A lot of the dialogue felt forced, like he was just trying too hard, or maybe he drank too much Crystal before writing. Don't get me wrong I like the bootie shots, but Tarantino is about sex, violence AND story. He is a masterful storyteller. Without the storytelling element the genius is gone, and we are left with third rate garbage. Tarantino has a role himself. One of his greatest ambitions is to be an actor, but he was just awful as well. I believe he went to the William Shatner School of acting. No surprise with this, there was a lot of bad acting in this movie. I think what Tarantino missed is a lot the movies he is giving homage to in Death Proof are simply bad movies. If bad acting, bad writing, and bad movies are what Grindhouse is about, he nailed it.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|The price for this was excellent. I compared in the US and in Canada for the best deal and this was it. Unfortunatly the clear case was damaged during shipping and I am not sure how to get another one. If anyone was information on how to do this please let me know.

1569474680|2.0|Little Face by Sophie Hannah has an intriguing premise. Alice Fancourt calls the police in a panic; she insists that her newborn daughter Florence has been kidnapped and a different child put in her place. Her husband David insists that the baby is Florence, but her mother-in-law Vivienne, the family doyenne, isn't so sure. Det. Simon Waterhouse sees no evidence of kidnapping, but he feels drawn to Alice and wants to believe her strange story. Hannah's pacing and dialogue is excellent, and as we start to see the horrors taking place in the Fancourt family home, the tension level ratchets up considerably. David's first wife was murdered, and Alice can't help but wonder if she's next. Vivienne holds her son in her iron grip, and Alice is expected to fall just as neatly in line. The first two thirds of this book was fantastic, but then Hannah pulls the rug out from under the reader. An author walks a delicate line when using a narrator to deceive the reader. Some have pulled it off with aplomb: Agatha Christie and Louis Bayard come to mind. Unfortunately, Hannah isn't talented enough to succeed in her ploy, and after reading, I felt manipulated and used, much like poor Det. Waterhouse. Skip this book; don't waste your time.
140120306X|5.0|Don't expect a narrative like the first two volumes.  Moore and O'Neill create a universe where the past incarnations of the League have had an impact on the world as great as the Murray group we know and love.  But to do that Moore uses different media than the \\"traditional\\" graphic novel format.  There are type written reports, English history comic strips, an unearthed portion of uncompleted Shakespearian play, a sequel to Fanny Hill (on parchment type paper) and many other genres.  It becomes obvious that Moore would have included a vinyl record if he could (though it is rumoured that this will come with the Absolute version) but the 3-D section works a treat.  The Kerouac inspired story (Sal Paradyse) is extremely heavy going but Moore is simply staying true to the way he wishes to present the vision he has.  I know some will be disappointed because of the lack of a similar narrative to the first two volumes but they should revel in a true genius like Moore cutting loose in his own inimitable fashion.  It whets the appetite for Volume 3.

B000YABYLA|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  First, Ellen Page deserves an Oscar nomination for her brilliant performance.  She is a breath of fresh air, almost single handedly carrying this film from start to finish, appearing in almost every scene.  She plays Juno, a high school misfit who comes from your \\"average\\" dysfunctional family -- mom left when she was young, father remarries and has another daughter.  Juno and Paul (Michael Cera) have sex and she gets pregnant.  At first she contemplates abortion, but instead decides to give the baby up for adoption.  She finds a yuppie couple, played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, looking to adopt since the wife is unable to have a child.  Both Garner and Bateman gives strong supporting performances.<br /><br />Sure, the plot doesn't sound like much, but the plot isn't what makes this movie special.  The screenplay and writing are superb and Page is a revelation.  At times, I was worried that the movie would turn sentimental but it never does.  And alternatively, the movie never gets too full or smart for itself -- coming close but never quite crossing the line.  And all the performances are top notch -- with J.K Simmons and Alison Janney wonderful as Juno's father and stepmother respectively.<br /><br />If you like well-written and well-acted movies, be sure to see Juno, it won't disappoint.  This was well worth the $9.75 ticket.  At the least, you'll certainly be witnessing a breakout performance by a future star in Ellen Page.

6304308469|5.0|It is already a moving experience to see a 1932 movie with sound in black and white and added to that, the storyline is so rich in context, that  complex and interacting characters for actors and actresses (5 together) are compelling but yet, simply put.<br /><br />Reflections of life in the Grand Hotel, there are many graphical implications (roulette hotel door), great conversations (the bookeeper and his boss), starry stage (elevators and hotel rooms) and exquisite costume (the ballet dancer and baron). This is a real classic movie for everyone who loves movie as its very own nature.<br /><br />Greta Garbo is somewhat outshined by Joan Crawford but still she emanates a sense of untounchable and distant aura.  There are many to be told both in this movie and for this movie.  I am not goint to the academics and details.  Just buy this movie and have a go and you'll know how movie is a form of art.

B0000E1ALR|5.0|I am neither a hardcore fan nor a casual listener.  I like a lot of artists in the singer-songwriter vein.  Having said that, I find Springsteen's music more exciting, emotional and poignant than most artists.  I gave the CD package 5 stars because of the quality of the  artistry AND I feel it represents his career well.    Hardcore fans might disagree that it leaves out a lot of good songs.  I agree.  His albums tended to have more than a few great songs which   sound out of context on a compilation.  However, it would seem that this CD package might be aimed at those who, like myself, did not buy every Springsteen release through the years, but, perhaps, had one or more of his truly great albums such as Born to Run, Darkness or The Wild...     His carreer has been a long one.  During that time (1973 to the present) his style, focus and sound have gone through changes and then sometimes they fall back to earlier days.  My point here is that a package such as this will do a great service for those who want to become familar with Springsteen material outside of his more well-known releases without (or perhaps, before) purchasing his other releases.    Another plus for all fans (especially newbies) is that the track order is chronological, making it easy to see where he was coming from and where he has gone.      The first two CD's are all from his previously released albums.  The third CD is a bonus.  It collects out-takes, B-sides and live cuts.  Most of it sounds just as good as the first two CD's and its fun to listen to.
0765318741|4.0|OK.  I admit it.  I purchased this book because I saw the movie previews.  I'm a big Will Smith fan and am excited about the movie, but I always prefer to read the book before the movie so I can compare.  I was hesitant to purchase the book with the movie cover on it, only because...well...I'm just that way.  But trust me, the story does not disappoint.<br /><br />Considering the fact that the story was written in 1954, it was a truly amazing concept for it's time, although if you place this book in history, it was written within recent memory of the end of World War II and at the beginning of the Cold War.  Human extinction from biological warfare or nuclear attack was real and fresh in everyone's minds at that time.  But, especially interesting to me was the tweak on vampirism being caused by some pandemic outbreak.  With recent news about SARS and the Bird Flu, the fear of a massive human extinction is as real today as it was in 1958.<br /><br />However, don't fall into the trap that this is a story of vampires alone.  It is more of a story about the human will to survive, the need to be with others of our kind or to share the monotony of living with something (the plot line where Neville is trying to win the affection of a surviving dog is particularly heart-wrenching), and what happens when the persecutor becomes the persecuted.  Without ruining the story, I will say that the plot twist is especially surprising and effective and very thought provoking.  This short story will have you thinking about it for days afterwards!<br /><br />Now, why did I give this book 4 stars instead of 5?  The only reason:  This edition is a compilation of short stories by Richard Matheson, the first of which is I Am Legend.  This fact is not noted ANYWHERE on the book covers, binding, title page, etc.  I was very confused when I thought I was entering a new chapter of the book and realizing that it had nothing to do with the previous.  However, I have found the other stories just as interesting as the first and recommend that you read them all!  You can definitely see where modern horror novelists (ie, Stephen King) were influenced by Matheson's works.  In fact, a few of the stories I have found creepier than Mr. King's works..and some of these were stories written over 50 years ago!  In particular, check out Prey, Witch War, and Dance of the Dead.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how Hollywood handles this story.  I can already tell by the movie previews that it is not completely faithful to the book in many ways (the main character description, the dog, the setting in NYC instead of Southern California) and I will say that the book ending is not your typical Hollywood ending.  I guess I'll just have to pay my $9 and see! Regardless of how Hollywood treats the story, I will give it credit for bringing attention to a short story I would have never found on my own but am so glad it is now a part of my collection.st and recommend that you read them all!

B00064WSNM|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - The result of a bombastic fussion; the complex, open minded and cultural style of Larks' Tongues In Aspic, with the start of the supreme dark and chaotic/hardest music King Crimson later totally acquired, Starless And Bible Black comes as the second album for King Crimson's second generation. The album is indeed a master piece, just because the music displays a wide, surreal and abstract musicianship but less explorative/comprehensive, its more melodic but yet experimental, gets a more classical aura but still with the most beautiful sense of progressive rock, and Starless And Bible Black is unique in their specific discography because its one of their best structured albums, the technical details are pure and capturing, and the production is flawless.<br /><br />\\"The Great Deceiver\\" is the most bombastic, insane piece in the album, it gets their quirky sense of humor in a chaotic way, one of their bests; \\"Lament\\" is a softer piece but its dramatic, compelling atmosphere is delicate and fabulous; \\"The Night Watch\\" is probably the most classsically-inflicted piece in the album, possessing an incredible poetic theme with a castle-like scenary, the piece may be the most complex and Larks Tongues In Aspic-inspired in the album but borders from being overproduced; \\"Trio\\" is one of their most famous, a violin centered piece very unique in its form, while \\"Fracture\\" is another very famous, timeless classic, specially because its one of their instrumentals wich sounds really structured and well played, more comprehensive too, but if you notice carefully, this piece was the start of King Crimson's heavy brutality strictly kept in Red and from  THRAK to The Power To Believe, the first guitar chords are very recognizable in their later works, the song is even kind of reprised in The ConstruKction Of Light in the song \\"FraKctured\\". In conclussion, this is argueably the best album from King Crimson's second generation, its certainly very well played (John Wetton's bass licks are delightful), and less explorative but more imaginative and structured than Larks' Tongues In Aspic, and much better supported, comprehensible but less brutal than Red, I strongly recommend this album for any casual listener and progressive rock lovers.ss licks are delightful), and less explorative but more imaginative and structured than Larks' Tongues In Aspic, and much better supported, comprehensible but less brutal than Red, I strongly recommend this album for any casual listener and progressive rock lovers.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|This film was stylistically riveting for the first 30 minutes or so ... but after I got used to the groovy retro-style of filming (weird 70s colors, familiar t.v.-cop-show angles), I started looking around for a plot.  I found none.  I started looking for characters I cared about.  Again, I found none.  The best moment was when Rose \\"Homewrecker\\" McGowan got smushed against the windshield.  Downhill from there.  Wait for it to come on HBO so you won't feel bad about spending your money.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - One of King Crimson most notorious and long lasting masterpieces, Red resulted in a much darker, heavy and brutal style than their previous releases, this is the darkest side of progressive rock. Even when the band was reduced to a trio, its happy to notice many past members collaborating in the album, such as David Cross, Mel Collins and Ian McDonald, who was about to rejoin the band just after they broke up even before the release of Red, without any kind of support or live material. The music displayed is indeed one of the heaviest, bordering heavy metal but staying very focused in its concept, this is album is the perfect and awaited emotional burst King Crimson needed to their careers, delivering it in a quirky, freaked-out but yet cerebral way, although resulting less structured, (in my opinion) it turns out to be their most passionate release.<br /><br />The heavy, infectious title track \\"Red\\" turns out to be extremely similar with \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic Part Two\\", \\"Fallen Angel\\" is maybe the only song in the album to keep certain melodic touches, still profoundly obscure, its religious objectiveness makes me think in nothing more but a dark, gothic cathedral atmosphere. The fast paced, dreamy \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" results hipnotic, \\"Providence\\" stays as a more delicate but very experimental instrumental, while the closing \\"Starless\\" is arguealby the best song they've ever written, as a matter of fact, this song reflect the soul of King Crimson, being dark and brutal, experimental in its passages, poetic and chaotic, and with a perfect structure lasting 12 minutes, its a perfect progressive rock song.<br /><br />The legendary Red is the less structured and less suported from the band, and the technical details result very uneven, but its emotional outburst of passion and its very unique obscure surroundings is what made this album unique in the anals of history even without any type of support, behind their classic In The Court Of The Crimson King and the flawless Starless And Bible Black, this album results as their third greatest work.<br /><br />The remastered version comes with good sound quality though in this one specifically could've been better, some diary pictures (as always) and lyrics.nd the flawless Starless And Bible Black, this album results as their third greatest work.

0307387151|3.0|This book has 4 parts, and the only reason it gets three stars (as opposed to 1) is because of part 1. Parts 2 and 3 are fluff, added for melodramatic effect, and are a painful attempt at making this a war epic. Part 4 is cleverly written, although the 80th birthday party is completely cheesy.     I actually enjoyed the author's writing style. Although slightly laborious, I liked his detailed descriptions of feelings, feelings about feelings, the countryside, hot summer days, people and events. I empathized with the characters (only in part 1), and even got the part about atonement (in part 4). I thought that the ending, where Arabella could be any of the female characters in the book was very clever.   **** WARNING - giving away some of the plot - do not read further, if you haven't read the book ****  I like that there was no reconciliation between the sisters. It makes it more real. However, Robbie's and Cecilia's premature deaths makes their love, and therefore the book, seem pointless - almost like \\"all that for nothing\\" or \\"so many years for two months together\\". Most of their relationship is imagined or based on wistful memories and letters. It may have been a better book if they had moved away and started a new life, with some sort of character development and some sort of description of their lives together in addition to the brief glimpse through Briony's eyes.    All in all, a good read, but not brilliant, which is sad, because it has all the potential to be so. Oh ya, and the great \\"mystery\\" was as transparent as a window right at the moment it happened.
0440238609|5.0|There is no doubt that Mr. Pullman is a outstanding writer.  Books like these could only be crafted by a master.  They are the kind of books you can't put down because you've just got to see what happens next.      I wanted to read these books after the comments in the newspaper about Mr. Pullman advocating atheism in the movie adaptation of the first of the three books, \\"The Golden Compass.\\"  I did not see anything to suggest that in the movie at all, but of course the Catholic Church forbade their members to see it, and others protested, most likely without even seeing it or knowing what it was about.  I feel sorry for people whose minds are closed and who mindlessly obey authority without question.  That is what these books are about.  I find it hard to reconcile myself with the idea that we are in the 21st century with so many people like this around.  As a matter of fact, if you look back at science fiction stories and movies of 50, 40, 30 even 20 years ago you will see that most of the writers expected us to be far more advanced in every way than we are in the 21st century, unless you want to call human robots an advancement.

B000R5N1MC|5.0|Having seen this movie probably more time and in more different formats than most people, I thought it was time I write a few words about this masterpiece of filmmaking. Truly, I wasn't boasting with my assertion that I've seen this movie as much as I have (I watch this movie almost once a week and have done so for almost 10 years). I own several, still unopened, VHS tapes that for a large part of the nineties I did my best at collecting. I own the Japanese Laserdisc version, a rare bootleg version that was distributed over the internet a handful of years ago that has the narration selectively placed back into the Director's Cut version of the film, not called the Esper Version as some would want to label it, the Director's Cut and now the HD version of the Final Cut. That makes 5, but 6 if you count the Workprint version that comes with this box set. So, I would say that's one more than most.<br /><br />Blade Runner first and foremost, is probably the greatest film ever made, from beginning to end and in all of its variations. A bold statement when the film doesn't even rank in the top 10 in the American Film Institute or on IMDb. Spots #97 and #104 respectively (ahem). But as these kind of lists are subjective and truly under the control of mere mortals and their own strange whims, and I take no offense that so many so-called aficionados have over-looked this film for so long. Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that `Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film.<br /><br />For years, Blade Runner was divided into two different camps, or rather four and they are: Those that preferred the narration and those that did not and the other camp was those that thought Deckard was a Replicant and those that thought he was either human or felt it was left ambiguous. Ridley Scott has very gracefully over the years, given homage to these thoughts and made many statements that most readers are aware of, chiefly - that Deckard was a Replicant. Unfortunately, due to the studios fingering with the film during post-production, Warner Brothers had the right to trim anything after the 120 min mark, and thus butchering the nuance of the film and leaving several things vague and forcing Scott to tack on the Happy ending and the narration - because as we all know ... we're all just too stupid to get it.<br /><br />The new and most refreshing part of the new argument, evinced in the 210 (wow!) min documentary `Dangerous Days' is that Scott gives equal time to those that enjoyed the film with the narration, with Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) in the forefront, with his very candid telling of how Blade Runner changed his life and launched him down the road into filmmaking. We also get to hear a very lucid and warm retelling from Harrison Ford of the nightmare that he not only endured making the movie but the further commitment of having to do the Voice Over narration months later, which ended up having its own strange story as well.<br /><br />So, now with 5 versions available in this box set, you get to see Blade Runner in every single angle imaginable and it is engrossing every time. Ebert also said in the Nineties that the re-release of the movie for the Director's Cut gives you yet another version of the film, but fails to handle the main problems that were so apparent the first time around. As the film has changed Ebert has gone from student flippancy to utmost respect and enjoyment. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time if you're interested.<br /><br />There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Blade Runner is probably the high water mark of all films and will probably stay that way for quite some time. Internet voting puts the film as the 4th greatest movie of all time, according to AFI's own user polls - so that really puts perspective on AFI's and IMDb's so-called Final Lists.<br /><br />On a final note, when people watch this film, a lot of people come away with a strange feeling of familiarity regarding the content, the story and the character of Rick Deckard the protagonist, the Detective, the Blade Runner. You should know that Philip K. Dick was an incredibly huge fan of Raymond Chandler and absorbed every one of his stories on a personal level. Hampton Fancher, the screenwriter was privy to this when he penned the screenplay while making the adaptation for `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and did his best to not only pay homage to this for Dick but for Chandler as well. Movies like `The Big Sleep' really bring it home and make it evident to the viewer.

B0011EP0S6|5.0|I can't help but be annoyed that the first person who reviewed this movie gave it one star and said they were waiting for them to get to the point.  Well, the \\"point\\" of the movie is the music.  Duh.  And let me tell you, this is some of the best music I've heard, and coupled with the emotions of the characters, it's truly moving.  I watched this movie with my mom, stepdad, and husband and we were all blown away, despite our different tastes in music.  This movie will leave you wanting to hear the songs over and over again.  I literally watched the movie three times in a row because I thought that highly of it.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I've already purchased the sound track and DVD.  This is the only DVD I've ever purchased.
075640407X|5.0|My family is tired of hearing about this book.<br />I read it with increasing frenzy, falling deeper and deeper into a world of tired old heroes and the names that they were called, a world where myth is tangible, where magic is an art and a science, where music is everything. When I finished, I spoke of it with continuous praise and waited eagerly for the second day of the Kingkiller Chronicles.<br /><br />\\"Kvothe the Arcane\\", \\"Kvothe the Bloodless\\"... these are the names he lived.  Each has a story, each is part of the evolution of a character refreshingly textured, detailed, and moving. Rothfuss has entered the halls of the great ones of fantasy, creating a world, a man, a story, all rich with the tangibility and pageantry we have experienced in Rowling's Harry Potter series. Kvothe was expelled from the Arcanum at a younger age than most are accepted. He burned down a town, and saved it. He survived a massacre by the daemons Chandrian. He is a legend. And currently an innkeeper.<br /><br />Buy the book, my friend. It's worth it.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Let me first start by saying that I liked old nightwish, the heavier stuff like planet hell and romanticide in particular. I am a fan of all types of rock music espescially heavy guitar driven music. To me Dark Passion Play is a masterpiece. I define a masterpiece as an album that every song is great, has great diversity in tracks and takes you through a variety of emotions. A few examples of what I think are some of the masterpieces in rock, Powerslave by Iron Maiden, Metallica's Master of Puppets, The Joshua Tree by U2, TNT's Intuition, Appetite For Destruction by Guns and Roses and Creed's My own prison.             This nightwish release is all of that and more. The bottom line is the quality of the songs. I can't get this out of my player every time I take it out and listen to a few songs from someone else I want to put this back in. It really took me by surprise because the first time I listened to it, it was just pretty good. It seems to get better with every listen. I have read all of the negative reviews and most of them sound like the hardcore fans who just like Tarja's voice. In my mind annette's is more accessable to a larger audience, which I think is a good thing. What I have always liked about the whole gothic genre is playing the sweet sounds of a female voice against heavy and aggressive music. She does have power at times but it is not over done.              All in all I would give this 10 stars if I could. Well done.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is a wonderful family movie.  I did have trouble playing the disk on one of my DVD players.  It said something was wrong with the disk.  I think it was copy protection.  It played on my computer and the other player.
0440238609|1.0|This book is too dark for small children.  I would suggest that parents read a head of time, to know when to stop reading it to your children.  I found the material disturbing.  Nothing like what I would expect from a fantasy book geared towards children.  This author has a long way to go, to be in the company of other great fantasy authors- C.S. Lewis, etc.  Save your money and skip these books!
0743298020|4.0|The Thirteenth Tale pulled me in almost from page one.  There is a gaping hole in the otherwise satisfying ending, but Setterfield sells it, flaw and all.  I didn't have the \\"hey-wait-a-minute\\" moment until after I had completely finished it.    Made me want to go back and reread Jane Eyre as well!
B000SM7QUC|3.0|No doubt, anyone who buys this is buying this for Life Is Beautiful. However, aside from a few shining moments, there are no other songs that measure up to it at all.<br /><br />I get that this CD is the journey of an addict's road to recovery. I got that. And yes, it's told quite superbly in most cases, but a story isn't going to make a CD great. In the end, the actual songs are the glue between Nikki Sixx's spoken word interludes. Heck, the only good interlude-esque part on here is when Nikki is going day by day saying what's happening as the music--and his voice--gets more and more intense. Past that, I skip them. Take X-mas In Hell for example, you can tell he's just reading from a script, it doesn't sound organic at all. That happens throughout The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack time and again.<br /><br />As for the songs, they're okay. The music is almost always great, it's clear Nikki is still great at crafting a terrific riff. I think the lyrics are what drag down what could end up being a good song. Pray For Me is a prime example. The lyrics are choppy, and kinda forced in without really fitting. However, despite its flaws, there are a couple brilliantly realized tracks. Van Nuys will be an instant hit with anyone that hears this thanks to the chorus. Of course Life Is Beautiful is great. Girl With The Golden Eyes is great thanks to the guitar riffs, vocals, and the afforementioned spoken word day-by-day account from Sixx. And finally, Courtesy Call is just a great rock song that is sure to grab you upon first listen.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Van Nuys, Life Is Beautiful, Girl With Golden Eyes, and Courtesy Call. In essence, The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack is really nothing special. Once you get past the 'you can do it' message and the few good songs included, there's nothing fulfilling to this. This will no doubt be one of those CDs that sits on your shelf for long periods until you get an urge to go back and listen to it. Judge for yourself though.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|The remastered Joshua Tree is better than it was when the album first came out. The new songs are awesome!
B0011EP0S6|5.0|Fantasic, beautiful movie with great music.  If you are looking for automatic weapons, this movie is not for you.  This movie is about music and relationships.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|There's an interesting and important story somewhere out there but this is not it.  I haven't seen such stilted acting in a long time and a more convoluted story than this one.  Now, I can do complex movies, such as Syriana, but this one takes the cake.
B0000263JN|5.0|I have much less to say than the two reviews below, which are both appropriate homages to this particular recording. Just that I love this album, and it is so great to see it's available again in CD, in any, form.  As, apparently, pretty much all of the ISB's catalog is these days.  I went looking for CDs of some of their albums maybe ten years ago, and there weren't much out there.  I still bring out my vinyl every so often to remind myself what all THAT was about.  I still find each album, but particularly this one, full of pleasure from another season.
B000003TAB|1.0|Nothing else to say, the only good cd from this band is MTV unplugged.  The music of Nirvana is far superior in acoustic version in my opinion.
B000W746GK|5.0|I have never had any interest to read a Harry Potter book, but for some reason I really enjoy the movies. I guess because they are different and have something new to offer other than the usual Hollywood \\"Blow everything up and show off my heaving pecs\\" movie.<br /><br />I really liked the witch soccer game, the ghost in the bathroom, the scenery and sets. I liked the giant snake at the end and the way Harry killed it. How the elf got his freedom at the end of the movie was pretty funny.<br /><br />I was a little confused with the whole \\"I am a memory and my diary holds my rememberances and I need this sacrifice to become real again\\", but I went along with it. I don't take movies like this so seriously that I cannot enjoy them.
B000003TAR|1.0|If he was he didn't show it in his music, poor musical structure, bad lyrics, ugly sound.  Nothing interesting in this cd.   If you are very frustrated about society and you feel rejected, try to get some help with a professionnal.  This music won't lift you up !

B0000048YO|5.0|Watch and learn!  This is what sexy was before women lost all their clothes.  Rita Hayworth is smoldering.  She dances in this dress that has a slit up one leg and it is so amazing.  Oh, she does a striptease....and takes off a single glove.  Very cool.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|When I first downloaded Minutes to Midnight, I was shocked, and not in a good way. I almost cried, hearing another one of my favorite bands go pop/soft. I refused to listen to it for months, until I decided to give it a second shot.     Granted it's absolutely nothing like Hybrid Theory or Meteora, it's still Linkin Park. They've just grown up, and even if you're horrified by the new album - it'll probably grow on you a little.     If I would have reviewed this album the night I downloaded it, I would have given one star. Now it's closer to 4.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I had this CD in my car player for six months and listened to it every day.  I love it!  I still listen to it often.  Rough and hard but not in a grating annoying way.  Skillful music and lyrics.  Buy it and rock out!!

0812550706|5.0|I read this book 12 years ago and loved it.  I hate sci-fi as a rule, but this book is great.  It's about a kid who does amazing things and that is probably why I liked it as a kid.  Lots of imagination for the reader.

B000NIVJEU|1.0|I HATED THIS MOVIE!<br />The screenplay and dialog were atrocious.<br />The visual effects were sub-standard.<br />It was pretentious as hell.<br />The plot was beyond predictable and not developed at all.<br />The climax, which the director built up for an hour, was a disappointing 60-seccond piece of trash.<br />If you have not seen this movie, don't.<br />This is seriously the only movie I have ever considered asking for my money back after seeing.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I watched this movie with my wife and three-year-old daughter.  All three of us enjoyed the movie.  It is witty and has a great pace.  I thought Meet the Robinsons was difficult to follow because of the fast-tempo slapstick, but Ratatouille was perfect.<br /><br />The film's message was simple:  Anyone can be anything they want.  Even a rat can be a chef.  The characters are engaging.  The setting is gorgeously rendered, and the plot is wonderfully enchanting.  Gone is the preachy and patronizing nature of some cartoons.  Ratatouille is a 5 star family film!
B000YMBBH0|5.0|An excellent value for three HD movies.  We watched all 3 in one weekend and it was better than being at the movies.  I highly recommend this to all action movie lovers with HD.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Excellent performance from Gilmour with the added talents of David Bowie, David Crosby, Graham Nash, and Steven Stills.  Richard Wright is back with David with a most impressive showing.
B000286RZM|4.0|In 2004, fans of John Frusciante were spoilt with six albums in six months. For those who had preconceptions that they would all be the same, they could not be more wrong.   The ball started rolling in June 2004, with `The Will to Death'.  When I first found out the title for this album, like any other, I began to think of what this album would sound like.  Due to the word `Death' I thought it would be metal/rock or at least on the heavy side.  I could not have been more wrong...    `The Will to Death' is a very warm, laid back album.  It's almost as if Frusciante has accepted he is going die and is happy to talk about the subject which is really the concept of the album.  However, until the time comes he wants to live life to the full and not worry about what eventually will happen.  For those expecting an album similar to `Shadows collide with People' I think will be disappointed.  Although equally as accessible to the listener; the tracks are more designed as album tracks.  As oppose to `Shadows' where the tracks are more like a collection of singles with a few instrumentals.    My favourite song on the album is the last, entitled `The Will to Death'.  As an album closer I feel it delivers in summing up the concept behind the album nicely.  The gentle plucks of his acoustic guitar, mixed with a fine electric guitar, creating a warm, majestic melody.  The lyrics are ones spoken straight from the heart; oozing sincerity and honesty.   Such as `The Will To Death is what keeps me alive, It's one step away'.  I think this lyric sums up best what the album is about and the way it's delivered with such delicacy and at a pitch only few can pull off.      One of the things which stands out about Frusciante's song writing on the album and across all his albums, in his post druggie era; is the intros to each song.  Each song has its own unique style of entry which, in my opinion, can be distinguished from any other song by anyone.  I often hear songs on the radio and thinkthey are one song, but they are actually another. I really do feel John pays particular attention to this to make his songs unique and instantly recognisable.  I think the main reason for this is because of his superior knowledge of the guitar and his endless imagination to go with it.  The stand out intros on this album are from `An Exercise', `Helical' and `Far Away'.    The structure and delivery of all the songs on `TWTD' have a simple, logical feel to them. Almost as if they were so obvious, my mind ponders as to why they were not thought of before.  Personally I think it's because simplicity is difficult to achieve.  I am not a guitarist but when I try and play the guitar randomly, it's easy to make stuff complex because that's what playing randomly is to me.  But to actually make things sound simple requires a certain level of skill because what sounds simple is often harder to construct than it seems.    Although not his best, this is still definitely up there and worth a listen as Frusciante takes another turn in his never ending musical journey.  This is undeniably an album full of album tracks rather than `Shadows Collide with People' which was more of an album full of singles with a few instrumentals.  At the time of purchase it was the first of six to be released in a period of six months and he certainly left this fan eager for the imminent releases with this warm, laid back record.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|You buy, a lot of old pics, tickets, memorabilia, a offer for a poster, mini--posters, a wonderful t-shirt, and the box.. So big and duty. Please buy this if you can... if you are a real.. REAL FAN, buy it.. if you dont, dont buy anything and go to your home to wait to see Led Zeppelin on tv hahaha. THE BESTTTT!!!
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini's \\"The Kite Runner\\" is one of my favorite books of the last 5 years, and his follow-up does not disappoint. \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" tells the story of Mariam and Laila, two Afghani women of different generations whose lives intersect in the midst of war. While set against the backdrop of a nation's struggles, the novel does a beautiful job of exploring the more personal but equally epic themes of love, parenthood, hope, despair, abuse, and - most importantly - friendship between the two women.     I always find it interesting to see how male authors write about the inner lives of women. Considering Mr. Hosseini's first novel was a fantastic story of friendship between two boys and the men that they became, his depiction of Mariam and Laila, both as girls and women, is layered and rich. This is a really great book.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Mas que un concierto, un concepto musical que nos muestra esa base de pink floyd en un exponencial ensayo en las miticas ruinas de pompeya, donde cada uno nos lleva a una experiencia propia, Waters y sus gritos, Gilmour y el Slide de su guitarra que mas agudo no puede, el estruendo de la bateria y las notas del piano nos llevan al Vesuvio y nos perdemos en cada tema. Un dvd que de verdad hay que tenerlo por ley y por cultura. The Best!
1591841666|5.0|This concise piece about not mulling over quitting is a great focusing tool for young professionals looking to make and difference in what they enjoying doing, and succeed at the same time.  Defining the reasons for quitting and quitting early is a fresh new perspective.  It is valuable, especially if the job you have or the task you're doing is just NOT WORTH it.  Read this book if you are at a career crossroad.  Thanks Seth.
B00006LLLN|4.0|As a rule, I basically hate country music, but I LOVE Allison Krauss and US!   It's definately her voice...crisp and clear and lacking that \\"twang\\" and \\"nasality\\" of most country singers.  I am also a big Celtic music fan and I can hear the similarities between the two.  The instrumentals are rich and deep and tie it all together.    My friend introduced me to AKUS a month ago....now I'm addicted!  There is just so much crap out there now....this definately is NOT!
B00006I53S|5.0|This is a fantastic all day, walk around lens.  Outstanding optics, very quiet USM motor, and close focusing ability make this an excellent choice for the new, or established digital photographer.  Forget the 18-55 EFS lens that comes with some packages, as it's quality is poor compared to this lens.  If I were to sell all of my lenses, this would be the one I would keep.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|this is my all time favorite movie. the best. great acting. watched it 3 times in one day.
B000XA5K48|3.0|Other than the absolutely stunning and underutilized Monica Bellucci this movie is not worth seeing at all.     Bad action movie.     An okay love scene.     3 stars for giving a role to Monica Bellucci Only.
158270208X|5.0|This Gratitude Journal is a *great* way to introduce engaged couples to the Law of Attraction -- along with The Secret -- as a *way* better gift for the couple's future than a blender. I've often suggested to my brides and grooms that they make a practice of gratitude journaling as a way to keep their perspective during the stressful wedding-planning months, and it's a practice I hope couples will share throughout their marriages.

0553582461|5.0|This was by far the best book in the series. This is the great conclusion of the 6 book series of the Tale of Fitz. I, myself, was left a little disillusioned after Assasin's Quest and almost didn't push on. I decided ultimately to skip the Liveship Series and head right back for more of Fitz, 15 years later in The Tawny Man Series. I find this series title to be misleading for Fitz is again the First Person Narrative and main character. For this reason, alone, did I return to the tale. And I was not dissapointed.  It was clear from the beginning of the Tawny Man Series that Robin Hobbs had stepped it up as an author.  She had broadened her scope, and steadied her rythym. And, finally, she learned how to conclude her books.  That was my biggest problem with the First Farseer Series, hasty unfullfilling endings.  And not only did she clean up that little habit, she greatly increased her storytelling in general. I enjoyed the Tawny Man Series thoroughly.  I must say that you do have to read, at least, The Farseer Series. It's not optional like the Liveship Traders Series.   This book was filled with colorful new characters, and a relaxed suspense that dances throughout the whole book.  Bravo, to Robin Hobb, she is like a fighter that instead of coasting through the latter rounds on a way to a victory she really stepped it up, saving her best for last and delivering a great Fantasy Knockout.
B000W4KT64|4.0|This is a good remake of the original.  John Travolta is hilarious.  The whole cast did a great job!
B000002JSP|5.0|In all of Led Zeppelin's albums, there are tracks that are not just hard rock. Eg, 'Down By The Seaside' on 'Physical Graffiti', is a song which some fans sneer at, and others sometimes dislike to hear Led Zeppelin go into other areas. Personally, Led Zeppelin were the band who, for me, got me not just listening to rock, but kick started an interest in blues, acoustic and later jazz music. This album truely shows that Led really did go into lots of areas, and is a must for real fans of Zeppelin, who can dip into all of the musical landscapes they covered    The album is a showcase to the talent of John Paul Jones, who took the majority of songwriting for a change, where as on previous albums this role was Jimmy Page's. This instantly gives the album a more different sound, as it is dominated by Jones' synth. and piano. Not that the guitar isn't brilliant, though. Jones on this album takes the band to Rio with a fantastic samba section on 'Fool In The Rain', touches deeply with Plant's affectionate lyrics giving heartfelt touch on 'All Of My Love', and travel to Texas with the light-hearted 'Hot Dog'. The main rock stomp, which in true Zeppelin style is different to a lot of other rock bands, adding woven styled sounds and a guitar that takes you away only the way that Jimmy Page can, 'In The Evening' is another classic, and the other tracks, which dip into Blues and add more synth. make this album what it is: an album only a truely talented band could make, which is different, and takes the listener somewhere else. Sure, a lot of fans call it a bit of downer, and it can be critised, but they don't seem to want to let the band go anywhere different, and dislike the idea of an artist challenging the listener    For the true Led Zeppelin fan: Dare to listen to more than just the earlier albums
B00003CXXP|3.0|In a future where the polar icecaps have melted and the resultant swells have taken many of the world's most prosperous cities with them, robots have become an integral part of society.     Cybertronics of New Jersey has created a new model 'Mecha' that can serve human beings in all daily capacities. Their creator describes the model as a 'sensory toy'. He proposes they build a robot who can love. He wants to build a child robot based on neural networks who'd fulfill the dreams of the world's childless couples--and of course, increase the company's bottom line as well.     The moral question is--if a robot could love a human, what responsibility would the person have to the robot?     After 5 years, the Swintons still mourn the tragic loss of their son. Henry Swinton (Sam Roberts), who works for Cybertronics, is approved for the first trial of the child-Mecha. David (Haley Joel Osment) comes home as a 'surprise' for Monica (Frances O'Connor). Henry's had to sign a pretty extensive release to obtain David for the family.  There are no takebacks--if they don't want David, he will be destroyed.     Initially, this is not a pleasant surprise for the grieving mother. David's untrained adoration is creepy at best. He follows her everywhere, his programming forcing a bond she does not feel.      Soon Henry, who spends little or no time with the child, sees David as a 'toy' and Monica, who has allowed the Mecha child to call her 'Mommy,' sees him as a 'gift.'    Then a miracle happens, Martin Swinton (Jake Thomas) is returned to the family.      Sibling rivalry, with all the stew of competition, comes into play--and of course, David doesn't fit into his human family.  Monica abandons him in the country like an unloved puppy and David quests to find how to become a 'real boy.'      \\"AI\\" explores what makes a person human--and frankly 'human' is not so pretty in this case. This future world has created gigolos to pander to women's fantasies, Flesh Faires (A Celebration of Life) which are the equivalent of 'bread and circuses' in this world--and a great way to dispose of outmoded Mechas.     \\"AI\\" is long to have been borne out of a short story (Brian Aldiss' \\"Supertoys last all Summer Long\\").  At 1:45, there are portions that really drag.  Still, it's an excellent vehicle for Haley Joel Osment, who really impressed me in \\"Pay it Forward.\\" Have a tissue or two ready for the end--it's definitely sad.
B000002H98|4.0|Review no. 1195. Don't believe I've ever covered a disc on Amazon with THIS many other reviews. I don't CARE what any other old school Metallica fans, followers, die-hards, etc. think about this CD. I've always liked it from day one. Tracks I just might never grow tired of hearing are \\"Sad But True\\", \\"The Unforgiven\\", the power-house rocker \\"Wherever I Shall Roam\\", \\"Of Wolf And Man\\" and \\"The Struggle Within\\". As many of times as I've listened to this disc, I never once felt it was all THAT commercial. Maybe a little, but still good enough to appeal to fans from the beginning. I start listening to Metallica right after the release of 'Ride The Lightning'. Obviously recommended.
0553565915|5.0|I read this book many, many years ago and the hope I received from this book is still with me today.<br /><br />Why?  Well, I am not saying that a person has to believe every word written in this book, but certain portions are undeniably true to me.<br /><br />My father, who I trust implicitly, once died during an operation.  The doctors were able to bring him back, but in that short amount of time he saw the light and the colors of indescribable beauty.  My father told me this story long before I read this book - but it is why I believe many parts of this book.<br /><br />Some other parts just \\"feel\\" right - and I chose to believe them.  They make sense to me and the book has given me great joy and hope.<br /><br />Joy and Hope.  Two of the greatest things a person can possess.<br /><br />So, I say ... try it ... read the book and if you don't believe it then fine.

076781326X|5.0|Review number 111. I remember seeing this 1968 Christmas holiday classic in a theater the day after it came out. Story takes place around, I'll say 1850 England. When a kid sees this movie for the first time (especially back then, before cable, video games, ipods, etc), it really does make a lasting impression on you. Too many memorable scenes to mention. I thought the Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) did an exceptional good job in this film, as so did Oliver Twist (Mark Lester), Nancy-the hot redheaded bar maid (Shani Wallis), bad guy Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed) and who could forget good 'ol half-hearted pick pocket master mind Fagin (Ron Moody)? Is it just me or could he have possibly modeled for Jethro Tull's 'Aqualung' lp? I usually can't stand show tunes, but out of the movie's fourteen songs, I liked \\"Food, Glorious Food\\", \\"I'd Do Anything\\", \\"It's A Fine Life\\" and the swinging \\"Oom-Pah-Pah\\". Only character in 'Oliver!' I could NOT stand is that pirate reject / Napoleon wanna-be Mr. Bumble (Harry Secombe). Recommended.

B000UD0ESA|5.0|This is a review of the Final Cut, not the movie itself, which everyone knows is great.    I am very glad that the producers did their job to restore, clean and enhance the video and sound quality, only for this, this DVD is a must to longtime Blade Runner fans, it does not matter at all if you own the previous DVD of the Director's Cut because at once the Final Cut begins you know you spent your money right. It's almost like the film was done last year in digital, it's amazing! The contrast between bright and dark is greater, and the picture quality and resolution is far better than in the original Director's Cut VHS and DVD. Moreover, the soundtrack sounds better than my Blade Runner original CD, it has great depth and you can listen clearer the twiks, beeps and sounds of the future. So, if you are hesitanting because you already own the Director's Cut DVD, my recomendation is: get the Final Cut now!    About the other differences between the Director's and Final Cut: they are essentially the same film, Riddley Scott simply perfected the Director's Cut (which was rushed in 1992 because the Workprint version leaked as Scott's 'true' vision): Some minor CGI adjustments in the fantastic 2019 LA cityscape; Zhora's death scene is improved, now you can really tell is Zhora who is shot, not just some stunt woman; the unicorn sequence is slightly longer and trippier; Tyrell's death is blodier (and in general the movie is more violent, just like the International version); some additional shots of LA streets and dialogue; finally, the only CGI 'major' addition is the dove flying at the end towards the 2019 LA polluted skies.     In a nutshell, this is Blade Runner as it should be, and how it was meant to be: perfect image quality and excellent sound quality. I really do not care now for the theatrical version (yes, I saw it first of all versions, many years ago and I did like it) with that unnecesary voiceover that ruins the music soundtrack in some parts - an essential aspect of the film, you see, I love the music; I saw the workprint a while ago and it is just an unfinished version, nothing less, nothing more. So if you are budget minded, can live without the other versions and some featurettes and simply love this movie, go for this Final Cut (and also there's an excellent 3 plus hour documental and three audio commentaries from Scott's and company that should more than satisfy your Blade Runner hunger!).
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Wonderful.  I have only praise for delievery and the content of the movie.    No problems at all thank you very much for this.  It was a delight to see the face of the person that the movie was given to. It worked wonderfully and has been watched four times in the last two days.      Thank you for everything.  It came quickly and was not damaged.
0375505091|1.0|This was a huge disappointment.  The photos were sometimes absolutely grotesque (I'm a professional not of her stature but I do have an eye for this stuff!) and I had to change pages as fast as possible!  Some were blurry, repetititve and made you question not only why was it in the book, but why take it at all?  Nudity CAN be beautiful if done tastefully but this was just bad.  NO better word would describe the content.  I returned it the minute the stores opened after Christmas!  I bought books I could actually learn something from...........
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|The longest awaited DVD special edition of Ridley Scott's Masterpiece (Alien is a close 2nd) is here at last and - It was worth the long wait!      This is a benchmark for DVD in the same way the 1999 release of Alien, and the 2000 releases of Fight Club and The Matrix pushed the boundries of when the format was new.    The special edition has been done to death and it takes a lot to impress DVD fanatics these days but this set does the trick and then some.    The HD version boasts not 1 but 5 different cuts of BL all in anamorphic widescreen and remastered in 1080P (are you listening Mr. Lucas?  This is how you treat loyal fans - not by slapping them in the face with your revisionist antics).      The commentaries are great, Dangerous Days is one of the best movie documentaries ever made, and all the little details are what make this set so great.    Note:  If you hit Play All on the deleted scenes - they play out like an Alternate short version of BL which I like to call the \\"Super 8\\" cut.  For those of you too young to remember...before VHS, companies used to sell 8MM film clip reels of films like Star Wars, Superman etc and you'd play these selected scenes on a projector.
6302768810|2.0|This review is a little tardy.  I actually bought this tape a couple years ago but just now came across the review request e-mail.<br /><br />When I ordered this tape I was hoping it was something I had seen back in the late 80s or early 90s where one of Kevin Pollack's bits was about Brian Boitano at the Winter Olympics.  Unfortunately that show must have been one of the hour long comedy specials on HBO.  This tape is not his best work by any means, but it does have a few funny moments.<br /><br />My suggestion is to avoid this one and see if you can get a DVD copy of the HBO show.  It is hilarious.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|It amazes me that sooo many people reviewing this film have complained about the long scenes of women talking, if memory serves, all of Quentin's films have people talking about anything & everything, this surprises all of you, what was \\"Pulp Fiction\\" about>> people talking, & \\"Jackie Brown\\">>> people talking, can't comment on \\"Kill Bill\\" because I have not seen it, even \\"From Dusk till Dawn's\\" first hour is riddled with talking, enough about that, this film scores with me as being somewhat original, there is no doubt that Tarentino is a fan of 70's car movies, most notably \\"Dirty Mary Crazy Larry\\", & has a female foot fetish, & to those who say Kurt Russell doesn't have a lot of screen time, were you watching the same movie, Kurt has just as much screen time as he should, In this he is Stuntman Mike who it seems has it in for women, the first hour introduces us to four or five (if you count Rose McGowan's character) women who banter about anything & everything, & are quietly stalking by Russell, when he later dispatches them, it is kind of gruesome, but not overdone, basically a blink-you-miss-it shot, in which he rams them head on in his souped 70's Chevy Nova at I am guessing a 100mph speed, because it is constructed as a stunt car, he survives but not without a trip to the hospital, a year passes, & he is on the prowl again, this time in a Dodge Charger(think General Lee painted black) that is also able to withstand a serious impact, only this time he stalks the wrong set of women who are just as crazy as him when ticked off, when they decide to do a crazy stunt in a Dodge Challenger, he ups the ante by taunting them, almost killing them, what he doesn't count on is being shot when one is packing, he flees, & soon after they are taunting him looking for some sweet revenge, that it is almost comical, Russell turns into a complete cry-baby & this so fun to watch, as the hunter becomes the hunted that results in a 20 minute car chase that is the best I have seen ina long time, why so many Tarentino fans didn't like it is a mystery to me, I don't know what these 1 star people were expecting, definately a fun movie, especially the last 30 minutes!
B00005JPKE|5.0|\\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" is the best straight up war movie I've ever seen.  (Super highly recommended for military, ex-military, or future military personnel.)        Free of editorializing.  A microcosm or distillation of war in general.   Great psychological insight into into the Japanese mindset of the time.       The juxtaposition of big tragedies vis-a-vis little tragedies gives it Shakespearean grandeur.       I was prepared to be bored.  Thought it was an appendix to \\"Flags of Our Fathers.\\"  Had no idea it was a Japanese written movie, but made by Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg.
1400049628|5.0|As a zombie fanatic (since age two, no joke!) I got a huge kick out of this book. But I got an even bigger kick out of carrying it around with me in public! When people laugh or ask about it you just keep a straight face and tell em \\"Safety first, ya know, You gotta be prepaired.\\" It's a riot. This book is fun as hell!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Great movie, definitely not to be missed.  The story is excellent, the attention to details superb, the characters wonderful.  Best Pixar movie so far. Enjoy it!
0143038419|1.0|The premise of this book is that some depressed lady decides to go Italy, where she dines at a fine Italian place and then decides that she could then travel to India and other 3rd world countries and write about the food she ate and all this somehow leads her to all the answers in her uncertainties in life.     Sounds pretty boring, but people have still decided to read it. Once one review was published showing the book in a positive light, everybody jumped on the bandwagon so that the book would become so popular that YOU would feel stupid for not reading it. But I will not fall for this, this book is, without a doubt, boring, and I refuse to read it, and anybody who thinks it is absurd of me to judge other readers  and says that this book is delightfully entertaining and life changing can go jump down a well.
B000PKG4SC|4.0|Alright... Lots of lauds for DSB being really forward minded and changing with the times. I don't really know what she re-recorded and what input she had in the feel for some of these songs, but yes, again, good job being willing.    This is a weird album... I enjoy it, I do. I will always love DSB's hardcore show(wo)manship and brassy Bond style and oddly enough, this album downplays that. Part of DSB's appeal, in my opinion, was the way she made EVERY song a rousing anthem. This album is for those want a rousing anthem and a cocktail at sundown. Sometimes it's really well done and quirky and classy, but other times it really just regresses. I hear a lot of random 90's muzak cheese that throws me way off, but I don't know...    1. Get the Party Started - I suppose it's tongue in cheek to have x-year old Bassey sing Pink (boulevard is \\"freaking\\"), so it's cute and the treatment is pure DSB. I like it.  2. Big Spender - Nice treatment... a little played, I'd say. HOWEVER, if you can get ahold of the \\"Pink Pound remix\\", there's a lot more flavor to it and a definite approach to it.   3. I Who Have Nothing - Boozier, reggae-ish and appropriate, fits well.  (this is where it starts to go downhill)  4. This Is My Life - Weird... not worth it  5. Slave to the Rhythm - Eh... scary, weird... definitely not worth it  6. Can I Touch You There - Michael Bolton scary weird... Stay away. Very away.  AND THEN!  7. What Now My Love - GREAT treatment. Very stylish. Definitely back on track with this one.  8. Kiss Me Honey Honey - Very, very cute. Effervescent DSB.  9. Hello - A little weird... but I love hearing different interpretations of this one, so maybe I'm partial and maybe it grew on me.  10. You Only Live Twice - Not one of the stronger tracks, but a good effort.  11. The Living Tree - It seems kind of out of place on this album, but this piece is incredible. REALLY incredible. Worth the entire album.  12. Where Is the Love - Not a fan at all...  13. I Will Survive - Strong track and approach to finish with.    So... after all this pretentious critique of mine, just check it out for yourself. Definitely worth it.

B000LC4CVA|4.0|The Celtic Woman show, New Journey is a credit to the talents of the 6 beautiful women and to David Downes who arranges the show.  The addition of Haley Westenra is an added plus.  A solid performance all around and worth adding to your collection of Celtic Woman DVDs and CDs.    I noticed that there is a difference between the DVD and the PBS show in that there are different crowd shots and that the titles to the songs appear on the PBS version before each song and not on the DVD version.    In addition the Celtic Woman company offers a 17 minute video on the DVD. entitled \\"Behind the Scenes at Slane Castle\\".  This was excellent and I would like to see much more of this inside look.    My chief fault is not with the show or any of the outstanding performances from the girls, but with the producers of the DVD.  There is a glitch between songs at about the 57 minute mark which causes the DVD to freeze for a moment.  While it does not occur during any performance but rather during an crowd applause shot, it is highly annoying as speaks to poor quality control on the part of whoever mastered the DVD.  I returned the first copy of the DVD I received hoping this was just a fluke, only to find that the fault exists on the replacement copy I received.  In light of what you have to pay for a DVD at full price this kind of sloppy production control is uncalled for.  This sort glitch also appears on the DVD \\"Christmas Celebration\\" at the 51 minute mark.  I fully realize that edits have to be made to a concert DVD to weed out excess time but these cuts should be seamless and not distracting to the enjoyment of the performance.    If you can tolerate this glitch then add the DVD to your collection.  If not wait for a used copy to be offered for sale.    I rate the performance a 4 out of 5 only because of the poor way in which the DVD was made and not a reflection in anyway of the performance of the girls.
B000000ZKD|5.0|Love it!!!!  It makes me happy.  The base line keeps turning my lights on and off (I have the clapper).
B000VR824S|5.0|This is one of those performances you will want to add to your collection. This concert features a lot of the same people at the 2004 performance, which is fine because the point of the original Crossroads 2004 was that Eric invited performers who where in his record collection. Clapton is one of those artists's who is just as comfortable as a lead performer as he is a supporting musician.  In 2004 he chose to let ZZ Top close the show and they rocked.  This time ZZ Top was nowhere to be seen and Clapton closed the show.  He surrounded himself with a solid supporting cast, Steve Winwood,  Derek Trucks, John Mayer and Johnny Winter., and Eric wailed on the guitar to a higher than he did in the performance of 2004.  Bottom line, if you are a fan of the way Clapton plays guitar, you will not be disappointed in this DVD.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|The 1st. Braveheart release had this annoying flickering at the top of the screen every time it changed scenes. I'm thankful they came out with a release that doesn't have that problem, it's a great movie, it needs a great picture quality, which this release delivers.
1594489505|5.0|This story of Mariam and Laila's courageous journey is moving and captivating. The story is full of culture and each character offers rich insight about their beliefs and practices. The book is written in a way that breeds compassion for every character in the book. This is an amazing story that will stay with me forever.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I did not get to see season one when it aired for the reason I did not have wb. I do now and enjoy smallville and enjoyed seeing and having season one to watch. I really thought the seller did well on shipping and selling the product reasonably.
B00067189O|5.0|For $12.97, you get regular stereo sound plus 5.1 DVD Music! Documentary is no Ken Burn's Jazz but it is nice bonus. Enjoy the sweet music.
B000KRNG5E|2.0|Before you guys come out of the woodwork and start yelling at me about how great Argento is, I love his work.  And this piece, I just do not get.  Suspiria was a great movie, I was ready to turn this one off after 30 minutes.  My DVD cut out before the last 15 minutes, and I didn't care.  It's a much more artistic piece, yes, but I don't even understand Argento's imagery.  The acting was worse than godawful, not that Argento's films are known for that, but this was really bad.  I didn't really care a thing about the three mothers, there was no suspense, I do not understand all the great ratings this film got.  Maybe i'm missing something...
B000Q6GUW0|1.0|This is probably the crappiest, most irresponsible piece of dreck ever foisted on the public by Hollywood. It's really just a warmed-over Clint Eastwood/John Wayne fantasy for idiots who think they (and society) are somehow served by some douchebag who believes he's been touched by God with the ability to decide who is guilty and should die. Frankly, the main character is such a despicable bit of pond scum that it's hard to imagine who with an IQ above the single digits could admire him. The most laughable part is those of you who say he \\"only kills bad guys\\", and therefore it's okay. That's the sort of reasoning that grade-schoolers, bin Ladens, and Dubya Bushes accept as logical; the rest of us long ago grew out of it. Jeez. And does anyone, truly, wonder why we keep seeing massive homicides in this country?<br />Hard to believe that Showtime, which brings us the best two shows this season, sees fit to air this turd blossom.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Introduction:    Okay, as Female Spy (a name which my mom and I both share) Normally I only review videogames; that's just me.  This time, however, I decided to try writing a different type of review; and Ratatouille is a movie worth my first movie review as a critic.  Normally, I believe in the saying \\"Nothing is Perfect,\\" but some things are more impressive than others.  To put it simply, this is one of the best movies out there.  Disney movies have been suffering in quality since Walt died (Finding Nemo had a terrible beginning), but there are a few movies that have hit the mark: Cars, The Incredibles, and Ratatouille.  So, some of Walt's old talent still lives.      The Plot:    Ratatouille is a movie about a rat, named Remy, with a keen sense of smell and a dream to become a chef.  His dream contrasts with his family life of pillaging food, however.  Struggling between his family and his dream, Remy becomes acquainted with a garbage boy known as Linguini; who can help him realize his dream.  This initiates a roller coaster ride of controversy on both sides; as humans don't trust rats and vice versa.  This all leads to a nice ending that's sweet as sugar.      Good Points:    1.  Teaches the \\"Never judge by appearances\\" theme.  You wouldn't think a rat could be a master chef.    2.  Gorgeous graphics.  Paris looks absolutely lovely in this film.  Does it make sense to say it's cartoonish in a realistic way?    3.  Funny and romantic.  In order for any movie to be good for me, it needs to be a simmering comedy with a dash of romance.  This movie fits the bill.    4.  Engaging characters.  Humans or rats, protagonists or antagonists; you'll love everybody!      Bad Point:    1.  There's only one: the scurrying rats.  Actually, this didn't bother me, because they personified the rats; so, I saw them as little furry people instead of rodents.  Seeing Remy's entire family (about several hundred rats) scurrying at once in a couple of scenes, however, made my mother and my grandmother cringe...      Conclusion:    You'd be insane not to see this movie.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Who couldn't love this British humor? There are times in the series that you feel bad for Mr. Fawlty but you can't help but laugh, (quilt ridden no less.)This series is about a man and his wife who own an Inn in Torkay. You begin to feel sorry for the old chap but just as you do he does something so bizarre you're on the edge of your seat waiting to see how he'll get out of the latest jam, and how he'll keep it from his wife, no less. In the end it is hard to feel for him because he's always cooking up some big idea that turns  into one giant mess!!<br />[[ASIN:B00005LC1H Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series]]I've watch these episodes over and over for years you couldn't make a better investment in laughter!!
B000003TBP|5.0|If you plan on buying this, be aware that there is a deluxe edition coming out January 29, 2008.  This will have the original album plus 2 tracks on the first cd.  the second cd will have b-sides and remixes.  It will probably cost around 25-30 bucks.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This movie is a pretty good vampire movie. Even though it was from the 90's I think they did a good job with it. Brad Pitt did an awesome job as Louis and Tom Cruise did decently with his role as Lestat. Kirsten Dunst was an adorable Claudia and Antonio Banderas was  a clever Armand.
B000669GAI|5.0|This compilation of Pearl Jam's greatest hits  showcases the band's eclectic  body of work, and is perfect for someone who doesn't own every PJ album, but wants a collection of their best songs. Their most well known songs  stood the test of time, and still sound great, such as  \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Jeremy\\", \\"Alive\\", and of course, \\"Black\\", which happens to be one of my all-time favorites. There are many other lesser known, yet wonderful songs on here as well, such as \\"Immortality\\", \\"Corduroy\\", \\"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town\\"...and the list goes on. I do have to agree with the other reviewers who said that \\"Garden\\" and \\"Rockin' in the Free World\\" should have been included in \\"Rearviewmirror\\" but other than that, no complaints here!
B00005RHGL|5.0|Love this movie. Just the right mix of people to make this a great movie. I will watch over and over again even though I don't generaly watch westerns.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I purchased this movie because I'd seen it on TV and knew my little granddaughter, 5 years old, would love it.  Was I ever right!  She has watched it maybe 5 or 6 times, and I've only had it a very short time.  The cinematography is absolutely beautiful in this production. The young man who plays Peter Pan is wonderfully perfect for that fuzzy line between childhood and emerging teenage.  This is truly one of the best Peter Pan productions I've seen --- and I've seen quite a few!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is an essential film for any library.  I'm not a purist so my wife and I loved the new colorized version.

B000UD08HW|5.0|Looks great on my system at 1080i.  If I want nature, I'll pull out the Planet Earth Blu-ray. Have yet to see a buffalo play a Strat like Gilmour.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|Excellent. I really enjoyed the extras. Although the T-Shirt was a little cheap, the collector's edition was well worth it. I attended the concerts that year and also attended the premier of the movie; it was nice to see the replica of the movie ticket. Thanks Led Zeppelin for continuing to satisfy my musical needs.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|CA-CHOW!!!!!  If that translates into THE MOST UNBELIVEABLE PICTURE EVER... then Lightning McQueen has been properly quoted!  I've NEVER seen a more clean, crisp, beautiful, and awesome picture on a dvd. Ever.  The only reason I'm going the Blu-Ray route and not the HD is because of PIXAR.  I would follow them any direction for the sheer quality of film they produce.  Simply put, PIXAR RULES!  I'm ready to order RATATOUILLE now!!  Found out yesterday after searching around the FINDING NEMO is in \\"08!!!!!  Can't wait!!!!!!

0752864300|5.0|During the Grunge craze, several bands became prominent and were written about.  Band members were interviewed by Rock journalists and others.  Although I've no enthusiasm for their music, TREES provided the ultimate insight into what they did and how they did it.  And about that I'm wildly enthusiastic because it holds the key to so much of POP art and lit.  This small group of hirsute, obese strummers came out of the dank gloom of so many of the fishgut towns in the Northwest, wanting what most guys that age want; a break, some excitement, some fame and enough money so they can pick up some fat hungry girls who like to eat and go ut and have a good greasy, dirty time.  Two fat guys, a drummer and a screamer; the screamer was tall, long-haired and chronically depressed, and sang behind the veil of his lank hair, but he had the right kind of voice and delivery to make the gloomy doggerel of their songs seem like lyrics of some profundity when yelled into and across the intense sonic whine (singing trees) of the band's electronics.  They were both puzzled and affronted by their success because--and they were frnk enough to see it and admit it--their success, their sound came from their amateurism.  They were not and did not pretend to be professional musicians; what they did came ou of their need to express themselves with what they had.    In that sense the group grasped what they had in common with all the truly great proletarian artists, in Rock, in high POP art, the Blues, in Comics like Heavy Metal, in Heavy Metal music, in Pulp Fiction generally, and in Sci-Fi stories; the Pulpy spinoff of the three-penny thriller.  All these creative artists offered an immense working-class public entertaining material that served as High Art and the repository of great ideas and sensations, in easily-digested, cheap forms.  Mass entertainments for mass markets.    Dick's books fit into this form perfectly, and this book, surely one of his legitimate masterpieces, fits perhapsbest of all.  Its form is that of a kind of montage made up of thinly detailed but vividly colored scenes from the private and professional life of an individual who must work for his living.  His name is Deckerd (Dick-Hard?) and he lives in an apartment or house so unattractive, a minimum of words is more than enough to describe it.  He has a semi-catatonic skank for a wife, and she, unable or unwilling to face any reality outside their dwelling, stays attached to a device called a Mood Organ, endlessly varhing the combinations in hope of finding one that will deliver her from he nightmare of apathy.  It is a set-up very much like something one would find in an illustrated Crum magazine; say DESPAIR COMICS.    After his dose of Mood modification, he escapes to go to work.  It is a job he hates, but has grown numb hating.  He is something between a policeman and a garbage man, in that he spots and eliminates stray, or unauthorized, escaped droids from neighboring planets and space platforms, who have deserted their posts and come to Earth.  In the course of his duties he has the opportunity to visit the droid or replicant production facility, and there to administer a standard Empathy test to one of the replicants, a shining female.  The contrast here is poignant: he has before him a beautiful, synthetic and capable woman who functions well in the world, and who can be trained to love him.  At home he has an authentic woman who is neurotic and profoundly incapable of maintaining either herself or their home and is therefore an unsuitable or unsatisfactory wife or companion.      That problem's the essence of BLADERUNNER, the most beautiful and important film of the second half of the 20th century.  But the film is not the novel.  There are many shades of difference, and those differences enhance the inspirational fecundity of the book.  More pictures will be made from it, or inspired by it, and they will all be more than superficially different.    Others here havepointed out Dick's comparative lifelong poverty.  As a Chicago nerd transplanted to Los Angeles, without looks or any technical and financially rewarding specialty, he fell into writing for the Sci-Fi pulps.  His work has the look of that genre: the flat, quick stories, sketched out and either stitched togethe or pasted over one another, and all written under an editor's or publisher's deadline.  He produced about 30 books, and estimating what he might have made out of them,  I conclude that he made between 5 an 6 thousand dollars a year, during the sixties, and kept himself gring them out by means of drugs.  Like Warhol's paintings that depend on mass production techniques--wherein painting blends with silk screen and becomes photosereography--or the physique painters and illustrators of Sci-Fi an fantasy--wherein draughtsmanship meshes with pastiche realism; indeed, like the decorative cubists who incorporated pieces of 'found' material into their paintings and sculptures, so Dick used what he found, modifying it slightly, and by manipulating the context of these images, was able to simulate many of the effects of conventional narrative writing, without having to use that technique itself.  Although as some have noted, there are stretches of good or even brilliant writing, they tend to be short, small and the stories proceed around them, like fluids streaming around a solid object.  Quentin Tarrantino, another great proletarian artist also uses mass-production techniques, producing visually, a sense of fast-editing that is reinforced by his ability to interweave separate character-driven stories and incidents into an overall narrative, and then to bring them all to a satisfactory conclusion.  Tarrantino's films have yet to inspire books, whereas Dick's books continue to inspire screenplays.  Dick's books use limited language, even inarticulateness to suggest pictures; to conjure up images in the imagination.  It's as simple-minded as a Hockney assemblage of Polaroids.  But one feels sure, no matter how fanciful the outward appearance of any given metaphor, that Dick has based all on solid observation of the world around him.    I imagine that Dick had as his day job, something like Credit Investigator.  He looks like a ReproMan.    He's working in that endlessly inhospitable, expensive conlommeration of hovels, Los Angeles, with its acrid, brown atmosphere, it's stink and its 24-7 Euphoria.    His job is to track down physically magnificent, but deadly and unfeeling escaped slaves; i.e., blacks.  To a middle-aged mid-American like Dick, these large, people would be dangerous at least.    His job is to ruin or to destroy their credit, if they have any; to repro their cars; to strip them of unpaid-for jewelery and costly electronics.  He works with the police, but outside the legal system.    His turf of exploration is that vast, inhabited wasteland of semi-industrial blight, around L.A.X.    He is sexually challenged by the beauty and the physicality of the women.  He is intimately threatened by the physicality of these virile men.    He cannot and does not get the affair going that he wanted with the female.  Probably impossible anyway.  50s-60s L.A.  Probably racially restricted housing.  He's relieved.    He crashes when he's finished his gig, and his home skank manages to pull herself together enough to throw a cover over him as he sleeps, and to put on a pot of coffee.    Tomorrow is another smoggy, funk-inducing day: same plot, different characters.    Both Stalin and Roosevelt are dead, but this is what happens when Kafka and Orwell combine to produce the literture of the Proletariat.  It is monstrous because life for most people today is monstrous.  All one can say as one looks down on this misshapen, modern thing on its gurney is, \\"It's alive!  Alive!\\"  Unfotunately, some might say.
B000W0NO5Q|5.0|A friend of mine referred me to this book. Once I read it I was immediately charmed by the characters and the easy way of storytelling.     This book will lead you on an adventure and you will come to love the characters in the story. Once you finish this book you will want to continue on in the series.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Oh my Lord! I thought it was bad when Michael Bolton decided he could sing art songs. Rod Stewart as a rocker, whether you liked him or not, was a great example of the genre. He was fun, engaging, and effective. He is simply terrible at this.    His raspy voice is the only thing that sets him apart... but it doesn't add anything to his \\"interpretations\\"--mostly bland arrangements with no sense of style, no imagination, and no class. Sorry, Dude. This transformation only worked for Linda Ronstadt.    The fact that these are great pieces of music simply can't overcome the fact that he doesn't know how to do this style. Eww.
0689865384|5.0|One day, I decided to go impulse book-shopping, and chanced on picking this one up, thinking it sounded interesting - and boy, was I right! The plot of the story is amazing, and keeps you guessing throughout the entire novel.  As soon as I finished reading Uglies, I immediately went back out and bought Pretties, and pre-ordered the third book, Specials.  I read through each one the very same day I got them, unable to put them down even for a moment - in short, these books are amazing, and the author (after reading several other titles of his) is extremely talented - I urge you all to read this book, and all the ones to follow - you won't be disappointed! :)
B000MCH5P4|2.0|A triumph in redundancy. The entire Mexican wedding and its aftermath added little to the central story of the impact on the lives of a married couple of American tourists on a bus tour in Morocco when one is senselessly shot by an Arab kid trying out an illegal rifle. The resultant collapse of the Arab family as a unit was touching. The rifle belonged to a Japanese hunter who gave it to his Arab guide who sold it to the Arab family. It transpires that the Japanese hunter has a deaf-mute teenage daughter with alienation problems heightened by her intact virginity. Why the focus should be on her and not the bereaving widower father escapes me. The only telling point was that everyone failed in \\"talking\\" to the other.
B000PC8AFU|2.0|Well it is not what I hoped for at all! I have to agree with the others, do not waste your money for the one or two good tunes. Go buy \\"Before the Music Dies\\"
B000SM7QUC|1.0|Okay so I know I will get bashed but someone has to say it - this is not a \\"great concept/story CD\\".  Now I love the Crue and Sixx just as much as the next gal but come on.  If I wanted a spoken word CD I would look up Henry Rollins.  This CD has only one viable song to listen to on it's own.  Sikki seems to be trying to repeat the works of Queensryche, Rush (2112) or even Savatage with this storyline CD.  But unlike the former bands, the only song to stand on it's own is LIB.  Sadly I see this talented band being left in the dust when Sixx returns to Crue.  I may be a fan of old but this CD is not worth full price.  If you are looking to find more awesome tracks like Life is Beautiful - then just download it.  I wish I was warned prior to shelling out hard earned money.
0375847227|3.0|The Golden Compass was good enough as a \\"young adult\\" adventure story, a bit similar to LeGuin's A Wizard of Earthsea in the way it feels. There is another book/series that it reminded me of, but I can't think of what it is (possibly Robert Jordan's seemingly-endless Wheel of Time series); it just seemed very familiar. The Subtle Knife was okay, the writing was good enough to allow me to overlook some plot holes. But The Amber Spyglass just didn't cut it, and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth for the whole series. Several times in the second and third books, I felt like I was reading a children's version of the two Endymion books with a bit of Ilium and Olympos thrown in (all by Dan Simmons).     I personally like the idea of anti-religious children's books, but Pullman messed this one up. Instead of attacking a religion (or religion in general) head on, he set up the Authority, which is very much a \\"straw man\\" (or straw god?). Instead of rational protagonists, he gave us New Age mumbo-jumbo mixed with Eastern mysticism. Pullman created what had to be one of the greatest villians ever, in Mrs. Coulter, but then ruined the character in the later books. The final explanation for the Dust was just plain stupid, and requires us to overlook some pretty major chicken-egg issues. And in the end, defeating the Authority didn't really matter, because the problems were man-made! Even accepting it as a children's book, this series had too many problems for me.
B000VSBX34|5.0|IT'S LIKE WATCHING A BRAND NEW MOVIE! AWESOME! JUST AS FUNNY AS WHEN I WAS A KID! CLEAR AS A BELL AND SOUNDS GREAT! ANY BEATLES FAN WILL LOVE THIS!!
B000W4KT64|5.0|My wife and I saw Hairspray on Broadway a few years ago and loved it.  Then, this holiday season, my daughter requested the DVD of the movie---not because of us, but because shed'd heard good things about the movie.  Her sources were right on: The film is just as dynamic and entertaining as the stage production, with great performances all around (John Travolta is terrific as expected) and plenty of energy that translates well to the screen (even a little one!).
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This dvd is so great. I bought it for my dad for christmas and he loves it.  I also like the bbc version better as it doesn't have Sigourney Weaver in it.  If you have never seen this do yourself a favor and buy it now.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|An incredible compilation of music from one of our legendary Hall of Fame pop-rock bands. All of the best hits are here with only a few throw away fill ins.
B000UNYJV8|2.0|This review isn't about the movie, but rather about the quality of the DVD, which is poorly authored. The advertised extras are all there, the subtitles and alternate audio tracks are there, but the movie itself looks like some old AVI bootleg, not DVD-quality video. Namely, it's badly interlaced - meaning that any time there's movement on the screen, the moving object breaks up in to off-synch horizontal lines. This is something I don't see even on things like Youtube anymore, much less on a professionally released proper DVD. I've tried this disk on 3 different players, all with the same interlaced results.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Beautiful, breath-taking and spectacular viewing of nature's wonders. A must see for all who inhabit our incredible planet earth!
B000ASDFJU|5.0|The product I ordered arrived very quickly, packaged well and for a great price.  I would definitely order from Amazon.com again!
0810993139|5.0|My daughter asked us for this book for Christmas. It was a favorite of the 4th graders at her school during a recent book fair. They ran out of the book for purchase and we found it on Amazon for less :-), always a good thing.
B0007M22TI|3.0|This is not as good as the Celtic Woman Christmas DVD, but it is a nice one.  It was interesting to see and hear the interviews with the performers.  These ladies really do have beautiful voices.
B000002J09|1.0|This album and The band Led zepplin in paticuilar couldnt be more overated. The gimmick is LOUDNESS. not musical skill and creativity as in jimi hendrix cream and great blues artists such as muddy waters and bb king. not a great voice as in queens freddie mecury. john lennon or elvis presley. not excellent songwriting as in the beatles. bob dylan. and frank zappa. not orginality as in the rolling stones. deep purple. or black sabbath. but just loud obnioxuis singing about degrading sexaul situiations. not that thats a bad thing but the way zep presents it is ridicolus the lemon song? give me a break! self indulgent talentless guitar playing with very little soloing. when this guy does do solos it sounds so bad it sure to get you pressing the mute button. try good guitarists like jimi hendrix. eric clapton. duane allman. and chuck berry. much better than this goon. john paul jones did just enough to get by i have a friend whos a better bass player than him. but truth be told john bonham is a good drummer so if you think its worth buying the album for the drums be my guest and purchase zepplin iv today. if you dont save your money on more talented bands. oh and by the way if you wanna buy the album for stairway to heaven youre sure to catch its one millionth playing on the radio soon in your car. so i wouldnt worry about it.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|A really great DVD.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  It's a delight to see and listen to.
0525950079|5.0|I personally thought this book was better than \\"Pillars\\".  I couldn't put it down (all 1000 pages) and was sorry when it ended.  It did end with a slight promise of more, so maybe there will be another sequel!  Hope Ken Follett doesn't wait 10 years for another one.
1582701709|1.0|PT Barnum would be proud. Now all I am supposed to do is think good thoughts and concentrate on getting rich and it will happen if I really believe. Yeah right. I'd be happy for my $20 bucks back (I didn't really buy it I skimmed it in the library). If you are gullible enough to buy this book well then you deserve what you get. Did the last self help book you bought help you? Or the one before that? If they did why are you even thinking about this trash? If they didn't why are you even thinking about this trash? Oh and the secret to getting wealth is hard work. Don't be a dope.<br /><br />RMW
B000I0QK74|5.0|I wasn't too keen on buying a James Taylor album, cuz I'm a Jazz fan. After the first listen I was glad to have purchased it.  James's clear, strong voice and his selection of tunes make this album worthwhile.  He also has the best arrangement of 'Jingle Bells', I've ever heard.  I own about 50 Christmas CD's and listen to this one quite often even tho most of the others are Jazz.
B000YMM3CC|3.0|I have heard about this movie from a few people who i think have just jumped on the \\"WOW WHAT A GREAT MOVIE\\" bandwagon, so when i ordered it, i was expecting this profoundly, emotional, romantic drama. Well, it was profound in its own subtle way, a little slow at times, but in the end a touching love story that leaves you sighing w/ a tear and wondering if it will ever be like it is in the movies for you!
B000YPUF9W|5.0|Resident Evil Extinction is one of my favorite movies. I know a lot of people are complaining that the end of the movie is a huge cliff hanger, but don't worry, because they are making a 4th movie. And it is shooting right now, and should be out by next summer or fall. Okay, onto the real review. The story in this movie is pretty much just setting up for the 4th movie, but that doesn't keep this movie from being good. I really like this movie. I think the acting is really good, and just the story. So you definitely need to check this movie out.
B000I0XLYO|1.0|...This would be the movie to watch. The funniest thing about this comedy is that a studio actually put money into this script and managed not to recoil in shame. It's cute, it's pointless, it's a perfect movie to watch when the tv screen is watching you, or a group of friends are not sober and bored.
0446577391|4.0|First off, I will say that I did not enjoy \\"The Camel Club\\" one bit.  It almost turned me off from the series until a friend (who also hated the Camel Club) recommended \\"The Collectors.\\"  And I really, really enjoyed \\"The Collectors\\", especially the con artist aspects and how it came together with Oliver's story so nicely.  With \\"Stone Cold,\\" it is a much better book than \\"The Camel Club,\\" but doesn't quite measure up with \\"The Collectors.\\"  I enjoyed having Annabelle back and getting more of her backstory and it was fun to see a darker side of Oliver Stone.  Was the plot believable?...well, not really, but believable enough to not close the book.  Recommended if you liked \\"The Collectors,\\" but make sure you read that book first (and I guess read \\"The Camel Club\\" as well for more insight on the characters).
B00000J2PH|5.0|Wonderful CD - Carole King is a great artist - she has a beautiful voice and is very talented!  My favorite is the \\"You've Got a Friend\\" (I like it by James Taylor also)!  Received CD in timely manner in good condition!  Highly recommend seller!
B000002UB3|5.0|I used to listen to Abbey Road  <the album> back in high school every night at bedtime. I would fall asleep to the Beatles Abbey Road every single night. Now I have it on CD format and am re-living my past by playing it every night as I fall asleep into Golden Slumber thanks to the Beatles. Clearly the best \\"album\\" ever made in my humble opinion!
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|saw the film in the movie theater - was glad to have it on blu ray
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I love this movie and every movie made by Pixar.  This movie is very cute and funny.  The idea is a bit disturbing but who cares, it's a movie.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|My So-Called Life is one of the best TV series ever on DVD. I've been wanting to own this for a long time and I'm glad I got the chance to buy it here for a good price. Definitely worth the money.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|I was very skeptical about buying this album because a large number of the songs were from the disappointing \\"Human After All\\" album.  But the live versions are way better! even the classics are beefed up with more clicks and whistles!  Ive been listening to this album non stop for about 2 weeks now, I just cant stop listening to it!   The big highlight is the last track on the album, thats probley my favorite.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Danny Boyle's latest effort \\"Sunshine\\" marks his leap into the sci-fi genre. And, similar to many of his other films, a mixture of intelligent dialogue and stunning cinemetography works to illustrate something beyond the surface plot. \\"Sunshine\\" is an emotion, spiritual, and scientific journey for everyone who takes the time to lose themselves in the movie.    While many have bashed \\"Sunshine\\" for its seemingly implausible plot, I commend the writers for taking a leap into seemingly unknown territory. This also, however, has its drawbacks. Since many people do not know of the existence of \\"Q-balls\\" and since the film never makes any mention as to why the sun is dying, \\"Sunshine\\" can come off as ill-informed and scientifically ignorant. A short, concise summary of exactly why the sun is dying could help the movie appeal to those who did not take the time to research it before stepping into theaters.     But other than one small flaw, \\"Sunshine\\" is an extremely bold and impressive addition to the science fiction genre and should be seen by both fans of the genre and those who are not.
B0006N20RC|5.0|Royal Albert Rod Stewart DVD:    Excellent album, very good quality color shots.  Actually feel like you are there participating in the concert.  Truly captures the performance charm of Rod Stewart and demonstrate that his talent has lasting value over the course of 4 decades.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|John McClain is the most rockin cop ever. Over the years we have seen this dude stop an entire gang of terrorists in his socks, land a plane that he wasn't even boarded on, and save a city from that \\"simple simon met a pie-man\\" nutcase, with no weapons whatsoever. The man is unstoppable, and with his razor sharp wit, that of course sometimes gets him into more trouble then necessary, he is tons of fun to watch, every time.<br />This new addition to the Die Hard franchise is no exception. Bruce Willis should commit himself entirely to the role of John McClain in my book. He is always awesome. I ordered this one up on the On-Demand the other night and it was like I was eight years old again, watching the original. I literally felt like jumping around the living room, and throwing cushions around and stuff to pretend like I was blowing stuff up.<br />In this episode, John McClain somehow ends up involved in this whole computer terror plot. He's teamed up with that \\"I'm-A-Mac\\" kid, who does an exceptional job of being an obnoxious computer programmer kid.. a perfect platform for John McClain to spout his usual one liners under pressure (\\"Say it in English kid!\\") .... Intense moments in this film include a car/helicopter chase scene and a crazy kung fu chick. The CGI was used moderately throughout the film until the last scene, which I think may have over indulged in the special effects a little too much (just me? I think CGI is corny as hell myself...) But all in all, this movie is just as entertaining as the other Die Hards... not as good as the first one of course, and way better than the second... but as we all know, they all rule. Yippie Kai Aye and so forth. ROCK.
0743435753|1.0|“Flag in Exile”  **5<br /><br /> Stereotype / Stock character:  Mary Sue:  author character, author surrogate, self-insertion<br /><br /> After the Third Battle of Yeltsin’s Star, Hamish Alexander-Harrington, gives 11 DuQuesne class (Manticore’s Gift class) superdreadnoughts to the Grayson Space Navy to promote positive diplomatic relations in the Manticoran Alliance.  There are 3 problems with this tactic.  First (1), it denies the ships to the Star Empire of Manticore (Star Kingdom of Manticore).  Second (2), it denies the crews that did the actual fighting 13,200,000,000 Manticoran dollars in Prize money.  Third (3), as shown in the later books, the other allies do not repay this gratitude.<br /><br /> Manticoran Alliance<br /> -- Andermani Empire (Anderman Empire)<br /> -- Caliphate of Zanzibar<br /> -- Casca System<br /> -- Idaho System<br /> -- Minette System<br /> -- Poicters System<br /> -- Princedom of Alizon<br /> -- Protectorate of Grayson<br /> -- Republic of Candor<br /> -- Republic of Erewhon<br /> -- Republic of Sidemore<br /> -- Star Empire of Manticore (Star Kingdom of Manticore)<br /> -- Yorik System<br /><br /> Honor Stephanie Alexander-Harrington constantly talks about the need for duty and never shows signs of being a cynic.  She inspires everybody except those who are the stereotype/stock character villains.<br /><br /> Gregory Paxton resigns the chairmanship of the Grayson Society and the Austin Grayson Chair of History of Mayhew University to accept the position of Harrington’s espionage/intelligence officer.<br /><br /> After Edward Martin kills Julius Hanks, he surrenders to the authorities.  James Candless wants to perform a summary execution, but Harrington stops him.<br /><br /> Honor Stephanie Alexander-Harrington, who is just learning how to use a katana; kills William Allen Hillman Fitzclarence, who holds the title of Swordmaster Second.  This is the “emotional amateur defeating the professional warrior” clich&eacute;.<br /><br /> When the Fourth Battle of Yeltsin’s Star begins, Honor Stephanie Alexander-Harrington commands the armada despite:<br /> -- Having nearly been convicted by the Grayson Chamber (Conclave of Steadholders, Conclave of Steaders), which considered her guilty by suspicion.<br /> -- Having survived an assassination attempt and a courier (cutter, dispatch boat, pinnace, shuttle) crash.<br /> -- Being forced to kill William Allen Hillman Fitzclarence in a katana duel.<br /> -- Wesley Matthews should have replaced her since he knew that she had been mentally burned out and broken.<br /> -- She sees her duty as defending a society that considered her guilty by suspicion.<br /> -- She wins the battle by using a bluff.<br /> -- During this sequence of events she never shows signs of mental or physical exhaustion.<br /><br /> If Tom Clancy, Patrick Robinson, or John Ringo had written this they would have included the needed elements of cynicism and retaliation.  Honor Stephanie Alexander-Harrington would have resigned from the Royal Manticoran Navy and the Grayson Space Navy; then she would have resigned from her noble (nobility) titles.  She would have relocated to the Andermani Empire (Anderman Empire) and enlisted in the Imperial Andermani Navy.  Instead, Weber writes everything in morally good-and-evil storylines with no gray/grey areas.<br /><br /> Honor Stephanie Alexander-Harrington has been given too much respect and glory.  She is Manticore’s only first rate hero/heroine.  Hamish Alexander-Harrington and the other admirals/captains are written as:  second rate, third rate, fourth rate, fifth rate, sixth rate (rating system of the Royal Navy); officers.<br /><br /> The use of “moral courage” has been overused.<br /><br /> The treecats have been given too many privileges and exceptions, however they are not held responsible for their actions.  Eventually Weber will write that the treecat’s abilities of empathy and telepathy are used for loyalty tests of everybody.  This type of loyalty test is already used by the royal guard of the Kingdom of Torch (Congo, Elysium, Verdant Vista), Lara’s Own Regiment.  In the Honorverse, privacy is irrelevant and the concept of trust is obsolete.  Weber has forgotten what happened in the United States of America:<br /> -- Communist Control Act of 1954<br /> -- Communist registration act<br /> -- Executive Order 9835 (Loyalty Order)<br /> -- First Red Scare<br /> -- House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) (HUAC)<br /> -- Joseph Raymond McCarthy<br /> -- Loyalty Review Board<br /> -- McCarran Internal Security Act (Internal Security Act, McCarran Act, Subversive Activities Control Act)<br /> -- McCarthyism<br /> -- Second Red Scare<br /> -- States Attorney General’s List of Subversive Organizations<br /> -- Subversive Activities Control Board<br /><br /> Weber needs to write that genetic engineering (biological engineering, biological systems engineering, biotechnology) is not evil.  The ethics of genetic engineering (biological engineering, biological systems engineering, biotechnology) have always been written in good-and-evil terms.  Genetic engineering (biological engineering, biological systems engineering, biotechnology) has always been written as evil regardless of use.  “Andromeda” had a balanced view of genetic engineering (biological engineering, biological systems engineering, biotechnology).<br /><br /> Weber has written that technology is only evil if it is misused.  He has never written about the evils of cybernetic (actroid, android, bionics, cyborg, gynoid, humanoid robot, robot, robotics) surgery.  Cybernetics (actroid, android, bionics, cyborg, gynoid, humanoid robot, robot, robotics) have been written as being irrelevant to a person’s morality.  Weber should write that cybernetics (actroid, android, bionics, cyborg, gynoid, humanoid robot, robot, robotics) are seen as dehumanizing and Sharpton is reviled for its heavy use of cybernetics (actroid, android, bionics, cyborg, gynoid, humanoid robot, robot, robotics).  In the “Star Wars” universe, cyborgs were viewed with distrust and fear since they were part machine and had been dehumanized.<br /><br /> The Beowulf Life Sciences Code outlaws any serious genetic engineering (biological engineering, biological systems engineering, biotechnology), even for the colonization of heavy gravity (gravitation) planets.  Even though the planets in San Martin (Trevor’s Star System) and the Star Empire of Manticore (Star Kingdom of Manticore) were colonized by modified colonists, it is now outlawed by known space.  Modifying colonists for different environments is not the equivalent of the genetic slavery promoted by Mesa (Mesa System, Mesa Terminus).<br /><br /> Everything is written in “black-and-white” morality, there are no “shades of gray/grey” morality.<br /><br /> The things that Honor Stephanie Alexander-Harrington can do without failure:<br /> -- alternative dispute resolution<br /> -- appropriate dispute resolution<br /> -- arbitration<br /> -- bravery<br /> -- character judgment<br /> -- common decency<br /> -- conciliation<br /> -- courage<br /> -- diplomacy<br /> -- dispute resolution<br /> -- duels (Dreyfus Protocol, Ellington Protocol)<br /> -- emotional control<br /> -- ethical behavior<br /> -- external dispute resolution<br /> -- facilitation<br /> -- gliding (glider)<br /> -- honor<br /> -- integrity<br /> -- leadership<br /> -- logistics<br /> -- marksman (designated marksman, scout sniper, sharpshooter (Scharfsch&uuml;tze), sniper)<br /> -- martial arts (hybrid martial arts, mixed martial arts)<br /> -- mediation<br /> -- moral behavior<br /> -- negotiation<br /> -- non biased actions<br /> -- politics<br /> -- strategy<br /> -- swordsmanship (Daishō, fencing)<br /> -- tactics<br /><br /> Honor Harrington<br /> -- HH1 -- On Basilisk Station<br /> -- HH2 -- The Honor of the Queen<br /> -- HH3 -- The Short Victorious War<br /> -- HH4 --Field of Dishonor<br /> -- HH5 -- Flag in Exile<br /> -- HH6 -- Honor Among Enemies<br /> -- HH7 -- In Enemy Hands<br /> -- HH8 -- Echoes of Honor<br /> -- HH9 -- Ashes of Victory<br /> -- HH10 -- War of Honor<br /> -- HH11 -- At All Costs<br /> -- HH12 -- Mission of Honor<br /> -- HH13 -- A Rising Thunder<br /> -- HH14 -- Shadow of Freedom<br /> Anthologies<br /> -- HHA1 -- More Than Honor<br /> -- HHA2 -- Worlds of Honor<br /> -- HHA3 -- Changer of Worlds<br /> -- HHA4 -- The Service of the Sword<br /> -- HHA5 -- In Fire Forged<br /> -- HHA6 -- Beginnings<br /> Crown of Slaves<br /> -- CS0 -- From the Highlands (Changer of Worlds)<br /> -- CS0 -- Fanatic (The Service of the Sword)<br /> -- CS1 -- Crown of Slaves<br /> -- CS2 -- Torch of Freedom<br /> -- CS3 -- Cauldron of Ghosts<br /> Saganami Island<br /> -- SI1 -- The Shadow of Saganami<br /> -- SI2 -- Storm from the Shadows<br /> -- SI3 -- Shadow of Freedom<br /> Star Kingdom<br /> -- SK1 -- A Beautiful Friendship<br /> -- SK2 -- Fire Season<br /> -- SK3 -- Treecat Wars<br /> Manticore Ascendant<br /> -- MA1 -- A Call to Duty<br /> -- MA2 -- A Call to Arms<br /> -- MA3 -- A Call to Vengeance<br /> Book Companion<br /> -- HOS -- House of Steel:  The Honorverse Companion<br /> -- HOSH -- House of Shadows:  The Honorverse Companion<br /> -- HOL -- House of Lies:  The Honorverse Companion<br /> Jayne’s Intelligence Review<br /> -- JIR1 -- Jayne’s Intelligence Review, Vol. 1 -- The Royal Manticoran Navy<br /> -- JIR2 -- Jayne’s Intelligence Review, Vol. 2 -- The Havenite Republican Navy<br /> -- JIR3 -- Jayne’s Intelligence Review, Vol. 3 -- The Silesian Confederate Navy<br /> Ship Book<br /> -- SB1 -- Ship Book 1:  The Havenite Sector<br /> -- SB2 -- Ship Book 2:  The Silesian Confederacy<br /> -- SB3 -- Ship Book 3:  The Short Victorious Warineering (biological engineering, biological systems engineering, biotechnology), even for the colonization of heavy gravity (gravitation) planets.

B000002KDI|3.0|After reading Garbageman's review, I have to concur: \\"Live Rust\\" is a corporate hack job.  Not only is \\"Cortez the Killer\\" edited, so is the version of \\"Hey Hey My My (Into the Black)\\", at first I thought I was hearing things, but no, I also have the vinyl, and the song is full length on that.  The irritating thing about this is that when Reprise marketed this CD, 74 minutes was the most a disc could theoretically hold.  Since this disc runs 74:31, and they now run 80 minutes or more, (and have since the mid-90s), why wasn't this remastered with the intact songs YEARS AGO???  I have been waiting over ten years for a newly mastered CD of what I previously thought was the single-greatest live concert recording ever, Bar None.  I guess I'll die before they decide to do this disc over.  Neil, are you listening?
B0000028SU|5.0|I recently purchased these (Lucky Town & Human Touch) again after my other copies had been stolen over 10 years ago. After listening, I think I like them more now than I did when they came out! They are some of Bruce's best work and all the better for being pretty under appreciated.
B000YKFJ66|5.0|Can you say Philip K. Dick.  They based this movie on a story by Philp K. Dick.  This was a great movie.  I'm not a huge Nicholas Cage fan but, he was good in this movie.  There were a few cheesy parts but, overall, it was a lot of fun to watch.  The special effects were good and you start getting hooked in right away.

B0010DRYPA|4.0|This film doesn't seem that remarkable by today's standards, but in 1932 it was quite innovative. MGM used an all-star cast in a bracelet of intertwining stories that involved them all. The ballerina (Garbo) misses Russia, feels life is empty and pointless, and is saved from killing herself by the Baron (John Barrymore) who had been planning to steal her jewels to pay a large debt to some shady people that he owes. The stenographer (Joan Crawford) has set her sights on the Baron believing him to be rich, while she is being eyed by her employer, a wealthy industrialist (Wallace Beery) who is the former employer of a dying man (Lionel Barrymore) who intends to spend his life savings experiencing what he has been missing out on all these years, who in turn is befriended by the Baron. The only character who exists in isolation is Garbo's, who has a relationship with the Baron but noone else.<br /><br />This is the only film to ever win the Best Picture Oscar and be nominated for no other awards. This is not because the picture is a poor one. Instead it is probably because there are so many subplots and so many players that it is hard to zero in on any one of them and say a particular link in the chain is outstanding compared to the others and therefore deserves an award. However, altogether, the actors and subplots form an entertaining film. Since this film was such a commercial success the entire formula was reused in \\"Dinner at Eight\\" the following year, and even used part of the cast from this film - John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Beery. Oddly enough that film was superior to \\"Grand Hotel\\" in many ways, but didn't receive any Oscar nominations.<br /><br />Finally, much has been said about Greta Garbo's over-the-top performance in this one. I have to admit, if this was my introduction to Garbo I would be asking myself what is the big deal about her supposed great reputation. She's practically playing Ophelia at certain points in the film. However, if you think about it, Garbo's portrayal is an appropriate one considering her character's circumstances. She was a ballerina in Czarist Russia who has the world ripped out from underneath her as a result of the Russian Revolution. Now, late in her career, she is surrounded by sycophants and isn't even missed when she runs out on a performance. The little documentary that comes with the DVD does a good job of explaining more about Garbo and her performance. There's no commentary track on this DVD. Instead there is a comedy short that parodies \\"Grand Hotel\\" plus some theatrical trailers and movietone extras talking about the premiere of Grand Hotel in addition to the mini-documentary I already mentioned.<br /><br />This latest release is being done for the sake of repackaging the last release. If you have the previous release and you are happy with the packaging, there is no reason to buy this one too.it, Garbo's portrayal is an appropriate one considering her character's circumstances.

0805079831|5.0|The Republicans and most especially this administration have become experts at subverting democratic processes. The examples are too numerous to count, everything from recess appointments and signing statements to the whitening of Louisanna, the privatization of education in New Orleans, and the privatization of our military and emergency services - to name only a few - all done with no debate and no consensus.    Read all about it in The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein - it may well be the most important book you will ever read. Listen to parts 1 & 2 of an interview with her here (it takes a few seconds to download) - the second part of the interview is under the first one:    [...]    The book is meticulously researched and documented. Democracy is a meaningless word if the American people are not aware of what's going on. Folks need to understand that what has happened under this administration is NOT INCOMPETENCE but the systematic carrying out of a well-planned agenda - and only when they are caught red-handed, do they plead incompetence.
1594489505|4.0|you will love this book!  It's set in the same location (Afghanistan), but this time it focuses on girls rather than boys.<br /><br />It is the very sad story of a few Afghan women around the time of the Russian invasion.  It is told from the point of view of someone who lived there and knew women such as these before he (Hosseini) moved to the United States.<br /><br />This one is a real tear-jerker, so be careful where you are when you read the last chapter.  I definitely recommend it.
B00000099Y|5.0|I had the album before this one (Undertow) for a long time.  I liked the album alot.  It was isn't in my top 10 but I enjoyed listening to it from time to time.  Recently on a whim I purchased this album.  I absolutely loved it.  Other people have mentioned Pink Floyd in the same breath as this album and the allusion is apt.  This album is a lot like a good Pink Floyd album (which happens to be my favorite band).  The differences are the unneeded use of profanity (which does not make the music any better and probably reduces sales) and the harder rock edge.  I like the harder edge as it is a nice twist but I don't see the need for profanity.  I guess I am a little prejudiced in that I happen to believe that only dumb people are unable to express themselves without resorting to expletives.      Overall this is a great sounding album but be forewarned that there is lot of f** that and f* this.  It is not a album you want to listen to when your kids are around.
B000RIHBIE|4.0|Although this album is known as being one of Sum 41's most diverse albums, I do feel that there are some hints of the past present in it.  You could start to feel the change in their last album \\"Chuck\\".  I feel this is just a continuation of that album, but with a much improved sound with use of a wider variety of instruments.      I really love the opening and title track, Underclass Hero.  It is filled with energy and a great beat; however, I don't really like the other heavier, faster paced songs, such as March of the Dogs and King of Contradiction, as much.  It just gets old and I want to hear something different for a change.  I enjoy the other slower, more diverse songs more, such as With Me, Best of Me, Walking Disaster, and Dear Father.  They remind of the slower songs on Chuck such as Pieces, which is one of my favorite Sum 41 songs.    Anyway, I definitely recommend this album to Sum 41 fans as well as those who are looking for something new and different.  Older fans will enjoy songs such as Underclass Hero, March of the Dogs, and King of Contradiction.  New fans or fans of the slower Sum 41 songs will take pleasure in the songs With Me, Best of Me, Walking Disaster, and Dear Father.  All in all, this is decent album.
1590171993|5.0|This is a beautifully written, psychologically astute portrait of a man and his life, from his origins as a farm boy, to his awakening to a love of literature at university, to his subsequent problematic marriage and career as a professor.  There isn't a wasted word, and the story is absolutely compelling, which is remarkable given the apparently quotidian nature of the plot, characters and setting.  It's often a sad book, but it is also a profound one, and I found the small victories Stoner achieves to be very satisfying.  Yes, it's an \\"academic novel,\\" but that's really beside the point; it's a smart, engaging, unpretentious book that addresses what it means to be alive, to love, and to work.

0374530718|2.0|Sophie's World is said to be beneficial to Teens in terms of learning the history of philosophy.  It is also a great tool for learning the concise individual biographies of many of the most influential thinkers in world history.  From a Teen's perspective, Sophie's World is a very informative and educational book solely for the purpose of learning about philosophy.  Only by reading closely was I able to identify some of the philosophers' most important ideas and personally compelling sentiments.  Though, as a fictional novel, Gaarder struggled to create an entertaining plot to correspond with such dense material.      His intertwining of philosophical content with poor fiction was ineffective in creating a harmonious combination.  An analogical example of this concept is portrayed within the novel's plot as young Sophie is trapped in a world of fiction and finally escapes to the world of reality.  One could link this to her life emotionally as she grows into womanhood, but why use this analogy in a book on philosophy?    The informative and educational content on philosophy is interesting alone, but the lackluster plot taints the novel as a whole and prolongs the writing to an excessively long piece of literature.
B000I2MRHE|3.0|This tummy time \\"toy\\" is great for a small period between the newborn and crawling timeframes.  If can be used as soon as your baby is able to lift her head up and have decent control (i.e., head isn't too wobbly).    The base spins and allows the baby to see different sections of the mat.  Now, from the picture, it looks as though the baby will be able to spin themselves, but for us that was not the case as my son was not able to push hard enough to spin himself.  So the spinning part will be left to the parents.  He also didn't interact too much with the toys attached to the mat, but that may just be him.  My son loved the section with the mirror and one with a worm on it, but the mat didn't seem to increase his ability/willingness to endure tummy time, but he did seem more content during it.    As soon as he was able to start spinning himself, he as just about to crawl and we preferred putting him flat on the ground and letting him get onto all fours to rock on his hands and knees or army crawl.    Bottom line:  I don't know if its worth getting... any other flat playmat will serve the same purpose...

The plot worked for me and while the movie isn't perfect, it was a darn fun ride, complete with political philosophy, pathos, and some realism.<br /><br />Dare I say that Marky-Mark is turning into a fine actor after watching this and the Departed?  I just might.  Keep up the good work.

0688145078|5.0|Joanna Cole has done it again!  Filled with colorful, eye-catching pictures, this book will keep your son's attention and help prepare him for the baby on the way.  I am 7 months pregnant with our second child, and have begun reading this to my 2-year-old to help prepare him to be a big brother.  I like the fact that this book is geared to him, and helps introduce him to the concept of \\"brother\\" and \\"sister.\\"  Simply written, this book employs large text and basic sentences to hold even the youngest toddler's attention.  As usual, Cole provides factual, accurate information, without going into too much detail.  The book shows a breastfeeding mom, yet informs children that the new baby may get its milk from either Mommy's breast or from a bottle.  I like the fact that the mom is shown nursing the baby, yet the content is not graphic in any way.  At the same time, it doesn't alienate families who will be bottle feeding.  An excellent choice for your growing family!!

B000063UR2|3.0|I rated this item three stars for only one reason -- the original Director's Cut, which was terrible.  I originally saw the theatrical version and loved it, especially the sound track by Tangerine Dream.  Then I got this DVD and eagerly checked out the \\"ultimate version\\".  The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith is really lacking, doesn't add a thing to the ambience of the film, and in this version Tom Cruise comes off as some sort of neanderthal running through the trees and the Princess is a spoiled, brainless little you-know-what.  No thanks, I'll take the theatrical version any day.  Unfortunately, I got the single-disc version for my granddaughter for Christmas (who loves this movie!) as it states on the back that the soundtrack is done by Tangerine Dream and that the disc \\"includes\\" the Director's Cut.  Not true, it's the Director's Cut only.  So now I'm buying the two-disc set so that she will have the theatrical version that she wanted to begin with.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|When I clicked on the movie and scrolled down to the reviews, I fully expected reviewers to bust \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" for its exaggerated action showing McClane coming out of each sequence with minimal injuries. However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much praise the movie had received, not only for the action, but for an aging McClane/Willis. As I continued to read the reviews, the idea of hero archetype began to unfold in my mind.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW<br />If you have seen the movie, please follow the flow of action: Archetypal hero is given a quest (task--Police Chief: Pick up a hacker), overcome all sorts of obstacles (action scenes are plentiful and incredible), rescue the kingdom (United States), kill the villain (hacker supreme), and rescue the princess (daughter, check) and marry her. No, but the subordinate Matt (hacker frontline) is becoming \\"that man\\" and a declaration of interest is made. \\"That man\\" is in reference to Matt's questioning McClane: Why do you do it? Answer: Because I am the only one.<br /><br />With McClane as archetypal hero (think Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo; Viggo Mortensen in LOTR), he must have a specific quest. In this case, Save America from the Fire Sale: Everything must go.\\" Since the beginning, Americans have sought to conquer a frontier. We sailed across the seas in ships. We traveled by wagon over the land until we reached another ocean. We made airships and traveled into space. Americans--always restless, always moving, always seeking. Now cyberspace and virtual reality have become the new frontier.<br /><br />That takes us to the kingdom: cyberspace, specifically America's cyberspace. This film serves as sirens, clanging bells, bullhorns--as warnings that America is under imminent attack from cyberspace terrorists. We had best prepare ourselves. Matt's line: I thought it would be cool to see if it (Fire sale) could be done. McClane: We're not talking about computers here, we're talking about people. This is about people. \\"Fire Sale\\" in cyberspace/hacker terms refers to the destruction of the infrastructure: transportation, utilities, financial institutions, all run by computer.<br /><br />Thomas Gabriel is the Dark Side (Darth Vader), both originally on the kingdom's side, each turning for individual reasons. Gabriel becomes the catalyst for McClane's actions in saving the kingdom. Gabriel explains that it is better for one of \\"us\\" to bring down the kingdom than an outsider. Really? Destruction is destruction is evil.<br /><br />In another point, McClane not only represents the archetypal hero, but portrays some elements of the Wise Old Man, another obvious archetype (Obi Wan Kenobi, Gandalf, Merlin). The very mention of McClane's age invokes this vital archetype--hero into Wise Old Man. If there is a sequel, will John McClane become New York's Chief of Police? No, I see Chief of Homeland Security ahead with Justin Long's Matt as his second in command. What will John do in this position? Is he up to it? I think so. By then he WILL be the Wise Old Man.re Sale\\" in cyberspace/hacker terms refers to the destruction of the infrastructure: transportation, utilities, financial institutions, all run by computer.

If you remember the days of putting on an LP, kicking back in a bean bag chair, and listening to the entire thing start to finish, and remember how GREAT it was...this is the album for you!  Conjure up visions of listening to Quadrophenia, The Wall...you get the point!!!
B000V1MMLI|4.0|I like this album a lot, as well as the messages Serj and SOAD bring through their music without oversaturating (I feel) as Rage sometimes does. I opted for the Limited disks but I feel they fell a bit short with the included extras. Other than that, the main focus, the music, brings a nice range and is a great addition to my playlist. The videos for the tracks add to the depth of the music.

0307346609|3.0|I find that the \\"interviews\\" in this work are an interesting angle to portray a ficticious event set in current times, in a modern form of media/press. Idea was good. But I found myself wanting to \\"just finish the book off\\" about 1/3 to 1/2 way through. As mentioned before in a previous review by another person, the dialect of the characters interviewed is all the same. Sort of like if a bad actor played many different roles without engulfing oneself in their culture or socialogical background. One other minute critique I have is that, just when the interviews are getting interesting, they end and another starts. It could just be me though.<br /><br />Overall, its an interesting book, and if you enjoy short stories you might be more into this than I, since there is a lot of start/stop with the interviews, although they all focus around a central theme. If you are looking for horror, Id look somewhere else.

0375842381|5.0|Many of you may have seen or at least heard of the film \\"The Golden Compass\\" and the controversy surrounding it. The film is an adaptation of the first book of the trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\" which also includes \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and \\"The Amber Spyglass\\". The British author , Philip Pullman, is an outspoken atheist and has been accused of trying to turn children against God in this trilogy. Is there merit to this accusation? I leave that to the reader. I can tell you that the theme of the story is certainly anti abuse of power. The criticism of the books are very simplistic and in my opinion unfair. The books do challenge interpretations of the Hebrew creation myth at the center of Jewish and Christian doctrine. The premise is that all sentient life has been deceived for thousands of years by a being who calls himself \\"God\\" but in fact is a ruthless tyrant who subjugates everyone and demands unquestioned obedience. It is a struggle between His forces and those who would encourage Wisdom and Curiosity in Mankind! Included is the concept that this battle had been fought before but the wrong side won thousands of years ago! Now both sides are getting prepared for a decisive war and the outcome will have profound implications for all the universes. At the center of this story is a young girl named Lyra and a boy named Will whom we meet for the first time in the second novel.  Their decisions will determine the final outcome of the conflict. Another central theme is the concept of \\"Dust\\". This is what the Church (summed up as \\"The Magisterium\\") fears most and wants to destroy at any cost. \\"Dust\\" represents a challenge to the doctrines of the Authority and is considered heresy.     This is a compelling story and hard to put down! The characters are complex and the themes are thought provoking and bold! There are unquestionable parallels to how real life organized religion reacts to anything which challenges it's authority. The cliffhangers in the first two books will leave the reader breathless! This is the boldest and most interesting fantasy adventure I've ever read. I think it's treatment of Biblical themes make it better than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because it has something much more profound to say! An open mind being a prerequisite, I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone who wants a fresh fantasy approach to an age old concept.

Then you got a couple of songs that are ok like \\"cornucopia\\" and \\"tomorrows dreams\\", I think these are the first sabbath songs that didnt make me tremble in excitement, and finally theres one \\"song\\" that i just dont get wich is FX, What the &(%= is that? Instead of making another good song thay had to waste it on this weird track.  Well finally i can say this is a very good sabbath record worth having!
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|The movie 300's visual design was intentionally degraded for a look the director was going for but it's still has great picture quality in my opinion.

I believe this to be a must own, although it may be a little to graphic for younger audiences as well as movie viewers who aren't after violent movies.
0385339704|5.0|Washington wakes up to the gruesome news that two members of the Supreme Court have been murdered overnight. The shocking part was in their diversity. The old, should have retired years ago, Democrat Justice Rosenberg and the younger Republican Justice Jensen. The fact that they were almost always on opposite sides of any issue left law enforcement with no clear political motive. The only clues left behind seemed to be ones of the killer's choosing. A nylon cord used to garrote Jensen as he sat in a movie house watching a porno film. The Rosenberg affair was messy - three people dead, three 22-caliber bullets to the head of each victim Rosenberg, a guard and an aid.<br />Down in bayou country Tulane University law professor Thomas Callahan on hearing the news got roaring drunk to ease the pain. Rosenberg was one of his idols and he couldn't believe the end had come.<br />While the whole country pondered the reason behind the killings Darby Shaw, a bright law student and bed partner of professor Callahan turns sleuth. Ms. Shaw pores over the current Supreme Court docket and eventually comes up with a promising case. And for the next four days she shuffles through pages of affidavits detailing lies and abuses by lawyers and their clients.<br />In the end Darby Shaw writes an eight-page draft of what will later be called the Pelican Brief. Shaw is only half convinced that she is on to something, however, in spite of her skepticism she turns the pages over to Callahan.<br />Callahan attends the Rosenberg funeral in Washington and passes the brief along to a colleague. And once copies of those pages get into the wrong hands Darby Shaw becomes the hunted.<br />John Grisham takes us through a fast paced cat and mouse investigation, and in the end solves the puzzle to everyone's satisfaction.<br /><br />Tom Barnes author of: `The Goring Collection,' `Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone'<br />`The Hurricane Hunters and Lost in the Bermuda Triangle'

B000TEUSJU|2.0|I really debated about whether to bother to write a review of \\"Caligula\\" or just let it sink into obvilion & hopefully out of my mind. I felt the same way about \\"300,\\" but like \\"300\\" I decided to express my thoughts for the record as it were. I usually don't read other customer reviews before I write my own, but I succombed to curiosity & did manage a little peek--then I KNEW i had to say something.<br /><br />The really negative reviews seem to be from people who were disgusted by the X-rated pornography. Well, I can appreciate that view. It seems to me that the people who are REALLY INTO porn basically have unsatisfactory personal sex lives. Why else would you be drawn to something if you're already getting it on a regular basis? I think people who have a healthy sex life find porn to be inevitably boring. In the case of \\"Caligula\\" there is an unrelenting plethora of every kind of imaginable sex act in the book, released as a veritable non-stop action stream throughout every inch & foot of this film. So if naughty sex is what you want, that's exactly what you'll get in viewing \\"Caligula.\\" I mean, the human body can be very beautiful,but there is such a thing as overexposure; just as the movie gets to an interesting point dramatically, group sex is thrown in once again & obliterates any real nuance of the scene.<br /><br />I would say that about 90% of the overall production design is a Fellini ripoff, but without that great director's humanity or humour.<br /><br />What really amazes me is all the time, talent & obulent spending that went into this picture. I agree that Malcom McDowell turns in a stellar performace as ancient Rome's worst Bad Boy. Good heavens, it's even got a young (and pretty hot cookie) Helen Mirren playing good-turned-bad-girl wife of the crazed Caesar. That's right, HELEN MIRREN! She who played Ayn Rand & Queen Elizabeth. In this movie she starts out as a priestess of Isis, then falls for Caligula, and then is literally changed like a dog to him. I know actors have always been identified with prostituion, but this is taking things a bit too far. Mirren must have tried like hell to gather up all the copies of the film she could get her hands on in order to get rid of the evidence.<br /><br />I gave the film 2 stars for shock value, costumes & sets.<br /><br />The only thing I really can't abide about \\"Caligula\\" is how it slanders Pagan culture in general, and the Cult of Isis in particular--but then I don't think anyone involved took this project too seriously.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004U12X I, Claudius]]always been identified with prostituion, but this is taking things a bit too far.

B000W1V5VU|4.0|At the very least, you'll think it was second best of the three movies (at least to date, who knows?).  A fun movie, if only to watch Casey Affleck and Scott Caan play the Mormon twins.  If they hadn't worked with such a ridiculous cast, those two could've stolen the film.

0894803123|5.0|I got this product and the (Cuisinart ICE-20 1-1/2-Quart Automatic Ice Cream, Frozen Yogurt, and Sorbet Maker) for my girlfriend as one of her Christmas gifts and she loved the ice cream maker and this cook book, she was going all through it the first day figuring out which ones she wanted to make first.
0439882826|5.0|I bought this book for my 6 year old son and I enjoy reading it as much if not more than he does. He is amazed at the pop-ups (how do they do it mom?) and I am more amazed because I know how difficult it must have been to create. I bought an extra book for collector purposes, just to have an extra one.
0764110284|5.0|I've just come from a tutoring session with an adult Russian student; she was so pleased with this book that I let her keep my copy and returned home to order another for myself, its modest price being yet another inducement for purchase. The book is lucid, well-organized, and thorough. While I explain by paraphrase, analogy, and mime, here the phrases are defined precisely, with variations made explicit. As a native speaker, I found myself not only informed but also delighted by some of the book's definitions.  It seems to cover the most common phrasal verbs non-native speakers encounter and understand in context but are otherwise flummoxed by.  For a student who speaks competently but wants to \\"sound more American,\\" this book is an ideal resource.
B000VWYJ8Q|1.0|I think that the story follows the first two, and it has some good action.  My problem is with the DVD itself, it would freeze every two minutes and at some point it just froze so badly that i couldnt even get the DVD out of the DVD player, extremely bad quality DVD, very frustrating.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|With its clever, moving script and wonderful performances this remains the classic version of the tale of the department store Santa who maybe really is Santa--depending on your point of view. Edmund Gwenn is terrific as the old guy and the young Natalie Wood (who apparently really believed he was Santa during the filming) is the perfect little skeptic-turned believer. As well as the original black and white film this set includes the colorized version(forget that)and interesting background features, including an interview with Irish actress Maureen O'Hara, who played Natalie Wood's mother.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|This movie's story is somewhat shallow and I never really cared about the characters. Do not, I repeat, \\"Do Not\\" spend extra money to own this on Blu-ray its just not worth it. The movie is extremely grainy and may have been done this way purposefully. My point is if you can get it on DVD for a fraction of the cost go that route. The CGI is impressive at times but never really excellent. When its all said and done 300 is a movie you will soon forget.
0786838655|5.0|I bought this book (and its two sequels) for my 13-year-old for Christmas, and I've finished the Lightning Thief already (he doesn't know that I've read ahead).  In short - it's GREAT.<br /><br />The book takes place in the US, primarily in New York, but also in St. Louis, Denver, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. It's full of Greek myths that have been given a modern feel - what is remarkable is that they CAN be updated, and not feel ... well, old or out-of-place. The hedonism of the old stories fits rather well into our modern society. Not to worry - the books are not sordid or inappropriate for the intended age group, however.<br /><br />The idea is that the Greek gods haven't stopped their old shenanigans, and are still producing children with mortals.  These kids are still being turned into heroes, and are still being hunted by monsters, due to the old rivalries between the gods.<br /><br />In this particular book, something very, very important has been stolen (you might be able to guess from the title), and the blame is being handed to one particular god, the one who happens to be Percy's father. That puts Percy in EXTREME danger.  So he goes on a quest with some new friends (a satyr and a wise girl) to try and clear his father's name.  Along the way, he has to learn about his powers, defeat some monsters, and learn to believe in himself.<br /><br />The book is funny, and exciting, and I think any kid - boy or girl - over the age of 8 or so would love it. And their parents will get a kick out of the mythology they thought they'd forgotten from high school.

B000VWE5OY|4.0|Torchwood is a great sci-fi show for adults.    I give it 4 stars because it is a spin-off; like most spin-offs, I think it still needs a little time to find its \\"place.\\"    **Minor spoilers may be scattered through the rest of the review.**    Some of the episodes probably make more sense if you also watch Dr. Who. But it isn't essential to have watched the Cybermen try to take over in Dr. Who in order to understand that Ianto's girlfriend barely survived when aliens tried to turn her into a robot. In fact, considering some of the poor reviews, it may be better if you did not know much about Dr. Who.     One complaint I read, if I remember correctly, complained that Captain Jack was not as light-hearted as he was in Dr. Who. But Torchwood's Jack is a much different person than the Captain Jack in the first 2 seasons of Dr. Who. Torchwood's Jack has been stuck on Earth for over 100 years... making friends, falling in love, only to watch them grow old and/or die. That's enough to make anyone cynical.    Most of the complaints posted center around the sex in the show. It is definately an adult show! I think there are times that the sex detracts from the episode, but other times it adds a subtle nuance to the scene. But, since season 1 is only 13 episodes, I have hope that this will improve.    What I find funny- Torchwood is a \\"secret facility\\", a \\"covert operation.\\" Yet they have Torchwood spraypainted on the wall of their hidden base, drive around in big SUVs with Torchwood painted on the sides and the top of the vehicle, and Owen routinely orders pizza using the name Torchwood! I guess there's secret and then there's secret.    All in all, Torchwood is a great show. I would recommend it to any adult fan of science fiction.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|When this imaginative series first came on DVD, I took a chance knowing the creative genius of ALIAS' JJ Abrams and watched and was hooked from the get go. I especially liked the back stories of this fascinating cast of characters as they cope with their mysterious new 'home'. Characters we grow to like meet untimely deaths and in season three, one of those will be sadly missed. (Methinks it's back to Hobbitland for him.) Lost third season is most entertaining as we get to know 'the others' who continue to torment the castaways. This season's finale is a knockout with a cliffhanger to top 'who shot JR'. Were the 'survivors' really rescued? Will I have to wait until Dec 2008 for season 4 to appear on DVD? It seems ABC sees fit to bombard us with commercials every 8 minutes and this really bugs me.
1932100660|4.0|This book has changed our lives.  I had heard about this book, but not about what it recommended, so I began reading it with high hopes of learning about diet and nutrition, but not sure of what I would find.  The evidence presented in this book is nothing short of amazing.  It has convinced us to completely change our diets.    The one problem that I have with the book is that it stops just short of completion.  He talks about the importance of the scientific method, and criticizes others who make assumptions, but he never actually tests his final assumptions.  He advocates a vegan diet, but none of his tests actually deal with people on vegan diets.  Instead, he infers that because people who have the least amount of animal products in their diet are the healthiest, that a complete abstention from animal products is the answer.  I'd prefer to see some actual tests of this.  There ought to be enough vegetarians and vegans who believe that their diet is the best and who would be willing to be a part of a study to prove this.  But he never seemed to actually take that final step.    Still, though, the other evidence is very compelling to at least cut back drastically on animal products, and that is what my family has done. For the past four weeks since we got this book and started reading it, we have almost completely eliminated meat and dairy from our diet. We're not ultra strict about it, because it would simply be too difficult to function in our current society to worry about every ingredient.  But our diet and outlook have changed radically, and it's because of the way that Dr. Campbell and his son presented the evidence in this book.
B0001I562I|5.0|I am so happy that this Disney film was finally converted to DVD format.  Both my son and daughter are extras in the very beginning of this movie.  They filmed for three days and after all the editing and cutting was done they appear for approximately \\"30 seconds.\\"  It still is a sweet 30 seconds to me.  I had to have a copy for each of us so I bought 3 copies.  By the way, it is a very cute story and Sarah Jessica Parker has come a long way since this was filmed.
B0000028RR|5.0|Pre-Script: the reason I refer to the band as RATM throughout rather than the simple \\"Rage\\" is because I take my reviews seriously and I like to be as proper and precise with them as I can. \\"Rage\\" is a band hailing from Germany, although popular in the U.S. that plays Hard Rock, but it they are not \\"Rage Against the Machine\\". Also, This being my first review I want people to get used to my format and how I write my reviews. I thoroughly break down and discuss each song (if reviewing a CD) and then give it a number rating _/10.      That out of the way, My Review:      This is the best RATM album out there. Personal Favorites/ highlights include \\"Bombtrack\\", \\"Killing in the Name\\",\\"Take the Power Back\\", \\"Settle for Nothing\\", \\"Bullet in the Head\\", \\"Know your Enemy\\", \\"Wake Up\\", \\"Fistful of Steel\\", \\"Township Rebellion\\", and \\"Freedom\\". I just realized I named every song on the album. This is practically a greatest hits album. Every album of theirs is a hit, this and Evil Empire being the best.       I'm going to thoroughly breakdown and discuss each song now so you can really understand what RATM is all about and so you can better understand and prepare yourself to listen to this.      The opener \\"Bombtrack\\" is a song about the media and how it twists the mind and helps to influence how people view political factors. \\"see through the news and the views that twist reality\\". On the musical side, the beat/rhythm of \\"Bombtrack\\" is pretty catchy and loud as well. 9/10        \\"Killing in the Name\\" is a good track, and is one of my favorites (beyond this album; by RATM in general) with a catchy guitar riff, a simple yet outstanding bass interlude, awesome drumming ( I like the cowbell addition myself), and a catchy end mantra of \\"____ YOU I WON'T DO WHAT YA TELL ME!\\". This is a good track, however it's got 5 lines of lyrics. slogan after slogan: \\"Some of those that work forces\\" :those that died are justified for wearing thee badge and the chosen white\\", etc. The lyrics allegethat some officers of the Police Force and  the government in general are racist and are members of the KKK. This song goes beyond that topic, however, and becomes a great rebellion track towards the end, becoming loud. this song also has a GREAT solo. 10/10      \\"Take the Power Back\\"'s track title is pretty self-explanatory\\" The U.S. has too much power and is abusing it, and us as Americans must \\"Take the Power Back\\"! \\"Bam here's the plan, Mother ____ Uncle Sam!\\" and the vocal interlude in the middle is amazing. (BUY THIS! and you'll see what I mean!). This song has incredible guitars that sound \\"anti guitar\\", an over-rated bassline (it's good, but it's not the best bassline RATM has like some people say it is), and outstanding double bass drumming (it's not heavy metal fast DB drumming like you're thinking, it's a simple, catchy, yet AMAZING! two-foot tap or boom boom. (BUY THIS! and you'll see what I mean!). A Personal Favorite with another great solo and a semi-melodic ending, \\"TTPB\\" is an easy... 10/10      \\"Settle for Nothing\\" was the first RATM song to feature melody. A soft Bassline starts off the song, and then it erupts into a loud scream. This song toggles that format throughout: Loud, Soft, L, S. s all great RATM songs do, this song has another great solo. Enough said... 9/10      \\"Bullet in the Head\\" is my personal favorite tied with the next 2 songs and has a funky bassline that gets my vote as the best bassline RATM has. the guitars on \\"BITH\\" are really high pitched and \\"anti-guitar\\" sounding again. The drumming is slow and then  switches up to a bit faster before the solo (sort of like a drum bridge) and then when the guitars erupt at the end, Brad's drums switch up again to fast, thrashy, and perfect in this mix. \\"BITH\\" is about propogand on television and how it influences people's minds and opinions on political matters. Tom uses amp feedback to create an incredible solo for this song. One of RATM's heaviest songs and A Personal Favorite (yet again) ... 10.5/10      \\"Know your Enemy\\" is my number one favorite song on here, tied with \\"Wake up\\" and the former. \\"KNE\\" starts off with a catchy toggle switch riff (Tom turns one pickup to 0 and the other to 10/11 (full) and uses the pickup selector to toggle between the two) and then turns into a regular guitar riff. It features a catchy, heavy bridge (part of a song before the solo) feturing Maynard james keenan from Tool on vocals, and then Zack taking over with \\"Know your enemy!!!!!!\\" and that is suceeded by an awesome yet complex, highly technical solo with many parts to it. \\"KNE\\" alleges that America touts itself as \\"the land of the free\\"  yet lies and behind the rest of the world's back takes freedom away. Listen to the ending vocals: \\"YES I KNOW MY ENEMIES, THEY'RE THE TEACHERS THAT TOLD ME TO FIGHT ME: COMPROMISE, CONFORMITY, ASSIMMILATION, SUBMISSION, IGNORANCE, HYPOCRICY, BRUTALITY, THE ELITE, ALL OF WHICH ARE AMERICAN DREAMS!\\" 10.5/10      \\"Wake Up\\" is my favorite song tied with both of the formers. \\"Wake up\\" starts out with an awesome bassline overdubbed with a highly experimental guitar, and  awesome drumming (my favorite to air drum to).Later in the song, tom creates a catchy-as-hell solo using a talkbox (that patented box that was made famous almost single handedly by Peter Frampton), followed Zack whispers \\"what was the price on his head\\" and then 5 seconds later \\"WHAT WAS THE PRICE ON HIS HEEEAAAADDD!!!!!\\" and then nothing but drums can be heard. After that, a bass interlude takes up about 30 seconds of time, and then Zack screaming \\"WAKE UP!!!!!!\\" 8 times, and that is suceeded by an awesome solo that is probably my favorite solo on this album (tied with the next songs solo). \\"Wake Up\\" is pretty much a message to the listener: het man \\"WAKE UP!!!!!\\" don't believe the propoganda, AMERICA SUCKS!, etc. 10.5/10      \\"Fistful of Steel\\" is an awesome song as well, probably my 2nd favorite on the disc. \\"FOF\\" starts out with an odd sounding guitar (Tom scratches the strings with his pick while rapidly moving the whammy bar) and then the guitar switches to a catchy riff, underdubbed/supported by bass- and drum-work. \\"FOF\\" has an AWESOME solo (Tom slides his guitar slide up and down on the string while flipping the toggle switch up and down rapidly to create a flippin awesome effect!). \\"If the vibe was suicide, then you would push the button, but if you're bowing down THEN LET ME DO THE CUTTING! YEAH!!!\\". Zack alleges that if suicide was the issue it's your doing, your choice, YOU'D push the button, but if you're bowing down to the system let him or anybody elese do the cuttin, because you're better off alone or dead. Excellent song off of an excelllent album... 10.5/10      \\"Township Rebellion\\" has an awesome/weird bassline, I've never really payed attention to the drumming, and guitar sound that I can only guess as to how to even emulate it. Another technical, complex solo with many parts to it goes into making this song even better, and the lyrics are  better yet: \\"Why can't freedom be fundamnetal, from Johannesburg to South central, on the mic yes someone should tell them to kick it to the township rebellion\\" \\"Why stand on a silent platform, fight the war, ____ the norm!\\". Zack is saying that african cities (i.e. Johannesburg) do not have freedom and is talking about slave rebellions (like the Stono rebellion). Zack also makes references to the American Revolutionary War. 10/10      \\"Freedom\\" is an excellent finisher (my personal favorite, better than \\"Evil Empire\\"'s \\"Year of the Boomerang and a great breakdown song. this is one of RATM's heaviest songs and a personal favorite. This song was definitely made for Zack's vocals (he's got so much to say in this song he has rap fast just to make it sound in place). The intro is real heavy and fast, and The first verse is all bass, drums, and vocals until the next verse and the solo. After the solo Zack shouts \\"Shot-Back!\\" and then a really cool bass/guitar breakdown occurs. the end is \\"Freedom Yeah\\" \\"Freedom, Yeah right\\" \\"Freedom.... YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! \\"Freedommmmmmm!!! Yeah!!!!!\\" (and repeat that about 8 times). Zack tells the story of Leonard Peltier in this song. Leonard Peltier was the leader of the Native American Indian Movement of the late 70's. he was convicted of killing 2 FBI agents (he's innocent though) and was thrown in jail. The government actually found evidence of his innocence but they decided to cover it up. Today, leonard still sits in that jail cell that he's been in since 1980-something. Zack, however, is speaking about freedom for everyone in the U.S. though. 10/10        I would also like to say the liner notes, too, are very interesting, an awesome picture of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc burning himself to death at a protest for freedom in vietnam 1963, and liner notes are interesting, Zack thanking everybody from Chuck D. of Public Enemy to Ian Mckaye of minor threat and his Weird, ascetic dad. Lyrics to every song are included except for \\"Killing in the Name\\" in which the liner notes display    2.) Killing in the Name  and thenskip to track 3 \\"take the Power back\\"'s lyrics.      I hope I've been helpful and REALLY RECOMMEND that you BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY!!! BUY 2 copies!      Zack is a great lyricist and makes you think while having a good time about what his lyrics mean, Brad is a great, fast drummer, Tim Bob is a great bassit, and Tom Morello isn't just great , he's one of the best, most technical guitarists in the world.      This is an incredible album and is the Magnum Opus of my CD case. I honestly consider this a prized posession of mine, when I get some extra cash, I'm going to BUY A 2nd copy. BUY \\"RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE\\" TODAY!!! (if you BUY THIS new, RATM gets 50% royalties) TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! Every song on here is a masterpiece.        I also recommend:    \\"Evil Empire\\" (April 16th, 1996) by RATM    \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" (Nov. 2nd, 1999) by RATM    \\"Renegades\\" (Dec. 5th, 2000) by RATM    \\"Live & Rare\\" (1998) by RATM    \\"Live at Grand Olympic Auditorium\\" (2003)by RATM    \\"Live at Grand Olympic Auditorium\\"(DVD) (2003) by RATM    \\"The Battle of Mexico City\\" by RATM (DVD)(Feb,2001)    \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" (DVD)(1997) by RATM    \\"Significant Other\\" (1999) by Limp Bizkit    \\"3 Dollar Bill Y'all\\" (1997) by Limp Bizkit    \\"The Real Thing\\" (1989) by Faith No More    \\"Solid Gold Hits\\" by Beastie Boys (2005)    \\"Licensed to Ill\\" by Beastie Boys (1986)    \\"Power to the People and the Beats\\" by Public Enemy      Well my hands are tired as ____. My future reviews probably won't be quite this long (by the way)        Credits:      Zack De la Rocha-Vocals    Tom Morello-Guitars    Tim Bob-Bass/Backing Vocals    Brad Wilk-Drums    Produced by GGGarth    MJK-vocals on bridge of \\"Know Your Enemy\\"      Thank You for reading! :)
B000000OU0|5.0|This album is truly the Eagles at their best - unlike most mediocre live performance recordings, this album lets you hear the articulation on the guitars, the roughness in the voice, the cheer of the crowd - every detail.    The performances are exquisite, from the unique solos in Hotel California to the lyrical wonder of \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\".  Every second of this album is pure audio  bliss.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.
159102594X|1.0|The first book in Joe Abercrombie's \\"The First Law\\" series, entitled The Blade Itself, will feel very familiar to most veteran fantasy readers because it is essentially a duller version of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire books.  Without too much effort it is probably possible to match up each character in Abercrombie's book with one of Martin's characters (Abercrombie's tortured torturer Sand dan Glokta and Martin's beloved imp, Tyrion Lannister, are only the most obvious).  The setting of a British isles inspired medieval land is also generally the same, as is the vague menace in the North and a variety of other plot parallels.  Usually a comparison to Martin would be glowing praise, but in this case, Abercrombie does a C or C- job of mimicry at best.  The dialogue fizzles, the plot is ponderous and without twists, the villains are not particularly compelling and neither are the heroes.  In fact Abercrombie, despite packing his novel with torture, blood, romance, swordplay and magic, manages to turn out a boring and completely forgettable addition to the fantasy genre.  The only high point in the whole book is Glotka's two dentists speech, but it is short and the meme of toothlessness is otherwise beaten to death.  I have nothing against Abercrombie's use of the sincerest form of flattery itself, but the copy must still hold some weight on its own and not make the reader want to simply put it down half-way-through and pick up the original.
B00007KMOX|5.0|Kleiber's recording of the Fifth Symphony has long been hailed as one of the definitive performances of the work - its musical virtues are unquestionable.  This SACD master is the best version of the disc yet - notably cleaner than the CD master and better in my opinion than even the vinyl version.
B00009RDGA|5.0|I first saw this movie in 1994 on AMC (American Movie Classics). My mother told me about it and that she saw it when it was in theaters. I really loved it and always will. Tatum O'Neal was terrific as Addie, the orphaned girl who goes around the country with Moses Pray, who is a con artist selling bibles (played by Ryan O'Neal). They were both great in this movie. Any person who sees this movie for the first time will almost get the impression that it was made in the 1930s, but will be told that it was made in '73. The movie does have the period look and feel, such as the fashions, the music heard, and the cars that were around from that era. And yes, the film is shown in black and white to give it the style (this film would NOT have had the look and feel if it were shot in color. This also applies to \\"The Last Picture Show\\", which was also a period movie; taking place in the early '50s, though made in 1971). I have always found Addie to be funny, especially in the scene in the diner when she and Moses are eating, and she is griping about wanting her $200 (that made me laugh). I also thought Madeline Kahn was funny as well, who played Miss Trixie Delight. The scene where Miss Trixie walks up the hill to talk with Addie (and trips on it) is side-splitting also. PJ Johnson (who played Imogene, Miss Trixie's maid), was brilliant. Their screen time was minimal, but they were funny. Peter Bogdanovich did great directing the film as well. There are some special features, as well, such as widescreen viewing, Peter's commentary during the film, which is interesting, because he will fill you in on how certain scenes were done, etc. There is also a documentary that profiles the making of the movie, which makes a nice addition to this movie. Any person who is a fan of this movie must get it and add it to their movie collection. Kudos to the actors for their great performances in this movie and Peter Bogdanovich for his directing. Way to go!! This will always be one of my mostfavorites!
B0000VCZK2|1.0|This would be a really great set if the discs were not damaged--they really should do a recall.  Like many others apparently, I started watching the first disc only to have it start skipping badly about 1hr. in.  I figured it was just a little smudge or dust on the disc & was horrified to see that there were large scuffs on the DVD.  I examined a couple others and found damage to them as well.        Go with the individual 2-disc releases; I've heard they don't have these quality control issues.
0743554450|5.0|We first listened to Kite Runner which provided a glimse of male society in Afghanistan and life as an expatriate in the US and took us back into the Taliban controlled Afghanistan.  The world in a Thousand Splendid Suns is smaller.  Women confined to life in the shadows of society.  And yet, finding meaning, love and a glimmer of hope. I would strongly recommend listening to Kite Runner first and then A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|What an unfortunate movie. The packaging promised some lovely post-production work - a gritty, grainy flick. Unfortunately, however, the scenes inserted for this 'director's cut' missed out on the post work that the rest of the film benefited from, resulting in lovely dark shots punctuated with slightly washed-out footage (low-contrast, almost MiniDV-like).    Adding to the bizarre graded/ungraded footage was a strange blend of fine-tuned shots which clashed quite blatantly with rather amateurish hand-held action (usually poorly graded, and clearly part of the director's cut inserts). This quasi-verité style wouldn't have felt out of place in a film school mid-term project.    Overall bland pacing with some side-stories that were left underexplored - is the Li Gong's character a key part of this drug lord's empire (in which case it makes sense for her to control large parts of his dealings) or is she just a throw-away member of his harem (as suggested toward the end of the film)?    Jamie Foxx is quite obviously punching his timecard and collecting his paycheque on this one. No energy, no vitality, no damn good. A hint of character escapes him in his bedroom scene, but remains safely stowed away at all other times.    Colin Farrell's most passionate moment also arises in a weak bedroom scene; he too manages to suppress any emotion or reaction even as Li Gong's character supplies the blatant prompt at the film's conclusion.    Li Gong manages to escape the director's attempts at suppressing all emotion, giving the film one or two solid moments. Her character is, however, somewhat diffuse and she thus avoids being given too much credit.    This is well worth watching as an example of how to take a movie budget, some solid actors, a decent franchise, and some good-looking marketing and still manage to produce a load of tosh.
B000ZOW96Y|4.0|I loved this movie, but also had it deleted from my files before I'd even had a chance to see it. I got it as a .99 special, so I just downloaded it again...and paid for it again as well.  I was planning on watching it the following day with my S.O., but once again found it had disappeared from my video files.  So, unless you're ok with taking a chance on paying for a movie you might not even get the chance to watch, you might want to steer clear of this one.    Just the same, I did enjoy the movie itself, and for that reason alone I gave it 4 stars.  Would have had 5 if Amazon hadn't been so crappy about it.
B000UOOT1W|4.0|As  previously noted, this collection concentrates on Santana's legendary early work and his \\"comeback' collaborative work.  A huge chunk of his often maligned but occasionally brilliant material from circa mid-70's thru the 90's is not represented.    What was perplexing on this disc was the inclusion of a previously unreleased version of \\"The Game of Love\\" featuring Tina Turner. Turner of course does a solid job with the vocal but the song is just so much better suited to the youthful voice of Michelle Branch, whoose \\"Shaman\\" version is ALSO included. Just leads one to speculate how Tina Turner's talents could fit with one of Santana's darker compositions, say, like \\"Evil Ways\\".    Overall this collection flows well and I caught myself really enjoying the Jennifer Lopez collaboration \\"This Boy's Fire\\" although I am hardly a hip-hop fan. That song and Rob Thomas' \\"Smooth\\" stand out among the best of Santana's more recent work. The working in of the very best of Carlos Santana's groundbreaking late 60's/early 70's material and the new collaborations probably make this one of your best choices for an indoctrination to anybody just becoming interested in Carlos Santana.

B00005214X|5.0|In 1970, twenty-seven-year-old singer/songwriter George Harrison had, for a few years, heaped quite an assortment of songs he never got to record or release as a member of The Beatles, which had broken up only a few months prior. George pondered how life was going to be or how it was to continue after having been one of the Fab Four for so long. Upon resolve, he was going to make excellent use of those songs which never made it to vinyl and was thus going to come out in full force as a solo artist.     To carry out his mission, he enlisted the services of producer Phil Spector and hauled in the ranks of several renowned musicians, including Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr. George Harrison was to start a project that was going to show the world that there was more to him than just the Quiet Beatle who was, in a creativity context, subordinated notches below the Lennon/McCartney duo. The fruit of his efforts would be a landmark album by the name of All Things Must Pass. Thanks to the volume of music that would be contained, it would have a unique, marketing distinction of its own: while Dylan's Blonde on Blonde is officially recorded in the annals as the first ever double-LP, Harrison's new work entered the stores as the first triple-disc collection comprised only of previously unreleased material.     Back then, and even in retrospect, one can agree that Harrison's option to issue his first solo material in this fashion was, to say the least, a very bold move. Fortunately, for him and the music world, it was to be a successful decision that would make Mr. Harrison a chart-topper in the singles and album categories.    Among the tunes that would help bring All Things Must Pass to the forefront and generate massive sales are the top 10 hits, the double-A single My Sweet Lord/Isn't It a Pity, which spent 4 weeks at #1 and was the first chart-topping single from a former Beatle, and What Is Life. Included in the set are the Bob Dylan contributions, I'd Have You Anytime andIf Not for You.      To music fans, there are so many reasons that point to the success of All Things Must Pass, but there is a tie that binds them all. It is, simply put, a most enjoyable, though sometimes poignant, set of tracks that, altogether, touch the soul to the degree that even Bob Geldof unequivocally calls it the greatest album ever released by a former Beatle. Indeed, it has some very uplifting tunes, which, IMHO, comprise the very best portions, including the electric Wah-Wah, the Wagnerian Let It Down, the wistful Run of the Mill, which is followed by the bluesy and symphonic Beware of Darkness. Apple Scruffs, The Art of Dying, and Awaiting on You All cannot be denied, nor can the title track itself.    Subsequent to the main body of this masterpiece are what might be regarded as the equivalent of B-side recordings that nonetheless serve a purpose. This middle set provides a smooth segue to the final portions, which are instrumental recordings that have been identified and immortalized as The Apple Jam. Beginning with Plug Me In and concluding with Out of the Blue, The Apple Jam was a free-for-all for George Harrison and his band mates to let it rip and ride to the end.     Containing the picture of the distinguished, long-haired George Harrison alongside some garden gnomes on the front cover, All Things Must Pass, visually interesting and sonically appealing, was recorded at number 437 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 500 greatest albums of all time and is certified as the best selling album by a former Beatle. In fact, it outsold the first solo offerings of John Lennon (Plastic Ono Band) and Paul McCartney (McCartney) combined. No small feat, to say the very least!    Thanks for the great memories, George.
B000WZAE1I|1.0|Stardust is a fantasy movie directed by Matthew Vaughn in 2007.  Basically it's big time Hollywood's response to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.     It stars a couple of old warhorses, Michelle Pfiefer and Robert Deniro in supporting roles.  Michelle Pfiefer was so-so as the evil witch Lamia, at least the role was something she had life experience with.    Robert Deniro role, on the other hand, as the in-and-out-of-the-closet Captain Shakespeare was the biggest, lamest ego trip I've seen a major Hollywood actor make since Ishtar.  I cannot possibly convey to you how bad, annoying, and downright irritating Deniro was in this movie.  I am Robert Deniro fan, I think he is one of the finest actors of our time.  But this movie made me hate him in ways I would have never imagined, and every other movie he has made in his life will be forever tainted in my mind by this abyssmal performance.    The Hindenburg was a disaster, Hurricane Katrina was a disaster, the tsunami in Indonesia was a disaster, World War II was a disaster, but they all pale in comparison to Deniro's performance in this movie.    It's really too bad.  Neil Gaiman wrote a clever and entertaining story.  Claire Danes was very good as the star Yvaine.  Charlie Cox, was a little too smirking in his role as Tristan.  But Ian McKellan's narration was top notch, and the special effects were superb.    There are parts of this movie that I truly enjoyed and would love to watch again, but I honestly can't watch Deniro's performance without losing my lunch.    Thanks Bob.
B000I2J79K|4.0|Great sound, especially the Chicago horn section. One thing, this is one the first HD DVDs out I guess and the menu doesn't work while playing like other newer discs. So you can't be playing one song, go into the menu for playlist and jump to another song.

159102594X|3.0|Logen Ninefingers is a homeless, battle-scarred barbarian, hoping to live one more day.  Jezal dan Luthar is a conceited rake with the vague ambition of winning an annual fencing contest.  Sand dan Glotka, who won such a contest years ago, is a torture-crippled torturer in the Union's Inquisition, rooting out whatever truths or half-truths will please his superiors (if not the Union's senile king).  Ferro Maljinn is an escaped slave, lean and feral, seeking vengeance against the empire that destroyed her people.<br /><br />Against the backdrop of the mysterious agenda of the wizard Bayaz and an invasion by a new barbarian king, first-time author Joe Abercrombie slowly weaves together the violent lives of these four to open his First Law trilogy.  It's difficult to elaborate further without providing spoilers, but suffice it to say that so much of the story remains in the shadows that readers seeking closure may wish to wait until the trilogy is completed.<br /><br />The Blade Itself--its title taken from a quotation attributed to Homer--is reminiscent of two other recent debuts by young authors: The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss and The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch.  All three are lengthy, unfinished tales with competent writing and world-building, as well as displays of intelligence by the authors in striving to avoid, or at least execute freshly, fantasy cliches.  That said, even taking into account Mr. Abercrombie's hard-boiling of his prose to evoke the grit of his characters and their surroundings, TBI is distinctly the least well-written and -imagined of the three.  (With regard to world-building, a map would have helped.)  Mr. Abercrombie shows a knack for portraying hard-edged, brutally realistic characters scarred by their pasts--Logen, Glotka, Ferro--but his portrayal of the naive Jezal pales by comparison.  On the other hand, a few displays of humanity throughout the tale are surprising and well-executed, as are some instances of dialogue and the repetition of certain phrases.  As a final note, this reader found the liberal use of real-world profanities and grammatical errors distracting.<br /><br />If it were a restaurant, TBI would never be mistaken for a fine-dining establishment, but it stands up well as a bar and grill welcoming to guys and gals with the time to overlook slow service and who enjoy peanut shells on the worn, wooden floor and plenty of red meat.  Recommended as a library loan for everyone else.  3-1/2 blood-and-mud-crusted stars.on of certain phrases.

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I've read many of the reviews and was shocked that anyone who enjoys Celine Dion's voice could write a negative review.  If they don't care for her, why review?  This is the most stunning DVD I've seen to date.  I'm upset it's not yet in Hi Def.  I will buy that when it's released.  I just couldn't wait that long.  We saw the show when she was blonde and but other than the hair, the show was mesmerizing.  On DVD it is even more riviting because of the close-ups and smooth transitions.  I will cherish this DVD for years to come.  I think she has the most beautiful voice of our generation.  She's in complete control of her music at all times.  Never a faulty note or misstep.  I really do get chills when I hear her sing.  I know many of you didn't care for her new album, Taking Chances, but I think it, too, is stunning.  She's different on some of the songs, but so what.  She's versitile. To those of you who don't like this concert, get over it.  We true fans are thrilled.  I can't wait to see her when she comes to my area next year.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is a great cd. The music hits you upside the head every time. Rare in modern music. Amazon sent me a copy that has the last track screwed up. Instead of the track I should have, I have half of it, then a blank gap, then finally a different song not from the album. This is my second intl cd order that has had a problem. I won't be doing this again. Amazon wrote they would give me a $20 refund on the total order but it hasn't shown up on my card balance yet. This order took me 10 emails. I give Amazon 2 stars. Quality counts for long term intl customers.
B000CNFC76|5.0|I have seen many golf movies but this is the best of the lot.  This is a movie that is more than just for golfers.  My wife even enjoyed it and she thinks that watching golf is about as exciting as watching paint dry.  I would give it four and one half out of five.
0786852550|5.0|I started to read this book expecting it to be Harry Potter-esque and was very surprised to find this book to stand on it's own and never make me feel that it was trying to be a Harry Potter knock-off. The Amulet of Samarkand stands on it's own and I can't wait to read the rest of the Bartimaeus Trilogy!

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I never made it to Vegas to see Celine's show live so was very pleased they released this on DVD. I enjoy Celine very much but can't say she is my #1 favorite artist. However this DVD absolutely blew me away. I have watched the concert 3 times in the last 3 days! Her voice and performance are great, the dancers are wonderful and visuals are amazing. (That 10 million dollar LED screen WAS worth the money!!) The back-stage feature is really interesting and well done and gives you an idea of the hard work and experience of what it's like to be involved in the production. Definitely worth 2 hours of your time. The other, more interview style, featurette is also informative and very interesting. I have since watched the fan tribute several times and have found it very touching and enjoyable to watch as well. This is a must have for anyone who likes or loves Celine, or just a fantastic, entertaining show.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I like this movie just as much as my kids do.  I think it's more fun than HSM1.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|The fourth season of NCIS is great entertainment, just like the three before it!  NCIS has some of the best characters on TV: Gibbs (intense), Tony (playboy), Ducky (quirky), Abby (funny) and all the rest of the cast.  I have to admit, I miss Kate's character, but I've warmed up to Ziva.  And she is the reason Gibbs returns to NCIS at the start of this season after he had retired to Mexico.<br /><br />One thing that makes the show great is there is so much camaraderie among the cast.  Whether they're solving a crime or just giving each other grief, there is great chemistry there.<br /><br />My husband and I love the show, and will continue to watch NCIS for as long as it runs!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Great movie series! I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He watched the whole thing in less than three days.  It is a bit graphic with the injuries and battle schenes.  If you aren't into blood and violence this is not for you.  It is however, historically accurate and informative.  Really gives you a sence of what the soldiers really experienced.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Like so many others who prefer Harrison Ford's narration in the 1982 theatrical release, I too have waited 25 years for this day to come. I'm glad someone at Warner Brothers decided to release what is probably the most popular version of Bladerunner, regardless of what Mr. Ridley thinks!
B000WQW988|5.0|I am a big Nirvana fan and when I heard the Unplugged MTV concert was for sale on dvd, I just had to get it. I had seen this concert the night it was first aired on MTV and I loved it. This is the last live performance that Kurt Cobain ever gave before his tragic death. This acoustic performance is among Nirvana's best. The power of Kurt's voice is breathtaking. This performance proves that Nirvana was one of the greatest and most talented bands ever. The best performance, in my opinion, is \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\". Kurt does this song all by himself and it showcases the true talent that he possessed. This is such a great concert because it was performed in front of a very small audience and in an intimate setting. Very nicely done. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who loves Nirvana. You won't be disappointed!
B000W7205O|5.0|Hero genuinely impressed me, much to my surprise - I'm not a fan of the humourlessly one-note Jet Li, who has always struck me as a character from Mystery Men who didn't make the final cut (useless `super' power - the ability to wave a flagpole around very, very fast) and after all the fuss made over the tedious, overlong and undernourished Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was expecting the Western critical praise to translate into another tired and overfamiliar movie that appealed mainly to people who hadn't seen much Eastern cinema. Boy, was I wrong. A gorgeous looking epic with a real sense of scale and amazing visuals allied to a complex plot, I was kicking myself for not seeing this one on the big screen. Not everything is successful (the duel on the lake never quite works), but more than enough is to guarantee repeat viewings. Li's limitations are used well for once and while Ziyi Zhang's petulant acting still doesn't entirely convince me, it's surprising to find the weakest performance coming from the film's best actor, Tony Leung Chiu Wai. Never at his most convincing in fantasy swordplay movies (the introspective Ashes of Time excepted), he seems a little underpowered for such an iconic role. But these are minor quibbles with a major delight.<br /><br />There is one irritating problem with the directors cut disc, however - a watermarked logo that periodically appears in the upper corner of the frame that can only be got rid of by skipping the disc back a second or two when it appears. The behind the scenes documentary isn't subtitled into English, but the feature is.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|An excellent book for avid Dune readers. It gives insight into the mind of Frank Herbert and allows one to see the formation of the Dune Universe.  Excellent investment for collectors.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|QT has a good deal of haters, as well as lifetime fans.  There doesn't seem to be much middle ground.  I don't believe this movie will change that.  It has a love it, or hate it feel.  Definately not your mainstream film.  If you like QT, I recommend Death Proof as one of his best pictures.  If profanity offends you, stay away.    The premise of the movie is great.  Kick butt cars, hot chicks, a crazy killer, and a fun ending to cheer for.  The 'grindhouse' effects may annoy mainstream movie-goers.  But I absolutely loved it.
0439882826|5.0|I bought this for my husband who has been a Star Wars fan since he was young.  The quality and detail of the pop-ups is amazing!  Even if you don't really care for Star Wars, you will enjoy this book.  At this price, you might want to buy two, especially if you plan on letting your children read it!
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This film was well done in all details both professionally and historically, even though a two-hour film cannot be expected to satisfy true history's demands.<br /><br />Some would be shocked to know that the end of the slave trade was painstakingly accomplished by a few warriors of hearty Christian faith, especially since modern social justice issues have been hijacked by secularists whose worldview cannot sustain sacrificial love for the oppressed (especially when there's no one else's tax dollars available to finance their supposed good intentions).  William Wilberforce's beliefs and character were constantly assailed for being the narrow-minded Christian who actually believed what Jesus said, and it was he who was painted out to be the immoral one for incessantly laboring to free those who had no voice.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to any who would be interested in knowing more about how the abolition movement/avalanche began in the west.  When government and commerce were both on the side of exploiting a class of human being (as it is today in America with Mexican slaves), the odds seemed insurmountable unless you had a great faith in the Almighty who controls the destiny of all history (may He raise up new warriors to free the illegal Mexican slaves in America from both the pseudo-liberals and the greedy capitalists who are invested in the status quo).  Wilberforce and Newton were men of great faith who changed the world because of their faith - not in spite of it.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|Only in Amazon was this price this low and some muppets here complain without doubting the pre-release is not a box at all unlike here in UK, its in its black glossy box which is cool but I have bought it here for the obviously cheaper price. All individually bubble-packed but heck as long as there is something inside!    The movies are stunning and better than being in a moviehouse if you got a 5.1 and you can watch all the extras in each.    WHY ARE THIS MUPPETS REVIEWING THIS ITEM IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN HD-DVD PLAYER? DOH! Again... Doh! Just shhh and admit you don't know how to read! This is meant for HD-DVD owners. Why in tarnation you buying it if you don't have one. You'll get it cheaper on standard DVD format anyway.     This review section is becoming like a forum for dummies already.    JASON BOURNE Rules! Even James Bond has to up his ante just to catch up these superb movie trilogy!

B000UX6TRK|2.0|Well mine was the same as everyone else's.   Is it only the ones from Amazon.com that are this way?   Is this how it was intended to have 80% of the sound from the right hand side?   I just saw Lionel in concert here in New Zealand and this is a great souvenir of the show, but having the sound problem makes it unenjoyable to watch.  But again, great show.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|A true quality album by an artist who's star continues to rise!  There really isn't a bad track on this album.  The production is tight and polished.  This day in age it's hard to separate yourself from the rest of the pack but Rihanna certainly does with tracks such as \\"Umbrella\\" and \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" the bonifide hits of the album.  The nice thing I also enjoyed is the range that she is able to demonstrate from the somber \\"Rehab\\" to the nice rock sound of \\"Shut Up and Drive\\". An excellent album of music that I would recommend for people that appreciate a talented artist that interprets a great sound.
B000W4HFY8|3.0|Like the first soundtrack for Twin Peaks, this CD is an absolute must for all TP fans.  The only problem, and it has nothing to do with the music, is like all CDs you order from Amazon or through the mail, the plastic holder in the CD case holding the CD was broken so the CD was moving around the whole time.  Luckily, I haven't noticed any skips or bad scatches.  The three-star rating goes for the quality of the product when I received it, not the actual quality of the CD music.  That would be a 4 or 5 star
B000068CNX|5.0|When we last saw our Friends, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) had gone to the airport to meet Ross (David Schwimmer) who was returning from China.  She'd gone to declare her love for him.  What she didn't know, however, was that Ross was returning with a girlfriend, Julie (guest star Lauren Tom).  Naturally, that means we get plenty more complications to the Ross/Rachel relationship.  Will they ever get together?  Find out in \\"The One with the Prom Video.\\"<br /><br />The other four Friends are experiencing trials of their own.  Monica (Courteney Cox) loses her job and winds up searching for work.  On the plus side, she starts dating Dr. Richard Burke (guest star Tom Selleck).  The down side to that relationship is that Richard is old enough to be her parent.  In fact, he is Friends with her parents.<br /><br />Joey (Matt LaBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) go through the breakup of their relationship when Joey moves into his own place and Chandler gets creepy new roommate Eddie (Adam Goldberg).  Meanwhile, Joey is enjoying the rise and fall (literally) of his career when he lands a part of the soap opera Days of Our Lives.<br /><br />Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) is the one character with the least in the way of story arcs this season.  Not to say she doesn't get some funny episodes, like the one where she is possessed by a dead woman's spirit.  We also see the debut of her signature song \\"Smelly Cat.\\"  And she starts trying to track down her father and gets half brother instead.<br /><br />As you can see, there's lots going on in this season.  The show was still new with lots of ground to be explored.  And it was still at the top of its creative game with plenty of laughs each episode.  I especially love the conversations where they are talking about one thing, but it sounds like they are talking about something else.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Friends, this is a great season to add to your collection.
B000Q7ZO8U|2.0|I am 50 yrs old, my fiance is 48. We settled in on Christmas night to watch Polar Express. Her first words was that the animation was kind of eery and spooky. I commented that it was like watching a movie with animation that had the same look and feel of photo's from childrens books. Maybe we were too used to the amazing animation from studio's such as Disney's Pixar? We loved CARS, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc etc. The bottom line was that the animation for Polar Express was just too odd to keep us interested and we turned it off after 20 minutes and switched over to watching \\"Cars\\" from Pixar. Polar Express may very well be a wonderful movie, and kids might enjoy it. But it just didn't do it for us. This was the Blu-Ray version, so perhaps my expectations were too high.
B0007939NO|3.0|Good film but unfortunately came late in the big musical era.  Too bad it couldn't be filmed on location.  Still a good yarn.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|I bought Live Free or Die Hard to have as an action-adventure / Blu Ray reference disc. Live Free or Die Hard does not dissappoint! The Movie is entertaining and moves quickly, always holding my attention and often times keeping me on the edge of my seat! Yes, you need to be able to suspend reality somewhat as Bruce Willis, a mortal being, defies death and overcomes physical injury that would break a normal persons bones, over and over. But WOW! The action and effects are as good as I have ever seen and the movie is extremely well done. Next to the Original Die Hard movie, this has quickly become my favorite in the series. Highly, highly recommended.
1401300529|3.0|Very well done but he wrote basicaly only about the ist marine divsion,  second infantry ,third infantry and first cav divisions. I served through much of this with the 32nd RCT, 7th infantry and there was only a small mention of the 7th except for our regimental CO Col Don Faith. . we were the other half of the tenth corps but the first marines got all of the credit. Is there a book out that gives ALL OF THE FACTS rather than picking 2 or 3 pet units as this author did it creates an illusion that they were the only ones fighting this brawl when other units that were not mentioned, were all engaged in the same fights or others just as deadly. I sent two of my brothers each a copy of this book for christmas prior to reading it and now I feel like this was an error in judgment as they now think that the 7th division was a rear guard outfit that never got into a fight since these other aformrntioned units did all of the dirty work. this sets up a great injustice to the 7th as well as the other units that were neglected with out  a foot note or mention of their time in hell I know that doing an indepth book on all of the units involved in this war would be too large to publish but they could be printed as volumes and cover the entire war.This would sell a lot of books Ernie Hagness

B000YAA6AU|2.0|Oh well,I am not here to be popular.I am here to be honest,and if ever a film could have used a colon cleanser to get it moving,it would be \\"P.S. I Love You\\"!    I usually love films like this.I had seen the trailer enough times, and especially liking Gerard Butler ([[ASIN:B0007TKNL0 The Phantom of the Opera (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000QXDED6 300 (Widescreen Edition)]]) I was primed for an entertaining and heart touching film.Well,it did not work for me,not because of the story itself or the acting,but Good God this film needed some editing!!!!!!!!!! This film moved like my Grandmother used to say,like \\"Molasses creeping up hill on a cold January day!\\" For all of it's good intentions \\"P.S. I Love You\\" just droned like a wheezing bagpipe! Sorry folks!

They give a token honor among thieves warning to Bank (Al Pacino) to play fair, knowing they'll have to wreak havoc by \\"breaking The Bank.\\" What follows is mayhem in the fine tradition of \\"Ocean's 11\\" and an infinitely better romp than the abysmal \\"Ocean's 12.\\" Everyone is back together - and even with old enemy Terry Benedict.<br /><br />The harm done to the hotel critic isn't funny, but that's the only low point, and I missed Julia Roberts.  Everything else is great, fiendishly clever, and a disappointment that this is the last in the trilogy. Well worth it to buy the DVD.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I originally was skeptical about this cd from Bruce, the hype behind it, then the reviews blasting the \\"wall of sound\\" and finally after having it only for 3 days consider this as Springsteens best since Darkness on the Edge of Town, melding his old sound which is what drew me to his music with his more recent work and doing so successfully, this cd along with Ian Hunters-Shrunken Heads, Neil Young's -Chrome Dreams II and PLant/Krauss- Raising Sand are the best of the year. If only we had more artist producing at these levels.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This was a good thought provoking movie.  It touched upon a deep topic without being preachy.  Ioan Gruffudd did an superb job as William Wilberforce...he should win some award for that. The supporting cast is excellent as well.  It is a good solid buy and you should definitely check it out.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|Three great movies that are not only fun to watch but now look better than ever in the Blu-ray format!!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|It was a great spoof movie.  I was cracking up all the way through.  Much much better than \\"Not Another Teen Movie\\".  If you don't like spoofs,vulgarity, drug references and the like, then you won't like this.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|It doesn't matter if you like Queen or not. This DVD is a must-have. That's my first Amazon review of a rock'n'roll item. I never cared too much about Queen but the DVD release seemed to me so awkward - I thought: why would they bother to release a concert from 1982 and a live performance in Live Aid which is in everybody's collective unconscious? - that I decided to give it a chance. I was prone to hating the item because Rock'n'Roll and Queen are not my cup of tea.<br /><br />There I go, an innocent man inserting the beautifully boxed DVD in the player. I turn on the TV. I let the show run while I'm in another room studying and doing other stuff: I could barely listen to the music.<br /><br />I grabbed a bottle of wine, sat on the sofa and started to look at the screen heedless of the music and the images. I laid down and was bound to sleep just when the player got to the chapter of Under Pressure. And man...<br /><br />It's beyond description. Freedie Mercury delivers a performance that is perfect from beginning to end. In fact, Under Pressure is so wonderfully played and sung that it alone makes the DVD worth buying. The sheer power of his gutural voice constantly changing its register from bass and tenor is otherwordly in its beauty and sophistication. About the middle of the song his voice goes through a very logical and beautiful recitation of short, brief syllables, as if he were teaching you to sing, and then turns in a wonderfully executed falsetto as he faces the drummer - \\"these are the da-a-ys - just to get smoothly back to his powerful gutural voice: \\"it never rains but it pours\\". Then he starts to teach us to sing again beautifully ascending and descending in the scales by reciting very brief, distinct notes: there are legati and stacatte, all in a very short period of time, beautifully arranged and organized.<br /><br />Suddenly, he threats to shoot us: his hands are clearly symbolizing a revolver shooting each note with accuracy. Then he goes out of his way to deliver a perfect progression from his natural register to a long high tenor-like note: \\"higher, high and hiiiiigh\\". He starks asking \\"why\\" in a vibrant, touching and thrilling way before the band develop the song to its climax. By then, you're already either crying or standing upright on your sofa. You're in for the final jewel: his desperate, almost dreadful questioning - \\"why can't we give ourselves one more chance... - and then the powerful, loud, but sofly and gently executed last verses: \\"cause Love is SU-ch an Ol-ld Fa-shion Wor-rd And LOve Dares YOU to CA-re FOR the PE-ople...\\". It's pure poetry. The guy rocks.<br /><br />If there were just this song in the DVD, it'd already be magical. But the whole thing, once I started to listen carefully to it, is wonderful. His performance in Live Aid beggars belief. The stage is just an extension of his body: he moves freely, beautifully, and delivers what's likely the greatest feat in the history of live rock and roll concerts. Play the Game, Hammer to Fall, Radio Ga-Ga and We are the Champions are given their most incredible performances in Live Aid. He commands the crowd, the stage, and, above all, his voice.<br /><br />But the real treat is the Montreal gig DVD. It's perfect every step of the way. Therein is probably one of the most impressive versions of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". In Montreal, he's much more elegant in his moves and dances than in Live Aid: he throws his fist in the air as he opens and closes his hands; he gets his arm in a hook-like disposition, the muscles all strained, and lifts it as if he were trying to break some barrier.<br /><br />I give up. The band is wonderful and the guy is just a genius. I can't watch people singing just after listening to him: it's dull. The way he commands the stage, his beautiful presence and his jaw-dropping vocal technique are peerless in Rock and Roll's history. Maybe Robert Plant in his good old days could match him, I don't know.<br /><br />Buy this cd.It's too cheap for the treasure that's in it. It really doesn't matter whether you like Queen or not.It's too cheap for the treasure that's in it. It really doesn't matter whether you like Queen or not.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I had looked several places for this DVD set and they were all at least double the price I paid...and I got free shipping!  How great is that?!!  The box it comes in is great for storage and will protect it well.  The package arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.
B000LC51TM|5.0|I've been a fan for over 10 years and never saw 'em live.  Turned my wife on to Rammstein for working out.  Now, she won't work out to any other band.  So, I bought her this for Christmas.  15 bucks for a kick a** live CD/DVD.  Why pay $40-$90 for an extra documentary DVD and big booklet  when you can get the essential stuff for $15.  No English subtitles, so go elsewhere for the lyrics if you need them.  These guys put on a great rocking live show.
B000HDR9NG|4.0|I had initially heard that the Killers second CD (Sam's Town) failed in comparision to Hot Fuss.  After listening to this album, i have to disagree.  I feel that the Killers just took a different direction musically with this album.  I also feel that it is just as good as Hot Fuss, If not better.  The sixth track, Read My Mind, is an exceptional stand out on this album.

0316010669|4.0|Gladwell is an impressive author, and his understanding shows in this book.  He applies the principles he discusses in \\"The Tipping Point\\" and his numerous articles in the writing of a book that is catchy and easy to read without sacrificing information.  Many of the conclusions he draws are surprising and challenging to how you view everything from yourself to the justice system, but the arguments are strong, drawing on both example and research data.  All told, an excellent book.
B000VWYJ86|2.0|with a 5-second attention span.  I'm glad I didn't actually pay to see this thing.  It's suitable for anyone who thinks on a fifth grade level and doesn't concern him/herself with realism.  Amazing how everyone in this movie is almost clairvoyant and knows everything everyone else is doing and where they are on the world map.  It's as though everyone has the omniscient power of God.  Further, as in a lot of these phoney action movies, a lot of people (mainly Matt Damon) apparently have the stamina of Olympic long-distance runners, since they run, jump, dive, etc. for lengthy periods of time without getting much winded. And, of course, one can jump multiple times through glass windows without getting cut.  George Smiley, where are you?
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is defenitely the best movie I have seen in a long time. It was so awesome I saw it twice in the same day. So worth the 16 bucks I spent on tickets. It is so much better than it sounds, a teenage girl get pregant and gives the baby up for adoption. It is hilarious, smart, and Ellen Page is amazing as Juno. There are unexpected plot twists and it's just totaly awesome. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. It's not for the little ones, though. There isn't really a sex scene, but they do show part of one kinda, no nudety, there is a lot of swearing and talking about stuff kids shouldn't be exposed to. Every second of Juno is worth seeing and I am SOO buying the DVD when it comes out. (the music is worth buying the soundtrack too) The movie has been compared to Knocked Up, which is a great movie, but Juno is so much better. The characters are well-developed and I fell in love with most of them instantly. I also hated some. This movie made me and the entire audience laugh histarically, say 'awwwww!' and maybe tear up a little. I will for sure go and see this movie again in theaters. I have never before wanted to see a movie so many times. I am soo glad this movie was made!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Muppet Christmas Carol is our favorite version of this Dickens story.  It obviously deviates slightly because of the muppet characters, but not enough to change the general story.  We love the music and the humor in it.  Michael Caine is wonderful as scrooge and the \\"ghosts of Christmas' past, present and future\\" are very fun to watch.  They all create the appropriate feelings.  My only complaint has nothing to do with the movie, only the shipping.  We paid extra to get it overnight and didn't receive it for 4 days.  We did get it in time for Christmas, but it was on Christmas Eve and we had wanted to watch it before then.

0142000663|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy many of John Steinbeck's books. I truly recommend East of Eden and Of Mice and Men to anyone who hasn't read them. This book however I found very tedious, slow, and overall quite boring. I know it's a classic and all but really had a tough time getting through it and after all that work I really felt the conclusion left me hanging.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have been using this with my D40 since April of this year. I love it. I wanted something that would bounce and which would cycle faster than the internal flash. This does both.    I suspect the SB-600 would cycle even faster but it's so BIG. I also would like to be able to bounce sideways and use it wirelessly as a remote flash (SB-600 can do both, I believe, though I'd have to use my D70 to control it remotely) but the size (small) made it a winner for me over the SB-600.    Now I have a Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce diffuser for the SB-400 and that's just great for outdoors stuff where there's no ceiling to bounce off of. I love my D40+SB-400+Ombni-Bounce diffuser combo.    Wonderful for taking portraits and shots of my little girl.    12 November 2008 update: My SB-600 works great with my current DSLR, a Nikon D200.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, storyline, concept, characters, writing style. This book was recently recommended and by the first chapter was intrigued by not only the culture of which I was reading about, the realness and depth of the characters. Having limited knowledge of the middle east, this was truly an education for me! I highly recommend this book and I am running to get the Kite Runner as I hear it is superb reading as well.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Engaging, different, well acted. Emma Thompson is utterly brilliant as a tortured writer. Her acting is absolutely dead-on perfect and made the  movie advance a giant step up in quality. Will Ferrell is completely believable as Harold Crick, the deadpan IRS agent. This was the best I've ever seen him. Dustin Hoffman is perfect as the slightly trippy literature professor taking Crick's story seriously. Normally, a person like Crick would be diagnosed as a classic schizophrenic. Maggie Gyllenhaal is terrific and beautiful as the purposely tax-dodging hippie baker and love interest. Thoroughly enjoyable every time she appeared on the screen. Queen Latifah was a poor choice as a writer's helper, and not much of an actress. I didn't believe a word she said and was sorry she was there at all. Fortunately, she had a minor role. But the story is entertaining, and for once a popular movie with top stars engages your mind and your emotions. Go rent or buy it. It's a guaranteed enjoyable evening. Four stars from the 249th Amazon reviewer.
B00008EY7H|5.0|This DVD made my 6 year old grandsons Christmas he's in love with the entire \\"cirque du soleil\\" He loves the characters sings all the songs and performs the hula hoop event.

B000UX6THK|5.0|As melodramatic as it may sound, re-watching Twin Peaks for the first time in about 7 or 8 years was like having a friend die and then meeting him again, only to realise he is still dead. Infamously 'unresolved' - for reasons that become clear in this set's documentaries - Twin Peaks presents characters so authentic and meaningful that it is easy to forget they are only fiction and heart-breaking that they are so finite (only 2 series were made - cut short in its prime). Unfortunately the series became a caricature of itself in the last quarter when it was temporarily left in the hands of other writers, but Lynch and Frost returned to bring it back up to a cosmically spooky new height.    Despite the oddball and cinematic TV that has come along since - deeply indebted to Twin Peaks -- this remains one of the very few truly post-modern and tragi-mystical humanistic television experiences. All credit to Lynch and Frost. For it contains an eloquent and articulate wisdom and a subtle intuitive conceptualism that is rare in TV - even amongst those that are claimed to provide something near to this but are ultimately too 'pop'and too compromising.    Twin Peaks has not dated. Its themes are timeless, its acting appropriately ranging from brilliant to farcical, and the cinematography stunning - the colours, especially in the Lynch and the Hunter episodes, are at once real, surreal and hyperreal; the angles and perspectives are revelationary and revolutionary. The mistake often made in regard to    Twin Peaks is to view it as simply kooky. But, as with all Lynch's works, its eccentricity makes it all the more human and humane and is complimented by a truly knowing familiarity with the lightness and darkness of life. It is not just satire, it is postmodern reference on countless levels.    Anyone with a real sense of artistic and humanistic interest in the best uses of the television medium MUST experience Twin Peaks - at least once. The accompanying documentaries are essential viewing for TP and Lynch fans, as it provides brand new insight into the creation, development and fate of the story, the music and the characters.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I received  three CDs for Christmas: the Eagles' big comeback CD, Britney's \\"Blackout\\" CD, and Josh Groban's \\"Noel\\" CD.  Britney's CD is my favorite...  I'm a baby boomer, but I like all kinds of music.  I must say Britney's CD surprised me.  My 17-year-old niece gave it to me, with a big smile and a mischievious wink.  It's a wonderful CD.  My favorite songs are: Piece of Me, Gimme More, Hot as Ice, Heaven on Earth, Radar, Toy Soldier, and Ohh Baby; however, all the songs on this album could be hit singles.  I hear that Zomba overlooked a masterpiece called, \\"Cry,\\" that should've been on this CD.  Hopefully, it'll be showcased on Britney's next CD.  Best wishes in 2008 and always for Britney!
B000XPU5NY|5.0|I personally had the pleasure of seeing this concert live with my wife in Chicago. The performance was at the United Center. Genesis really blew the roof off the building blasting off with \\"Duke's Intro\\", a combination of \\"Behind the Lines\\" and \\"Dukes Travels\\" before entering into \\"Turn it on Again.\\"  My wife and I are huge Genesis fans, and it appears that almost all of Chicago are closet Genesis fans because they performed for three nights.  What really energized us was the fact that the entire audience in one form or another knew every word of every song.  The best example of this was when \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\" was performed. Everyone around us was singing, almost competing with the amplifiers.  This concert was more than just a show, it was a revival meeting.  The mix of classic songs such as \\"In The Cage\\", \\"Ripples\\", \\"The Cinema Show\\", and \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" contrasted well with later songs such as \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"Land of Confusion\\", and \\"No Son of Mine\\".  Phil Collins did his famous tambourine routine during \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\". Later, Chester Thompson joined in later with Phil Collins to play dueling drumsticks on stools before breaking into \\"Los Endos\\". Let's not forget Daryl Stuermer and Mike Rutherford, the true Guitar Heroes during \\"Firth of Fifth\\"! Rock Band should have a Tony Banks Edition complete with synthesizers as his performance during \\"In The Cage\\" and \\"The Cinema Show\\" - it would add a great new dimension to the game.  In fact, there should be a Genesis Edition of the game with two drumsets, a double-bridged guitar, synthesizers, and a tambourine.  I guarantee it would separate the wannabes from the true musicians.    Two things of importance.  This compilation from the European tour is great.  However, I feel that the sound quality from the official bootleg recorded directly off the soundboard during the Chicago performance sounds richer and fuller than the retail compilation.  Consider checking to see if the bootlegs from any of the concerts in the states are still being sold.  Another interesting thing worth mentioning is that during \\"Invisible Touch\\", Phil Collins was OK with singing \\"...and though she will **** up your life, you'll want her just the same...\\" but changed the third verse of \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\".  He did not sing \\"..and the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright..\\". Instead, he sang the last verse twice.   Was this the case with other shows performed in the states?  On this album, he sings the correct verse. Was this an error or was this a case of censorship because the lyric is from 1974 and part of a story in music that someone may take offense to?    To all fans of Genesis out there, keep your fingers crossed that one day we will see Gabriel and Hackett together with Banks, Rutherford and Collins for a performance of all their classic stuff like \\"Supper's Ready\\", \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" and maybe a full performance of \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\".    This concert was incredible, hands down.  The fact that so many people are hung up on different key signatures astonishes me.  Has anyone ever considered that changing the key signatures make songs new and fresh again?  This is especially true for songs in excess of 30 years old.  Not every song in the set was transposed, and the ones that were never sounded better.  If it could be expected that every song was going to sound exactly like the album recording, what would be the motivation to even see a concert?  The key changes not only accommodated the pitch range Phil's vocals, it allowed his vocal chords to pace themselves. At least on the U.S. leg of the tour, some cities had 2 or 3 shows in a row at almost 3 hours a piece.  Give the man credit for singing as well as he did in those key signatures.  You also assume that Phil was the only one being accommodated.  Tony and Mike had some singing parts.  How do we know that one of their voices hadn't deepened due to age?  It shouldbe noted that it Ray Wilson also performed songs transposed a step down during the \\"Calling All Stations\\" tour in 1998.  Check it out on YouTube. Phil Collins never sang \\"Land of Confusion\\" this low.  All of this aside, true fans came to see these legends of rock reunited after 15 years, not to criticize their choice of key signature.    An additional thought.  This concert was definitely a snapshot of their most successful era.  I think there needs to be one more encore where Ray Wilson, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, Anthony Philips and all past members get to take the stage and play together.  They are just an instrumental part to the bands success as Tony, Mike and Phil.  Come on guys, just one more for the road!!!
1595141715|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher is well written, and easy to understand. Because 99% of the story deals with some sort of dialogue or the inner thoughts of the main character(s), much of the novel flows very much like speech, which I appreciate. I ended up reading the entire novel the same day I started it, as it kept me at the edge of my seat and held me there. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is interested in the way that simple words or actions, or lack thereof, can affect everyone and anyone. As stated in the novel, \\"Everthing affects everything.\\"

0790729350|4.0|Bought for my husband for Xmas he has always wanted it for his collection of off beat movies
B00011F5DK|5.0|We opened this early Christmas eve when we and the visitors - adult daughter and her friend  - were at the point when everyone had run out of news and other things to occupy the time.  We all needed a diversion.  Boy did this game fit the bill!  We are in our 60s, and my daughter and friend in their 20-30s, but it was a game all ages could really get into.  I suspect it would well down to early teen or younger.  All through the game my daughter's friend kept exclaiming, \\"We're getting this as soon as we get home!\\"  Every free moment for the rest of this visit was involved in playing Blokus.  My daughter and her friend were so enthusiastic we finally offered to let them take the game home since it was clear they'd be inviting everyone over to it.        High points are that games are short enough, even with 4 players, that no one get's bored (maybe 20 minutes or so with 4 playing), nor stuck playing a game they need to or want to leave.  You can play nicely with 2, 3 or 4 people, though I think 4 likely works best.  But beware \\"mature\\" folks - your kids can likely beat the pants off you!

B000VECAEO|5.0|Nothing really to say about this, beyond \\"It's a Seinfeld!\\"  That sums it up.  For those who know and love the show, this collection is a must have.  For those who don't know the show, go back to season 3, watch the whole series from 3-8, then buy this.  You can't go wrong.  One of the only two or three worthy comedy shows in the last 20 years.  (The other is Curb Your Enthusiasm, by Larry David, the creator of Seinfeld.)

B000F1IQNM|5.0|We love this movie.   In fact, we lost the first DVD, so I had to buy another one.  My boys (4 and 7) thought the pranks they played on the Nanny were hilarious.   Emma Thompson does a fantastic job in this movie.  The British accent is sometimes hard to understand the first time you watch it, but you pick up things you missed when you watch it again, and again, and again.   Enjoy!
B00026WU64|4.0|Bob Dylan's second album is the one where he really cane into his own as a songwriter and a performer. Indeed, this record contains some of the finest songs that Dylan has ever created- the achingly beautiful \\"Girl From The North Country\\" and the bitterly funny \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" are highlights, as is the damn funny surrealist ramble of \\"I Shall Be Free.\\" And even those absolute masterpieces are merely appetizers when compared to the apocalyptic \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" or the cathartic rage of \\"Masters Of War.\\" The latter is simply one of the most fiercely poetic protest songs ever written (yeah, Dylan hated to be labeled a protest singer, but in this case, that's exactly what he was- it just wasn't a topical protest song), a torrent of raw emotion and unbottled fury, with genuine emotional anguish lurking beneath the surface. And (I say this at the risk of revealing a bit too much about my political leanings) it's still startlingly relevant today. \\"Talking World War III Blues\\" is a different kind of pacifist anthem, a hilarious (but undeniably ominous) tale of anxiety and apocalypse. Perhaps the album's greatest moment is \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,\\" which describes the end of a relationship with stunning poetic virtuosity, as Dylan mourns the death of love with equal parts frustration, anguish, and resignation, with a sort of sad, knowing humor permeating the whole thing. There are moments of the song that are uncanny in their emotional resonance- it's amazing, how this guy who was born so long before me, who lived and wrote and created so long before I even existed, seems to understand some of the feelings and episodes in my life better than I can (\\"I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind/ You could've done better, but/ I don't mind/ You just kinda wasted my precious time/ but don't think twice, it's alright.\\" How did he know?!).     But I don't think it's a perfect album. I hate to admit it, but this doesn't strike me as the utter gem that others see itas. It's a very good album, to be sure, but there are too many just-ok songs here. \\"Oxford Town\\" is a somewhat by-numbers protest song, and \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" (a rendition of a traditional tune) is a pleasant but ultimately inconsequential little number. Same goes for \\"Honey Just Allow Me One More Chance.\\" \\"Bob Dylan's Dream,\\" despite a suitably mournful tone, dramatically overstays its welcome, and \\"Down The Highway\\" is similarly dull.    But really, this is a fantastic album, and a few weak cuts only marginally detract from its overall power. Enjoy!    Oh, one more thing: There is one song I forgot to mention, something about wind, and mountains... pleasant little ditty, if I do say so myself.
B00013F38K|5.0|I loved this show from the moment it hit the airways back in '72. Now some 35 years later (can it really be that long?) I'm able to enjoy it as often as I like, isn't technology amazing! While the fighting sequences seem pretty tame now by today's standards it was not the martial arts that really drew me to this show. It was the Buddhist philosophy that kept me entranced.<br /><br />Who could ever get tire of listening to Master Kan (Philip Ahn) and Master Po (Keye Luke) teachings on spirituality, philosophy and the meaning of life to the young, searching Kwai Chang Caine (Radames Pera) during his years in the Shoalin monastery. These teachings and perspective on life would be exemplified by the adult Caine (David Carradine) during his travels thru the American Wild West in the mid - late 1800's.<br /><br />`Kung Fu - The Complete First Season' was definitely the beginning of a landmark series that began to slowly open the Occidental world to a new way of looking at life, starting a revolution that is still going on in the hearts and minds of many today. Join the revolution!
B000002KIE|5.0|For some people, this is the quintessential punk album, and it's hard to disagree with them: This is a filthy, cruel, nihilistic, loud, furious, and seemingly amoral album, full of brutally simple music and snarled vocals, with righteously pissed-off lyrics and a sense of primal immediacy underlying the whole thing. Sure, it's also surrounded by controversy (whether or not the music was performed by the Pistols themselves or a bunch of uncredited studio hacks, whether the album was a calculated attempt at commercial success or a genuine statement of rebellion, etc.), but when the music is this good, who really gives a damn?    Thirty years after its original release, this thing is still an absolute monster, a frothing-at-the-mouth declaration of war against social mores, conventional wisdom, and the status quo (whatever it happens to be at the moment). It's rebellion for its own sake, the distilled essence of youthful rage and cultural dissatisfaction. \\"God Save The Queen\\" and \\"Anarchy In The U.K.\\" are absolute masterpieces- they document the decline of Western civilization with a gleeful snarl, with Johnny Rotten's skin-curdling bellow spewing cathartic venom at everybody and everything, venting his frustration at a world that's carelessly ripping itself apart. Outside of those two classics, we've got the chaotic \\"Holidays In The Sun,\\" and the acidically catchy \\"No Feelings.\\" \\"Bodies\\" (which was, ironically, named one of the greatest conservative rock songs of all time thanks to its perceived anti-abortion message) isn't moralistic- it's hard to imagine that the label \\"pro-life\\" (or, in fact, pro-anything) could apply to the Sex Pistols. It's actually a somewhat true story about a girl who'd been hanging around with the band at the time, and who had described (in agonizing detail) the illicit abortions she'd had to Johnny. Multiple members of the band have attested that the song was intended to convey a pro-choice message by denouncing the society that had forced the song's protagonist to seek an illegal (and potentially life-threatening) alternative to a medically safe abortion. It also rocks really hard.     A punk rock classic, then. Enjoy.

B000274THQ|5.0|\\"Goodbye Lenin\\" is an excellent film.  Director Wolfgang Becher keeps the action fluid as one scene sparks the next.  The French Academy of Cinema named it the Best Film from the European Union.<br /><br />Daniel Bruhl is the star who plays the son Alex.  He first came to my attention in [[ASIN:B000AM6ODK Love in Thoughts]] and was in [[ASIN:6302020816 The Edukators]].  He has also played in \\"Ladies in Lavender\\" with Maggie Smith & Judy Dench and \\"The Borne Ultimatum.\\"  The European Film Academy named him Best Actor for \\"Goodbye Lenin\\".  He does an excellent job as the young man shouldering responsibility long before he's ready.<br /><br />Katrin Sass plays his mother Christiane.  As an actress, she won the Silver Bear Best Actress award from the Berlin International Film Festival in 1982 for \\"Burgschaft ein Jahr\\" and won the James People's Choice Award as Best Actress for this film.  Sass turns in an excellent performance in the greatly varied role from political activist to invalid.<br /><br />The story of the film revolves around the family whose father has apparently left them.  The mother raises her children in East Germany.  She is quite attached to her country and suffers a heart attack as she watches her son at a protest rally.  Falling into a coma, she awakes 8 months later to a reunified Germany where the wall has fallen.  However, since her heart is very fragile, Alex concocts a huge fantasy to keep from his mother the fact that Germany has changed because he fears it would be too great a shock.  This results in all sorts of hilarious antics such as searching for East German pickle jars and telling his mother that thousands of West Germans have been scaling the walls to get into East Germany and escape capitalism.<br /><br />Chulpan Khametova plays his sister Lara who is busy having babies with her boyfriend Rainer played by Alexander Beyer.  There is a hilarious scene where Beyer bears all as he tries to fix window blinds before bothering to dress.  Meanwhile Alex falls for Ariane played by Maria Simon who appeared in the film [[ASIN:B0002C9D9U Luther]].  Alex enlists his coworker Denis to help fake news broadcasts so they can play the tapes on his mother's TV.  Florian Lukus as Denis is a stitch, wearing fake moustaches and pretending to be a TV news anchorman.  Lukas won the Best Supporting Actor from the German Film Awards for his role.  There is a reversal at the end of the film where we meet Alex & Lara's father Robert Kerner.

B000I0QL82|5.0|\\"Holiday Inn\\" is a song and dance routine and I confess I'm not a big fan of musicals. Even so, when you take the brilliance of composer/lyricist Irving Berlin, mix with one of the greatest singing voice in history, Bing Crosby and add the finest dancer ever; Fred Astair, all that's missing is a heart's desire. Stunningly beautiful actress Marjorie Reynolds provides the perfect additional heart beat, completing a delightfully well woven romantic comedy that works almost flawlessly. Released in 1942, this timeless love story is a monument to creative moviemaking at its best. Bing Crosby's Academy Award winning song \\"White Christmas,\\" first appeared in \\"Holiday Inn\\" some 12 years before Bing Crosby's movie, \\"White Christmas.\\" Couch Potato Review? 7 Potato, More.

0689859368|2.0|This book is about 100 pages minus a few full-page and many partial-page illustrations. It took less than an hour for me to finish the whole book. While it may take more time for younger readers, it is safe to say that this book is really short. I think the book doesn't have a great deal of reread value either. This book could easily have been combined with book 2 to create a book that is actually worth $10. I recommend you save yourself some money and check these books out at the library.

I had never seen Bladerunner and when the HD release came out I knew it was time to experience one of the so called \\"best movies of all time\\".

A purchase i wish i could take back.  Obviously I am in the minority here, but IMO...  Pass on this one.

B0009UC7QQ|4.0|The Truman Show is one of those movies which takes an initiative, trying to be different and introspective. It is often labeled as a comedy, but I don't know if there is a real category that defines this film (it is part comedy, part drama, part \\"reality\\" show). However, I think one of the more important perspectives of this film is simply the morals projected: that free will and creativity make us who we are, that no one has the right to suspend our freedoms, and that diversity and change are natural in life and that attempts to take these away from individuals stifles one's ability to live. Truman has had ideas that everything in life isn't as perfect as it seems, and he is right. When he catches on to these, he truly begins to try to live, and push back the limits that have restrained him. Although the movie takes a very simplistic premise, the idea that Truman Burbank has been pretty much living a television show from birth, it works because its subject creates debate. Far too few films provoke any kind of reaction like this one; people should have an opinion about movies after they view them, and The Truman Show delivers in this perspective.     One of the drawbacks is that some of the characters are a little bit too cut and dry. Take Christof, the director of the show, who is presented as an evil egoist who only wants ratings, and will not stop this idea of \\"reality TV\\" even when Truman is onto this idea. His character was a bit too simplistic. Not everything in this movie works, and sometimes the acting from characters is as phony as the world that Truman lives.     It's a thought-provoking film though. It clearly makes one think about the possibilities and power that media sometimes has over individuals. How much do we really want to see and know about someone's life? What is \\"crossing the line\\" as far as personal space? The paparazzi could take a lesson from viewing this film. This movie was made before reality television really took off, but it really fitsinto this world because it presents the idea of taking away \\"personal space\\" and privacy. Truman's momentous life events are all a part of the American home, including the moment he \\"lost\\" his father, and the moment he regained his father. Many reality shows have individuals \\"perform\\" each episode and these individuals do this because they choose to. Truman Burbank's character is the very opposite of this spectrum; he doesn't have this choice, and takes measures to break from this.     The concept of the movie is unique, and is certainly applicable in today's world. Definitely a movie to check out, then go back to later on!
B000J233SK|4.0|Written as something of a travelogue, Loreena Mckennitt best selling album (it was recently certified platinum) is one of the best of its kind. Originally issued in 1997, the kick-in point was when an edit/remix of \\"The Mummer's Dance\\" cracked the top 20. It characterizes much of Mckennitt's work; strong melodies, lush harmonies and a deep Celtic bent. Mining the same ground Clannad did for [[ASIN:B0000AM6OX Macalla]], and to a lesser extent, Enya, this is music for those intimate nights when you're feeling mystical.

B000AP04FG|2.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie when I caught it on HBO.  I actually sat through the whole thing expecting some solid comical genius from Vince Vaughn.  Surprisingly it was Brad Pitt's subtle reactions, his staccato way of saying lines that is inadvertently humorous, and childish way he performed the domestic violence scene(s) is what produced major laughs just as I was ready to change the channel.  Angelina Jolie, who is perfect at playing a neurotic woman and natural vixen, seems to try too hard in this role and adds more drama to this movie whose dialogue is so bad at times you'd think it was written at the hands of borderline dropouts in a remedial high school. There is one scene where she is weeping over a glass of whiskey awaiting the death of her husband that made me throw an apple at the tv.    Vince Vaughn's character did add something to the movie but not much.  His lines too seemed forced or out of place for this movie, though he was highly believable as the aging bachelor who still lives and squabbles with his mother. People who like to watch explosions and live vicariously through good looking people or who idolize Brangelina might like this movie. Otherwise, tune in for the scene where Pitt suspects his wife of poisoning his food and the one where does stylized kicks to his wife's body. Tune out for the dialoge and Angelina's many failed expressions of danger which turned out to be more of a \\"f**k me face\\" for the cameras.
B00005BJ9W|4.0|back to early 1983, I notice a song pretty caught my ears, and I really like the melody, and the chorus  Save it till the Morning After (2+4 times), and ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT  and finally found it's \\"Save a Prayer\\", and started to hunt this album  the first one was cassette (1984), it's broken because I played too much (esp. Save a Prayer)  the second one was US version of LP, the Side A tracks are remixed, but I personally don't like these 5 tracks  their CD (UK version) was released 1994, I bought it even don't need to think twice, but I found #5 \\"Hold Back the Rain\\" has \\"clicks\\" (I mentioned once on their previous album) removed, it started from Bass guitar, just feel something missing  Rio deploys these \\"clicks\\", but I don't think it's sound of Rio in Brazil  \\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\\", the haunting sound also catches my ears  \\"New Religion\\" is like an allude of \\"certain\\" church (name kept)  \\"Last Chance of the Stairway\\" recalls me of \\"Planet Earth\\" somehow  \\"Save a Prayer\\" is still my very favorite, along with \\"To The Shore\\" and \\"Sound of Thunder\\" (both on previous album)  these 2 albums are produced by Colin Thurston, and I can say \\"Duran Duran\\" is first half, \\"Rio\\" is second half, and they should be sold as 2CDs  if you have previous one, buy this one  or if you have this one, but previous one, that makes it complete
0525950079|4.0|I found some of the one star reviews amusing and more than a bit confusing. To condemn a book because it has sex scenes is just too ridiculous to even attempt to understand. In reality, if these \\"antisexites\\" had read the entire book they would have found relatively few explicit sex scenes for a 1000+ pages. I find it sad that some reviewers focus so acutely on a single subject and condemn the entire work on such a thin basis. None of these \\"one stars\\" spends any time on the style, plotting, characterization, drama and language. The vast amount of historical research alone gives the work an appealing life as a unique addition to Follett\\"s bookshelf.    \\"World Without End\\" is a sequel, and comparisons are natural. Like many of the other reviewers I too had read the first volume years ago, and though I remember enjoying it very much I think that even if one does not read that book they will still experience a great read. WWE is loaded with interesting characters and literally hundreds of stories winding through the main plot. The characters come off as real and lively as well as purely evil, funny or pathetic - in other words a book chock full of something for every reader who truly enjoys settling down with a thick volume that takes effort to complete.    Follett creates and paints a believable world for his cast of characters. As usual the quality of the writing keep the story flowing and scene after scene setting up great events. Follett's characters are as usual drawn with daring, humor and more than a touch of mystery. The setting is dynamic and part of what I enjoyed the most, seeing how his creations moved through the society of the times and how they reacted, rebelled, fought and, yes, fornicated. Family life, and the society of the guilds and how they worked within the ages, and of course the conflicts that developed within that context.    Plotting is very strong, Follett should be congratulated for juggling so many characters and moving them through the scenes and situations he has created to bring out conflicts, love, hate and violence that was very much familiar to the time period. If, like me, you have enjoyed many of Follett's books, no matter what genre as much as I have then I believe you will like this one too, and very much.
B000VL9XE2|5.0|Well, it's not hard to expect the low reviews that this album has been gathering. They were practically pre-written after Miss Machine did not follow up Calculating Infinity the way people had hoped it would.    This album is signature Dillinger Escape Plan, for those of us who do not hold Calculating Infinity on a pedestal (for many, this was their introduction to the band, and that first sound is hard NOT to expect on subsequent work.) Where this album follows Dillinger Escape Plan is in the continual progression that the band has made from album to album; producing the music they want to produce, and often with the expressed purpose of suprising and jarring the audience.    In to the album itself, it opens loud and chaotic with \\"Fix Your Face\\" a song that promises the band has not forgotten how to play the frantic, chaotic complication of tight, quick guitars and arm-breakingly jarring drum work. Dimitri Minakakis also makes a guest appearance in this opener, a strange taste of 10 years changes as the original front man from 1997 backs up the third front man in 2007. As Fix Your Face seems to slow down and fall apart at the seams, it traverses us to the track \\"Lurch\\", which opens with Greg Puciato screaming in a stilted, stop and go style that seems to lurch along with Gil Sharone's rather odd drumming; this opener has all the feel of driving on oval tires. the track moves slower, but continues ben's weird stop and go strumming style of guitars that Calculating Infinity aquainted us to; additionally, Ben outro's the track with a supressed, solo like piece of guitar work that makes my hand cramp.    An equally quiet, stilted bit of drumming opens up the first 'commerical friendly' track on this album. It is probably this song alone that has many Calculating Infinity era fans throwing out 1 and 2 star ratings. Unlike anything Calculating Infinity & Earlier, this song moves in a deliberately obvious melody, the lyrics, despite their anger and resentment (and greg'ssignature bigger than life ego style) are, in fact, almost exclusively sung, with the screaming being the interlude (this is very much opposite of dillinger's usual style.) despite greg's intimidating style and appearance, he offers up some suprisingly high falsetto's in this track, and the sheer unexpectedness of this is jarring and grating in a way that seems signature to Dillinger. The song plays through the \\"radio friendly\\" 3:30 minute mark to 4:04, and the poppy bit gives way to a quiet bit of noise that is 'Sick on Sunday's intro.    Sick On Sunday mark's the beginning of where this album shines. Ben & Gil work through a series of frantic, mind breaking guitar and drum pieces that are short and supressed, as if played through a microphone placed a yard too far away from the guitar (and in a different room than the drums) over this, bits of static and other electronic debris ties it together before a jarringly loud moment as jeff, liam and greg break in at full volume, then slow the pace in to an odd few comments before dissolving in to \\"When Acting As A Particle\\"    When Acting As A Particle marks the start of 4 quick, sub 2 minute songs, alteranting between insturmental and vocalized. When Actin As a Particle is, to say the least.. weird. Chimes and Strings are abused, feedback is used as accent, and the track is generally, creepy. this would be at home as one of the 'cool off' tracks on Calculating Infinity, and, halfway through, it reaffirms this thought with Gil's frantic druming (devoid of any cymbal work and very sparse snare work) and precisely picked, stuttered guitars.    This all comes to an abrupt end to give us \\"Nong Eye Gong\\" a decidedly signature song and probably the one that all the Calculating Infinity fans can love. Greg restricts himself to screaming hoarsely over fast, slamming guitars and fast, quickly shifting drumming. the whole band moves seamlessly through this track and, one feels particularly sad that it ends as quickly as it begins,you might put this on repeat and keep a mosh pit happy for hours though. \\"When Acting as a Wave\\" the other insturmental, follows up with a jam session like sound, the guitarists riffing quickly and chaotically as Gil & Liam pound out suprisingly well fitted low ends.    \\"82588\\" finishes up the spree of short songs, again we're treated to the fast, precise stop and go of Ben's guitars for the first half, greg screaming along, and then the song drops down in a jazzy little quiet riff as greg sings from somewhere on the other side of the room, this has a vague feel of Calculating Infinity, to say the least.    \\"Milk Lizard\\" is an entirely new sound to Dillinger i think. the song follows the 'radio friendly' and 'poppy' vibe of Black Bubblegum, and together these are the most acessible songs on the album. For you metal fans with guilt pleasures in ska & punk, this song will feel right at home in your respective digital music players along side other frantic & crazy ska outfits. Fishbone comes to mind particularly when listening to this track, and if for any reason i can single out, its the very, very odd inclusion of trumpets and trombones. there are interludes throughout this track, in the forum of a chorus, that feel as if they belong to another song altogether. its this chunk that, with black bubblegum, feels the most like Miss Machine, though Gil's double bass work is much stronger for these pieces, and gives this portion of this particularly 'weird' song its credibility.    after that, we're back to a calculating infinity like series of fast riffs, staccatos and arpeggios as ben & gil showcase their ability to try and follow the music sheets of 15 solos at once and manage to produce nearly two minutes of chaos called 'party smasher' greg, liam and jeff are almost the supporting acts in this track, and do damned good work.    the album gives us a break with the first track over 5 minutes. 'dead as history' muddles through digital static, wind, and a weird bit of piano and upper octave digital organ work. filtered sounds break over this quiet interlude, and if one concentrates hard, it appears to be heavily suppressed riffs, distorted drums & screaming, before jeff's rhythm guitar chugs in under greg's singing. this is a track that almost exclusively features greg singing over plodding, deliberate music. i wouldn't call this commercial friendly, but it is certainly accessible.    ...and we're back! \\"horse hunter\\" certainly takes off after the high falsetto finish of \\"dead as history\\", and after a brief moment of screaming and psychosis induced guitar abuse, everything falls in to a Dillinger Signature, jazz funked guitars over punctuated drumming. this bounces and plays with faster paced frentics before Greg returns with screaming & singing overlayed, giving a back and forth feel that suggests this band could use a second singer full-time, otherwise live renditions will lack. even the ending minute of this track's singing brings overlays that, if the band can find suitable supporting singers for a tour, will be  breathtaking live.    this all winds to an end in 'Mouth of Ghosts'. on paper this looks like a marathon song for dillinger, clocking in just under seven freaking minutes. in truth, the beginning few minutes could be lost, they're a strange introduction that sounds like, to be honest, someone tuning in to the piano player that used to sit in the middle of clothing stores at the mall (nordstrom's springs to mind.) through an underpowered radio. to add to this, the rest of the band plays quietly around this little piano dirge in a subdued fashion, i imagine this is what calculating infinity might sound like if i had smoked an entire kilogram of marijuana before listening.    this lead up, all half a song of it, rides to a climatic screaming and howling series that winds up the song with a detuned thwack on a guitar string left to drone.    overall, i'd say this really is a wonderful album, and despite my shakeyness on the length of the buildup in the last track, it earns its place amidst this strange ride through the full range of dillinger's last ten years.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|Well, gave it a 4 star due to the fact of the song selections the band used which were excellent but as before later \\"Live collections\\" were better. Other then that, a great re-release of album which makes the original single disc a smart choice to sell on Amazon or E Bay for a \\"Buy It Out\\" price of 10 USD. Check out \\"Judemac Forever\\" on the net, search Google, MSN or Yahoo.
0143036556|5.0|Many people have written about the positive attributes of this book. I would like to add just two observations. First of all, I've read few non-fiction books that grabbed my attention to the degree that I felt like I could actually visualize the times and places being described. My favorite two sections were the ones on Easter Island and the Norse colonies in Greenland. They left images that are burned in my mind. Second, as someone who is interested in topics such as peak oil, global warming and so forth, the idea that this time, the entire planet may be exhibiting some of the same behaviors that individual collapsed civilizations did was both enlightening and scary. I have noticed that this is a book that is becoming widely quoted, and rightfully so. Even if all you take away from the experience of reading it are the many interesting little details about places you probably have heard of but don't know much about, it's worth your while and the price of a copy!
B00005JNNZ|1.0|The ONLY person who was able to act in this movie was S.Jackson. The rest of the people, where did they find them? And Ashanti, someone needs to tell her she couldn't sing and she definately CANNOT act!!!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Linkin Park returned with this lighter touched album that has gotten people wondering \\"Where has the old Linkin Park gone?\\" Though at times that Linkin Park is missed deeply after their two outstanding cds \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteroa\\"...they are far from being completely lost. Chester, Mike, and the boys hit into a different aspect of the bad...one where their producer wanted them to go. They headed into this album knowing one thing \\"Throw your old ways of doing an album...and try to create something new...fresh...and lively.\\" And after 100 demos for the new album...in lies \\"Minutes to Midnight.\\"     Mike-less songs, Chester-less songs, and a few slow beats make a lot of fans turning in the other direction. But before you blow this album off completely...take a second, sit down, and listen to the songs deeply as they flow. Has Linkin Park completely lost their touch? Gracious no. With the like of Bleed It Out...Linkin Park can still impress with the Mike & Chester duo. Mike took a less lead part in this album, even with his two solo songs \\"Hands Held High\\" and \\"In Between\\". Mike is still not lost in the songs, as he supports a softer background mode as he still takes part vocally in the background. This album let the two express themselves better as musicians and showing how creative they can be.     The band still knows how to rock, with a tremendous live tour in 2007...one spot being Atlanta which myself attended...and was blown away. Minutes To Midnight album took a lot of the setlist, but was performed amazingly and improved my liking of the album even more. There will still be haters, dis-likers, and every other kinda if negative critic to this album...just like any other album...but try and do whatever you can to listen to this album. Buy it, borrow it, or do those other things *wink* that will allow you to listen to this CD. Though the \\"every song hard rock\\" sound has left a little bit...this CD still shows that they are tremendous musicians.    GRADING SCALE:  Excellent (5 Stars) = 8 - 10  Good (4 Stars) = 6 - 7  Decent (3 Stars) = 4 - 5  Eh... (2 Stars) = 2 - 3  What Did I Just Listen Too? (1 Star) = 0 - 1    SONG REVIEWS  TRACK 1. WAKE  Serves its purpose as the intro to this CD. It tends to pump you up and prepare you for this CD...especially to those listening to it for the first time. When performed live...the crowd certainly was pumped up.  RATING: 10/10    TRACK 2. GIVEN UP  Mike-less song...but Chester performs very well in this solo song. The feeling you get while listening to this track just makes a great start to the album. Chester's long scream at the end will surely give some the chills. Expect this to be a single very soon.  RATING: 10/10    TRACK 3: LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST  The first song to turn the heads of some people. Again, Mike-less. It is indeed a slow paced song, but the lyrical ability Linkin Park has makes up for all the slow paced songs on this album. The songs is performed smoothly, but knocks you off pace from the high energy start to the album.  RATING: 7/10    TRACK 4: BLEED IT OUT  Enter Mike Shinoda...and exit an awesome song. Mike shows his rapping ability, especially after his Fort Minor album...but Chester saves the rockers with his powerful vocals mixing this into a well executed Hip-Hop/Rock song, without over-endulging you with the rap. It has been blaring the air waves, and doing great at it.  RATING: 10/10    TRACK 5: SHADOW OF THE DAY  Exit Mike again, and enter another Chester solo...with the slow paced rhythm. Already released as a single, Shadow Of The Day carries a good lyrical based song that is showing the good out of the slow paced LP in this song. Chester does a very good job all the way through, and even though it is indeed a slow paced song, Linkin Park does very good.  RATING: 8/10    TRACK 6: WHAT I'VE DONE  It has come and gone from the airwaves, while making some think when they first heard it that Mike was gone from the band. He is indeed not gone, just one of many songs he is not strongly featured in. But was a great single when released, and continues to be a great single. Wiping away your past, and starting a-new...and forgiving what you've done. Great song, great opening single.  RATING: 10/10    TRACK 7: HANDS HELD HIGH  Enter Mike, exit Chester. Mike returns to the cd after 2 consecutive songs no playing a vocal spot. This song is all him, and done with a non-rock...slow hip-hop style. The War song meaning behind it makes this song a nice little tune for those Anti-Bush people. I just think the \\"Amen\\" parts get a little annoying.  RATING: 7/10    TRACK 8: NO MORE SORROW  Hard rock song led by Chester, and the performance is very solid. This song grows on you more, and it should be a top pick for the next single if it occurs.   RATING: 9/10    TRACK 9: VALENTINE'S DAY  Out of 100+ demos made for this album, I can't find myself seeing how Valentine's Day was chosen. It's a slow-paced Chester only song that I've yet to grow attached to. It's more like a skipping track than anything. It's a decent song, but just not a good choice. This CD could have done with out it.  RATING: 4/10    TRACK 10: IN BETWEEN  Mike knocks out another solo shot but this one much slower than Hands Held High. This non-rap ballad is a decent track, and serves its purpose as a near album ending song...but just nothing you may find yourself listening too over and over again.  RATING: 6/10    TRACK 11: IN PIECES  The second to last song of this CD \\"In Pieces\\" is a very good slow paced song. Chester sounds great and the lyrics are rather nice. One of the better slow paced songs on this album. This album would have been much better if two songs like this would have replaced \\"Valentine's Day\\" and \\"In Between.\\"  RATING: 8/10    TRACK 12: LITTLE THINGS GIVE YOU AWAY <---VOTED BEST TRACK ON CD  Being about the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, if you have not heard this song...DO. Great song and a tremendous performance live. Should be higher on this CD, but the meanings and lyrics behind this song is what is slower paced song is all about. Who cares if it isn't heavy, this song is an amazing performance by the LP boys. Breaking over 6-7 minutes, you will be loving every minute of it. If not, remove the wax from your ears and listen again...be amazed.  RATING: 10/10    FINAL RATING: 99/120 = 8.25 (\\"Excellent\\"/5 Stars)    OUTCOME:   I think the rating for this album fits nicely, with two songs lowering that rating, I think it is just a mere step above just being \\"Good\\" and finding a soft spot in the Excellent category. To those in love with the lyrical aspect of music...will love this cd. Those who are expecting Hybrid Theory or Meteroa...this album is not for you. It hits a slow pace, but comes out very good and worth several listenings or even non-stop listening.
B000009DUY|5.0|Saving Private Ryan is by far my favorite film and to have recently experienced \\"classical crossover,\\" the soundtrack by John Williams astounds me. His music sets EVERY mood that puts a fine edge to the film. I have shuffled this soundtrack many times within my easy listening playlists and the music never gets old.
B00079FUI6|4.0|don't have the dvd's but love the show.  About the only show I do watch for myself. It's me time.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, I owned the VHS, and the dvd, I was excited to buy the blu-ray when it came out, I've seen this blu-ray version about 3 times now, It gets better with each viewing.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk about the movie in this review, suffice it to say, it is one of the best movies of all time, one of the best gangster movies, and an all around fun movie to watch.<br /><br />This review is more for those deciding on buying this when they already have the dvd.<br /><br />This blu-ray has one of the best transfers I have seen, the movie is quite old, but looks much better than the dvd does upconverted.  The colors are dark and rich, great contrast and you can see lots of detail.  The movie has never looked so good.  The movie does have some scenes that show its age, where you can see flecks of dust and marks on the film, but it doesn't detract from the picture, it just adds character.<br /><br />I have seen some other \\"classics\\" put out on HD-DVD and Blu-ray, even some new movies shot within the last 2-3 years.  Many of these are very soft, and inconsistent as a transfer.  This movie, is perfect, all the way through, the transfer does not disappoint.  It is deep, dark, well saturated, and nothing looks soft, light, or bad.<br /><br />Where this disc shines, is the commentary, you get to hear commentary from Henry Hill (the guy the movie is based on, and FBI agent Edward McDonald) he discusses how the movie really compares to his real life, and he is quite entertaining.  The disc also has a few other bonus features, and the movie trailer, which is nice.<br /><br />All in all, this is an amazing movie, with a fantastic transfer loaded with features.  You cant go wrong with this one, It's great, and for Amazon's low price, it's a steal.

0345409671|4.0|Memnoch The Devil.  Book #5 in the ever-growing series of The Vampire Chronicles.  It is here however, that Rice introduces perhaps the most compelling character since Lestat...the devil himself!    For fans of the series, this is a tale of anguish unlike any other.  This time, Lestat is caught having to make a choice; a choice of deciding where he stands in the battle between God and the devil.  You see, they are not enemies, merely advesaries trying to prove to eachother that the other is right!  Confused?  Don't worry, once you begin reading, you'll get it.    Rice maintains the prose in which has made her a household name in the world of writing.  Descriptions of the always visually impressive vampire world are once again at the forefront.  However, Rice again ups her own anty as she brings the entire essence of the existence of an underworld into this one.  Not just any underworld either, the devil's underworld!  If you are familiar at all with the novel \\"Dante's Inferno\\" than you will feel right at home.    A very compelling novel (as always) that keeps the chronicles alive and will have you waiting for the next installment eagerly.  The one question at the end you'll find is....when it comes to God and the Devil, what side will you be on?  Lestat made the choice, now it's your turn!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Received the product in a couple of days even though standard shipping was selected and it was the holiday season. This was a birthday gift for my partner who thinks I now walk on water so both of us our happy! A few reviews have stated that the packaging is mediocre and I have to disagree, the whole boxed and filing system is very effective and the chances of scratching the DVD are no more likely to happen than if it were in a regular DVD case. It would be funny to find out how many of those who complained about the packaging pull out the DVD and stick their fingers ont he disk :) This is a GREAT gift for any West Wing fan, the inclusion of the pilot script is a brilliant touch - just be prepared, the whole package including commentaries and behind the scenes comes to a total of 175 hours which is perfect if you need some quiet time but if you plan on the recipient doing any chores forget it, so far we're into Season 2 disk 4....only 5 more seasons and about 150 hours to go!!!
0471463396|5.0|I got this book from Amazon several years ago, have read it several times and applied it to my own investing. It is not for beginners, but does not require a Phd either.  The authors present a rational philosophy and a unique, detailed method that will help you to really estimate the intrinsic value of a share of stock, and then they walk you through actual examples. The writing is interesting, concise, well organized, and clear. The book provides a backgroud of traditional value investing methods, and then introduces a model which builds upon and advances the body of value investing knowledge. I have read many books on value investing, and this is probably the best. Some of the material is difficult, but even if you don't get everything you will still profit from the book and find it interesting and thought provoking. The second half of the book, from Chapter 9 to the end, profiles various professional value investors, their philosophies and methods. This part of the book was probably included mostly to provide filler, but it is easy reading and contains some useful information.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This is the movie that the seem to step it up a bit age wise. So it gets a little more intense. Still a great family movie.
B000069AUI|5.0|I like to call myself a late bloomer when it comes to Coldplay.  This was the first album of theirs I purchased, after hearing the band perform \\"Clocks\\" on The Tonight Show.  Before that, amazingly, I had never heard \\"Yellow\\".  Regardless, I now own all their work and I've come to love their music entirely.  Their debut was much more subdued and warmer, but \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is by far their most innovative album.  It seems more precise and calculated, but also more cohesive.  The general rhythm of the album is superb and it flows very nicely from one song to the next.  Though not as soft as \\"Parachutes\\", it has a quality more immediately appealing and catchy.      Chris Martin's vocals were never anything to scream about when it comes to technical accuracy.  Still, there's a great deal of heart and emotion in his lyrics.  The entire band seems to mesh together into one.  This is very evident throughout each song and especially during live performances.      Easy standouts on \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" are the opener \\"Politik\\" and the hit single \\"In My Place\\", both utilizing catchy guitar riffs and a sense of urgency to grab the listener.  The former is sprinkled with delicate piano and sudden instrumental surprises, while the latter relies on grand sweeping melodies and rich string arrangements: Both are extraordinarily intense.  \\"The Scientist\\" is one of the biggest tear-jerkers in melodic rock history with its sensitive piano and gut-wrenching vocal performance by Chris Martin.  \\"Daylight\\" makes great use of glissandos and crescendos, and is one of the more experimental-sounding tracks on the album.  \\"Green Eyes\\" is a charming love song that sounds more like old school classic rock than anything else on the album.  \\"Warning Sign\\" also sounds like a comfortably familiar tune, and the end is pure glitter and emotion with soft piano and vocals.  The title track includes interesting sounds of echoes and possibly feedback that add an element of mystery to the progressive and assertive tune.  The most recognized and celebrated song though is \\"Clocks\\", which in its timelessness will continue to hold strong as one of the most beautiful and likable piano laden pieces ever to be released in the music world.  While \\"X&Y\\" featured many songs with such a formula, \\"Clocks\\" was the featured piece on \\"A Rush of Blood...\\", and that makes it all the more special.  It almost sounds like there are angels singing along to it.  Simply put, it's a perfect song.    The tracks here are all wonderfully written and executed with awesome transitions from soft to hard and back again.  Indeed, it is easy to relax to Coldplay's work, and this album is no exception.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|This box is an essential item for an U2 fan!    I bought and I would buy 100 others times!!!    A classic U2 album plus extras album and a live perfomance dvd.    Simple marvelous!!!
B000000OU0|3.0|Good selection of songs, but missing a few personal favorite Eagles songs. This CD does contain a version of Hotel California that all fans must own. Worth the 6 bucks paid in it self!

006056251X|4.0|Because of romance publishers' typical neglect in numbering series on the covers, I bought and read this book before the other wallflower novels.  It didn't lessen the enjoyment, but I wish I'd read them in order.<br /><br />I loved the interaction between the two leads.  Evie is so sweet but also so strong.  And St. Vincent is so incredibly needy but also defiant and sensual.  I wish his transformation had been foreshadowed a little better in the previous book where he was a near total villain (so maybe it was better I read this one first?).  Kleypas does a great job of making us love him though and I look forward to every time this couple shows up in every subsequent book in the series.<br /><br />I also love the introduction to Cam who shows up as the hero in 'Mine til Midnight' and Daisy's encounter with him was a hoot (with some steaminess as a bonus!).

B000AP04L0|5.0|I purchased the DVD for my husband for christmas. It is my husbands all time favorite DVD and i think that everyone that works in an office setting can relate to it. I also purchased a red swingline stapler with it and my husband was in heaven.....  Good present for people that already have everything and that are hard to buy for.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|I am so frequently disappointed by the Anime I purchase that Tekkonkinkreet was a total breath of fresh air. For starters the animation absolutely blew me away. It's a seamless blending of traditional and computer generated animation but you can't really tell where one ends and the other begins. You kinda have to see it to understand but it looks stunning when the camera pans around the city. I might compare the backgrounds to Metropolis released about five years ago. The people are drawn in a very simplistic manner which contrasts in an interesting way with the unbelievably detailed and complex landscapes.<br /><br />It's in the story where most Anime fall apart. Generally the problem for me isn't so much that the stories are bad but that they are completely forgettable. Even a classic like Akira had a pretty paper thin plot. Tekkonkinkreet, on the other hand, will likely be difficult to forget in fact it's rather haunting. It's the story of two young street kids named Black and White. They are the epitome of Japanese Yin and Yang. Polar opposites who need each other for balance and when events pull them apart the balance is throw off and violence ensues.<br /><br />What I love about Tekkonkinkreet is how different it is from anything I've seen before and how I felt an actual emotional attachment towards the two boys. I really hoped the movie would give them a happy ending (I won't reveal the outcome). Another cool thing about Anime unlike American animation is the moral ambiguity of the characters. Ironically a movie based on the Manga Black and White isn't so black and white. Even a member of the Yakuza can do something brave, almost heroic. This isn't a movie for children. There is quite a bit of violence which may surprise people given the whimsical cover but it is a great movie and clearly deserving of all the acclaim and film awards it has received.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I love having all four movies together like this!  This is especially nice for saving space.  I have a lot of movies and not a lot of room.  Great idea!
1582701709|3.0|Very interesting book.  Good thoughts - you will enjoy this one.  Just use your head when reading.  Kind of runs along the line of Way of the Peaceful Warrior.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This movie, more than any other, is what the promise of HD home video was all about for me. Watching the final cut in 1080p was a stunning experience. Not just the video, which is absolutely top shelf, but the audio as well. I heard things in the film I've never been able to make out before.    Having every version of the film in one set is a dream come true. I can't say enough good things about this release. If you're like me and a fan of this film you owe it to yourself to pick this up on BluRay or HD-DVD. Don't settle for it on DVD. Treat yourself to the majesty of Ridley Scott's vision in full 1080p.    Five stars all the way.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Quoting the commentary section on the DVD:    \\"This one girl told me that the second she saw me pull that (school bus) window down, it brought her right back to school.      Every kid remembers those, like, weird little buttons you had to push that were, like, impossible to get down when it was like, friggin' hot on the bus.      And she's like 'The second you pushed those down, it like, brought me back (to school).'      \\"And I thought that was funny.\\"    Or, as one enthusiastic reviewer puts it:    \\"Just watching Naploeon as he stuffs tater tots into his pocket for a late afternoon snack is enough to create hours of enjoyment.\\"    The I Hate Gen X site sums it all up better than I can:    \\"Gen-X film is self-indulgent, tedious, devoid of ideas, weak in its storytelling, pretentiously focused on weird unrealistic characters, celebrates ugliness, and is often crass and vulgar. Again, because they have no politics, their films lack a point of view. Overall, it is so much stylistic and intellectual ma*******tion...They do all of this to perceive themselves as 'kewl'. They've taken us to the nadir of cultural and artistic expression, and have no clue they've done so.    The GenX audience is quick to murmur or talk or in some way indicate - so others notice - that they 'get it.' Often comedy films are not funny, but GenX wants to indicate that they get where the joke was planted so they nervously laugh - as soon as possible after the punchline delivery, when what was said was simply not funny. And the characterizations in often self-absorbed and pretentious GenX films are less than a sketch most of the time. We are given a stereotype, or an outline of a character, and GenX as an audience accepts the draft as the final form. Again they indicate that they get it and can't be bothered with character development...GenX wants cartoon characters on-screen because they don't want to have an actual emotional reaction to fully developed characters...\\"    Maybe I'm getting old.Maybe I don't understand the \\"humor\\" of Gen X, Y or Z.      But funny? Hours of enjoyment? Huh?  Gosh, no!  I'd rather get my prostate reamed than watch this again.
1594489505|4.0|It's a wonderful book; there's no disputing that in my opinion. But, it did not emotionally grab me like The Kite Runner did. Actually, it made me want to reread The Kite Runner more than anything else...
0765318741|2.0|I hate to go against the grain here but I found this book to be mediocre at best.<br /><br />It started out decent and I especially like the attitude of the main character, but the ending was a huge disappointment. I believe it could have had a much better ending in keeping with the general tone of the rest of the book.<br /><br />The last half of the book had me confused until I figured out that it had nothing to do with the first part. As I haven't read any other books by this author, I thought maybe my copy was a misprint.<br /><br />If I had it to do again, I wouldn't wast my money. My advice is to save the money on the book and if you just have to know the story, go see the movie.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|First off let me say I'm a huge Scifi fan and I have all (that are available) the Doctor Who episodes on VCR or DVD. I actually cried when Tom Baker regenerated into Peter Davison. But all the characters on Torchwood need to die in the Season 2 opener and a new crew needs to take over. During the course of the first season I went from looking forward to each show to hoping one of the main characters fell into an abyss. The only one worth saving is Jack (of course he can't die anyway). The rest of them needs to go. The acting was pitiful and at some point you need to care about what happens to the characters in order to want to watch it every week. I can put up with weak plots and terrible storylines (the 1st season had both), but I have to care about the characters. Please BBC, Torchwood is a great idea but throw the current cast into a pit full of Cybermen and Daleks and start from scratch.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|We love this video.  It was funny and even inspirational making you want to cook.  On the negative side it made you fall in love with a rat.  At that time we caught a rat in a live trap and couldn't bear to kill it after seeing Ratatouille.  So we dropped it off far away where there weren't any houses.  It's a great movie and one you can watch over and over.
B0006IINSW|4.0|Pineapple Thief is mainly the project of writer and arranger Bruce Soord.  Bruce also sings the vocals handles the guitar and some of the keys.  Soord is joined by his brother Adrian on keys, Mark Harris on bass and Nick Lang on drums.  The band often gets compared to Porcupine Tree and it is easy to see why.  I also hear a definite Radiohead influence and Soord's voice is very similar to Billy Corrigan of Smashing Pumpkins.  I don't think that this band is quite in the same league as either Porcupine Tree or Radiohead, but I quite enjoy this album.  The album is not overtly proggy, but certainly contains elements of progressive rock along with more mainstream psych / rock styles.  Highlights include the soaring \\"Part Zero\\" and the 16 minute opus \\"Remember Us\\" which closes the disc.  If you like Porcupine Tree, Radiohead or Smashing Pumpkins these guys are worth checking out.  This is the only album I have by them, but look to pick up more.
140120306X|5.0|enigmatic, layered, surreal, multidimensional...alan moore brought all of his strengths to bear in this supremely and explicitly  strange yet delightful book. as with the other LOXG books and \\"from hell\\", moore incorporates myth and matter here for another experience unlike anything in the world of graphic novels. like any of his works, you have to read it three times to get all of the details...and even then like playing a record backwards to imagine some satanic incantation...there are subtexts real and perceived for the reader to dwell on. yes this book is enigmatic and somewhat incongruent, but that is part of its joy...you just pick up whatever glimpses of alan's blazing world he offers up, and delight follows.
B00005JPAO|5.0|In 1997, the world received the shocking news of the sudden death of Princess Diana.  This fascinating movie examines the chasm that opened between Queen Elizabeth II and the British public when she underestimated their grief and failed to react to Diana's death in a manner that they deemed appropriate.  Caught between queen and subjects is newly elected prime minister Tony Blair (looking about 22 years old, and played to perfection by lookalike Michael Sheen).<br /><br />When the news of Princess Diana's death in a car crash in Paris reaches England, the prime minister immediately contacts the press with a statement of grief.  The royal family, on the other hand, are vacationing in Scotland.  Not only do they display no reaction to Diana's death whatsoever, they do not even cut their holiday short and return to Buckingham Palace until they are good and ready.  Things continue to get tense as the British public gets no statement or reaction from the royals.  The grief-stricken British spontaneously bury the street outside Buckingham Palace in flowers for Diana.  The tabloids chronicle their growing animosity towards the queen.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Queen sits alone, watching video footage of Diana on television, analyzing Diana's every move with a brooding squint that speaks volumes.  She seems jealous, regretful, and deeply puzzled by the \\"people's princess.\\"  Helen Mirren doesn't exactly look like Elizabeth, but she has her mannerisms, her accent, and her dowdy but impeccable wardrobe precisely nailed down.  Through Mirren's subtle but powerful performance, you become aware that the queen comes from a different, more stoic generation than did Diana.  Like Diana, the queen also served as a symbol of England and its heroic endurance during the Second World War.<br /><br />Only the prime minister seems to understand the queen's side of things.  One of the great pleasures of the movie is seeing him mediate between the queen and her subjects, attempting to repair the growing rift.<br /><br />Every great character study has an unforgettable scene:  the one in this movie is where Tony Blair after having been voted into office still must observe the tradition of going to see the queen and asking her to accept him as her prime minister.  He does this, and she - in a priceless exchange invoking the memory of Winston Churchill - puts him firmly in his place.  You've got to laugh, and marvel at both great performances.Every great character study has an unforgettable scene:  the one in this movie is where Tony Blair after having been voted into office still must observe the tradition of going to see the queen and asking her to accept him as her prime minister.

B000XCZGVI|4.0|[[ASIN:B000XCZGVI Zodiac (Two-Disc Director's Cut) [HD DVD]]] is a brilliant and absorbing study. More suspenseful drama than shock thriller, it's measured pace, and length, the original theatrical release was over two hours, guarantee that it is not for everyone. But there are still plenty of shocks and thrills as the Zodiac murders are painfully reenacted. I loved it, I found it deeply engrossing and moving. I highly recommend it. I suspect that it will find new life with the release of this cut.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|When you first start watching Little Miss Sunshine, you may have the alarmed feeling that you've accidentally picked up a heavy family drama.  The Hoover family of Albuquerque NM is teetering on the brink of disaster.<br /><br />Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) tries to maintain a desperately dynamic tone as he teaches a motivational class to six bored participants in a grungy classroom.  His wife Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) has to go a psychiatric hospital to pick up her brother Frank (Steve Carell), a university professor who attempted suicide over unrequited love for a male graduate student.<br /><br />She moves Frank into their suburban home where he has to bunk with teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano), a devotee of Nietzsche, who has taken a vow of silence until he can escape his family by getting into the Air Force Academy.  Richard's dad (Alan Arkin), a resentful hippie, has been living with the Hoovers since getting kicked out of his retirement home for shooting heroin.  And he happens to be the only one who cares enough to make time for pudgy 7 year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) who wants to compete in beauty contests.<br /><br />Yet even all this desperation holds a compelling edge of black humor.  The plot immediately kicks into gear when circumstances involving a default move Olive into the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant to be held in Redondo Beach CA.  The family has three days to get Olive to the beauty pageant in their unreliable Volkswagon bus - and of course the grandfather and the suicidal uncle can't be left alone so they have to come, too.  As does poor Dwayne.<br /><br />Two key performances are Grandpa and Frank who have each decided they have nothing to lose.  Frank develops a bemused and gentle hands-off approach to events:  he just lets life happen to him and laughs at it.  In that way, he's a good companion for high-strung Dwayne.  Grandpa, on the other hand, gets increasingly impatient with the adults and poor squeamish Dwayne whom he peppers with inappropriate sex advice.<br /><br />But he's always there to reassure Olive and help her develop her dance routine as best as an old reprobate like him can.  I mean, what does he really know about sugary-sweet kiddie beauty pagents?  But he does his best by Olive, even helping her pick her music.  When the movie finally gets to the pageant after the family has been bickering and bonding on their increasingly bizarre road trip, you may burst out laughing when you recognize the first few notes of Olive's chosen song.  At least you will if you remember the 1980s - at the hilarious and inadvertent inappropriateness of it all.<br /><br />In the end, though, this is a story about a family that sticks together.  It's a terrifically entertaining character-driven piece, and features fine acting by all involved.riate sex advice.

0895260131|3.0|Didn't it strike you odd that so many people claim that Islam is a religion of peace, given all the mayhem many of  his adherents cause, from Iraq to London, from Thailand to Madrid?  THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT GUIDE TO ISLAM (AND THE CRUSADES) will show you   convincingly that Islam is in fact a warrior faith. The author makes a convincing case, citing numerous verses from the Koran and the ahadiths (the religious traditions of Muhammad) to prove his point. (Islamic leaders loath those who claim that Islam is a peaceful religion. Ayatollah Ruhollah KHOMEINI verbatim:  \\"I spit upon those foolish souls who make such a claim.\\" [p. 191])  The book is excellently structured, with chapters named after often heard PC arguments like \\"Islam is a religion of peace that has been hijacked by a tiny minority of extremists\\" or \\"Islam is a tolerant faith\\". The arguments are then scrutinized, compared to the religious teachings and interpretations of  Islamic scholars, and refuted. Due to the book' structure it comes in handy in discussions.   The later chapters found particular favour with me. The fashionable politically correct term \\"Islamophobia\\" (one of many leftist thought control slogans to stiffle discussion and dissent) is examined and refuted at length. I found the chapter  \\"Critizing Islam may be hazardous to your health\\" particularly interesting, which scrutinized among other things the Dutch filmmaker Theo Van GOGH's murder. A descendant of the famous artist's brother, Theo van GOGH's documentary SUBMISSION about the oppression of women in the Muslim world had aired two months previously, when on 2 November 2004 a jihadist immigrant shot and stabbed him repeatedly and slashed van GOGH's throat with a butcher's knife. (Just two years before this horrible death, Dutch politician Pim FORTUYN was assassinated by a Muslim extremist.) Prospects are grim: Provided current trends continue in the future Europe will be islamic by the end of the century (p. 222)  One has simply toadmire the author's courage for writing this book, given that today even harmless cartoons can cause violent riots and mayhem around the globe.  Despite all the good thing one can say about this book, it is not flawless. For instance, maps detailing the spread of  Islam or the various crusades would have been most welcome. The complete lack of maps is a severe shortcoming in my view.   Also I have to admit that I did not agree with everything the author wrote. I can not second his favorable view of Judaism and contrary to Mr. SPENCER I think that some of the Muslim world's grievances are justified; let's not forget that they suffer tremendously at the hand of the zionists! The author's leanings are very biased towards Israel and to call Rabbi Meir KAHANE \\"a political activist\\" (page 207) is an extreme white-wash, to put it mildly.
B000I0RNV6|4.0|In the Academy Award-winning version of \\"Cinama Paradiso,\\" certain story lines were only suggested because the film had been considerably cut before release. If you loved the two-hour version, one of the warmest films I have ever seen, the nearly three-hour director's cut is a must. Unfortunately, the restored footage lacks the freshness that made the rest of the movie so touching.

0143038419|5.0|I am an avid reader. Every once in a while a book comes along that I just can't put down. Perhaps it was because I could associate with the author or maybe because I am currently overseas, but I thought it was wonderfully written from the heart. A must read!!
B000089RVX|5.0|If there was an option to rate this with ten stars out of five, I would do it. The sad, mournful songs touched my heart. The Open Door explored more territory; there were happy songs, too. In this CD there is no aboundance of it. But sad songs make you reflect on the sad things that happened in your past. Evanescence is a way to \\"get it all out\\". Each song is a masterpiece, and as a group they create something utterly out of this world.Of course, you have to like the type of music. Some people think it's goth. Yes, it is. Some people think it's heavy rock. Yes, it is. But there's so much trash in that genre nowadays that some people mistakedly bunch it up with the wierd, dark type- My Chemical Romance, for example. I'm not saying that you can't like Mcr and Evanescence both, but they're not the same. Evanescence takes that genre and make something utterly and hauntingly beautiful.I hope you have the privilege of owning this cd someday.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|This album is worth a lot more than $18.  I would pay $50 for this easily.  No questions asked.  Annie Lennox's music will be here still selling in the year 2107.  It's the sound of beautiful captured on a compact disc.      Timeless and essential to everyone living in the 21st century.    Buy this album.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica burst onto the scene in the early 1980s with their thrash-tastic debut Kill Em All in 1983. The jolting, relentless, turbo-charged guitar and drumwork set the metal music scene on fire and Ride the Lightning took it 10 steps further. Their sound matured and the songwriting became more sophisticated with more melody while keeping the same breakneck speed. Songs such as \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" \\"Fade to Black, and \\"Creeping Death\\" are classic Metal anthems while lesser known songs such as \\"Escape\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\" are supremely strong in their own right. Many of the songs deal with Life and Death and the darkness and light that combines them. A glorious Metallica record and one for the ages!
2226135022|5.0|A beautiful tale of perseverance and belief. Hysterically funny at points - tragically sad at others. This is truly one of my favourite books. It is certainly a good book for anyone seeking to learn French. The vocabulary is limited and the story is quite capable of capturing your imagination - encouraging you on.<br />For those who speak French fluently already, it is a wonderful quick-read. Well worth the few hours it takes to read!
B000OZ2CZW|3.0|Rihanna's third album, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is entirely front loaded. The first six tracks are the strongest of the lot followed by the back six in which the quality is noticeably diminished. Of the first six tracks, three are borrowed from other artists. For example, \\"Push Up On Me\\" contains an interpolation of Lionel Richie's 1983 hit \\"Running With The Night\\". This is followed by \\"Don't Stop The Music\\" which contains an interpolation of Michael Jackson's 1982 hit \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". Finally, \\"Shut Up And Drive\\" contains an interpolation of New Order's 1983 hit \\"Blue Monday\\". this aside, at times I was reminded of other artist whilst listening to \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" like Justin Timberlake on \\"Rehab\\" or Nelly Furtado on \\"Breakin' Dishes\\". On other songs I heard Lisa Lisa And Cult Jam.<br /><br />This all amounts to a half baked pop album. Rihanna has vocal talent, she just needs to have better songs. At 19, she has plenty of room to grow. For now, \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is just average. I'd like to see her write her own lyrics and stop using producers who borrow rather than create. Similar artists such as Madonna, Prince, Michael Jackson, George Michael all started off at early ages and were able to create new music rather than borrow from old music. Three stars for the entertaining and catchy first half.
B000W0IEII|5.0|Great price, unmatched anywhere.  Quick and easy transaction with free shipping directly to my home.  I always check Amazon first!
0671646788|5.0|Great book.  Almost done with it, and have really found his advice friendly, helpful, and will keep this one around for awhile.  Even if his PhD isnt grand, his advice is worthing taking something from.  Hope that helps. Smile everyone, Have a great day!
B000001DVD|4.0|Not the best DL but not far from it.  I would rate it as #3 (i.e. their 3rd best alblum).
0684135051|5.0|I think after reading this book, I will definitely be less fearful of trying to knit a garment or something that requires shaping which has given me serious concern until now. EZ's techniques are just wonderful and so helpful. I wish I had every one of her books and had gotten them a long time ago.
B00005AFVR|5.0|The CD companion to the DVD of the Madison Square Garden Reunion Tour. My only wish is that they had included Light of Day on the CD. There are plenty of gems for Springsteen fans in this one. Don't take my word---rent the DVD and check it out for yourself.  Better yet, take a peek at the set list on this CD.  This is my 3rd copy because two others have been scratched up through use.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Too be honest, I had never heard of this film until I saw it on Netflix. There must have not been a lot of advertisement for it. But I will say that this film is perfect for families with great morals! I highly recommend it! And it's great for both men and women alike. It's not only about the sport of golf. So women will enjoy this film too!
B000002A46|5.0|I received this album a few years ago and it's one that I really look forward to playing each Christmas season.  It's wonderful for getting me in the mood to celebrate! If I had one complaint, it would be that the CD is too short!
0887431453|5.0|I've been using this workbook to teach my daughter all sorts of preschool activities.  It's been wonderful!  She loves it as well!  Highly reccommended!
6304779607|5.0|Cobra is a beast of a man. Highlights including the Cobra wrecking his car and the infamous hospital attack.
B0011Z102K|1.0|I've only listened to the previews on all songs except for Welcome to the Black Parade.  These guys seem like they are disturbed.  I would not recommend this for anyone, especially children or young adults.
B000008I4Z|4.0|It has taken many spins of this disc to determine what I thought of this band and this album. This is my first exposure to Marillion and I had no idea what to expect. The band is very talented and the production is so slick that no one instrument really stands out. Please know that I liked what I heard right away, but I just could not select a category to put this band into and I still don't. It's progressive and it rocks but even if you turn up the volume it doesn;t really rock very hard. It's like soft rock or something. Anyway whatever it is, I am going to buy some more of it because it is \\"soothing\\" and \\"melodic\\" and it makes me feel good. This band is very different from most others I listen to and they are a welcome change. It's raining right now as I type this review and the music seems very fitting. Thanks Marillion! - Ciao
6305428425|4.0|You'll find yourself quoting this movie after you watch it. A few slow parts but all in all, funny quarky movie!
0375847227|5.0|This a good set of books.  I have to say the first one was definitely my favorite, but the whole series is very entertaining.  So far as the controversy is concerned, I would disgregard what the media and the uppity types have to say about this book and read it for yourself.  Oftentime, those people calling to ban books like this one have never read them.  I say keep your mind open and enjoy the ride.
0765357151|5.0|(Helpful? Not? Please vote, so I know someone is reading these :^) The book and the movie have only the basic premise in common.  The movie has been updated and 21st-Century-ifyed, and Will Smith is great, yada, yada, yada...that was the spoiler, of sorts. I think I enjoyed the book more, but honestly, they're so different, it's hard to make a comparison. Hollywood did what Hollywood does best, and made a drama into an action movie (see Lord of the Rings, where books full of peace and philosophical ramblings somehow became three completely, unbelievably EPIC war movies. I liked 'em, but it was hardly the same story ... I digress)<br /><br />The book is rather short, as other reviewers have noted.  The author is excellent at putting you \\"in situ\\", the plot development does suspend disbelief, and it really is a different angle on the vampire stories of old.  Many felt let down by the surprise ending, and it was indeed a twist.  I still found it thought-provoking, if not a bit sudden.  I truly think Matheson missed an opportunity to finish a \\"great American novel\\" here, though perhaps his novella will suffice for you as well.  I note it was left wide-open for a sequel, some \\"dues ex machina\\" surprise, that could easily continue the storyline.  I think this was common in the popular fiction of the day (1950s), though it's a bit obvious today as a comic book ending.  I can't criticize it very harshly on that note though.  This IS the same guy who wrote \\"Stir of Echoes\\" ...  All in all, I think you will enjoy the \\"headliner\\" story \\"I Am Legend\\", and some of the shorts afterwards are kinda cool too (while others are decidedly nothing special).  You can consume this book in short order, so don't miss out on reading a truly classic story.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|Read all the reviews.  Each one of them adds a different aspect of the difficulty in describing the sounds found within this album.  But they really only begin to make sense after listening to it.    It's the sound of the city on a rainy night when a light fog dims the view and carries various sounds into your hearing out of context.  These sound become the silence; from the din come bits and pieces of music, bass and voice in a mix that is at once repetitive and hypnotic.      I don't know much about the dubstep sound nor the scene from which this arises.  I've since spent time listening to his first LP and find that one isn't quite as laced with ambient soundscapes and it has more of a sense of rhythm/beat to it.  But there is a certain something about this album that keeps me coming back.  It's at once introverted and yet captures the soul of the city so well that it is quite liberating.      Just when it seems that music is stale, derivative and corporate cloned, someone comes along with something fresh.  This is one of the shining stars of 2007.
B000062XGD|5.0|I really love this movie. The director was a genious considering at one point you want to cry for the volleyball!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Normally I'm not a huge fan of cartoons. I kind of fell out of watching them a while back, other than stuff like the Simpsons and Futurama. However, for a movie primarily targeted toward kids I actually got a kick out of this one even though I bought it for my girlfriend.<br /><br />I would reommend it if you're looking for a good way to spend about an hour and a half with some kids or possibly your girlfriend/wife. :)
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Excellent!  Shipped sooner than expected and only place I could find this rare DVD.
1596680296|5.0|I got this bug to knit socks for the whole family and had never knit a pair of socks before.  I bought several \\"how to\\" books before I started.  This was the book that I ended up using over and over.  It has great pictures and illustrations.  I found all the instructions clearly explained and easy to follow.  She explains how to make socks in detail before you get to the patterns so you have a clue what you are doing before you start.  When you need to reference any part in the \\"how to\\" section it is easy to find in the clearly defined sections.  When you get to the pattern section, I especially liked that she separated the patterns by gauge (ex: 8 stitches per inch, 7 stitches per inch, etc) so you can follow the one based on the gauge you knit in as well as being able to use it different types of yarn.  I started knitting socks about a month ago and I am on my fifth pair. I highly recommend this book.

B00005QDW5|5.0|My husband wanted a Pink Floyd CD for Christmas.  This is the best.  He said it is exactly what he wanted.    Great cd
B000301YY8|3.0|James Blunt reminds me of someone who has lived a long time. He sings with such heart and soul and his songs really make you think about the words and their meanings. This is one of my favorite albums and I listen to it almost daily. I truly think you will like it as much I do especially if you are a child of the sixties or seventies.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|Reading many of the reviews I have seen two sides: the people that didn't really like it anyway gave it a try and continue to complain, and the people that were open minded and gave the series a true chance.  Unlike what anyone says these are the real reasons Enterprise got canceled.    1. It was on UPN, a channel which at the time most places didn't get which they didn't take into account when they checked ratings.    2.Paramount and UPN were going through a shift in management. The Main reason the show was cut short was cause of the new takeover. This had nothing to do with ratings that was an excuse.    I remember seeing the HUGE rally to get this series to season 4. If the series was that poorly received nobody would of bothered. In Season 4 everyone attempted writing,emailing and calling everyone to continue the show. The new management would have nothing of it no matter what was done.    Having said that I will give you my review of the series.    Most people take things that they think are official, but are not. They Look at enterprise and see inconsistencies. There is none. The original series has a hell of a lot more, and the next generation spent time cleaning up that. Enterprise was created to officialize all of the unknowns or the \\"supposed\\" known.  Enterprise started out in testing waters in the beginning example being the sexy scene with T'Pol. Having realized it was a bad idea, it was quickly changed. After many adjustments I found that most of the characters had more depth to them over the seasons. Each one got a chance to have an episode about themselves which was nice to have for once. Many of the previous star trek's had very scattered episodes and had small pool of characters that got a chance. Having said that, the only one that got less was Hoshi.  As for the writing, besides the last episode which was the most atrocious piece of garbage I've ever seen in my life (the real nail in the coffin), most of the writing was well done.  For Consistency, there was more episodes that had meaning to them; less fluff. If you checked reviewers sites with ratings of each episode, Enterprise is the only Star Trek with the most consistency for ratings. All except the last episode are rated a 7/10 or higher.  For music the first version of the song was MUCH MUCH better, and it was something different, you know how everyone hates different.  I Know I'm saying randomness, but I would like to explain things, especially since I saw so many negative type reviews about the series.  Please Everyone Check out the series and give it a chance.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I love the Beatles, and I love Cirque du Soleil......This is a like a hot fudge sundae with the cherry on the top!....The added scores by George Martin are wonderful....I highly recommend this CD!
B000SZLSB2|5.0|As usual Mr. Blunt has hit a soft spot in my heart for his \\"1973\\" song. It is a light and  playful song of memories if you were lucky enough to be alive in that period of time. I've listened to it over and over and think that this catchy tune and album will affect you the same way.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|My son adores the Tremors movies, and spent lots of time on YouTube watching clips from the sequels until he received this Tremors AttackPack for Christmas. Now he's off one screen and onto another, and making up his own Tremors games and graboids. Who says video screens dull the imagination?
B000M4RG42|2.0|This movie is pretty much a \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" wannabe that falls flat. \\"Ryan\\" was a great movie, this one's a flop, and most of the things it wants to say were already said with megawatts more power in \\"Ryan.\\" The battle scenes are uninteresting. There are few successful scenes that put us right there in the terror of battle that other recent war films like \\"Ryan\\" have accomplished. Where's those shots that become emblazoned on the memory like the landing craft door falling open and the GI's in front getting instantaneously mowed down like rag dolls by German machine gun fire, the guy searching for, and finding, his severed arm in the waters of Normandy beach, and the three medics bizarrely working on one practically dead guy while surrounded by thousands of dying and wounded? \\"Flags,\\" in comparison, is unimpressively timid and uncreative in its visual imaging. Do I unfairly compare this movie to \\"Ryan?\\" Art is partly appraised by the level of art that comes before it. This film doesn't view as a successor to the groundbreaking accomplishments of \\"Ryan.\\" It's more of a John Wayne film without John Wayne and with characters and scenes that mostly border on war movie stereotype with dialogue that is very forgettable. As for the battle of Iwo Jima, we get no sense of the strategies of the battle or how things progressed.    When it switches to the returned-home scenes the movie just becomes either boring or painful to watch. I've seen all this kind of stuff before. Give us something new to mull over. Push it harder. \\"They were the heroes, not me.\\" Come on. What does that really mean? How about, instead of just the cliche, we get something profound that reflects the background awesomeness of the situation. I don't just want to see the Indian (the film's term) end up in the ditch with only that cliche on his lips. Pathetic is not valid or interesting here. Another example, how and why does a man end up dying, not with thoughts of his loving wife of fifty years, nor his loving grown children who are by his side, but with thoughts about someone he briefly knew in a wartime situation fifty years earlier? Was that the sum of his existence? Sorry, that scene came off corny to me. Young men frolicking. Is that supposed to move me? Give me something powerful. Wrench my gut, Clint, like \\"Ryan\\" did with \\"earn it, earn it.\\" Boys will be boys, in life and death, is not much of an alternative.    The other thing that \\"Ryan\\" did with great success--which all post-Vietnam films are morally required to do--is get that question, \\"was it all worth it?\\" mounted on the screen somewhere. All that death, destruction, maiming, torture, and insanity on Iwo Jima may have been for naught. The history books about the invasion are full of that theme. It's nowhere in this film. The island apparently had little strategic importance. Come on, Clint. Where's that in your film? It would be an appropriate topic to include considering the present situation of the U.S. armed forces. We want to honor, at least, the commitment and bravery of our armed forces. Honor them by getting to the real conflicts of the human soul and the powers that influence and control it, and maybe thereby, to the amazing phenomenons of duty and self-sacrifice, or lack thereof. Come on, Clint, earn it, earn it.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Since the first time I heard her, I loved her soft smooth voice and her style of music. I highly recommend this album if you like R&B it will soothe your soul.

0790729369|5.0|With all the Christmas shopping, I bought this for myself and it came on time, in good shape, and It's an excellent movie.
0316067598|5.0|Shipping was on time.  My husband loved the book.  He finished it in two nights!
0440178002|4.0|I just finished Shogun -- wow, what a great book. I can see why it's my husband's favorite.     My only complaint is that it's far too long for a mass market paperback. The type in this edition is small, and it's so thick that my husband split the spine the first time he read it, so it completely fell apart shortly after I started it.     I had to chuck my copy of this edition and get the old two-volume set from the library.
B00020X88O|5.0|i bought this as a gift for a friend of mine - and boy were they excited.  Where else can you find a vinyl poster of Elizabeth Berkley from the waist up, nude, with suction cup pasties to play pin the pasty on the showgirl?! now, i'm not saying this is the best movie made - but for a fan, or for someone who just wants to own a discussion piece, this is amazing.
B0011XBLV2|5.0|This is the most amazing and ingenious western ever filmed in my book; Clint Eastwood, Elli Wallach and Lee Van Cliff excelled in their acting and the sound track is superb, unforgettable, a masterpiece by Enio Morricone. I cannot find enough words to praise this movie. It is my all time favorite.
0142001104|5.0|The Zanders have authored a short masterpiece that should be read by everyone who loves great music and wonders how it is made. Of course the book is about other things as well. Harvard Business School published it because it promises to make executives more \\"generative.\\" Don't be put off: this book is not about coaching rich and powerful people to become more rich and powerful. Instead, it is a book of biographical sketches, most of them illustrating how ordinary and extraordinary people collaborate in the creative process of music performance. The stories are told in a way that can inspire anybody, but if music is a big part of your life, you are first in line for gratification! I cannot think of a more enjoyable, beautifully written book on \\"art\\" or on \\"possibility.\\"
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|This is one of the best ever. The first 3 minutes alone are worth the price.
0446577391|4.0|I keep thinking of more and more cliches to attach to the Camel Club. You know, how it keeps going,  kicks sideways, has one hump or two And I see them attached to Baldacci's style and plot. This novel is arranged in a lot of small chapters, bouncing from the interrelated Finn, Stone, Anabelle stories.I could not really discern and pattern to the jumps, but the author sketches quick action and then moves away. This keeps the story from dragging, gets lots of semiralated action introduced which serves as character development. He really does show us what his characters are through their activities outside the main plot line. I think the totality of the novel is a bit less unified than The Collectors - we are a bit more into good old international spying and retaliation and CIA black helicopter construction as a motivating factor than in The Collectors. This kind of diminishes the rather neat mesh of individuals with the plot McGuffin of the songbook which that novel had. I guess I rate it a step down from Collectors but one up from Camel Club and a real improvement over Baldacci's early work. Oh yes, the conclusion leaves us hanging but I suspect we will see an interesting romantic turn in the next issue.
0385522401|5.0|Definitively the best fiction I read in 2007. I do read a lot and I do not attribute the \\"best fiction\\" title without cause. On Chesil Beach is written with great sensibility and gives  a very accurate description of sexual mores in the sixties. I have already distributed several copies of this book to close friends. Every one of them greatly enjoyed it. Thank you Mr. McEwan. Thank you so much.
B0000CFW87|3.0|I was not crazy about the songs josh sang. His best one was \\"you raise me up\\" which is a very good song for his young but not yet fully matured tenor voice. The rest of his songs I would rate between 4 and 7.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I'm 60 years old and have seen more films than I can count. This film is  one of the top 10 I have ever seen. The tension, the love story, the social commentary are all gripping. \\"Lives of Others\\" grabs you by the throat and simply will not let go until the last frame. Along the way it shakes you very hard from time to time. The ending is perfect. There is not a single gun shot, car chase, or explosion. This is definitely not a kid movie. I'll say it again: This is one of the best, finest filme I've ever seen. SEE IT!!!
B000SUKPKM|4.0|Great collectio from a truly great Amercian rock n roll band.  You get everything...EXCEPT...they should have included \\"Long Way Down\\" and the original version of \\"Name\\".  I don't mind the new version...but ya gotta have the original.
B000SXOGW2|5.0|Everybody has their own best albums. This, in my opinion is the best of Pink Floyd. Using a US credit card only rule for MP3 downloads is disturbing.
B000002VCU|5.0|Alan Parsons is an absolutely awesome band. This particular album/cd is especially meaningful to me since I am a poker dealer at a local casino. But I have many more of his albums/cds, and they are all AWESOME! It is a mix of classic rock, progressive rock as well as jazz. Recommend to anyone!
B0001CCXZW|4.0|I ordered Gilmore Girls Season 1 as a Christmas gift for a fellow Gilmore Girls guru. My 11 year old daughter and I have been watching and enjoying the girls for years now and own all the seasons except the last one. We even have been known to quote them on occasion!!! The season we ordered for Christmas came very quickly and was in great shape (it was used). It can be a daunting task to find used DVD's to give as gifts but this one came looking like new (and is now a cherished addition to her DVD collection!). So if you're thinking about ordering Gilmore Girls - do it!! It will make you laugh and keep you totally entertained.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|This is for my seven year old daughter.  She loves it and plays it constantly.  No language to worry about and seems to be a good album.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this movie to me, so I rented it off netflix.  This movie blew me away!  It's definitely quirky and not exactly for everyone, but if you're into things that are a bit unusual... AWESOME.  It's a story of a boy with an abnormally keen sense of smell who becomes obsessed with the smell of women.  He learns from washed out perfume maker (a fabulous show by Alan Rickman!) how to extract essential oils and sets out to make a perfume like no other.  There are certainly some disturbing scenes, as with any story of a murderer, but mostly this movie is funny, well thought out, and quite refreshing.  Instead of turning this into the next gore flick, they really made this into a piece of art.
B00005JKHN|5.0|My 5 year old has been wanting Sleeping Beauty for months, but it is not available in stores.  I found this on Amazon.com and bought it.  I was a great purchase.  I think she and her little sister have watched it a million times already.  It is a great movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone with little girls who love Disney Princesses.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|\\"Blade Runner\\" immediately stood out as a movie with incredible depth -- you BELIEVED in the world Ridley Scott created, it made sense, and it all fit together.  The 2nd disc of this set contains a long documentary (actually several of them) which show how this world was constructed, what went into it, who contributed what and how it all came together to create something that was somehow more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />This \\"making of\\" disc is far-and-away the best such documentary I've ever seen.  It has, of course, contemporary interviews from almost everybody involved with the production (actors, director, production designers, visual effects artists, gaffers on down to the financiers) but also scads and scads of footage to illustrate the points being made -- and almost ALL of this footage never made it to the movie!  It's like a whole 2nd Blade Runner movie, looking at the Blade Runner universe from new angles inside the Blade Runner universe.  Sheer bliss for the fan.<br /><br />Among the interviewees is Paul Sammon, who wrote the great, great book on the \\"making of.\\"  Nice to see attention paid to someone who, while not a part of the production crew per se, was very much a part of the machinery which advanced the legend of \\"Blade Runner.\\"<br /><br />All these years later -- my goodness, 25 now? -- the pain of making the movie, under very difficult conditions with a very demanding director and incredible forces vying with each other for control, all these years later everybody involved has learned to be gracious.  Even Sean Young and Harrison Ford speak affectionately of each other.  It must be true that in the end the work stands on its own, and those who had a hand in it can finally see that what they created is, indeed, more than the sum of its parts.
0761119752|5.0|\\"Pajama Time!\\" is one of the best books ever for toddlers!  Perfect for the end of a toddler's day, and a nice counterpoint to reading \\"Hey! Wake Up!\\" in the morning.  I bought these, along with four or five other Boynton board books, to read to my 1-year-old grand-daughter.  What's not to love about lyrics like \\"Pajammy to the left, pajammy to the right, Jamma, jamma, jamma, jamma, P!J!\\"?  Some other favorites:  \\"Barnyard Dance,\\" a rousing and bouncing good time, and \\"Snuggle Puppy,\\" a grandmother's perfect excuse to bestow lots of hugs and kisses.    I'm a reading education specialist, and I love Boynton's books for the following reasons:    -Sturdy board books, great for little hands  -Colorful, uncomplicated pictures  -Simple vocabulary familiar to a young child but with the occasional unexpected zinger thrown in (like \\"aardvark\\" at the end of \\"But Not the Hippopotamus\\")  -Rhyming verse, wonderful for introducing young prereaders to the cadence of language  -Stories based on everyday events familiar to even very young children  -Gentle humor    Here's a tip for readers:  Boynton books are meant to be kinetic.  Lean to the left and right, dance the barnyard dance, sing the song-verses, ~whisper~ the little words and BOOM out the words in all caps, smack kisses loudly.  These books aren't just read; they're experienced.  Boynton books make reading fun--the better to entice little ones into becoming enthusiastic lifelong readers.  (They're fun for the adult reader, too, and bear up well under requests for repeated readings.)
B000VDDDY6|4.0|I must admit that I have haven't viewed these in HD yet. However even in standard definition (on a 56 inch screen) the new effects are amazing. Just the shots of the Enterprise orbiting planets leave me awestruck.  Yes, I have my opinions about why they didn't do this or that.  So far though I am happy with effort they put in.  I have noticed that Star Trek DVD's are more expensive across the board. I was willing to pay the Amazon price without too much discomfort though.

0385720920|5.0|\\"Twisted\\" isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.    I'd like to start out by saying that this book was immensely different than what i had expected it to be. I picked it up, primarily, because i seem to have a strange proclivity toward Palahniuk's writings, and had not yet been disappointed by any that i had picked up.     So there went book number four. And man, was it worth it.    Choke, while at oft times perverted, peculiar and explicit in nature, should not simply be written off as some sophomoric sex novel for the 21st century, because, oh, it is so much more.    While the main character, a sex-addict with a habit for faking choking scenes and portraying false identities to please his mother, is quite twisted in his own sense, i often times find him to be completely relate-able to anyone in society, even myself. He is the paragon of flawed logic and graphic mindset, a con man, but completely and utterly human, and gorgeously written.    Chuck has, once again, penned a novel which anyone can relate to, and enjoy, one that is both sarcastic and cynical; witty and sad. A piece to read over and over again, and a curious look into the flawed mind of human society today.    \\"Amazing\\" was never the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.

1931559317|3.0|It wasn't what I expected. I pretty much wanted a book for dummies on the sky for my fiance's xmas present of a telescope. It's a beautiful book and it has introductions at the front with great illustrations, and if we were to get hardcore into sky charts and all that numbery jazz, I'm sure we'll be glad to have it. But in the meantime, we'll have to have someone help us out with it.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Warm, smart, and funny `Juno' is a sympathetic look at teen pregnancy.  Starting out during her consummation, the titled character (Ellen Page) shares the details of her infatuation with high school track star, Paulie Bleaker (Michael Cera, `Superbad'), takes it to her discovery of pregnancy (in the presence of a convenience store clerk, played acerbically by Rainn Wilson) until she follows through her decision resolving her \\"problem\\".      Enthusiastic, but trying not to care so she won't get hurt, Juno comes across her pregnancy flippantly as a minor inconvenience.  Juno is named after Zeus's wife (technically Jupiter, but Hera's name wouldn't fit).  Her father named her as a self-fulfilling prophecy of her natural beauty.  Her dad (J.K. Simmons, Spiderman 3') is ex-military.  He's divorced, but married to a born-again Christian, whom he's found stability for ten years.  Her best friend, Ellen, is the only one on whom she confides, and her boyfriend is someone she hasn't quite locked down in her emotions.    Juno knows her choices.  She is as innocent and naïve as she is knowledgeable about what she could do with her baby.  Discerning what's given to her, she decides to have the baby and give it up for adoption.  She finds her potential couple in an advertisement flyer, but once her decision is made, she has to let her father and step-mother know.    Much of the movie shows a perky Juno discovering the trek of her pregnancy.  The movie has such a natural tone and delivery from its characters, they seem like people we all know.  Juno gets to know the adopting couple from St. Cloud, MN, a relatively short trek from her own Twin Cities suburban home.  The film makes discoveries about her relationship to Paulie Bleaker and the details of the adopting couple (Here Jason Bateman's appearance brings a real time warp to the picture.) that seem organic and natural.   Ellen Page is so good with her role that I wouldn't leave out the possibility of an Oscar nomination.  Herrange of emotions is good; the discoveries her character makes are believable; and her witty, fast-pitch lines are blurt-out funny.  Everyone else is identifiably genuine as well.     While the old fashioned paradigm of the nursery rhyme comes leaping to mind, \\"First comes love, then comes marriage, then come..someone...in the baby carriage,\\" real life, especially today, is often not like that.  Without much maliciousness--except for what normally comes to us--`Juno' leaves a lingering sweetness that isn't artificially enhanced.

In Cook with Jamie he takes it to a new level - not only do you get a fantastic recipe book, but a true 'cook book' - Jamie tells you what kitchen equipment is a must-have, and teaches techniques that form a foundation for future cooking.<br /><br />It's amazing how often a person can cook specific dishes, but lacks the foundation knowledge. For instance, if you can make a great white sauce, you understand the principle to make a roux, a white sauce, and a myriad of other sauces.<br /><br />Trust Jamie - he'll make you a better cook.<br /><br />(Did I mention you also get the happy feeling of supporting the Fifteen Foundation?)
B000Y44LBG|5.0|(4.5) Ridley Scott's `American Gangster' has the look and feel of its era.  Shot the old-fashioned way, the film brought three films to my mind:  `The French Connection,' `The Godfather,' and `Serpico'.  They don't make `em like they used to, but Scott really resurrects the seventies in this true tale story of Black organized crime--never told quite this way in movies to my mind.  Even the details are transporting:  the Nixon and Vietnam broadcasts, Muhammad Ali on a small black and white television, and newly acquired microwaves take us to Harlem and connecting places during that time.        Frank Lewis (Denzel Washington) is smart.  His boss, Bumpy, passed away with much fanfare, but gives Frank, his former driver and apprentice, a chance to fill his shoes.  Knowing how keep inconspicuous, Frank goes about life business as usual.  He is flanked by celebrities and knows to stay away from his heroin operation unless absolutely necessary.  Some of the tensest scenes come from confrontations he has with others who draw too much attention to themselves, and much of the violence is on a par with 'Goodfellas'.      On his trail without knowing it, is Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), an officer going to school to become a lawyer.  He has everything stacked against him.  Like Serpico he refuses to take money from bribes or drug busts, which is very tempting since he has to go to court over custody of his son.  His partner seems to go along with him until it is revealed that he is doing drug busts to benefit from the graft.   Trying to revamp the entire Drug Enforcement Agency, Richie must face a dishonest fellow officer from New Jersey (Josh Brolin) who as a top drug enforcement official, gains the most from bribes that keep the drug operation on the street.  Trying to find new fellow recruits (like John Hawke) that are both honest and competent is a trial in itself.     To keep even more unassuming, Frank makes his own connections to Bankok, where he notes heroin is the purest and a connection is stationed in Vietnam.  Noting also that there is a high addiction rate among soldiers helps him to smuggle the smack with relative ease.  Also learning a business principle from an appliance store, Frank eliminates the middle man--in more ways than one.  This maneuvering also gives Frank more leverage when negotiating with the Italian Mafia, whom he reduces in revenue and importance.     Besides an intricate story, Ridley Scott offers the best aspects of celebrated seventies movies.  Denzel Washington is as smooth as ever, and Russell Crowe, Josh Brolin, and Chiwetel Ejiofor are in fine form, especially comparing their other roles this year in '3:10 to Yuma,' `No Country for Old Men,' and  `Talk to Me' respectively.      When Frank's family leaves church with the sounds of \\"Amazing Grace,\\" one can't help but think of `The Godfather' where Michael Carleone (Al Pacino) witnesses his son's baptism as scenes of blood and violence interrupt the images of stained glass and solace in the church.  One of the great draws of this film is how it demonstrates so many ironies working together in one true life gangster story. Just like `Traffic` before it, `American Gangster' offers that supply and demand is a mighty tool that can make or break people's lives.  As Frank himself says, \\"Either you're somebody or you're nobody.\\"  What I liked so much about the film is that even with the grim contrast between haves and have nots, the movie left me with hope, which is a good way to leave a film.   (Based on the book `Return of the Superfly'.)
B00008PX8P|5.0|The sound quality of this DVD is fantastic. The video is great and they even mixed in some bootleg video footage to fill in some missing parts, which ironically adds an artistic edge to the original films. I have several music DVD's from all sorts of music genres, but this one gets watched the most. There will never be another Led Zeppelin; although, I hope and pray that I am eventually proven wrong about this.  Led Zeppelin cannot be categorized in a particular rock music genre, because they literally defined their own music genre. In other words, there's blues, folk, soft rock, hard rock, heavy metal and then there is Zeppelin who brilliantly combined all these sounds into their own timeless musical masterpieces. This DVD easily gets 5/5 stars.
B000YENUI6|5.0|A cinematic masterpiece!!!  Shot in certain European and Eastern European locations in subdued lighting which gives the film an intense feel.  I don't know what you guys are smoking, how are you giving this an average of a four!  I guess a lot of people are turned off by the graphic violence which my pastor took me to along with one of our priests and all three of us were \\"literally\\" squirming in our seats during the \\"nude fight scene\\", three grown men mine you, but what do you expect, it's the Russian mafia for crying out loud.    Viggo Mortensen played a very taut intense undercover cop within the Russian mafia.  Naomi Watts played a very caring and sincere nurse trying to find out why the mother of a baby died.  As for the ending, a lot of people have said that it was \\"tacked on\\", nothing could be further from the truth.  I listen to a lot of audiobooks and I've noticed lately with a lot of books, and films a lot of writers over the year just end it.  I realize most people would like to have a full conclusion in their films like Titanic, Gladiator or Lord of the Rings; every time you what a film a author or screenwriter doesn't have to spell out the ending for you.  They've written a full story for you and at some point it has to end.  The writer decides to end the story so they just end it.  They have nothing else to write, they're not inspired to write anything else, so they end it.  They expect you to be an intelligent enough audience that doesn't need an ending spelled out for you!!!    This film already has several golden globe nominations I wouldn't be surprised if it won an Oscar for best film, actor, cinematography, film editing and direction.  This film though mainstream is borderline a foreign film and pretty violent.  I haven't seen many films this year, but this is the best movie I've seen all year!!!  If you go see this film you have to keep and open mind :)
B000UR366S|5.0|Although a huge Joni Mitchell fan years ago..while in college and years after, I hadn't listened to her music for a long time.. until a recent tribute album came my way. That set the stage for \\"Shine\\" which I purchased with pretty much blind faith. This album grabbed me from the first listen. There are some sweet melodies that pack a visceral punch and soften and humanize her message. It is an extremely intimate collection of words and music. It feels optimistic and she sounds grounded and heartfull.  The focus of the songs resonates with our times and our age. I listen to this album daily and find it just keeps getting better. I strongly recommend it.
B00005JPD0|3.0|I really do not know if this film is intended to be a human drama or science fiction.  All this back and forth between present and past was making me dizzy at times.  At the end one cannot but ask the question:\\" and the moral of the story was....?\\".  I enjoyed New Orleans scenes from the Garden District and French Quarters.  But I still do not get it what was this film really all about: time travel, condemning of terrorist acts and acts of violence, action movie flick or something else altoghether.
0316096199|5.0|I cried a lot through this autobiography about rape. What a story.  I didn't think I could read it all-it was intense. But then I thought, if she could survive through all of this, I could at least read it. I am a better person for having read it. I can understand a little more about the tragedy of rape and the hope and courage of survival.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Excellent Show!  I'm so sorry it was cancelled.  Now I can watch Jordan Catalano in all his brooding glory!  Great extras-commentary, book with episode synopsis, list of music played in each episode, etc.
0316666343|4.0|This is an odd and sad tale of a girl who dies.  I thought some of it was strange but I really enjoyed reading it. The story line is terrific. What's odd is some of the spirituality and after life presented. I am so glad I read it though.
B000006TRV|5.0|I saw the movie when I was in HS back in the 80s and have always enjoyed the songs when they come on the radio.  I decided to finally buy the CD and I'm not disappointed.  Even my kids enjoy the music.  We especially like \\"How can you eat your pudding if you don't eat your meat?\\"  \\"We don't need no thought control.\\"  Pink Floyd has stood the test of time.  I ended up purchasing Dark Side of Moon, too.
B000092T6M|2.0|I have to say, I did not really like this movie at all. I bought it because it was on sale at the local movies store and I am interested in Robin Hood. I just did not like it. Costner's accent was horrible, should have gotten a British actor to play the part. The plot was not at all that good. It was more Hollywood than Robin Hood. I am sad I bought it. It was a waste of money.

B00005JPTI|3.0|Too little, too late -- this film was much better when it was called \\"28 Days Later.\\" While the post-apocolyptic images of New York are more haunting then if the film had been set in any other city; by now it's almost become cliche and irresponsible. At several points, Smith refers to New York as \\"Ground Zero\\" for the outbreak of the virus; yet, the allusion to 9-11 is overt. Throwing in some zombies and a formulaic ending only serve to cheapen the amatuer comment that this film attempts to make on sacrifice, social degradation, and (ironically) irresponsibility. (5/10)
B00009UW0N|5.0|At just six years old young Michael Myers was a killer.  On Halloween night he butchered his older sister Judith with a kitchen knife and was institutionalized.  Fifteen years later he escapes.  This starts what is known as one of the scariest and surely most influential horror film ever to be released.  `Halloween' has been mimicked time and time again with far less appeal and or reaction than was garnered from this cult classic.  This is also one of the films that cemented John Carpenter as one of the masters of American horror.<br /><br />`Halloween' follows young Laurie Strode as she is stalked by Myers.  Upon escaping custody Meyers returns to his hometown and catches a glimpse of Laurie outside his former residence.  He follows her, appearing for brief moments in a yard, outside her school, behind her home; always briefly but the impression of fear is left indefinitely.  Laurie starts to rationalize that she must be seeing things, that no one is really there, but we know she is wrong.  On Halloween night Myers lurks outside the Wallace residence watching Laurie's friend Annie as she baby-sits young Lindsay Wallace.  Laurie is directly across the street babysitting young Tommy Doyle.  The body count soon thereafter starts to rise.<br /><br />`Halloween' set the basic formula for just about every horror/slasher film to follow.  The same general character development is recreated time and time again, at times with satisfactory results but most of the time with sub-par results.  `Halloween', being the mother of all slasher films, doesn't have much a standard to reach and thus proves to be deliciously entertaining because all its flaws are forgivable.  This is the movie that started them all.  So when Laurie gets an edge of the killer and decides to run frantically instead of make sure Myers is really dead, and then stays dead, you think to yourself \\"that's where (insert movie) got that from\\".<br /><br />The difference between this original film and the many copycats that have followed in recent years is that Carpenter realized the fundamental element to truly scaring his audience, and that is mood.  He realized that less is more.  The killings don't start till the film is nearly over yet we are already shaking in our skin.  Why?  Because Myers is everywhere and his `evil' is all around us.  We can hear him breathe and feel him standing behind us.  There is a scene in `Halloween', a famous still at that, where Tommy Doyle sees Myers from his window standing in front of the Wallace residence, the green fog capturing his awkward stance, and that scene alone made me want to assume the fetal position.  Where horror films of today rely heavily on gore and severed limbs, classic's like `Halloween' and even `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' put more faith and investment in creating an overall eerie feeling, a mood that permeated every scene and thus proved much more effective in chilling the audience.  This isn't to say that horror movies of today can't succeed, for there are a few that really excel in this regard, but as a rule they try to hard in areas that are less and less effective.<br /><br />As far as acting goes, `Halloween' is far from a goldmine.  Jamie Lee Curtis did turn into a fine acting specimen but her debut performance is really not too impressive.  The remaining actors like Nancy Loomis, P.J.

B000PY52EU|4.0|Aggressive and perverse, this film is a curve ball thrown with some serious attitude. From Ricci flicking-off a tractor in the opening sequence to Jackson chaining her to a radiator, it's hard to imagine this project being pitched (let alone green-lit); yet, Brewer somehow manages to elevate this unique story's violent and sexual subject matter through ingenius casting (with the exception of Timberlake) and the incorporation of a blues subtext. If it weren't for the compromises that it tragically makes in it's second act, this film would certainly be receiving much more attention. (7/10)

B000TLTUL0|4.0|Suprisingly underwhelming -- Burton manages to perfectly capture the story's bleak visual aesthetic, despite some self-referential moments; yet, somehow fail in emulating the quality of the theatrical production's music. Part of the problem lays in the film's brief running time (by comparison), but is predominately due to the failure of the supporting cast, namely Carter and Bower, despite Cohen's best (if not distracting) efforts. Regardless, Depp's performance should satistfy Oscar voters and Sondheim fans alike. (7/10)
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|The only book by Phillip K. Dick I've every read (and I'm a major Science Fiction Fan) was \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" which was the basis for the movie Bladerunner. The only reason I read it was because I was a fan of the Movie. I was thoroughly disappointed with the Book. Nine feature films based on Dick's fiction have appeared, the other eight being Total Recall, The Minority Report, Screamers, Impostor, the French film Confessions d'un Barjo (based on Dick's mainstream novel, Confessions of a Crap Artist), Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly and Finally \\"NEXT\\". So when I read all the Critics' Negative reviews when NEXT was released, I passed it up at the Theater. Well, I am now sorry I passed it up.  I went ahead and bought a copy a found the movie exciting and very entertaining. There were only two things I had a hard time dealing with in this Movie. First: Nicolas Cage looked old and washed out yet he can still get a beautiful young woman who is a complete stranger, as far as she is concerned, to have unprotected sex with. Think about it. Old, greasy headed chain smoker and young beautiful woman. Wake up and smell nuclear bomb for Pete's sake. Did anyone else notice the clip of Doctor Strangelove on the Motel TV? Second: His leaps into all the possible futures reminded me too much of Bill Murray in \\"Groundhog Day\\". Both the females in those movies came to the same conclusion. They were being set up. Bottom Line, good movie, worth the purchase. Enjoy.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|I purchased one of these last year for the Grandchildren, they lent it to another child who ruined the disk, instead of a new title they begged me to replace this title. They are 11-2, they live outside the USA in a developing nation. They just got a DVD player. TV and DVD is stictly monitored by mother and they spend less than 2 hours a day on the TV.  This jungle book was my daughter's favorite childhood movie and looks like it is a favorite with her children too. The lyrics are easy and poetic, the characters are diverse and the outcome is a happy one.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|I strongly sense the confusion in this film is not deliberate, but rather due to poor editing and a jumbled script. There is way too much going on in this film and more is not necessarily better. About a half dozen storylines should have been stripped out of this film, since they become loose strings in the end. Really, only three storylines matter here and not one of them is the storyline that follows Clooney's character. Whatever statement this movie was trying to make is simply lost in all the clutter. If this jumble of storylines was deliberate, then it was a nice attempt but ultimately a failure. If it wasn't, well, find a better film editor.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This DVD arrived about 3 days after I ordered it.  I had surgery right before Christmas, so after every one left I settled in and starting watching \\"Dexter\\".  Season 1 has 4 DVD, so I turned off #3 at 3A.M. this morning, love it!!! I feel like I'm on vacation (remember the surgery). Good job Amazon!!!!  Sue C.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Quintessential dance movie!  Unique storyline about a ballroom dancing club in Australia that hosts a dancing contest.  The old hands want to limit the steps used but the young dancers want to experiment.  Great tension and just unbelievable dance moves.  Thorouhly entertaining!
B000V7B90C|1.0|I obtained this set for Christmas which I added to my existing AC/DC DVD collection.  This piece of work is the worst of the lot.  The sound lacks 5.1 and DTS, plus the picture quality for the most part is equally as bad as the sound.      Save your precious dollars and steer clear from this dud.  \\"Live at Donington\\" is what you should be looking at getting.    Shame on the boys from down under.  They pulled a fast one on their audience.    BTW, thank God that I didn't get the 3 disc set.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|The title says it all, the more I listen to it, the better I think it is. It's a masterpiece, the collabs are just awesome, and the whole album is simply brilliant. Great Kanye West!
0451450523|5.0|The Last Unicorn, despite its cute title, is a novel both casual and profound, mythical and familiar, quirky and solemn. Combine Alice in Wonderland with The Hobbit, and then add something darker and more grown up.<br /><br />While many are familiar with this tale through the children's movie, Peter S. Beagle's classic faery-story tells a much deeper story than the literal, visual representation. It is a tale of second-rate magicians, tragic heroes, and of the ancient, uncontrollable magic of the earth and sea. It is as much philosophy as fantasy, which is of course, the very best sort; It is this trait that sets Beagle alongside C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and the rest  of the Inklings. The deepest themes are conveyed, to the discerning reader, through a butterfly's inane ravings, through a gypsy witch's offhand remarks, through the unicorn's intuition.<br /><br />There is tragedy here, wry laughter too, love lost and spirit-touching symbolism, wrapped in a tone that will make you smile and sigh, feeling nostalgic about magic.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) must contend with the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace), a new Goblin (James Franco), his own dark side, his collapsing relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and, most devastating of all, a complete mess of a screenplay.  This is a hugely disappointing film, especially after the first two, also from director Sam Raimi, were so good.    It's hard to know where to begin.  The Venom subplot seems to have been thrown in as an afterthought, with no attempt whatsoever made to give the character a plausible introduction; it just happens to drop out of space near our hero.  The Sandman's character is wildly erratic; one moment he's a misunderstood man who just wants to help his dying daughter, the next he is vengefully joining forces with Venom to kill Spider-Man, an action that doesn't help his daughter at all.  Harry Osbourne's motivation flip-flops around to meet the requirements of the plot, Peter's dark side is played for laughs, and the angst between Mary Jane and Peter is childish and annoying, with the sadly undeveloped character of Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) merely one more contrived obstacle between them.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Just finished watching the final cut of the film and want to give this set my highest recommendation. I opted for this 4-disc version because of price and because it had everything the 5-disc version has except the rough version and the toys, which are both nice, but I can live without.    The first thing that jumps out is how stunningly clear the picture is! I don't have blu-ray of HD, just standard DVD and the picture on the final cut really was cleaned up frame by frame. No scratches, no dirt. I won't say bright color because it's not that kind of movie, but clearly defined color and a sharp image. For the night scenes and interiors, the sharpness really helps as you can clearly see what's going on and the neon highlights frame every outside shot. When Zhora goes through the window, the neon framing is spellbinding. And, yes, they did fix the shot. It looks great if you haven't seen the movie, but if you're familiar with the scene your brain gets into a tug of war because the new insertion looks real but you've got the mental image in your mind of the stunt woman with the bad wig. Messes with your head a little. Also they claim they did the same restoration on ALL the versions available but I watched the 1982 US Theatrical version first and, although it looked great, it looked nowhere near as good as the Final Cut version.    One of the things I noticed for the first time on this super clean version is the jerk of a camera cut I never noticed before. I really wish they could have fixed this because it jars the viewer out of the scene. When Deckard pulls his gun on Leon and gets it slapped out of his hand, the image jerks for a fraction of a second. I had to go frame by frame to solve this little mystery and found the cut: When Deckard pulls the gun, his tie comes up with it. When Leon slaps it out of his hand, his tie is down. As the tie, in the up position is right in the middle of the frame and can be clearly viewed now, when it snaps down it affects the scene.They clearly combined two takes of the scene and did it very well -- just not seamlessly. I mean they got rid of the spinner cables, fixed Zhora, but left this little camera jerk during a great scene. It sounds minor, I know, but when you watch the movie, it'll get you. I don't know if this has been something Blade Runner fans have been talking about for years or not, but it was the first time I noticed it.    The narration is gone. This was my first time watching it without the narration and it played fine. I DO like the narration as well because I'm a sucker for old film noir and love the elements from The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep and countless other classics that are woven into the film. I didn't think I'd like the movie without the narration but I did though I'm also glad to have both versions on the set. And Scott went with \\"I want more life... father.\\" Which I think works better but they were not able to synch Hauer's mouth to the word.    The sound is also incredible! And that's, again, on a standard TV. No home theater of surround sound. If you've got these things, the movie will rock!    What's added only enhances the movie. There are no big additions. Just fixing of effects, changing Zhora, giving the bird something a whole lot better to fly up to at the end. All of the effect additions are subtle. They make everything look real, which is the whole point, right?    If you're thinking of picking up one of the several hundred version that just came out, I think you'll come away with a new appreciation for the film. The clarity of image and sound reveal things you've never seen before no matter how many times you've seen the movie. They did a stellar job on the restoration. Plus the 3 and a half hour making of, 45 minutes of deleted scenes never shown in ANY version of the film, and featurettes on just about anything you can imagine related to the film. And you find out, once and for all, how Scott wanted us to view Deckard -- human orreplicant.    If you've been waiting to see Blade Runner done right, the wait is over. It's not perfect (see above), but it's the best it's ever been. This is a great set, well worth the price!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Seems I never had time to watch this on TV.  Now I can watch it any time thanks to quick service, Fast delivery, & safe packaging.
B000GYI32M|5.0|I am a Japanese girl living in Japan. This drama is very popular in Japan, although, we still do not have the third and forth seasons in our stores. I was very happy to see this drama and also I am very glad that I could bought it in a very reasonable price. Needless to say, this drama was awesome! Thanks.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I'm more than a little surprised that people seem to be confused by this excellent movie.    Here's my plot summary, and I hope it won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen Inland Empire yet:    A movie actress gets a part in a \\"cursed\\" project, a re-make of an Eastern-European movie, which suffered the murder of its original starlet.  Through a series of extremely odd and delightfully weird events, the modern actress (Laura Dern) begins to dip in and out of the original Polish (?) movie, and begins to see that she may be able to save the life of the woman who created her role.  Can she do it?  And what will it cost her?    You can spin as many themes off of that as you please, and the first one that seems to emerge is the sympathy between artists, who understand the transient nature of their work, and their lives.    I saw one review that mentioned the loss of impact on a small screen, but I was lucky, and watched it on a huge 54\\" Hitachi TV, with a lovely sound system.    Why are those topless dancers doing the \\"Locomotion\\" 2/3rds of the way through?  I have absolutely no idea.  But it was as startling as anything else in nearly every moment of the show.

B000EGCITG|5.0|Just about every song on this CD is great, which is hard to find these days.  Well worth the purchase.
0974872407|5.0|This book is just impossible to let go, and one of those books that you just want to start over as soon as you finish it. A tale of youth, love, mystery, social turmoil, classes, not entirely told in a romantic way, but more in a suspense ambiance. Definitely worth it.....there should be more books like it.
0793563836|5.0|This bass guitar method combines three separate books in one.  It covers the basics as the notes per string, the proper way to hold the instrument, scales, and the amplifier, as well as more advanced topics as modulation, triads, syncopation, bass lines, and chord symbols.  Many bass methods are written in tabulature (where you read a chart rather than written notes), but this book exclusively uses notation.  A CD is included.  This book has a spiral binding for easy use.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|If you are a Bruce Willis fan and a die hard fan this movie doesn't disappoint. Lots of action and very entertaining.
140120306X|5.0|Great read - love the 3D bit at the back.  If you liked the first 2 you're bound to like this one.  Bit of a hassle having to get it from Amazon.com  instead of the uk site (not available here) but worth it.
1577314808|5.0|I can't say enough about this book. It is a powerful insight into the human psyche. It uplifts your spirit, and will take you from a low to a natural high. My only regret is that I don't own the book, but borrowed it from the library and renewed it to read again. I need it by my side, so I guess I'm going to have to purchase it.     It's not for everybody though, my daughter didn't understand it. It's good to have some spiritual insight into \\"new thought\\".
B000GUK72U|5.0|apparently ALL of the catalog will become available individually in Feb 2008;  Question is-will they be remixed/remastered?-near 15 years of studio technology upgrading have come and gone since the last reissues in 1994.  Otherwise it seems pointless.
B0000024JA|5.0|Method Man's Tical. Arguably one of the finest solo releases from the Wu-Tang. Even though its hard to pick a favorite because they were all so good. I've enjoyed all the releases from the members of the Wu-Tang and while Meth is not the most lyrical member of the group, for some reason Tical is the album I listened to the most of all the solo releases. I think its the dark, grimey beats of the album. It's a very dark piece of work and its strangely very comforting to hear. It has a very calming and hypnotic effect on the listener and Method Man's lyrics and vocals enhance Rza's dark, grimey beats perfectly. I can't even begin to describe what a dark masterpiece this album is. Hands down, this is Method Man's best album. My favorite songs are the title track, Biscuits, What The Blood Clot, Bring The Pain, Mr. Sandman (love the bees humming in the intro & the beat is haunting and hollow sounding), PLO Style, I Get My Thang In Action and Sub Crazy. The other tracks are hot too and its definitely an album you can listen to without skipping any tracks. Something you will never see now on a hip hop album. I would suggest getting the \\"All I Need\\" maxi single to get the Razor Sharp Remix with Mary J. Blige. It also contains the Puff Daddy Remix. There are also two more obscure and hard to find remixes. The Bring The Pain Remix is just as good if not better than the original and the Prodigy Remix of Release Yo' Delf is wonderful. I have both of these on 12-inch vinyl and the All I Need maxi single on cd which can be gotten on Amazon for about 4 or 5 bucks. Bottom line, if you like Method Man or want to hear an excellent piece of work, own this album. I can pretty much guarantee you will not be dissappointed.   Peace.
B000WMEAKC|4.0|I had been introduced to the lead singer of this band in a few different ways.  One with Timbaland and his remix of OneRepublic's \\"Apologize\\" and through a few songs that were done with Paul Oakenfold.  I liked the sound this guy added to the music.  And when I ordered this album, I was very happy with the results.  This album is very easy to listen to.  There are some faint R&B beats in the background of a couple of the songs on the album, but not too much.  It's a very nice collection of songs by this group.  I definitely would say that I would buy this album again and their next release.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Wu-Tang Clan have always made albums that go beyond and Liquid Swords is no exception. Me being a long time fan of the Wu, I would have to say this is one of their finer solo projects. Genius/GZA has always been one of my favorite members of the clan. His cold, scientific, intellectual flow is unmatched by anyone. He has a flow which compels the listener to drink in everything he says. This album is hip hop in its purest form. There's nothing mainstream about it. Which is probably why I like it. The beats aren't quite as dark as Method Man's Tical but they are darn close. The album still has a very cold, ominous and brooding feel to it. It's raw, uncut and it holds nothing back. I could never get the Swordsman beat out of my head. Its so cold and dark that beat could be playing in a nightmare. I Gotcha Back is also very cold and hollow sounding. I don't think the Rza's beats will ever be as good as they were during this time period. In my opinion, the beats on this album and on Tical surpass those on the Cuban Linx and Ironman album. Not saying that Raekwon and Ghostface didn't have great albums because they did. I know others will disagree with me but thats just my opinion. I think I just like the Liquid Swords and Tical beats better because my taste is a little darker. Gza and Meth's flows were darker so Rza had to craft beats to match their flows. I understand that. Just like Rae and Ghost had to have beats that matched their flows. It was crafted so perfectly. This is an album that has to be listened to from beginning to end. Love the cover art too. If you are a Wu-Tang fan or just a fan of real hip hop, buy this album. Support real hip hop.  Peace!!!
1402568851|5.0|I can not attest to the quality of the reader of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night as I bought it on audio as a gift for a teacher. I am a child therapist and educator who read this book when it was first published. It is a fascinating tale, but more so valuable as a crash course in understanding children with Aspergers Syndrome or aspects of autism. The book is written from the view point of a young man with this disorder and is a window into thinking and behavior. It is fiction and a good story but the insight is invaluable.  If you work with children, teach, are a social worker, in juvenile justice or even work with families, read the book. It offers more than a college level psychology course... should be \\"for credit\\".
1416914285|4.0|OK, personally, I really liked the book.  Once you finally got into it after the first few chapters, it was pretty good and hooked you into it.  By the time I got two third's of the way through, I couldn't put it down... until I threw it, near the end.    This is where my warning comes in.  It's not some stupid annoying relationship thing either; it's much more than that and much more unsettling.  I'm trying VERY hard not to spoil this... but I really feel I should warn you.  What really frustrates me is that this doesn't come out until it's close to the end, and by this time you've already connected with the characters and you know who you're rooting for and all that.  You almost don't have a choice in who you root for either, because of the way it's written.  When this little fact comes out, it's extremely unsettling and possibly disgusting, unless you're into incest.  By the end, I found it hard to still connect with the characters and I was so confused and unsettled that I almost wished I hadn't read the book in the first place.  If I hadn't already gotten so close to the characters and wanted to know how they completely change a major part of the plot to match and cope with this... issue, I might not read the next one; but if I forget about it by next March when the second book is due to come out, which I'm starting to hope I do, I won't read it at all.
B00000J2PH|3.0|This is an excellent CD with the best well known songs from Carol King. An Excellent purchase.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|Sound is biggest dissapointment for this album.  Sound overcompressed and fatiguing.    I hate \\"rate for loudness\\".    I want my money back!
B000VWYNNW|3.0|OK, first you should know,I am a huge Led Zeppelin fan. Favorite band for 30  years. I have bought mostly everything Jimmy Page released, even \\"Outrider,\\" but editing existing songs from the original soundtrack is unacceptable. It would have been nice if they put a sticker on the CD that said, \\"I sold the rights of my songs to Warner for a one time payout and have no control over anything, I let them cut some good stuff out because money is very important to me.\\"..Jimmy Page.    The sound is great, I must admit that part of it. If you are an avid fan or even a poser you will like it. If the suits at Warner Strategic Marketing and Jimmy Page read this, and I know you will, the true fans will be unhappy about the butchering. If you want to listen to the unreleased songs on the way to work, buy it.     Question Jimmy:  If the songs are cut, spliced, and edited, then you really are not giving the fans the live experience that they are paying for are you?    Fans..Here is what's missing:  Whole Lotta Love- \\"I'm just trying to find the bridge...has anybody seen the bridge?\\"  Celebration Day- not he same outro solo that was full of energy, virtuosity and control.  No Quarter- Awesome original jazzy solo editied. You know Jimmy didn't have a say in that one.    I wouldn't mind if I did not buy every version of every media of release of the film.    I am retired from buying anymore official Led Zeppelin releases.
B000LGZHDS|4.0|This was one of those little Christmas presents I got for my 7 year old little boy who has a Sponge Bob.  When I saw it I thought he would be pleasantly surprised to get it, and he was.  It was the perfect size for his stuffed Sponge Bob.  He now sleeps with them both.  It matched its description exactly.  It was of good quality.  It doesn't look like a beanie baby, but more like a stuffed toy.  I was very pleased.
0060555661|5.0|I was drawn to this book first because W. Buffet suggested it.  Secondly, I was draw to this book because it was first written in the '20's or '30's and has continued to have a strong following ever since.  With today's fad investment books lasting a few weeks or may a couple years before their flaws are exposed this appeared different.    I can say that this book was different.  If you compare this to say [[ASIN:0446677450 Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money--That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!]]  OR  [[ASIN:0446677469 Rich Dad's Guide to Investing: What the Rich Invest in, That the Poor and the Middle Class Do Not!]], you will see actual information being provided rather than general concepts.  You will also see that the author has enough information to fill out the pages of the book rather than repeating every fourth sentence just to make it to the end.    I read this book through and had to significant take aways for myself.      First, I  am not an investor in the sense demanded by this author and demonstrated by W. Buffet.  I just simply do not have the wherewithal to travel to companies that I intend to invest in.     Second, I now understand why so many people suggest diversification as an investment strategy.  They are doing so because it is the first step to time-averaged investing.  They just do not explain the second step to that strategy which is balance.  This book lays this out and it is the first time I have seen this investment strategy throughly explained.  So, now that I understand the point, I have made changes to my portfolio to balance my investments and keep them balanced.  This method is so much easier than what I was previously doing and is very likely to produce the same results for me as I am not an investor of the order of W. Buffet.
B000VNMMQG|2.0|Save your money. I had heard the sound track for the movie, liked it alot, and decided to buy the movie. That was a mistake. Not only are few of the songs on the sound track in the movie, but the movie was disjointed, slow moving, and, well, dreadful.
140120306X|1.0|Too clever.   Too many references for the sake of being clever.  Moore has won in convincing people comics are a serious art form but the Black Dossier is a pyrrhic victory.

B000003FD9|5.0|It's a curious thing; keyboard players seem to suffer no impairment of technique as they approach old age but, generally, string players fare less well. Starker was 70 when he made these recordings and conscious that they might have to be his final recorded statement on the Bach Suites.     I think his timing was perfect. He has magically caught that elusive point of intersection between the ever-rising curve of experience and the perhaps-about-to-descend line of technical accomplishment. To my mind, Starker's offering is a perfect complement to Milstein's performance of the violin Sonatas and Partitas.    This recording is first class and captures all the detail of the artist's remarkable technique; he draws a surprising dynamic range from an unusually full-bodied instrument. Janos Starker demonstrates a profound understanding of Bach's compositional architecture and contemporary conventions of performance. There is something new to experience and marvel at each time these discs are played and I know of no others (including Tortelier) of whom I have been able to say that.    Every moment is a true delight.
0780626494|5.0|This is a great movie for family night.  Not for small children - there is some course language and adult situations (to emphasize the difference in the culture of 1960 vs 1995), but this a real hoot for teens and up.  Good price, too.

0440238609|1.0|These books go from bad to worse in their treatment of the Christian faith.<br />The first book  (The Golden Compass) and the movie of the same name are used to \\"suck\\" young people and \\"not yet Christians\\" or weak \\"believers\\" into atheism.<br />If you are a Christian who wants to preview the series be sure to highlight the references which will be embroidered on in the succeeding books.

0143038419|2.0|the first dozen pages were brilliant. 90% of the books is lousy writing and a miserable read.    she could be likeable but seems cold-hearted: for example: she doesn't feel sorrow over the two orphans in wayan's shop whom wayan seems to have taken in simply to work as free cooks and housekeepers for her and her shop. the author mentions that wayan doesn't include these poor 'orphans' in the new house purchase and the author doesn't really mind. i bet those 2 poor, abused homeless children are not in wayan's house now (there is a small chance she kept them on as servants after the book was published and widely read). that is just the type of thing the author is unintelligent and insensitive about.   she is an oaf. an emotionally rough yet weak person. she obsesses on a random person and gloms onto that person 24/7 to an embarassing extent.

0374530718|2.0|Sophie's World was an enlightening novel that explored philosophy to it's fullest.  The form of writing Jostein Gaarder used did not thrill me.  Jostein Gaarder incorporates the history the philosophy into a fictional story in an attempt on making philosophy interesting and fun.  The two very different types of literature mixed did little for me.  Gaarder would have been better off making a pure historical novel.    I despise the way Gaarder tore me from historical contexts to fictional contexts regularly throughout the novel.  Once I was involved in one story line it abruptly changed to another story line. Gaarder attempted to make the historical context more interesting by putting it in the form of a letter.  These frequent letters bored me very early into the novel.    I give Gaarder credit for trying this different form of writing.  The way he incorporated historical and fictional context into one novel was very different.  He is the first author that I have witnessed mix these two very different writing styles in this way.   My only comment is Gaarder could have been smoother in his transitions.  The end of the novel was confusing and abrupt.  The story line suddenly changed dramatically and just when it became interesting it ended.  It left me confused and wanting more explanation. I finished the book with the author leaving me unsatisified.
141694740X|1.0|I'm trying to put together a book of my own concerning some of this stuff which is what led me to finally devour this lightweight bestseller. I grant that I'm not the target audience for Mr. Behrendt, but I was rather astounded that such a simple and deceptive work received the blockbuster reception it did. Liz Tuccillo is co-author and she occasionally adds some input of her own here. She is not astute regarding these matters but appears to know fifty times more about relationships than the work's principal author.<br /><br />The main problem with the book is its gigantic misunderstanding of female motivation regarding reproductive selection. A crucial and unbelievably integral fact that Mr. Behrendt does not comprehend is that women are attracted to men who are indifferent towards them. The snarky and condescending advice he issues in the form of answers to fanmail--and it is within this format that He's Just Not Into You is structured--soon becomes pointless as a result. Behrendt can describe to women what some men may be thinking but he has no idea what females are thinking or how they get themselves into particular situations.<br /><br />Women do not like guys who initially come off as being subservient (when they first meet them at least, long-term is a different matter entirely). This is why the \\"nice guys finishing last\\" mantra came about in the first place. That this quip about nice guys is so well known is due to its being true. Women, for a variety of psychological reasons, are repulsed by men who worship them in the early stages of courtship. They want a man who's a challenge and one who will not immediately roll over for them and become their groupie. That's why they attach themselves to fellows who \\"are not that into them.\\"<br /><br />What males reading this haven't had a girl you were only mildly interested in end up falling love with you?

B00005MKA1|3.0|If you buy into the image of Marley as being this really mellow, optimistic, happy guy, this album pretty much will solidify that image in your mind. Even when the lyrics are melancholy (\\"She's Gone\\"), the grooves are so sunny you'd think they were meant as the soundtrack to some long-forgotten commercial pushed by the Jamaican tourism industry. That doesn't matter, though, because the first side of this is as good as anything else Bob has ever done, which for the most part is fantastic. Several classics - the lazy \\"Easy Skanking\\", with a slightly jazzy sax; the slightly disjointed, slightly menacing \\"Sun is Shining\\"; \\"Satisfy My Soul\\", a great reggae groove with a slight touch of R&B; and especially the catchy \\"Is This Love\\", with a great chorus and guitar hook. Oh, and the title track too, I guess. It's good. But side two slightly falters. Now, other than the gimmicky \\"Time Will Tell\\" there ain't a single bad song on this puppy, but I'd still much rather be listening to side one - it's loaded down with mediocre material, and it seems like most of it was just reprised from Exodus (a must-have essential classic that's amongst my favorite albums ever, thought I'd add that little tidbit) - \\"Misty Morning\\" has a similar horn part; and \\"Running Away\\" could easily be any track off Exodus' first side. I honestly wouldn't notice the difference. A couple other songs on that side are forgettable too, like the aforementioned \\"She's Gone\\", which practically defines \\"uneventful\\", and \\"Crisis\\", which tries to reclaim the \\"Lively Up Yourself\\" vibe. I mean, diversity was never Bob's strong point - he had a lot of other stuff going for him, so that didn't matter - but for the most part I can tell Bob Marley songs apart, even if they all fit a general formula. I can't tell these apart, though. Sorry. Anyway, side one's classic stuff, but I'm not big on side two, so I'm not really gonna recommend it unless you own the essentials - Catch a Fire, Burnin', Natty Dread, Live!, Exodus, Babylon By Bus and the compilation to end all compilations, Legend.bylon By Bus and the compilation to end all compilations, Legend.
B000UR9T8C|1.0|Plot in a nutshell: picking up where #2 left off - or maybe a year or so after #2 - it almost looks like Peter Parker's life has turned around for the better. He's excelling in his studies despite being hit with spitballs by lesser intellects (spitballs? come on Sam, even first graders don't do that anymore!), he has the love of his life, Mary-Jane Watson by his side, MJ just got the lead role in a Broadway musical, he's thinking of popping the question to her, and New York is loving his alter ego, Spider-Man. After the first showing of MJ's play, they enjoy a moment in a big web, staring at the moon, being romantic and affectionate towards each other, so for our hero, life is finally good.    But then the real world brings Pete and MJ's fantasy world crashing down around them. Old friend Harry Osborne is still out to avenge his father, Norman's death, as Norman died as Green Goblin against Spidey - derailed only by a brief memory loss - MJ gets fired from her play due to bad critical response over her singing ability or lack thereof, Peter is so high on the love he's getting from the NY populace that he's not being quite as sensitive to her as he should while she's not giving him the grounding he needs, and Gwen Stacy, a cute classmate of Peter's, seems to have her eye on him. To make things worse, Peter learns that a villain named Flint Marko, now the mutated Sandman, was the real killer of Uncle Ben ala Joker killing Batman's parents in the 1989 Batman film - though Sandman reveals it was an accident - and Peter's spot at the Daily Bugle is now being threatened by a smarmy rival photographer named Eddie Brock Jr. Then Pete's Spider-Man suit gets slimed with black goo that turns out to be an alien symbiont, that augments his powers as well as his aggression. When Peter finally realizes what the black symbiont is doing to him and what it will cost him, he rids himself of it in a church, using the noise of the ringing bell to knock it off - only to have it fall on Brock, who came to the church to pray for Peter's death by God's hand after Peter got him fired for submitting photo-shopped pictures of Spider-Man doing evil. This results in the creation of Venom, who allies himself with Sandman to kill Spider-Man. Who will survive? While it stands head and shoulders above last year's barely broke even super-turkey \\"Superman Returns\\", a super-heroic dud if there ever was one, Spider-Man 3 suffers from the same problems that plagued last year's runaway swashbuckler hit sequel \\"Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest\\" in that it over-stuffs itself and loses some of the idiosyncrasies that made the first go around so appealing, and also works against its themes of hubris and forgiveness. The actors do their best, but the material isn't up to par. Maguire appears to be having fun during his \\"dark\\" montage (the walk down the streets while pointing and pelvic thrusting at women who look at him with disgust obviously meant as a dark flip-side to the lighthearted 'Raindrops' montage of #2), but his fling with his dark side really should have been handled more seriously. Dunst, not the greatest actress by any means, gives her all but the film isn't always complimentary towards her. Franco perhaps fairs better as Harry, the friend haunted by old demons and a father's specter that he cannot shake.    Sporting what must be the worst bleach job in cinema history, natural red head Bryce Dalla Howard, almost unrecognizable with ice cream blonde hair, makes the most of the underwritten Gwen Stacy, here given a connection to Eddie Brock that never existed in either the mainstream or Ultimate Marvel universes. But Gwen, the ill-fated lover who was brutally murdered by the Green Goblin back in the 1970s, is little more than a MacGuffin, a plot device to annoy Peter and MJ.    Villains... oh there are too many. Thomas Haden Church makes the most of his Sandman character, a complex but fairly low ranking villain who gets the spotlight mostly because director Sam Raimi seems to like him, but he only appears sporadically, and the thing with him as Uncle Ben's accidental killer not only feels forced but undermines the guilt factor that drives Spider-Man.    Rail thin Topher Grace is hopelessly miscast as Brock/Venom, playing him as basically a mean, jerky version of his 70s Show character, and he's clearly in over his head because he has neither the physicality or intense range to pull it off. Grace no doubt hoped Venom would do for him what Batman did for Michael Keaton, but it just doesn't work. This is what happens when directors are forced to use characters they clearly don't like and then create watered down hybrids of them from their mainstream/Ultimate universe counterparts.     Well, the action sequences are still superb, and the film does have an obviously deep love for its title character. It's biggest crime is that it over-reaches its grasp, as seems to be the fate of so many comic book film franchises. So it's entirely great, but it's not entirely bad either.
B000PC1JKS|5.0|I've never really heard a Marley album I didn't like, but this is arguably the best of the bunch. Classic hits abound, including my favorite Bob Marley song, the heartbreaking ballad \\"Waiting in Vain\\"; the message oriented space-reggae title track; \\"Jammin'\\", with a fantastic groove, unforgettable chorus, and unbeatable atmosphere; and the feel-good instant-smile dynamic duo closers \\"Three Little Birds\\" and the Curtis Mayfield quoting \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\". If you haven't heard these five tracks, I don't know where you've been, but you owe it to yourself to listen to them.<br />But how's the rest? About as good, surprisingly. Of the leftovers, my favorite is the sensual slow jam \\"Turn Your Lights Down Low\\", an underrated song that really deserves more recognition, though I also adore the vibe sent out by \\"Natural Mystic\\", with its suspenseful fade-in. Awesome way to start a record. The remaining three songs on the side don't match up to that standard, but that's all because the ceiling on this one's pretty high. Okay, so \\"So Much Things to Say\\" won't ever be mentioned in Bob's upper echelons, but it's decent; \\"The Heathen\\" has an interesting synthesizer part; and \\"Guiltiness\\" features a fantastic refrain.<br />My only complaint about this album is what ISN'T on it. \\"Punky Reggae Party\\", the b-side of \\"Jammin'\\", is one of my absolute favorite Bob songs. I wish it had made its way onto the album. For whatever reason, it didn't find its way on as a bonus track to this \\"30th anniversary edition\\", even though it's available in such format on the other issue. Weird! In fact, all the this edition really did was add a slipcase with a really cool photo of Bob on it.<br />Whatever, no matter how you buy Exodus it's a very worthy purchase. Probably the first Marley album you should get, even though Catch a Fire is better.

B000YABYSS|4.0|Denzel Washington's \\"The Great Debaters\\" has that classic feel-good attitude about it, the kind that can be both uplifting and inspiring when we feel that life is getting us down. I admit that sounds a little hokey. I also admit that the story is somewhat predictable, especially as it nears the end. But the strengths of this film far outweigh the weaknesses--this is a pleasant and enjoyable story, one in which overcoming adversity is not only the overall theme, but also the literal driving force of the plot. I use the word \\"plot\\" because I have no way of knowing how accurately it interprets real life; the year 1935 saw the debate team from Marshall, Texas' all black Wiley College compete with several major, mostly white universities. Leading Wiley's team was Melvin B. Tolson, an African American English professor who stirred up controversy not only because of his race, but also because of his radical political beliefs.    In the film, Denzel Washington portrays Tolson as a motivating but firm man of principle, believing that a debate can only be won through a strict regiment of reason and logic. The beginning of the semester sees the formation of a new debate team, and out of the forty-five students who try out, only four are chosen. One is Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), a young man so disillusioned by life that he drowns his sorrows in reckless behavior: he drinks; he womanizes; he gets into fights with dangerous people. He's also Tolson's mental and emotional equal--both are strong-willed and stubborn, and both are willing to match wits with each other. The second student is Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), the first woman to ever be on Wiley's debate team. The feelings between her and Henry are strong, if a little stormy: while she does enjoy the occasional party, she doesn't appreciate the way he deals with his pain.    The third student is James Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), who must have been brilliant since he was in college at age fourteen. He also has feelingsfor Samantha, but because she only sees him as a friend, he constantly feels rejected. It doesn't help that he's always assigned as the debate team's researcher; he'd like the chance to actually debate an opposing team. His drive to succeed academically was most likely brought on by his father (Forest Whitaker, and in case you're wondering, no, he's not Denzel Whitaker's real life father); as a professor, he believes that nothing is more important than an education. It's so important to him, in fact, that some may perceive him as unsympathetic and needlessly stern.    The fourth student is Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams), who's eager to please everyone, especially Professor Tolson. I wish more about this character had been explored, because being the teacher's pet is always indicative of some deep-seeded need for attention. As it was, this character is the least developed. One thing we do learn is that his father doesn't agree with communism, which is bad since rumors have been spreading about Tolson's political beliefs; dressed as a simple farmer, he secretly meets with other farmers--both white and black--and discuss how they should form into a union, which would theoretically mean equal pay for every worker. One such meeting is interrupted by a group of white vigilantes who, as you might expect, prefer the status quo to progression. Leading this group is Dozier (John Heard), Marshall's bigoted sheriff.    The major highlights of this film are the debate scenes, all of which are effective in their simplicity. They show how the Wiley team earned its reputation as undefeated champions, and the victories are so satisfying that it's easy to overlook the routine nature of the plot. Watching the students carrying off yet another trophy, I felt joyous and triumphant inside, and isn't that exactly the way I was supposed to feel? As a director, Washington has crafted a film that isn't at all unlike some of the better sports movies--it puts the characters through a series of trying circumstances only for them to arise as one and transcend. \\"The Great Debaters\\" definitely accomplishes that goal, and accomplishes it well.    This is a good thing because some heavy-handed material is not spared on the audience. Keep in mind that this takes place in 1935 in the Jim Crow south; the film's single most disturbing scene shows a white mob surrounding a lynched black man, his dead body hanging from a tree branch and burnt beyond all recognition. Tolson and his debate team see this as they drive late at night, and in the end, they barely escape with their lives.    The film culminates with the Wiley team debating Harvard University, an event so historic that it was broadcast all over the country via radio. I guess it doesn't matter that, in real life, Wiley never debated Harvard--for this story, Harvard is symbolic of that one major obstacle to be overcome. You're just going to have to see for yourselves if Wiley wins the debate; you might have some idea given the kind of film this is, but even if this is the case, I'd still recommend this movie to you. \\"The Great Debaters\\" is good-natured and inspirational, the kind of film we all want to see from time to time. In all honesty, it was an absolute pleasure to watch something so uplifting. Let's face it: movies about winning teams--of any sport--can make you feel like a winner, as well.

I don't say anything, just send it.  It answers their questions and comforts them. This book is clear with no opinions - just facts received from subjects.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Priceless! Apparently a few reviewing predecessors have totally missed the point. This is what the wonderful realm of Independent film is all about. Two simple, sad people meet, find a common bond in music, and go on with their lives. There are no statements to be made, no barriers to be broken down, no ambiguity to be studied...simply a lovely story about nice, simple people. The original music is fine, and the non-actors actually did a fine job. Truth be told, I only rented it because of all the awards it's received, and had to find out what the buzz was about. Independent film is definitely alive and well, and this is one the whole family can enjoy.  UPDATE, 2/25/08: Perhaps the Oscar win for Best Song will help give this small movie a big audience. It's only nomination, it deserved to win.
038533348X|1.0|I really wanted to like this book. I loved \\"Breakfast of Champions.\\"   But in \\"Cradle,\\" I didn't connect with any of the characters or the story, and though I usually enjoy parodies of religion and apocalyptic themes, I thought the whole Bokononism thing was dumb and unoriginal. Too many ideas and concepts were forced into this book, none having a meaningful impact.   I only got through the first 100 pages, and I'm the type who ALWAYS finishes books. No more. Life's too short.
B000HCPU0Q|3.0|The Clash box set is a awesome box set for those who plan on not listening to the songs. The cds inside are packaged into their own sleeves. Thus, when wanting to listen to all the tracks, one must own a 19 disc player or be ready to change out cds after 2 songs. For the collectors out there, buy the box set and the normal cd as well. That way you have one for listening and one for looking cool on the shelf. For the listeners out there, buy the single disc greatest hits cds and save some cash. The idea of the box set might go against the ideas that the Clash were going for, but then money does talk.

B000TSIK14|5.0|This CD just rocks from the first song to the last. I was kinda wondering what they were doing with themselves. I've seen them live a few years back and they didn't play anything past Alien Nation. This shows the return of one pioneering metal band from the 80's. I thought they lost their way down the commercial road, but they found themselves back on the right path. The whole CD is just amazing. When I saw that they were releasing anothe album, I just thought, \\"great, what kind of disappointment can they do now?\\" From the first listen, I thought \\"OK, it's the opener, it's gotta be a killer.\\" Then I heard the next song and then the whole CD. I was blown away. This is a rocking CD. I am very pleased to own it, I recommend that you own it to. This is the album that should have been released after Alien Nation. It has the same vibe and lyrical content. This is killer with no filler. OWN IT!!!

B0000AFX64|5.0|Very good film.  wELL WRITTEN!  Great casting.  Jane Seymour looks as hot today in her late fifties as she did in her 20's.  Too bad ABC was so CHEAP and short-sighted to not realized that $1 million per episode in 1979 dollars was worth like $20 million+ per year in revenue in residuals in today's money.  MORONS like that are now probaly feeding us more mediocore comedis and reality tv.  Give me a classic like this any day.      Unless the reality show is live, real gladitorial combat to the death with some today's nitwit Celebrities like Ben \\"How you need this film to LOSE?\\" Affleck, Matt \\"I was BOURNE to BORE you with my Bond gone Rambo imitation!\\" Damon, Tom \\"I am nuttier than a fruitcake and 20 tin of mixed nuts!\\" Cruise, Brad \\"I got no talent but I am better than Tom Cruise!\\" Pitt, etc., and so on!   In betwee these matches could be condemned murders to the death until 20 CLEAN kills then they get a LIFE SENTENCE.  If not then wee strap them in and fire up \\"Old Sparky\\" and set it for EXTRA, EXTRA, EXTRA CRISPY!  :)

B000UD0ESA|4.0|The reputation of this film seems to precede the actual film itself. With that said, I bought this film having never really watched it before. I bought it based upon its critical acclaim and the talent involved. So after viewing this film for the very first time, I can't say I was absolutely blown away by it, but I will say that's a pretty good film. I enjoyed the basic plot of the film: The year is 2019, and a 21st Detective (Harrison Ford) is ordered to kill a small group of fugitive \\"replicants\\", or androids, that have come to Los Angeles. Of course, there is other sub-plots to the story, as well as a deeper meaning overall, but since this is such a popular movie, I wouldn't expect that there aren't as many under-privileged people out there as myself who would be reading or commenting about this film without knowing much about the story first! Anyway, I did enjoy the story to the film. Of course, the acting is good. With Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer, especially, putting on great performances. The sequences between these two during the last 20 minutes or so the film are wonderful. But what I loved most about the film was the setting and atmosphere. There are some really elaborate sets in this film. The lighting, and lack of lighting at times, really sets the mood and tempo of the film. And the gritty feel of the streets of futuristic Los Angeles is done really well. However, there were a few little things that I was expecting to be better with this film. From reading the back of the DVD, it made is sound this film was packed with action, when in fact, there just isn't many true action sequences in the film. There's one chase scene and of course the climatic ending, but that's about it as far as any lengthy action scenes. With that said, I feel there are certain slow spots in the film where it kinda dragged a bit. But other than that, this film is good. Its definitely worth purchasing at this price. Especially when this DVD comes with 3 different commentaries and a 3 and a half hour \\"Making Of\\" documentary. No, this isn't as in depth as the 5-disc collection. but if you're not a hardcore fan of the film, and just want a more affordable packaging to the film, this one is for you.a 3 and a half hour \\"Making Of\\" documentary.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I loved every second of this movie.  I have given it as a gift to 3 friends.  It is a terrific romance (even though they don't get together in the end...in the movie anyway).  Every track is amazing, including the title track which only makes it on the credits!  I saw them perform in San Francisco and the chemistry was just as amazing on stage.  Amazing to think that these two are not even actors.  Great film.
B000ZOW96Y|5.0|I don't have much to say in this review, but this is a great movie. It sounded great in the living room with the surround sound turned up. There's plenty of action in this film and I highly recommend it.
B0007ZEO4G|4.0|The recordings are nice and fresh compared to the original CD releases. Another incremental improvement. Shame there wasn't the huge jump in quality that was found on the Roger Glover remix of Machine Head. The beautiful three dimensional soundscape found on that remix should become a benchmark.<br />It's still worth replacing your old BURN though as the first release CD was pretty muddy sounding. This is a clear improvement..... I just wish they'd let Mr Glover have a go at it. (I know he didn't play on this album..... but his machine head remixes are a revelation)
0451196716|3.0|I've become a Stephen King reader late in life and perhaps that has increased my enjoyment of his works.  My earlier impression of Stephen King (based on hearsay only) was that they were full of horror and gore and would haunt my dreams.  Now I find they leave me contemplating life: my own and the world around me.  The Long Walk is written by Stephen King as Richard Bachman and is the only SK as RB book I've read so far.  SK devotes an eight-page introduction to Richard Bachman and after reading the book, I can see a distinctly different persona.  The Long Walk is a disturbing look at a future US society and one that I hope is never realized.  100 teenage boys begin the long walk in Maine.  Once they begin walking, they cannot stop or walk slower than 4mph. If they do, they receive a warning.  After three warnings, they are shot dead.  My thoughts as I read the book were why would anyone ever want to participate in such an event.  Either you win over 99 others, or you die.   As they walk, most of the boys gradually form groups and talk about their lives and reasons for participating in the walk.  Despite the horror one feels as to the inevitable outcome for the boys, it was heartwarming to see that many of them reached out to encourage and help each other.  The boys, who had everything to lose, seemed more humane than most of the spectators who lined the streets to watch them as they passed or watched the event on tv and placed bets on the outcome.
B000UJCALI|4.0|The image quality is a great improvement. Clear clean and bright. Also, the screen format is correct now as per theatre release. The only problem is that this is the longer edit version with many deleated scenes restored to the movie. I say &#34;problem&#34; because all the extra scenes were dropped for good reason. There is not one that adds to the story in any significant way. I was really interested to see the deleted scenes but they only serve to slow down the pace of the film and actually reduce the slow build of tension. (EDIT: Original theatrical cut available on Blu Ray now)<br /><br />This is a two disc set and the series of bonus features are well worth having. The director's daughter has created an excellent documentary throughout the filming process, which is a highlight of the bonus features.

B00000DGRX|5.0|I'm really happily surprised at the Roger Glover remixes on disc 2. The disc 1 remixes are nice and fresh sounding compared to older CD releases but the disc 2 remixes are really something special. With extended cold starts and finishes and a fantastic 3D sound, the Roger Glover remixes on disc 2 has become the definitive Machine Head disc for me. There is real depth to the sound and spaces between the instruments. It sounds as if it was recorded yesterday.<br />My question is: Why can't all new remixes be done this well?. I had no idea the technology existed to breath new life so effectively into old recordings.<br />Well worth replacing your old disc. I know it's painful having to re purchase products as technology changes...... but this is a big improvement.
B0000524CY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. I remember it when it was first released and still regard it highly as a brilliant piece of cinematic art. Even though I was glad to have the chance again to see it on the big screen, I wasn't all that thrilled with some of the additions. Even though I loved seeing the additional footage, I thought the subliminals and the added musical score took away from the uniqueness of the film. The ascetic way that Friedkin originally presented the film was one of the main reasons the film was so incredible and effective. The lack of musical score, and then when it was used, its esoteric nature, was one of the factors that gave the film it's disturbing nature. The film didn't need a musical score to inhance the effect of the film like so many other films. The absence of it left you alone, naked, and raw as you witness the horror that was taking place on the screen. It was like you were in the house with them. And the subliminals were cheap. Some reviewers of the original felt that the scene where Chris goes up to the attic and the candle flares up was cheap effect, unworthy of the film. I felt the subliminals were even worse. So unnecessary. I agree with Friedkin and feel the original film is just fine and I don't think that the ending leaves one with a negative feeling. Evil is evil and even though the exorcism was a success, there still is going to be residual from the events that had transpired. This film is an incredible piece of work and is one of the top 10 films ever made, regardless of what AFI may think. Bravo!

The storyline, the musical numbers,  the directing, the gloom of it all - it's all superb and it's all classic Tim Burton. Johnny Depp does an incredible job singing, but an even better job portraying the desperation and utter lost of his character. Despite all the objections, Helena Bohnham Carter is wonderful as Sweeney Todd's girlfriend. There are two duets between Alan Rickman and Johnny Depp, the first of which is breathtaking - here are two of the finest actors in cinema performing the weirdest possible roles and it works. Sasha Baron Cohen is probably miscast as the Italian barber, who is Todd's first victim, but that's not enough to make an impact on the movie. Sweeney Todd is a spectacle that, like all Burton/Depp collaborations, must be watched multiple times and will be enjoyed thoroughly on each occasion.
B00005JPFH|5.0|Excellent product. Superior sound and video quality. Delivered in right time as committed and perfect for any DVD collector. Cheers!!
B000W9DTG6|5.0|The pros:<br />Brilliant ensemble cast<br />Entertaining story lines that are enjoyable through multiple viewings<br /><br />The cons:<br />Lack of special features (Ocean's 12 disk special feature consists of...drumroll please...the TRAILER alone)<br />No real justification to buy box set unless you are just really really excited about owning, well, the box
B000S0GYRU|5.0|Man! THIS MOVIE SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME!!! I don't understand why people say that this movie is boring.<br /><br />The movie is easy to understand, is CREEPY, is dark, suspensful and BLOODY GORY!!!<br /><br />To be honest, the storyline is slow but is just like the storyline in The Exorcist (is slow but with horror from the beginnig to the end).<br /><br />adios.
B00004T1NA|5.0|First of all, before buying this product on here, be aware that porcupine tree is planning to re-release this album in 2008 and if you can afford to wait, i would suggest doing so just to save you 80 dollars or more.<br /><br />Anyway, the actual album features a lighter side of porcupine tree (campaired to new releases fear of a blank planet, deadwing, or in absentia) with many acoustic guitars and vocal harmonies. I believe the concept of the CD to be about growing up and relationships (I may be inacurate in thinking so) but either way its nostalgic to listen to this CD and think on past relationships.<br /><br />The title track \\"lightbulb sun\\" features some acoustic/distorted riffs and great songwriting. The track appears to be the character of the concept or Wilson reflecting on being sick as a child and \\"the noise from the street (the children playing)\\" makes him wish he was back on his feet. (9/10)<br /><br />\\"How is your life today\\" is not really one of my favorite tracks because its just kind of bizarre, however it does feature some impressive vocal harmonizing and a mesmorizing piano effect, overall the track just seems a little repetative. (6/10)<br /><br />\\"4 chords that made a million\\" is pretty similar to the track \\"the sound of muzak\\" from in absentia because it features the concept of soulless music of today. It is pretty much a typical rock song with some distorted guitar and some cool synth riffs. The main riff of the song has an effect that sounds kind of like a sitar. (8/10)<br /><br />\\"shesomeveon\\" is my favorite track of the album. It has a mesmorizing riff and some great harmonization on the chorus. Overall, the solo at the end is just crushing, it is so beautiful but sad at the same time. (10+/10)<br /><br />\\"Last chance to evacuate planet earth...\\" is a two part song, the first appears to be about a summer relationship as a child \\"we could climb a tree or two, and watch the sun go down...\\" overall the first part is beautiful because you can just kind of imagine the scene that Wilson is portraying. Part two has some parts of conversation from some cult about to have his followers have a mass suicide because they believe they must travel back to their own diamesion that is appart from earth. This part is quite chilling because this cult actually occured. (Part I 9/10 Part B 7/10)<br /><br />\\"All the rest will flow\\" is a pretty good track with some nice string movements but is overall not the best song on the album. (7/10)<br /><br />Next is \\"hatesong\\" which has some childish lyrics but i believe it was written to be that way. It has a pretty cool bassline and some neat wah effects on the guitar. Its a different song from prabably anything you have ever heard but its unique and one of my favorites. (10/10)<br /><br />Next is \\"where we would be\\" which is beautiful and has some pretty clean guitar effects. The solo at the end after wilson sings \\"strange how you never become the person you see when you're young\\" is just breathtaking because it makes you think about who you are today and its just kind of gripping. (9/10)<br /><br />\\"Russia on ice,\\" the longest song on the album is one of the best. It features some beautiful string movements in the first half and some powerful lyrics. It is about someone in a broken  relationship at a bar drinking themselves to death. And the person wishes the other would call and save them from the situation. The second half is preobably the heaviest thing on the album and features some kind of tribal sounding drums and even some funky guitar riffs. (10/10)<br /><br />Finally the album closes with \\"feel so low\\" which is again a depressing song but is also beautiful and a great way to end the CD. (8/10)<br /><br />Overall the music is breathtaking and shesmovedon can give me shivers sometimes when i listen to the solo by myself. It is a great CD but, again, all porcupine tree CDs are. Overall, reading this review gives no justice to the actual album. When I first heard it, I was a little bit indifferent to the sound of the record, but after repeated listens, I discovered it is a beautiful and well creafted work of art.ered it is a beautiful and well creafted work of art.
B00000255F|5.0|I  just had to replace another disc because the older one is about \\"Played out\\".  I just love this album and and always will. Thanks to the seller for the quick shipping.<br />thanks-cynthia H
B000065BPB|5.0|This headphone is good, but does not fit me. So I returned it. The amazon service is very good.
B000VLE3IS|4.0|Dont we all already own all of these songs?  This record is so totally pointless.  Has anyone else notice the huge amount of greatest hits that are surfacing from bands?  They are just re-releasing the same songs in a different order.  Obviously the record companies are in trouble because very little good music is being put out nowadays.  So what better way to line their pockets than release the same old s h it.  I still gave this set four stars because i am looking at the disc all by itself.  If you owned this and only this it's one great record.  But you, like me, probably already own all their stuff seperately.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|If you wanna have big stuff in your home... Buy this... Great Songs, a great compilation of a real real sound from Rock n roll era. Ledzep song book... from Good Times, Bad times to All My Love. Better than , Early and Latter Days... the box is amazing. Interesting review from the band and amazing design. The dvd brings the best from the DVD. Take a look inside Led, put the record on your car and GO!!! \\" In the days of my youth...\\"
B000SOQDNQ|3.0|I enjoyed the comedy of the book, but did not feel any strong attachments to any of the characters.  The book ended as I thought it probably would.
B000UNYK76|5.0|Excellent video-concert. Can u see the band in all angles of concerts and life. Beautiful colours, songs, Experiencie this film, more than a concert,is a collectible piece. 5 Stars to 5 musicians. ( and Boom too :) )
0446698326|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks, so when I asked for this book along with The Choice for Christmas I couldn't wait to read it. I love to read but books have to grab your attention & this book does that from the first few paragraphs. It's a book you will pick up & hate to put down everytime you have to stop. I read this book in two days I was addicted. The Characters were lovable yet realistic. You fall start to fall for John from the very start of the book. This is a love story that everyone will love! I wouldn't be suprised if this like many of Sparks' other books isn't turned into a Major Motion picture. If you loved The Notebook or a Walk to Rember this book is for you.
0399246665|5.0|This is a great collection of books.  It literally has a number of ways to use them and will grow with your child.
B00005JPNW|5.0|Nicole Kidman was a perfect smash!  The building and CGI in the first part of the movie were European and a world we wish was so beautiful like LORD OF THE RINGS graphics as they are making a 2 movie set now of the HOBBIT.  But for those of us that crave animals there is no other!!!!  They all have familiars that are animal that talk to them accompanied by EVERY HUMAN BEING ON THEIR WORLD by an animal and some change shape.  The little girl has to save the children and is quite commanding, as good or better than Harry Potter, it is one to buy and own definately!  LOVED IT and so do the TWIN NIECE AND NEPHEW who at 12 years of age loved it like Happy Potter or better.  IT WAS SUPERB!!!!!!  The polar bear fighters were a twist of originality, I look forward to the next secession in the series.  Everyone says the book is wonderful, even my college physics professor who read it all!!!!!
B000W4KT64|5.0|The movie is great. I loved Queen Latifah's performance and the songs she sang.[[ASIN:B000W4KT64 Hairspray (Full-Screen Edition)]]
6301174240|5.0|I watched this movie when I was about 5 years old. and to this day it still remains one of my favorite movies of all time.  I am a die hard Michael Jackson fan and anybody whom is in love with Micahel as much as I am needs to buy this movie. He is truely a great entertainer and a brilliant performer/actor. Very good story, GREAT MUSIC SEQUENCES, classic Michael Jackson at his greatest!I mean, what else could you ask for? He was the hero in this movie and is my hero in real life. Even with all the alligations surrounding him, you can't deny his emaculate influence to the music industry and the world. It has been a long time since I have seen this movie and I am so glad that I recieved the opportunity to buy a copy for myself. His legacy will continue no matter what....
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This has become my favorite CD.  The women have the most clear, delightful voices when singing alone, but there is magic when they are blended in harmony.  My 13 year old neice heard the CD in my car and fell in love with it as well.  This copy was a Christmas present that was quickly put on her ipod.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|Excellent exposé of the origins of western civilization. The series is so well researched and portraited that it is unbelivable. In 2,000 years we have not changed a bit. The same day to day hostilities that the romans had, we still have. The Roman Gladiators of today are the WWF, UFC and Boxing fights. We may not have slaves but big corporations have enslave us. So where is the difference?
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Music is so subjective and no one singer is going to be liked by everyone. I am thrilled that I found Amy. Not boring, not loud, not soft, always interesting. Reminds me a little of Etta James only with some now-and-happening stuff going on with a touch of rap, calipso and a dash of surprise!!  Love her and wish her the best in getting control of her life and the chemicals!!
0374280967|5.0|I loved this book.  It makes you realize all the benefits that a love of reading brings to your life.  I wonder if the Queen herself has read it and what she thinks of it.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Very happy with the price-I could not find cheaper anywhere. I bought both season 1 and 2 so I got free shipping too! Yeah!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|When I saw the promos for this movie, I decided not to bother seeing it in the theater. It looked like the effects would play best on the big screen, but I had this one pegged as what I call a \\"fantasy art\\" films. You know, the ones that rely too much on effects to bother having a good story, or the ones that are so clever, the audience never does figure out what the story's all about. Well, I saw the DVD, and I had this one pegged wrongly. The story was well-written, clever, and engaging. It had its twists, but it would only confuse those who would find any fantasy story confusing. Of course, the effects were good, too, and they probably would have played even better on the big screen. This one was a pleasant surprise. I doubt it is everyone's cup-of-tea, but it worked for me.
0525950079|5.0|My field is History--specifically English Medieval History of the Fourteenth Century. I found this book to be extremely enjoyable. It's a great story designed to touch on many aspects of life in the Middle Ages and relate that to the characters.<br />It's a long book but I wound up hoping it would never end. It's easy to understand the difficulties of the individual characters and see how that corresponds to problems each of us encounter in present day society.<br />I will recommend this book to my students.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Talk about a mind-bending experience!  Try watching Stardust one night, and Pan's Labyrinth the next.  The contrast between these two fantasy-reality movies will throw you for a loop.<br /><br />Where Pan's Labyrinth is the atypical fantasy production, Stardust is fantasy gone wild, with witches seeking immortality through the consumption of a star's heart, and that shooting star just not too enthralled with that option.<br /><br />A young man finds that he was born of a mother living in a fantasy world closed to outsiders.  He doesn't know that his mother is a princess, and this puts him in the middle of a war of succession as the old king dies.<br /><br />How wild does this get?  Picture Robert De Niro in a tutu.<br /><br />Yah.<br /><br />You will feel good at the conclusion of this film.  I'm told that Neil Gaiman's book Stardust is different, but that it is also wonderful.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|In all fairness, I may well decide to purchase the movie in addition.  I'm not particularly a big fan of musicals or soundtracks, but \\"Once's\\" music was so organic to the plot of the film that it literally became another character--a brain child of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, as it were.     \\"Falling SlowlY\\" has received a lot of airplay, at least on my favorite station--KGSR in Austin, TX.  The blend of Hansard's and Irglova's voices is particularly gorgeous on this song.     \\"The Hill\\" will break your heart.      Then there's \\"Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy\\" which may rival Peter Piper as a tongue twister.  I can hear that one sung in an Irish bar, for sure.      Honestly, every track has its own merits and is well worth listening to.  I doubt if I can see the movie once--and I'm certain many of these tracks will become frequent repeats.
B00076RT24|5.0|good movie lots of action and tells the story of the beginning of the whole star wars saga.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|It's a hard knocks life playing music on the sordid streets of Dublin, Ireland. \\"Once\\" opens with clear proof of that as our protagonist, Guy (Glen Hansard from the \\"Commitments\\"), has to chase down a thief who's stolen his guitar case full of tips.     But not all of Guy's encounters are so negative.  By chance, he encounters 'Girl', a Czech immigrant who turns out to be a talented pianist.     They form a friendship.  Then they begin to perform together, which blossoms into a band and a CD. This is definitely not a romance. Guy's still trying to resolve an old relationship with a girl who left him and Girl's married with a daughter til near the end of the film.     What \\"Once\\" is is honest dialog between two people about their dreams, their lives.      All this and the music is wonderful as well.  It's a folky-bluesy theme written by the two co-stars.  What's interesting is that the music, like a character in itself, evolves through the film.     \\"Falling\\" has received a great deal of radio play, particularly on my favorite Austin-based radio station.  The song that made me laugh was \\"Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy\\".  Now, that is an original title and very much real life.  I'm adding the soundtrack to my wish list and if the spouse likes the film, I may well end up purchasing the DVD as well.    Warnings:    To me, both Guy and Girl are fairly easy to understand, but if you have trouble with accents, you may want to turn on closed captioning  The \\"R\\" rating must be based mostly on language. If you have a serious problem with the f-bomb, you may want to skip this film; however, it really doesn't sound so harsh with an Irish brogue.
B000002H97|5.0|One of their best albums.  Metallica was the best selling rock band in the 90s, and this album is one of the reasons why.  Enter Sandman is my favorite song on this album as well.
0385507755|4.0|I found this to be the most real book I've ever read.  You feel his pain as you read this book.  Not for those with a weak stomach!
B000LX5V0A|5.0|Two track UK single features 1. The Buddha Of Suburbia (4:24) and 2. Dead Against It (5:48). The holographic CD looks great and rocks like a mother, too!
0553213105|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Didn't think it would be an easy read, but it's so easy to get into!!!  I love it!!
6304698690|5.0|Classic story, unreal cinematography, all in all fantastic film.<br /><br />The DVD itself doesn't really have any extras or interesting things because it's a film from '93. If I remember correctly, there are some theatrical trailers.<br /><br />I bought this DVD because I wanted this movie in DVD quality. Let me tell you, there's a difference. My VHS was pretty dull and the quality was not great (probably from being played so many times!). The DVD is much more vivid and smooth, and for this fantastic film, that is a bonus.<br /><br />The directing and cinematography in this movie are beyond fantastic. This movie is purely a work of art. The locations that they shot this movie in are stunning. They leave you breathless and asking yourself where these places are so that you can visit them! I really feel like the locations(as well as the music) are what make this movie great. The great big house, the beautiful gardens, the isolated moor, they all really take you there. It makes it feel real and authentic.<br /><br />Acting is fantastic too. Young Kate Maberly carries this movie from beginning to end with the help of her younger counterparts and veteran adult actors.<br /><br />The music is incredible as well. I would recommend the soundtrack. This movie wouldn't be half of what it is without the haunting music that was created as a background for it. Beautiful.<br /><br />Gorgeous film, one of my childhood favorites. See it on DVD, it's worth it!
B000F9RB8A|5.0|i watched this on a ps3 with hdmi cables running to a samsung 32\\" lcd tv. the picture quality would be an 8/10, and the sound a 9/10. which is not bad considering this movie is a few years old. overall, a very good blu-ray title!
B000031EGV|5.0|I've always enjoyed fantasy movies, especially those that involve some type of self-redemption or a chance to live something over and correct past mistakes.  While not everyone sees Jumanji in this light, it is just one of the many aspects of the movie that prompted me to buy it.  I like Robin Williams because he is not so \\"over the top\\" like he usually is.  Kirsten Dunst is one of my favorite actresses and this was the first time I had seen her.  And I love the relationship between the young Alan and his father.  All in all, great escapist fun!
B000VNMMR0|4.0|The movie has been reviewed a few hundred times, so my review is strictly about the DVD.  This version includes both the Theatrical version and the Unrated version.  The unrated is much more in-tune with the original three movies (Yippie Ki Yay ..!) and there are quite a few extended scenes.  Surprisingly, the unrated version isn't just additional dialogue - some of it is changed or replaced totally.  Most of them are worthwhile, but a few instances are funnier in the theatrical version.  It's worth watching both just to see the differences.  My main complaint is that this DVD has virtually NO special features.  I guess they really want you to buy the 2-Disc Special Edition.  The only \\"extra\\" on this disc is an option for a running commentary by Willis and the director, but I turned that off after five minutes.  Other than that, there's absolutely nothing.  So if all you want are the two movie versions, this is the DVD for you.  If you're looking for behind-the-scenes, actor interviews, deleted scenes, gag reels, etc, then buy the Special Edition.  Otherwise, great sound quality, widescreen is preferrable and of course, the movie is fantastic.  Enjoy!
B000N6TX1I|4.0|got to me on time, undamaged.  all i needed, as it was a gift.<br /><br />also, it happens to be a great film, heartbreaking and beautiful cinematic experience.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I ordered this DVD as a Christmas present for my niece.  It was delivered promptly and she was very excited to receive the gift.   She reports that it is one of the best movies to come out in some time.
