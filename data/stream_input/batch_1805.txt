B008OOYALE|5.0|starts slow..then quickly picks up speed..the challenges give you money and gold bars...enough that you arent without....add neighbors so they can help you out
0345803507|1.0|I feel the author was in a rush to get out the book. Crappy story line. Not that the first two were any better, if you want good erotica try Anne Rice writing under Anne RAmpling, now thats some good erotica!!!
630463949X|5.0|This dvd concert has all my favoite songs on it! Love it and we play it offen! I am sooooo very very happy to own this concert....everyone of my family and friends, who have watched it with me say they LOVE it.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|Mahjong Delude HD<br />really nice puzzles and the different challenges are nice.  Its nice to be able to challange yourself to try and get better times.
B009DZDJU6|4.0|After reading the  book and watching the movie, the book is better.  Most scenes are very dark and difficult to see.  Overall Read the book first then watch the movie and it will all come together.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I bought this first season because I loved the book so much.  But the series does not really do the book any justice the story is not the same and characters are a  lot different.  But I will probably watch the rest of the other seasons.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mahjong is always a great game to play.  Challenge with time restraints is great also.  Very addictive and cannot stop a game after you start.  Recommend to everyone.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|watched all 7 seasons in the past month and a half never a bad episode love them all, now on season 8
B0060DYMT6|5.0|I would recommed this movie to anyone.  Intriging and a interesting movie.  It keeps you spell bound and cannot take your eyes off scenes..
B004SIP7VM|5.0|this is one of the best movies i have seen , it has all the right elements and surprise in the end.
B000I0QL82|5.0|This is our favorite Christmas movie.  It's not Christmas until we watch this.  It reminds us of good old fashioned fun!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie actually lived up to the hype. It is so well done that my wife said to me after the movie, &#34;If you don't buy the dvd when it comes out, I will&#34;. Any movie that gets that much of a reaction from my wife gets high marks indeed. As an avid comic collector, I have to say, the movie keeps you so occupied that it does manage to provide a few well timed surprises. One in particular which I won't get into, that I feel was very well well done. I would recommend this movie highly.
0345529057|5.0|It has been a long time since I read a fantasy series and this George RR Martin did NOT disappoint! I am eagerly waiting for the series on HBO in March. I will be finished with Dances With Dragons very soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version has all the features I want - undo, draw 1 &amp; 3, auto-complete, etc. Best of all, it's free! Love it!
B00000JSJC|5.0|If you love strange flicks with high tech then you ll love this one about a relacement for wearing a wire for a sting operation only gone black market.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|The daily legos are really cool this year.  We are enjoying this product very much.  It is fun for all.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Waited for this one for what seems like a couple months seen it the theater thought it was great nice time travel flick about agent J going back in time to the 1960s to save his mentor agent K i like it alot.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|every time he come to my house he has to play it and he always wins. he plays it for hours.
B000063DGC|5.0|Wow what a show man Ozzy is probably one of the only show men in the rock industry who has the ability to get a crowd going and get them on their feet. This particular album is ozzys tribute his late performer and guitatarist Randy Rhodes and its really great. I highly reccomend this album to any Ozzy fan.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|For simple interviews, this does the trick.  Just plug the long cord into your mic input of your video camera or DSLR.  The only thing that you should know is there is no indicator if it's on so forgetting to turn it on will be an issue.  You will also have to guess at your battery life.
B00177YA1K|5.0|Another great flick for those of us SCI-FI fans about a giant interstellar cochroach who comes to conquer earth for himself and his giant family and the Men in Black get to save our world. Iike it alot.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|I was curious when I saw an add about this new TV show. I just love mysterious fiction stuff. It is out of our world.<br /><br />Nearly all childhood stories getting together in a full lively TV Show version. Sounds strange, but they did a real good job. Lana Parrilla is doing a great job as the evil queen. Though she is even I love her character.<br />The daughter of Snow White has to fight the Evil Queen. She just dont know that she is the daughter of Snow White as she was brought to our real life as a baby.<br /><br />Cant wait to see Season 2.<br />If you love stuff like that, go and watch it. I do not think you will disappointed.<br /><br />Addition: The menu of the blu ray is annoying. You cannot watch all episodes one after the other without returning to the menu. You have to click on what cd you are watching CD1 or CD2 etc and then click on one episode. After you watched it, you have to go to the menu and click on the next episode. That is totally annoying and not logical.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Music from another demension it certainly lives up to its title this album is a real departure from what i was ever used to i feel like i grew up with this band and went through a lot of the same s*** they did but music from another demension is really different but this one has to grow on one. For what its worth i always have their back.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game the first time I played it I was amazed. I have the kinga version and you cant run or walk around in that one I love the graphics
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Enjoyed the spiritual aspect as much as the action. The author made the journey amazing believable.  This is a book I will read again.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I don't even like racing & I love this movie. I have seen it twice now & I loved it more the second time around. I watched it with my 15 month old grandson this time & he was \\"hooked\\"! Go Mater!
B00009ZYBY|5.0|This was a a good telling of an old story and the visuals are wonderful. I believe this was one of the first movies where computer or CG generation was used on a wide scale. At least the way I recall it. Anyway it is well done.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have no problems with it . i like it and you should like it too. I have no reverts with my purchase.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|Tried this to see whether it would provide more value vs. the standard email client in Kindle Fire HD.  If the Kindle Fire HD had not come with an email client, this would have been useful, but you just don't need this app on that device.  So, it may be useful on other non-Amazon android-based devices.
B006LSZECO|5.0|wonderful mystery, full of lots of twists and turns.  I would recomend this book to all my friends, in fact I did just that!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book was so fascinating on many levels.  First, the description of Lincoln himself.  He can only be called a higher soul.  The detailed inclusion of his cabinet, staff, & generals.  Finally, the style of writing.  I could not put it down a s it read like a novel for which I did not have a clue what was going to happen.
B0056BMK6K|2.0|First of all, his book is an entertaining read.  I zipped through it in no time.  The book totally kept me interested and turning the pages.  That said, this book was supposed to help me figure out how to market my books better.  It didn't at all.  I don't think that the things Mr. Locke shares in this book are really the things that helped him sell so many books.  It may be that he himself doesn't know exactly what he did that worked to sell so much or maybe he's just keeping the best ideas to himself :P
B004D9FLJE|5.0|It has good ratings. I love the sons they sing in glee.<br />I would recommend to friends and other friends.<br />I would think that they would love it and its the best DVD.<br />Sorry for the funny languages in the video.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|&#34;Excellent insight behind the scenes. &#34; Well written, but indeed due to the declination of all relations a long reading. I preferred to read from chapter to chapter, not from start to end.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I love how the characters try out for Nyada.<br />I love how Rachel sings her soul out.<br />I would consider to my friends about it.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Perhaps not as hilarious as the first two, but quite enjoyable!  The streaming video was flawless.  We really like being able to start the movies anytime and pause and resume.
B0039NK0LE|5.0|I would totally recommand it to my friends..<br /><br />Funny, and crazy :)<br />If you liked the other ones, you will love it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is amazing and very addictive but you should add a new stage for all the dragons like an ancient stage
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Before I get into the book, i must state that I am disgusted with Tom Cruise playing Reacher in &#34;One Shot&#34;. Cruise is no Reacher and 99.5% of bloggers say the same, justifiably so!  Back to the book, I found  it a decent read. I thought the plot was fine and moved along at a decent pace. The good news is that while reading the book I never ever had Cruise in the back of my mind as Reacher so it is good that Child's plot keeps the &#34;Real&#34;  Reacher clearly in focus and not the awful image of &#34;mini-Reacher&#34; Cruise! Characters were pretty good although there is, what I consider, one nasty little bit of retribution from Child towards a fellow author, David Baldacci! WARNING, this bit contains a mini- spoiler! Baldacci has a new character in his last couple of books called John Puller who is essentially a Reacher clone, not nice! In &#34;A Wanted Man&#34; about half through the book there's a &#34;Deputy Puller&#34; in a small town who Child totally degrades as a despicable, half-witted cop. I believe this is a open, nasty pay-back dig at Baldacci and unbecomming of any author. For that I reduced a potential 4 star rating to 3 stars.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Movie was sent swiftly and plays perfectly. Words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, and words.<br />Thanks!

B008ASLK8A|5.0|if you saw the first one, you already know how crazy Sherlock is.  The fight scenes are incredibly imprbable and this time they don't all happen the way Sherlocks expectations.  There are many close calls, as you would expect.  It is cleverly done, lots of action, and several scenes/moments made me laugh out loud.  I was sitting in a repair shop lounge waiting for me car, I was able to completely lock out all the noise around.  it kept me occupied, entertained and helped the time go by.  I really have enjoyed it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The price is right and the games get steadily more challenging.<br />Take your time and get lots of start ... the price is right!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|this sequel turned out better than the first! It had more stars(old ones) than the first and a lot of funny (a little corny) one liners! the story was good and plenty of action! well worth watching!
B003O86FMW|4.0|i got this book electronically for my kindle app on my iphone and i had to read it for my summer reading book for school and i am a boy so i was kindof discouraged. I read the first chapter and couldnt stop reading!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I realy didn't think this movie would live up to hype, but it did! It gets better each time I watch it. Great job Josh!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's a really fun game, I highly recommend it. I play it all the time, it never ever gets old.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I had never read Sherlock Holmes before and this is a great collection of a few of the tales/adventures. I found them to be interested and fun to read, and because of this I purchased the complete adventures/stories for kindle (it is a dollar or two and has so much more content).
B009HELT3C|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed the movie.  I thought Josh Brolin was PERFECT as a young Tommy Lee Jones.  He had his voice and facial features down pat :)  The movie was VERY entertaining and I would recommend it to everyone.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I really liked this movie as did my kids. I think all these Dr. Seuss movies and books too are great.
B008DYZKQE|3.0|Pretty pricey for a short children's book.  My grandson (2.5 yrs.) usually asks for books to be read over and over.  We have only read this one once.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|Of course I love this movie since Channing is in it, but I also love it because this is how him and his beautiful wife met. Their chemistry is noticeable onscreen. Very cute couple.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book reminds you to enjoy every moment and that it is not the responsibility of humans to control time.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|All these kiddie apps are pretty decent for my young kids to help hold their attentions for a bit so I can get some stuff done around the  house :)
0300169787|5.0|Simply amazing as a retrospective and catalog of the artist's work. Beautifully photographed. Packaged and bound in a simple and elegant manner. Will turn the uninitiated into fans and the fan into a superfan.

B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I love this show. It is like a cross breed between Friends and Big Bang. Always funny, always a nice pick me up moment in each episode. If you haven't watched it yet then you are missing out!<br />Digital download lets me take it anywhere and it's great to watch on plane (although people may stare at you when you are laughing to yourself)<br /><br />You won't be disappointed!<br /><br />I buy over 400 items a year from Amazon and always give an honest review in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision.<br />This product rates 5 stars for use-ability, construction and price.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Its ok....I mean we all know what its a spinoff of, and when my kids play it they seem to like it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book. It ain't like no happy ending book or pretty princess crap. Can't wait for when they turn this one in to a movie.

0937381888|5.0|I wanted to start brewing my own beer and numerous friends told me this was the first thing I should get.  They were right.  All the fundamentals are contained in this book and presented in a clear, concise way.  It even touches on some advanced techniques and recipes towards the end.  If you're thinking about brewing beer, start here.
B0057ZEMF2|3.0|Anoushka Shankar is a fabulous musician. It's in her DNA; it's her birthright! And in theory, assembling a stellar group of virtuoso musicians to explore the commonalities and differences between classical Indian music and Spanish flamenco ought to have been a jaw-dropping project. From what can be gleaned from press releases, \\"Traveler\\" was conceived as a studio project put in place by the label to jointly showcase the talents of Grammy winning producer Javier Limón and his new label mate, Anoushka Shankar. Indeed a great deal was made of the fact that THIS was Anoushka's \\"Deutsche Grammophon debut\\" despite the fact that she already had a distinguished discography, including an amazingly colorful collaborative project with Karsh Kale. Well, at least she got second billing...<br /><br />While much was made of the album's daring fusions, something sounds a little \\"off\\" to my ears: the nasal twang of the sitar really DOESN'T blend with the percussive staccato of a flamenco guitar; the characteristic vocal ornaments of flamenco singing don't really mesh with their Indian counterparts. But then again, perhaps I was spoiled, growing up listening to the stylistic virtuosity of sitar genius Colin Walcott.<br /><br />It's difficult to lay blame with the musicians for this shortfall - Shubha Mudgal, Tanmoy Bose, Pepe Habichuela, Pedro Ricardo Miño, Sandra Carrasco, Duquende and of course the two headliners, Shankar and Limón are masters of their craft. No, the problem lay with a concept pushed to hard too really cohere: there is no question that the Romani originated in the Indian subcontinent, but through their travels they developed a polyglot style that absorbed an incredible range of influences, including Balkan, eastern European, Turkish, etc. to the extent that clear Indian inflections were completely over-painted.<br /><br />\\"Traveler\\" is a good album from some great artists, but instead of being a mouthwatering, musical masala, what we have is more like a tray ofpretty canapés being served at an ethnic-themed cocktail party.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I have loved all the STEP UP movies, and all are very good, i don't get tired watching.. please watch it.!!
B002APU580|5.0|My daughter really enjoyed this movie and requested it for Christmas. She also liked the TV series of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love this app so much! it has great tools, a varity of stickers, and tons of colors definitely worth the money.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a great way to keep my mind engaged when commercials come on :-) So far I think the levels are very challenging.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I read all of these books  and this one was the best of all of them.I love these books.<3  I love diary of a wimpy kid
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I have two of these 4100 right now. Rock solid performance, with absolutely no issues at all. I would recommend that you replace the stock fan and paste with some Arctic Silver and a much more robust fan, as the one in the box isn't sufficient to keep this processor cool enough when playing games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the BEST app ever!!! better than &quot;angry birds&quot; even! it's a lot of fun. its multiplayer even! &quot;Minecraft&quot; is on of my favorite games of all time. and believe me, its different than the Pc version. highly recommended. :)
B009P13RQY|5.0|The Sword has done it again. Excellent album by an excellent band. It has been interesting to see how the ban has subtly changed it's sound from album to album but still remained recognizable as The Sword. Apocryphon is not as crunchy as Wolves of Winter, but it does have a bit more heft to it than Warp Rider. You will not be disappointed with this album!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An amazing story by an amazing story teller!  Can't wait to see the movie. This is a book that could be read over and over. The first few chapters made more sense after reading them when I was finished with the book.  This story is  unbelievable, yet believable all at the same time. I would recommend to any age group. A really enjoyable read
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I just got it yesterday and love it. very clear and easy to work with. you can have as many alarms as u want. actually works. to were other alarms don't actually wake you up
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I love all these characters and actors.  They keep me interested and laughing with a bit of scariness to them.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|its awsome I like how Barry steels the jetpack and the scientist. star freicking out. and how you can get so many things
034580404X|5.0|I've read it three times already.  I loaned out my previous books and they are making their way through a family.  I purchased it again for my library.  I will read them again after I finish the other series by a different author.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This  is a really fun book. I would read it again. I think you should read it. You don't have to read the past dairy of a wimpy kid because it gives you information about the past dairy of a wimpy kid books. I recommend this for everyone who knows how to read.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I am happy that it left a lot of scenes to the imagination.  I just wish the ending had been extended a little longer.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I received my Kindle Fire HD 4G LTE on November 26, 2012 and just love it. It is amazing, especially with the 4G LTE and GPS Features. I was working on my Google calendar and after input, I checked my Calengoo App on my Kindle Fire and everything was there, and surprise, surprise, the map that appears at the Where box (for the event) shows up, along with a voice navigation selection. And the lady's voice is very nice too. You can be in your car and have your Kindle Fire beside you and she will talk you through the directions. See Cynthia Marr's book [[ASIN:B006JH3VXG Using Amazon Cloud, Kindle Fire's Gallery & Google Calendar With WiFi Connection Only]] for more information in using your Google Calendar with the Calengoo app.<br /><br />Previously with the Calengoo app, my legacy Kindle Fire had all the same features of syncing with my Google calendar; however, there is no voice navigation selection. A map is provided for the Where (location of the event) which has always been pretty neat.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I love watching this movie every year before Christmas; it's a classic! I bought this for our new blue ray player this year, now I can get rid of my VHS copy.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|I was skeptical when I first started watching this movie. Especially after looking at the cover. After all, how many end-of-the-world movies can a person watch? But this one is different. Stay with it until the end. And once you discover the title of the book everyone seems to want, also view the final few minutes to see the dedication displayed by the hero. I loved it!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is highly addictive. I play it every chance I get. The children in my family feel the same and my kindle fire battery is always dying because of it. Definatly worth playing.
B000BNI99K|5.0|I first heard it in a shop. Afterwards I bought one of the set at QXL used.  Now I saw that it is gathered in a complete box - so I just bought it.<br />Love to listen all the CD's and relax. Know all the melodies for various artists, but I find that Rod Stewart has added a just new  variation that I just love.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I am addicted!! Can't seem to put it down at night. The babies are so cute and i love freeing them from their bubbles. If you like puzzles you will definitely like the game.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Wes Anderson creates a world of surprises and mostly satisfying performances, a movie with no greater message than humanity is a fascinating subject, regardless of time and place.  Bruce Willis and Edward Norton are in their parts and all's right with the film.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|i watched it for free on youtube first and decided it was EXTREMELY worth it to invest in the DVD in hopes of them taking the hint to make a sequel to see what happens next - THANK GOD THEY&#34;RE MAKING ONE IN 2013 :D
1616614609|3.0|We bought this game because we no longer had time to get together with our board game group of five. Since this was a two player game it seemed ideal. I am also a big fan of Neuromancer, the book and the old Apple 2e game. However this game is time intensive. Reading the instruction manual is lengthy, you have to skip around in the book for rules clarification a lot. There are far to many pieces to punch out and organize. Id reccommend using life couters or dice if you have little ones with sticky fingers. Also the play area is large. We used up less space playing 4 man Settlers of Catan. If you have the time , you might enjoy it. We didnt and it was only vaugely similar to the Neuromancer title. We are storing it away for when we retire so I might update this review in 30 years.
B008EQHP4G|4.0|movie could have had longer music sections and possibly explained a bit better the man who wanted 'silent noise' - but otherwise it's okay
B0099114WO|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure how to take this movie.  From the previews that I saw, I thought it was a comedy.  When I realized that it was more of a \\"dramedy\\", I felt like I was on a rollercoaster of not being sure that I should laugh, scowl or cry.  But don't let my impressions hinder you - I highly recommend this movie and see it more than once.  It is so touching, poignant, painful and funny that it should be shoe-in Oscar nominations for Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep both. You will feel your heart move.  (And Steve Carrel should be nominated for best supporting actor, he's absolutely excellent as the therapist.)<br /><br />Overall, the movie took me back to the time in my life when I was 16 and my parents separated for the very reason that Meryl begins questioning her own marriage: Married too young, kids too soon, then wondering \\"what the hell\\" when the kids were gone and she's found looking back at her life and trying to find meaning.  The movie was an incredibly accurate journey of what I can now see what my parents must have gone through, the pain, angst, love and loyalty that gets all jumbled up then one person \\"upsets the apple cart.\\"  I'm pleased to also share that when Dad passed away last year, Mom and Dad had just celebrated their 57th wedding anniversary.<br /><br />Definitely a must see.
0670023329|1.0|Shin Dong-hyuk claims he escaped from a heavily guarded camp for North Korean political prisoners.  He was  able to break into a nearby house and steal an army uniform, then later steal food and more clothing from unattended houses.  He makes his way to China by getting help from homeless North Koreans who comprise a subculture in the small villages and towns of North Korea.  But where were the blood hounds chasing him, the security checks by police to find a wanted escapee?  Maybe this story is true, but certain details like being taken below ground in an elevator to be tortured because his mother planned to escape from the camp sounds more like a B grade movie than the realities of North Korea.  An elevator descending underground at a rural camp in this poor country, really?<br /><br />His story reminds me of the book The Long Walk which was made into the 2010 movie The Way Back with Colin Farrell.  A polish man, Slavomir Rawicz,  claimed he was sent to a Siberian Gulag by the Russians in 1941, escaped and walked with fellow prisoners all the way to India.  Hard to believe and later proved to be completely fabricated.  Why?  For attention of course.  A refugee makes his story sound really good, somebody suggests he write a book, the story gets even better and there you are.  I do believe North Korea is a hell hole, and hope that dictatorship falls.  But this book does not seem believable to me.  Shin seems like a scam artist who is capitalizing on his fame.  I'm sure he escaped from North Korea to China, but I am not sure about his prison escape story.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is endlessly challenging and fun.  It's amazing the amount of thought and imagination that went into this game, and it never seems to get boring!
B009LREA1S|5.0|First of all, the movie is 4 stars - good but not great. But just remember how difficult it is to pull of trilogies. The only one that comes to mind as a blow-out success is Star Wars. Great ones may also include the Bourne trilogy. These are two very off the cuff anecdotes, so please don't blast me. Christopher Nolan's trilogy is more akin to The Godfather trilogy in the weighted impact of popularity among fans. Yet we do not remember The Godfather, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for The Godfather III, nor will we remember Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy for The Dark Knight Rises.<br /><br />On to UV vs AIV. For all of you who believe iTunes is the end-all for digital ecosystems, keep this I'm mind: all they care about is getting you to trade up to the latest device. You cannot port your music and videos to a device other than an Apple device. Sure, you can download iTunes to your PC and buy media there, but good luck viewing that on a Kindle Fire or a Samsung Galaxy Note. Amazon is more interested in selling you the actual music and video. They are agnostic to which device you consume the content on. In fact Amazon would likely rather you be an avid consumer of its video and music content on an iPad than a Kindle Fire because then it doesn't have to subsidize your purchase of the device. The bottom line is that Amazon is much more aligned with the consumer's interests than Apple is, so all of you demanding iTunes versions of this and other movies should actually be advocating for Amazon Instant Video versions instead.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has lots of levels, which get progressively more challenging.  It really makes you think, and it's lots of fun.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is pretty easy to operate on my Kindle. There don't seem to be enough options for the deals.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|This game is very frustrating, because there's no place to find any instructions.  It's very difficult to manuever the &#34;Profit Bird, and some of the other characters.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|This is a Great Collection.  I had some some of the stories on CD but now I have so many in my Kindle Fire.  To Have this many stories on CD there would be a lot of CDs to lug around.  The stores are really good.  I'm happy I have them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Definitely one of the best books I have ever read. It kept me on my toes and the pages turning. I totally recommend it.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I can strongly recommend this album.  My wife and I have followed the singing career of Susan Boyle ever since we discovered her through that odds-defying competition when she sang \\"I Have a Dream\\"  that became the famous U-Tube video. The voice has a unique qiuality and tone, the words come across with feeling and clarity.  All of that natual talent only enhances her life story, the years of obscurity, taking care of her mother, singing in her church choir and in club talent shows.  Then, suddenly, in one incredible moment, that was all reversed and justice was served.  In this set of songs, she displays the same vocal talent with a new overlay of sophistication and well-rehearsed performance.  But always the voice, that unique and haunting voice from when she was first discovered.
0345457692|5.0|It has been extremely difficult to put this book down.  In fact, why am I on here writing a review?  I should be reading Altered Carbon.  The answer to that question is that I have been trying to pace myself and not rush through it.  It is right up there with a masterpiece by Timothy Zahn or Matthew Stover.  I am in love with Morgan's style and you will be too.
B009HELT3C|3.0|I'll keep this short and sweet for those who are about to push the &#34;Buy&#34; button.<br /><br />I was REALLY excited to watch this movie after I heard that it &#34;might be better than #1&#34; and &#34;redeemed MIB2&#34;. One of those two statements is correct.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It's a great family movie.<br />Ties the MIB trilogy together wonderfully<br />Adds a nice amount of depth to the characters that was lacking in the previous two movies.<br />Made me feel good when it was over.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The aliens are uninventive and really take a backseat to the rest of the movie.<br />Not impressed by &#34;villain&#34;<br />The CGI is 7/10<br />A new vehicle is introduced, for about 3 minutes of the movie<br />Severely lacks the comedy of MIB1.<br /><br />Summary: Fans who adore the first movie will be disappointed if they too have heard claims of it being the best of the MIB series. It's a great addition to the series but it honestly could have been more.<br /><br />Final Verdict: You'll watch it once, but that one time view is worth it for MIB fans.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|I remember the TV series, and didn't know what to expect from this movie. It was funny in many ways, but also sad in the amount of innocent bloodshed (but then he is a vampire... right?). I think this one is worth watching.
0525478817|5.0|I can't even begin to explain how just a few short hours ago, I was a different person. I was completely engrossed in this book from the moment I began reading, I literally could not put it down.<br />The story is sad, that's a given just by reading the other reviews. But the story is a complete paradigm shifter, it has changed the way I view my own unremarkable existence.<br />Green's writing is beautiful and well crafted. This book reaches a depth of emotion most authors can only aspire to.<br />Well done Mr. Green, well done.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was all I expected and a little more. The trailers were misleading (big surprise there) but the humor and humanitarianism of the show was outstanding. Will be watching this one repeatedly.

B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|If you liked Ender's Game, you may really enjoy this military training action film.<br /><br />I went into this movie with low expectations, however, I was blown away. The film relies more on characterization and story than special effects and videogame-related action. I found myself caring about the characters and really enjoyed the payoff at the end. Give the film ten minutes - the first scenes were confusing and, if you now little about the Halo universe, downright confusing. However, once the film steadies in on the training school, the story starts to take off. It asks interesting questions and piles difficulty after difficulty on the protagonist to the place where I was almost sure he was going to make a decision that would take him well away from the military action suggested by the backstory.<br /><br />And then all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />The production values were on the indie side but very effective. This story was a rare find, surprisingly good, a very welcome surprise, and possibly the best videogame-related movie I've seen.

ESPECIALLY IF YOU WATCH ALIEN BEFORE OR AFTER SEEING THIS, THE FIRST HALF HOUR IS EXACTLY THE SAME DESIGNS AND EVERYTHING. I KNOW THE DIRECTOR SCOTT SAID NO TO BEING A PREQUEL, BUT U CANNOT WATCH THIS MOVIE AND TELL ME IT IS NOT A PREQUEL. IT IS A GREAT MOVIE AND I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT. I HAVE WATCHED IT NUMEROUS TIMES SINCE BUYING IT AND IT PULLS ME IN EVERYTIME. THIS IS A MUST OWN JUST LIKE THE ALIEN FRANCHISE. CANT WAIT FOR PART 2.
B0037VIBGY|4.0|There is no doubt Tom Hardy is one of the best character actors in the world today, he's performance in Bronson is impeccable. The movie itself starts strong, but looses charisma as the story goes along.

B004GVUPFE|3.0|Games like this are a dime a dozen, so for me the importance is in the details. I can find tons of sliding block games, but what has the best options and interface and has gone the extra mile to make it a stellar game? Unfortunately this game just doesn't really do that for me.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />-Simple: I like that the blocks are actually blocks, not cars or any other objects. Keeping it simple is more up my alley with these types of games.<br /><br />-Options: The option to change the background and block texture is nice.<br /><br />-Stats: The stats button is handy to see how you're doing on various levels.<br /><br />-Difficulty options: It's nice to have 6 different difficulty options to progress through. Novice is nice for grade schoolers since it's pretty basic and easy.<br /><br />-Size and permissions: So many games are now asking us for some crazy, unnecessary permissions, this game isn't (only a storage permission). I appreciate that. It's also a manageable size (7MB installed).<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />-Scoring: My biggest annoyance with the game is how moves are scored.  I noticed after my first few games that the move counter seemed way off, so I paid attention the next game and realized that it doesn't actually count how many times you move, it counts how many moves you move a piece out of its starting spot. So if you start with a 1 x 1 block and using only one swipe you move it all the way across the board 4 spots, your move counter will go up to 4 instead of 1. The flip side of that is if you move it back to its original spot the move counter will read 0. Odd! I mean, you could get a really low score sometimes if you remembered where every piece started and tried to get it close to its original position after you have the red box piece piece close to its goal.<br /><br />-No level select/overview: My other smaller gripes are the game seems very choppy, not very fluid. There's no main level select screen where you can see a little icon or something of all the 112 levels in a set difficulty with your stats. It's hard to go back through and try to get a better score on a level because a little left and right arrow at the bottom are the only way to move through puzzles in a set difficulty. Levels can also be skipped, so then again it's hard to see what levels have been skipped and go back to them. I actually prefer gameplay that doesn't allow for unlimited skipping, maybe one or two levels, but not being able to skip through as many as you want.<br /><br />-Menus: The menus aren't very intuitive. It's very odd that in the \\"How to Play\\" section the screenshots show different menus and screens than what's in the game. I like the screenshots better.<br /><br />-Missing components: While I would never use the feature, and actually prefer it not included, the tutorial mentions a \\"heyzap\\" network that you're supposed to be prompted to log into after solving  a certain number of puzzles. I think it's weird that it's mentioned and not actually in the game. It makes it seem like the game was haphazardly put together and missing pieces. I would rather they just delete that mention in the tutorial and leave out all social networking extras.<br /><br />Overall, for a FAOTD it's not too bad. If it were an app I was going to fork out cash for I'd be a little annoyed and feel kind of ripped off.icon or something of all the 112 levels in a set difficulty with your stats.

1423113454|4.0|As someone who enjoys reading adolescent fantasy books, I really enjoyed this book.  The characters are interesting and likeable.  Having read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books, I found that the author does a great job creating a story arc which has similar elements to the Percy Jackson books but with plenty of differences to make these books stand on their own.  It was a fun and enjoyable read.
0374533571|5.0|Wow...I picked up this book because the movie was coming out and I have no idea how I missed this author. Honestly, this is one of my favorite books EVER. Told from the perspective of someone who was recently released from a \\"neural health facility\\", it is funny, sad, tender and hopeful. The mother is a great character as are the brothers and the father is believable and well-developed.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book so much that I don't think I can bare to see the movie...it can't possibly be as good as the book, which I read in three days.

B009A9BF5G|2.0|Is a shame that an extraordinary performance was so poorly captured and edited in this Bluray: grainy - looks like they used amateur camcorders to shot dark scenes; I hate the documentary-concert format, please put documentaries in extras not in the main movie!; few scenes last enough to enjoy it...

B004WR125O|4.0|It works with both. To use Mac filtering, you need to find out the adaptor's Mac address. To find it, you have to connect it to the wireless network first (if you don't the Mac address displayed is the address for the ethernet card). To do that, first disable Mac filtering on your router, then connect UWF-1 to the router as you normally do. Then,  go to hardware set up-->network, find out the adaptor's Mac address. Then return to router configuration and type in the adaptor's Mac address and enable the Mac filtering again.<br /><br />Some suggested using WEP, never do that. WEP can be cracked within an hour with open source software on the Internet. Don't disable Mac filtering either.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I bought this movie for the 3D which is pretty cool. But overall the movie is very average<br />and fits badly with the alien franchise/timeline. Near the end the story goes completely<br />off the rails. Could have been way better.

B00004R99U|3.0|...it was a pretty uneventful movie. It wasn't terrible, but it felt more rushed and dull than the first one. (As always, the original is way better.)<br /><br />The first movie was emotionally charged and told a story (not that this one doesn't, it just doesn't do it successfully) and keeps you engaged and entertained the whole time. The first movie was chock full of rich detail, lessons, and strong emotion, with some minor comic relief strewn throughout. But overall, it was rich with feeling, and possibly the only Disney movie where none of the musical numbers seemed cheesy or pointless. This one was full of lame comical antics between Percy, Flit, and Meeko, and lacked substance. The one exciting scene was very near the end where Smith, Rolfe and Pocahontas face off against Ratcliffe, and then it's over...The rest of the movie was just one big blah. The first movie was great from start to finish and I don't think it needed this sequel.<br /><br />One of the things I did like though, was some of the tie-ins and consistencies from the first movie that carried over into this one.<br /><br />This part isn't a big deal for most people, but the costumer and historical fashion junkie in me is SCREAMING about the \\"Wait Till He Sees You\\" segment (where Rolfe's maid is dressing Pocahontas for the ball) 19th century undergarments in a 17th century movie?! WHY?! The hoopskirt, underbust corset and pantaloons looked like something straight out of Gone With the Wind, NOT something belonging in the English court of the 1600s/1610s. Not to mention the swooping neckline and bare shoulders of the gown (again, something not in fashion until much later.) And the Marie-Antoinette like hair...<br /><br />Overall, a decent movie. Not great, kinda good, but definitely lacking in many areas compared to the original. 2.5/5
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I haven't finished it yet, but I love it.  I love the uniqueness of every chapter being a different story with different characters but yet they all tie together.  I will probably read it again.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It is rare that a sequel let alone a triology keeps me at the edge of my seat.  All the characters were phenomenal. Tom Hardy as Bane was unbelieveable and Hathaway is the true essence of Catwoman(sorry halle).  Ready to watch this movie again!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I have no conceptual framework to place this in my 54 years of reading.  I delighted in the originality, spirituality and creativity as this \\"fairy tale\\" unfolded.  Thank you for this Mr. Mattel.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This product was exactly as promised.  The old cord that I had was falling apart and so I needed a new one to be able to charge my Kindle.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is a phenomenal series.  There are so many different facets to the story...the romance, the action, the suspense, even a little mystery in there.  I think the only bad thing I can say about buying it in the trilogy format is that you can't really tell when you are near the end of each book.  The percentage on the Kindle Fire is for a 3 books, but again, if that's the worst thing I have to worry about I think that's pretty good!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a good second book. I have already preordered the next one. Then I will reread all 3 in a row.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|So far I'm enjoying the 4 Hour Chef. It's going to be hard to top Tim's previous book The 4 Hour Body because it contained some really ground breaking stuff for most readers. So far I've picked up few interesting tips in the 4 Hour Chef but I still have about half the book to finish reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A thoroughly compelling read.  It starts a little slow, but as you get drawn in you just want to know more and more.  The characters are all convincing and the plot has many twists and turns.  I look forward to any sequels.
B007KYQIEQ|5.0|Fun travel through time with a great cast. Will give you the warm and fuzzies. Great sit in front of the fireplace movie.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I'm very please with LEGO Friends Olivia's Tree House. But it's LEGO. What more needs to be said? Never been disappointed by a LEGO product yet. Amazon.com service and delivery was great as well. Very happy with it.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|If you have any passion at all about the 2012 US Presidential election ordeal, read this book.  It's perversely comforting to understand US politics was as outrageous and cutthroat then as now.  I ordered this after seeing Spielberg's fantastic film, \\"Lincoln\\" and being frustrated at not thoroughly understanding who all the characters were. Doris Kearns Goodwin's achievement is making the minutiae of historic events fascinating and the narrative a page-turner.  She was equal to her towering subject.<br /><br />To bring about his great accomplishments, Lincoln had to thread the needle with consummate skill.  He was resolute yet flexible, firm yet big-hearted, a skilled listener as well as speaker and as gifted at small talk as soaring oration.  As Kearns Goodwin points out in TV interviews, a sense of timing is an essential asset in a president.  Lincoln had that and would not be rushed by others into decisions he knew required seasoning.  He patiently waited for public opinion to ripen to a point of acceptance of ideas that were incredibly radical at the time.  Lincoln had tremendously fine political instincts and the wisdom to listen to them while simultaneously soliciting others' opinions.  If he heard a better idea, he would adopt it.<br /><br />From a young age, Lincoln abhorred everything about slavery, but at the outset of the Civil War had little more understanding of black people than most white men. He paid attention, though, and learned, and as chief executive his ideas matured.<br /><br />His tremendous ambition endured despite many early failures and much personal tragedy. He stayed alert for his opportunities and seized them. In 1860 nobody would have predicted Lincoln would be nominated as the Republican presidential candidate. He was ridiculed as a \\"railsplitter\\" from the uncouth West; more prominent politicians were dismayed. He snagged the nomination through fine instincts and consummate political skill.  So doubtless his ego was as big as any politician's but he managed it with magniminity and grace, deliberately appointing his fiercest rivals to cabinet posts because he respected their gifts and wanted the best possible people around him, giving him their best ideas. Yet he listened most acutely to his own wisdom.<br /><br />Interestingly, the geographic breakdown of progressives and conservatives in the 1860s is very similar to 2012.<br /><br />Personally, Lincoln adored and indulged his children but lost three of his four sons, the lone survivor being the eldest, to whom he was least close.  Mary Todd Lincoln was fiercely loyal to her husband and a good First Lady.  She had her foibles but given what she had to endure, I would say history has been unjustifiably unkind to her, this tragic woman's negative image abetted by her eldest son Robert Todd Lincoln, who seemed to have inherited little of his father's empathy and large-mindedness.  The death from typhoid fever of the gifted 10 year-old Willie Lincoln in the middle of the Civil War was particularly bitter, in that he was in a way a casualty of his father's Presidency -- if the Lincolns had stayed in Illinois rather than moving to sultry, subtropical Washington DC, surrounded by shallow waters, typhoid would probably not have been a factor.<br /><br />This book describes clearly and beautifully a series of historic events that changed the world.  Now perhaps more than in any other subsequent era, Americans need to understand the political process of broad societal change in a representative Democracy.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I read all 10 of the Vampire Journal books written in the series by Ms. Rice.  With each of those books I could not wait for the next book to come out as the story got better and better with each book building on the past book(s).<br /><br />That is exactly what I find in this book.  This book was a very easy read and I finished it on one rainy day.  The story was fast paced and it moved through the many different story lines very well.  While I can see the foundation of the series in this book, I expect and greatly anticipate the many twists and turns Ms. Rice will undoubtedly take readers on through the series.<br /><br />Ms. Rice has an ability to paint a wonderful story, over the course of time in a series and I expect that will happen with this book too.  I can see this story developing with friends, enemies and some villains as main characters and as I suspect will happen, Ms. Rice will have many enjoyable stories to tell within this series.  I await Ms. Rice's ability to morph and evolve the lines between each of them.<br /><br />For me the book stopped short and left me wanting to find out what happens next.  I await the second book and the beginning of another very enjoyable read and journey into the world Ms. Rice has created.  I also feel comfortable recommending this book to my children.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|Thought it was confusing. Just couldn't get into the story. without giving away the ending, it left me cold unexplained
0062197258|5.0|I just finished this book and my heart is still pounding. Really good read. I must say, I got a bit confused in the beginning with the story line until I realized that I wasn't reading the timeline at the beginning of each chapter! No substitute for intelligence! There were times in the book when I questioned how this was to end; was there a twist? Clearly, I won't reveal the ending but it's a good book and well written.  I'm ordering the hardcover for my husband for Christmas; he doesn't do Kindle which is his loss.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Jack Black, Own Wilson, Steve Martin and the hunt to spot the most birds! All wrapped up to make a great movie. Funny and heart-warming without being cliche. This movie made me want to read the book. Glad I finally bought it! :) Great condition and speedy delivery.
B0053KWDES|1.0|I was very curiose to see how this would work. This is an amazing product for the money. Just use a good pair of headhones not the in ear ones, I was using the Bose MIE2i's and they were starting to distort. I bought the Sennheiser HD25-1 II's and a HUGE difference. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Also battery life is excellent, and interchangable for the future if this one runs out of life.<br /><br />the FiiO is a great investment.<br /><br />*** UPDATE *** 2.27.13<br /><br />Had to return this. After a month or 2 with it the line out jack started dropping 1 channel. I thought it was my headphones so I tried another pair and same thing, also the battery stopped working. Fully charged it and still won't work. Damn shame because it was a decent little amp. I rather spend more money on a good amp from ALO Audio and know I have a quality product. Zero Stars!
B000I9YWDO|5.0|At my employer's facility we have every one of these characters except for Jennifer Anderson!  We had two supervisors that were assigned to offices with no windows and one door.  One office was originally a paint closet.  The other office was a storage locker.  Each of the supervisors staid in their respective 'closet' for twelve years.  Granted, they were amazingly normal considering their circumstances.<br />  This flick must have been written by someone in our  company.  Yes,  even the red stapler and the guy relocated to the basement!  This flick will be mandatory for arson investigators.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I haven't even received this yet but it is worth every penny. If you haven't started watching this show yet, what are you waiting for?!
B000002KGT|5.0|I wanted to get this cd to replace one my boyfriend lost, it's his favorite.  I was glad to receive it still in it's wrapper, and within just a few days of ordering it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Good quality graphics and music. You can set whether you want to be timed or not. Lots of settings and levels to clear.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The movie is great & the service provided was great.  Princess mononoke is wonderful & the animation is amazingly perfect!
1401937268|5.0|My favorite deck is John Holland's Psychic Tarot cards, but I saw these and I was drawn to buy them. I love them. My sister also bought a deck and I bought a deck for a friend as a gift. There are so many ways to get a message, so anyone from novice to advanced readers can use these cards.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved it!!!! I read some reviews & decided to order this movie. I wasn't disappointed at all. This movie was wonderful. I like Emma Stone a lot. I became a fan of hers after seeing her in Easy A. She deserves some awards for this movie. Viola Davis is fantastic, as is Octavia Spencer. This movie made me laugh & cry. I'll watch it again tomorrow. Then again after awhile. Definitely worth buying.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Fall of Giants Book One of the Century Trilogy by Ken Follett<br />The Century Trilogy chronicles the social, cultural, and geo-political history of the 20th Century.  Fall of Giants covers the first third of the century and is best thought of as a hamburger:  History is the bun holding it all together.  The “meat” is a mixture of English nobility and Welsh coal miners on the estate of Earl Fitzherbert, spiced with encounters with Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, King George V, etc..  The mustard is German gentry; the mayo is an American aid to President Wilson.  The onion is Russian, again Tsarist nobility balanced against factory laborers and encounters with Trotsky, Lenin, and Kerensky.  Wilted lettuce is the French, who get little attention beyond revealing their military flaws.  The ketchup is bloody World War I.  To make all of this work, Ken Follett requires an increasingly improbable set of coincidental encounters: Russian brothers Lev and Grigori  Peshkov separated before the war meet again as Bolshevik revolutionary and American army officer.  The American army officer (Lev) has already seduced the fiancé of President Wilson’s aid, who himself wounds the German nobleman enamored of Fitzherbert’s sister.  Fitzherbert’s wife is the sister of the Russian Prince Andrei who is being dispossessed by the Bolsheviks….and so on.  If you can swallow a dense bun of history and a mouthful of coincidences, Fall of Giants can be satisfying, but it’s not haute cuisine.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love all the pets that I can get. plus all the collections I can try to get. I think it is fun to play.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|the game is great and fun. what kills it is that once you get to around level 9 or 10 it loses data and sends you back to level 6 or 7 if you had quit for a while. Also I had collected several bounties for a mission yet I have not gotten credit for any.
B004856SQ8|4.0|I really do like this movie, hope they make a sequel and wished the original stars made a cameo. Fun!
B00012FXAE|5.0|I honestly loved this one more than the first. Much more action packed and I really liked Bishop in this movie.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|it was ok for a tv movie. not for  the big screen. not much more to add on this one
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he loved it. Although they made some of those stupid little changes that everyone complained about he still was really happy with the set!!!
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Bought this Core I3 to install in an Gigabyte GA-H77N-WIFI mini-ITX motherboard for an HTPC I am putting together.  Chose this particular CPU due to its (relatively) high performance with low total power (55W).  Ran Prime95 benchmark for over 30 min with standard Intel Stock cooler and it ran under 55 deg C!<br /><br />The CPU is quite fast and memory runs at 1600 MHz!  HD4000 graphics are decent (not great for gaming) but more than adequate for my HTPC needs.<br /><br />Highly recommended + amazon had the cheapest price (even better than newegg)
0060899190|4.0|Purchased this as a gift. It's different than I expected, but still nice looking. Definitely a good purchase. Small damage but that was to be expected.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|The compatibility claims it works, but it does not.  It just keeps loading and loading.  I might like the game if I ever got to play it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use. Love playing it.  Pops up quickly ready to play and the download installed quickly as well.<br />Loads of fun to play.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Once again another app i looked for specifically for my kindle from experience w on my phone. Perfect app for grocery lists, packing lists, to do lists, or just reminders for yourself.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great story. Great acting. Keeps you guessing. Entertains. My kids turned me on to it. Can't wait for season two.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Aside from 2 things i really like this app. Firstly, sometimes when you open the app and flip your kindle, part of the screen gets cut off- really annoying. Secondly, you can't long tap to open items in background browser.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen had great sociological, cultural and anthropological insights at her time. However, most of her works sound quite applicable and reasonable today as well, so many years onwards, i.e. after her. Nonetheless, her literary talent and skill are still unsurpassed. This story in particular is told in a very intuitive and psychological way, being very personal and touching, at the same time. The author is constantly flowing in the realms of human mentality, feelings and emotions; whereas keeping very sound and practical judgments on the wide social world surrounding the protagonist. Overall, it is a lovely story involving a whole spectrum of human moods, feelings and conditions, such as: love, romance, grief, happiness, longing, desire, rivalry, remorse, achievement etc.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy to use, intuitive, simple, free.<br /><br />Amazon - i don't like i must use a certain amount of words in a review. Pls ditch that requirement.
B003N5VOUO|2.0|I'm giving this movie two stars for being somewhat entertaining, but also a profoundly annoying and foolish piece of propaganda.<br /><br />The movie starts out as a cute love story set in San Francisco, bringing together an Autistic Moslem man and a free-spirited, modern Hindu woman.  These religious affiliations are important, because the movie soon takes on a very specific political agenda, one that seeks to paint Islam only in the most favorable light.  After a tragedy - or more accurately, after a barely plausible racist attack by affluent white youths in a thinly-disguised Bay Area suburb - our hero goes on a quest to proclaim to the President of the United States (no less!) his innocence of terrorist intent.  At this point the film becomes increasingly silly, and loses any credibility either as a historical drama or as a piece of art.  We note in particular the absurdity of the hero's and his companions' interventions in the aftermath of a hurricane in rural Georgia, the storm still going on in full force days after the initial event and in the absence of all the usual emergency responders - the Red Cross, local hospitals, Federal agencies, and so on.  The not-so-subtle subtext is that only the big-hearted Moslems care about rural African Americans.<br /><br />The most dishonest aspect of the film, however, is in its deliberate misquotation from the Quran in support of the proposition that Islam inherently deplores the murder of innocents.  The critical verse, which is actually cited in the movie, is the 32nd verse of the 5th Sura.  The deliberate omission from this verse is the proviso that allows, and indeed advocates, the murder of all those who are engaged in \\"spreading corruption\\".  This verse, and other similar verses elsewhere, is interpreted by radical Moslems to encompass anyone who is not of the Islamic faith, and to justify Jihad.  Omitting the language suggests that a moderate interpretation of the Prophet's words is the only possible interpretation.  If only that were true!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It was good to read the book to know what parts of the movie was accurate. Good read for all.
B004MPESSY|5.0|I rarely watch movies because I fall asleep after just a few minutes.  However! I have seen this one about 6 times and it always captures my attention and I still watch it from the beginning to the end.  Great revenge story!
B00005O3VD|5.0|I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She loves this movie! She used to look up the songs on YouTube and sing them and now she doesn't have to!
B0053JJLLC|3.0|After getting to the half-way point of this novel, I can say that it is clear to me that this isn't a Crichton novel.  Preston's hand is fairly obvious as the science (so far, at least) doesn't seem as believable as in Crichton classics.  But I am impressed with the ever-unique experiences of nature and it's certainly thought-provoking, even if it's not as easy to suspend my disbelief.

B009S8PEHY|5.0|Rod has outdone himself here. He actually sounds better than he did years ago. You can tell he was enjoying himself making this record. Bonus is &#34;When You Wish Upon A Star&#34;, which I have never associated with the holidays, but it really works here. Thanks to the great David foster for suggesting that this project be done.<br /><br />The special on PBS was really, really enjoyable, even with the numerous pledge breaks. Two major highlights: Merry Christmas, Baby sung with Ce-Lo Green, and the duet with Michael Buble on Winter Wonderland.<br /><br />All in all, a 5 star effort and my new favorite holiday album.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Marvel has a way of turning cartoons/comics into something quite entertaining and this was done pretty well.I'm looking forward to a part 2!
0062124293|5.0|This is an excellent, excellent book. If you are a woman, read it. If you are a man, read it. If you are a shoebox, read it.<br /><br />In all seriousness, it is rare that a book both makes me laugh continuously and makes me think about interesting and challenging issues -- but this book did. And while I do not agree with Moran's opinions about every subject she broaches, I respected her views and began thinking about my own stance on these difficult questions facing females today. I look forward to reading any other work by this talented author.
B00943SQCI|4.0|I love the original Dark Shadows and even enjoyed the Ben Cross mini-series and the only reason I rated this as high as I did is because of Johnny Depp. If you're looking to see anything relatable to the original this is not it!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I thought this was very well done. As some of the younger readers have observed, the references to the older computers and video games might be missed. But having grown up with them (and put way too many quarters in them) this was very cool.<br /><br />I hope they do a decent job with the movie!
B007HO392S|5.0|Great performer and the music blows me away.Will see her in concert in February and I am looking forward to that.
B002ZG997M|5.0|Great movie. I have the fight scenes savived on my browser. Even the Wild Bunch flick is right up there with book of Eli.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|MiB III is the icing on the trilogy cake. Got all three parts of that trilogy and they saved the best for last.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The plot was engrossing, and the characters very well defined. I thoroughly enjoyed this read, altho I'm not sure Katniss and Peeta were the right match, but that's just me.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The characters, their dialogue, actions, and inner thoughts are all very realistic.  It took a few chapters for me to become oriented and interested; but once I did, I looked forward to bedtime reading every day.
B000XXTCF8|5.0|Great Album at a great price.  Well Worth it!  Brought back some great memories of the days gone by.  A must have.
B0011WABIW|5.0|I have been through a lot of different media of this album.  It is just one of my all time favorites.  It's timeless.
B000HL09SA|5.0|Like \\"Old Yeller\\" and \\"Where the Red Fern Grows\\" this is a story of youth and the pets we love and lose.  Set during WW2 this is a story of a kid and a Jack Russell Terrier, purchased by his mother in spite of his father's protestations.  But it is this dog the kid so desperatly needs to grow up and learn responsibility and about the cycle of life.  A real tear jerker, this should be a family favorite.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good book but a lousy ending as if the Author ran out of ideas on how to close out the story!
B005XI9456|2.0|This album is horrible.  It is completely devoid of any soul or Christmas emotion.  But, my kids love it so I guess it's serving its purpose.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a really simple but fun game for any age. Enjoy it, I play mostly on my commute or down time at home.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Love this book and love that I could read it on my phone. It is the only way I can read I'm so busy.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|This is one of the first albums that I have listened to where I actually love all of the songs. They are all rich in meaning and the music is amazing. Nate Ruess's voice brings so much raw emotion to the songs that many artists popular artists seem to be missing. This is definitely one of the best albums I have ever heard and I recommend everyone at least gives it a chance.
B00846REIS|5.0|First in the series...if you liked 50 Shades of Grey, most likely you will enjoy this book. Anxious for the release of 3rd book in series in spring 2013!
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I am not the biggesst Kelly Clarkson fan, but I knew one thing from day one...the girl can sing. I really loved her &#34;stronger&#34; song and that's what prompted me to purchase his CD. I'm so glad I did because I not only love that song, but several others on it as well. It is a very cohesive album with the amount of pop and slow songs to satisfy your mood. If you were thinking about getting this album...DON'T WAIT any longer. It really is awesome.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, it is second in the series, read the first one and anxiously awaiting the spring 2013 release of the 3rd book.  If you liked 50 Shades of Grey, you will quite likely enjoy these books!
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|I have all but the 1st Rihanna CD and when I first listened this one I thought &#34;yawn&#34;...but after a few listens I got attached to a few songs (mainly because of their beat). Okay, so lets be honest....we know Rihanna is not a real vocalist....and we know she is not going to put out many songs that have a very in depth meaning to the lyrics....but we can pretty much expect one thing. Her songs are going to be catchy! She has songs that make you want to sing along (even though you can't sing) and it's okay because she really can't sing either LOL! (okay, I'm being mean). My point is....her songs are catchy and some of her beats are really good on this album. If you bought her previous albums you should go ahead and get this one.
B00A23MYCC|1.0|It was pretty bad and no plot....terrible movie ever made!  This movie is intended for poor taste of college humor... do not view with kids!!!
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I don't believe the app is completely supported under Android Jellybean, but I thought I would give it a try. I really like the layout and design, but it didn't quite work for me. There is potential here, but I am docking some stars for an inability to play videos in articles on Android and for not recognizing all types of newsfeeds. So, like a pretty girlfriend who lacks in substance, I had to part ways. But would date her again when and if she grows up some.
B007DA2FHG|5.0|The bond between truly man-bond of his loving horse through all his youthful experience, manhood, and war leaves this feel good movie as the best viewed for entire family.

B009HV2JT8|1.0|Funny.... the one good part of this movie was the trailer.  This movie should be refunded by all those people who paid to watch it.
B004T6IBNY|5.0|Five very different games to enjoy, motion is very realistic, sounds are just like the old pinball games of my younger days.  Very enjoyable. The western one is the hardest one for me, though.  Still can't get past &#34;you show promise&#34;.  Your scores determine your personal ranking from Amateur on through &#34;you show promise,&#34; &#34;pro,&#34; and &#34;pinball master.&#34;  If there is a rank higher than that, I haven't achieved it yet, maybe there's a &#34;Pinball Wizard?&#34;  Who knows, al I know is I will keep playing until I find out, or get old and die, whichever comes first.

B0046B1KHG|5.0|My son loves this movie. Watching it on my amazon app on ipad is great the resolution is wicked. Crystal clear
0385751532|4.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is about a 9 year old boy named Bruno who lived with his family in Auschwitz during the Holocaust. His father was a commandant for the Nazis. Bruno comes across a fence where he befriends a Jewish boy named Shmuel who was in one of the work camps.<br /><br />Overall I would say it was an amazing book and it did a really good job of showing how terrible it was for Jewish people during that time. Although it was hard to believe that Bruno knew almost nothing about the Holocaust especially since his father was a Nazi.<br /><br /> It was an attention grabbing book and I was not bored during any part of the book. This book can really make you think and I would highly recommend reading it. It's definitely best for young adults or adults to read, it's not a children's book.
B008VVT51U|5.0|The reason I purchased it was so that I could watch it whenever and wherever I wanted to watch it because I just love the acting and the characters
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I downloaded this on the advice of an article that named this as one of the educational apps you couldn't do without and wow, were they ever right! I put my notes on this, I put class memos on this, it is an awesome way to communicate with students as well as jotting down notes for myself and my husband and I even have a shared Christmas gift odds notebook! Wonderfully useful and I'm sure I haven't even begun to make use of all the great things it can do! Definitely recommend this for teachers and anyone with multiple devices that you need or want to share data and ideas with.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I really like this book because it has exciting adventures. The Wizard is only a humbug.<br />I never thought that until I read this book. I really like this book because of the land of Oz
B003THHIEM|5.0|Castle is one of the best shows to hit the small screen in years.  It has wit, humor, suspense, excitement, and sexual tension, and the chemistry between the stars is palpable.  I have liked every season, but Season 1 is possibly the best of all.  Nathan Fillion is charming and engaging, and Stana Katic is adept at playing her role with a range of demeanors from intense, vulnerable, and sarcastic to compassionate.  This show is always a good watch from beginning to end, and I enjoy watching the episodes over and over again.  Highly recommend.  If you haven't seen the show before, start with Season 1 and the first three episodes, and then you can watch any episode without being lost.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|very good series.  interesting, kept me coming back as often as i could to watch the next episode.  looking forward to season 2!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Read the Fall of Giants and could not wait for the sequel. Was disappointed with this effort. Waste of my time to read.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|I always find that there's something hypnotic in the classic films of the late 60s/early 70s, and Cool Hand Luke is no exception. Story and plot aside for a moment, the filmmaking style of this movie is pretty brilliant on its own. The photography is beautiful and uses minimalist landscapes of sparse props, etc, and compositions that are always interesting and well-designed from cut to cut. The story is straight forward but always engaging. The film's symbolism might be heavy-handed, but it resonates beautifully with the story and gives the film a lot of its charm. And speaking of charm, Paul Newman is aloof yet magnetic, delivering a performance that will enlighten people unfamiliar with him and his place in the Hollywood firmament.
B00992CF6W|5.0|can't wait till up dates and were are the creapers I can't find them Also survivul mode not the best
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This is a very handy app.  I am a realtor and I receive a lot of PDF files in the form of contracts etc.  This app is very user friendly, and I have had zero problems using the App.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs to view PDF files on their devices.[[ASIN:B004SD5GZ4 Adobe Reader]]
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I play it more than Angery Birds and I love Angery Birds. It is q fun and easy game to play.
B00021HBGS|5.0|We've had this product for more than a year, and my kids play with it every single bath. They stick them to the wall and to each other (which is fun too), and the pieces are easy to clean, which is not true for a lot of bath toys. My older son only started to be able to put the street together by himself when he turned 3 or so. Before then, I had to help him with it. The only thing I would improve is that the mesh bag it comes in is shaped such that it's difficult for little kids to get the pieces out or put them away. But even with that, it's definitely our favorite bath toy.
B0091REZMW|3.0|So far I have only had to find 3 or so items per area. Really wish there was more items or less time to find them in.
B0014YVCDK|4.0|very good album, very strong tracks with great inspiration and good ideas, so much rock and poetry :) PEARL JAM... what else?!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book allows the plot to really thicken and a love story unfolds. It's written very well and Christian grey is great!
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This isn't GCJr's actual debut album - there were 3 before it, some on an indie label. Some of the songs released previously are overproduced here. Also, the album's style ranges from blues, to rock, to hip-hop, with a slight touch of du-wop thrown in. That's it for the bad news.<br />Now the good news: This is a great album. GCJr's website advertises him as the next Hendrix; while that probably isn't true (it's hard to innovate), GCJr certainly does have a musical skill rivaling Hendrix's. The problem with Blues, even for afficionados like me is, lets face it, that it's usually similar and repetitive. This is where GCJr comes in - a new blues sound that already has me waiting for the next album. Some kickass guitar-playing too, sort of a cross between Hendrix and Kravitz.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved reading this. At first I thought it was a bit much for me but the more I read the more a plot unfolded and I had to purchase book two immediately. Highly recommended!

B008BM9L72|1.0|This book was boring and really badly written.  The author would find a word she liked and repeat it over and over throughout the books.  &#34;wanton&#34; was one &#34;gah&#34; was another, just to name a few.  It had no real story line except to say 'take a smart intelligent woman, introduce her to kinky sex and suddenly she has no will or mind of her own...'  It was disgraceful.  If you want to read a book that has lots of sex and kinky behaviour in it, read Jackie Collins, at least she has real writing ability...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it! So good. I have not seen the movie yet and was told to read the book first and I can see why the book was amazing.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This was a gift my son requested for his birthday so was happy to receive it.  Personally I don't even know what it is, I just buy what they want!.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|Great adaptation, great quality!<br /><br />If you are a fan of this graphic novel, this is a must own movie!<br /><br />Frank Miller animated.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it I could relate to Ana and the way she felt about GREY I loved someone like that who had hurt me physically
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Amazing Movie! It came quickly and int great shape!!<br /><br />How can anyone not love this movie. Wheadon did the world a favor!
B000QCS9NM|5.0|This is a fascinating book. I read it because it was part of my son's required reading but it was a curious peak into some rather bizarre characters.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Im thinking he needs to branch out from working with Tim burton. The movie was ok, but I can't imagine ever watching it again, for any reason. Do yourself a favor and find something else to watch.
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|I bought this app by mistake tow times.  I wanted an easier to use app. It is now gone from my device.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|There is not a better show on TV today. The conflict with Shane, the prisoner and the farm dominate this season and it delivers in every way. Some people complain about the first half of the season being too slow, but I say it set up the second half perfectly.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I  read this book years ago. I liked it so much I bought it for my Kindle, for a friend. ( we exchange Kindles when we are in Fl.) I rarely read a book a second time, but I reread this one. If you like a  thriller story and  WW2 history, this book is for you.
B008602KQI|4.0|very good acting  very much in keeping with the book's story line  The parts were age appropriate to the characterization in the book  reminded me of a novel version of Jackson's The Lottery.
B00138GZAC|5.0|Actually got this for someone else, but really like it.  It is slow, but very smooth.  Sade has a great voice and the music that goes along with that is great.

B009GYSQV6|4.0|Listening to the new Crystal Castles album (III) is a lot like the feeling of getting up too quickly. You bounce up out of a chair and that feeling of instant wooziness hits you. It's as if your head begins to compress and the edge of your peripheral vision begins to darken. Sound begins to swell in and out around you and you have the urge to fall back down in your chair till this feeling passes. Only with (III) this feeling last nearly 40 minutes.<br /><br />Crystal Castles Ethan Kath and Alice Glass have been making a mix of electronic, experimental and noise pop for almost ten years now. A propulsive noise, lying somewhere between electro noise pop and house music, they've always leaned more towards art over commerce. This choice has kept them in the underground, with only Canadian club kids and frequent readers of Pitchfork as the in-the-know crowd Castles caters to. On (III) they continue the sound they've honed and perfected on previous albums Crystal Castles and (II).<br /><br />`Plague' opens the album with Glass's voice seemingly coming from the depths of some Faustian purgatory as heavy bass and synth blasts push the song forward. `Kerosene' has an ominous feel with sped up, backwards vocals acting as a melody line and the `compressed head' vibe picks up with the beat and a synth bass line. `Wrath of God' is a propulsive dance track made for the damned. Starting out with almost a lullaby feel, then going into a darker and menacing place. `Affection' has a strikingly beautiful quality to it, actually. I don't get the sped up vocals, though.  I'm old, I guess. Kath is a talented producer and can build some amazing tracks. You can tell he's equally influenced by dance music as he is early 80s alternative, and the Robert Smith collaboration on the (II) track `Not In Love' is proof of that. `Insulin' sounds like Bjork and Aphex Twin freaking out in a padded room. `Transgender' is a woozy, dreamy track filled with distant screams and modulated keys that turns into a club banger, if that club was located in a dungeon. `Child I Will Hurt You' ends the album on a sparkly and quite pretty note, despite the warning in the song title. There's a real child-like, fantasy vibe to this song, which is quite a striking difference from the rest of the album.<br /><br />If `goth' were a word that was still quite popular in modern vernacular, then I'd use it to describe this record. Ethan Kath and Alice Glass hide behind the pulsating beat of club music; but in reality what they've made is goth music you can dance to.<br /><br />New Order fronted by Siouxie Sioux, and that's not a bad thing.to a club banger, if that club was located in a dungeon. `Child I Will Hurt You' ends the album on a sparkly and quite pretty note, despite the warning in the song title.

B008JFC6F0|5.0|In a lot of ways, Kevin Parker reminds me of Elliot Smith. Musically? No. But aesthetically, yes. Like Elliot Smith, Kevin Parker writes songs that feel lonely. Isolated. Also like Elliot Smith, Parker's songs come from a place deep down inside of himself. The outside world is of no concern to Kevin Parker. The world in his head is where he writes from. But unlike Elliot Smith, I don't believe Kevin Parker is sad about being alone. Kevin Parker isn't a tortured soul. He's just an old soul. And from that technicolor landscape deep in Kevin Parker's head is where the excellent new album Lonerism comes from. A place where John Lennon joined Blue Cheer and commited himself to acid head trip jams and Sid and Marty Krofft directed episodes of Little House on the Prairie. Tie-dyed tees and bean bag chairs. Schwinn Stingrays and key parties. Parker isn't old enough to have experienced the 70s, so he's re-creating them one album at a time. This time out he's perfected them.<br /><br />`Be Above It' starts the album out with a looped voice repeating \\"Gotta be above it\\" continuously, along with a looped drum part before Parker comes and turns this song into an anthem of sorts. A PSA straight from Perth, Australia. At first listen it's odd, but after you hear it 2 or 3 times it becomes this almost beautiful mantra. `Endors Toi' has that windswept stoicism that permeated Tame Impala's excellent Innerspeaker. `Apocalypse Dreams' sounds like a lost Lennon track. A mix of `A Day In The Life' and Plastic Ono Band idealism with a pinch of THC for good measure. `Mind Mischief' has a great rock `n roll groove by way of Marc Bolan. Then once you get midway into this excellent album you are hit with three amazing acid-tinged pop tracks. `Music To Walk Home By', `Why Won't They Talk To Me' and `Feels Like We Only Go Backwards' are some of the catchiest pop songs you will likely hear this year. Parker shows what a true pop music revivalist he is at heart. `Keep On Lying' is in a class of it's own. It's a long, strange meditation on Parker's own headspace. Who's he lying to? Us? Himself? It doesn't matter cause I dig his lies. Every single one of them. The fact that Kevin Parker's voice reminds me of a younger, reincarnated John Lennon only adds to the love I'm feeling for Tame Impala right now. Parker breaks out the riff strut of `Elephant' to pull us out of our LSD-daze, if just for a moment. It's about as rocking as it gets in Tame Impala country. Much like the Innerspeaker track `Island Walking'(sadly not included on the vinyl version), `Elephant' grabs ahold with a monster guitar riff that lives up to the song's namesake. Much like `Runways, Houses, City, Clouds' on Innerspeaker, `Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control' is the epic, existential moment on an already epic record. I'll spare you a long explanation of what it means, cause I don't know.  In one word: transcendence.<br /><br />Tame Impala have given us a gift in Lonerism. Perth, Australia has given us a gift in Kevin Parker. Lonerism seems to be a state of mind. A state of mind where it's okay to be alone. A place where you're comfortable with the ghosts of the past and the visions of a place that has never really existed come together to make a technicolor dream you needn't wake from.<br /><br />Kevin Parker may be alone, but never lonely.t's own.

B00004YRQA|4.0|That is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don't think more is necessary!
B000000WFF|4.0|Bought this for memories. I liked them when I was younger and still like a good number of their songs. Arrived in good condition.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The books are much better of course. They really are modern classics and should be read. however this does a good job of taking a huge idea and condensing it. the killings are not graphic and very old school mostly but that's ok because this is a pg movie. However I do think a bloodier version is needed, because killing people is a bloody disgusting affair actually. I did enjoy this movie alot though , the acting was spot on and similiar to the books vision. So that's a good thing here. The lead actress really carries this movie well too, she's got a bright future ahead of her if she doesn't blow it with drugs like so many before her have. the blu ray looks fantastic, it's not a four k picture but then only a few movies are shot that way anyways and there is no format for that anyway.  This was a smash hit at the box office though and worth your viewing. read the books though , they are better, just like the lord of the rings are better books than movies too. The blu ray has a seperate disc of special features and that's good too. I was glad to get the cheaper version without a digital copy or dvd. Please stop putting those in my blu ray package! It drives up the price. The story is about a society that like Rome uses violent games to help subdue the population and control them. It's more in depth in the books , but this version gets the point accross. It's a good movie that is aimed at younger viewers in spite of the themes here. It's in my collection to stay on blu ray for sure.
B003L77TZI|4.0|I liked a lot of the songs on here so I bought it. Came in good condition, I wouldn't play some of these songs around kids though.
B009439HEY|4.0|First, I have to admit that I have not listened my old Genesis LPs in the years after my turntable died. Since I always planned to replace it I have not purchased the CDs as replacements. I caught Steve Hackett performing some of the old songs on Youtube and was very impressed. When I heard about this disc I hoped that it would be as good as those performances. I am happy to report that it is. Most of the songs stick to the original arrangements (as I remember them). The audio quality is much improved and I could now understand the lyics that may have been lost in the mix on the LPs. I now realize how strong Steve's playing was and how much they meant to the songs. I thoght back to the days when these songs were relatively new and progressive rock was in its hayday. My only quibble is the choice of the female vocalist on &#34;Ripples&#34;. She has a weak Marianne Faithfull quailty to her voice and it hurts a beautiful song.
B000000WCA|4.0|Bought this more for a blast from the past and memories. I still like a good deal of their songs. Came in good condition.
B0042JIL2E|4.0|Imelda has a great voice which she wisely chooses to not overuse. Instead she just uses her voice to tell a story rather than try to &#34;prove&#34; to people how well she can sing. Many of the songs are rockabilly, a few jazzy numbers and the great ballad &#34;Kentish town Waltz&#34;.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|4 stars.  Not Grishams best, but a very enjoyable read. In typical Grisham style, he builds suspense with frantic and secretive travel up anddowntheEast Coast and around the Carribean.  Another Grisham trademark, surreptitious transfers of enormous amounts of money. A light-hearted story without serious examination of real issues, such as the death penalty, as in many other Grisham novels. You won t learn anything, but you 'll enjoy the wild ride.
B00772M1F6|3.0|The music sounds like it was recorded in 1955. If good 'ole rock and roll is your thing, then this is good stuff!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|its a great show i cant stop watching it, i really wants to know whats coming next!<br />I totally recommend it!
0307895475|4.0|This book is solid packed with useful information, facts, maps, and most everything you need to conquer Skyrim.  If you cannot find it here check the Skyrim Wiki online.  Between the two I am never lost anymore.
B009IF82SK|5.0|After a Season 5 that was not good, Season 6 has come back and the person bringing it back is Jim Parsons. He was way off in Season 5, Leonard and Penny picked up the show but without Sheldon there is no BBT.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is the superbly riveting story of a murder during the L.A. riots and its harrowing dénouement 20 years later. Very interesting background on the riots, LAPD then and now, and the war in Kuwait that may have passed firm public memory. I could not put it down.
B009K72RRS|2.0|After seasons 3&4 how can they go back to the kiddie season 1 & 2? They took the story right up to where they needed, dark and lot's of battle. That showed the harsh reality of war. Now they are back to bubble gum and bottles.
B00008G9JO|5.0|I'm writing this short review while listening to this remaster for the first time on a docking station for my iPod. I put it on as background music while doing some more important work. But I felt compelled to take a break and comment on just how wonderful this recording is. I'm a long time Tull fan but \\"Heavy Horses\\" has never been one of my favorites which make this all the more amazing. It is like listening to a brand new Jethro Tull release. I am usually underwhelmed by remasters and I usually write them off as an attempt to make a few more dollars off fans. That is certainly not the case with this one. If you're on the fence about buying this remaster, do not hesitate. I would give this hearty recommendation even without the bonus tracks, which again, I usually view as a way of gathering cash for material that was too weak to make it on the initial release. Not so with the two additional tracks here. I can't wait to put this on my \\"real\\" system and give it a proper listen!
B007CKNX28|5.0|Best new music I've heard in 2012, I highly recommend you check this one out! Every song on the CD has great lyrics and unique musical composition. Grammy nominated, it's a sure winner!
B004S699HC|4.0|It doesn't compare with the original, but it's a decent movie.  I didn't much care for what happened to Sara, though.  And as they were starting to have feelings for each other, it would have been interesting if they had been together at the end.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|A great show for moms and daughters to watch together.  Wish there were more shows like this!  Funny and smart.
B005GT3XGS|5.0|I love how Booth and Bones are always bickering and the chemistry between the all the characters just works!  I hope it enjoys a nice long run.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I switched from Razer headphones to these because I hated being tethered down by wires.  I was expecting some loss of quality but to my surprise, the quality was just as good if not better.  Absolutely love these headphones and would recommend for any gamer.  The only issue I have had is that if the bass is too loud, they can't handle it but for gaming purposes, it doesn't make a difference.  I've tested the range and for me, they can work up to 30-35 yeards away(through walls).
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I really like Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law together as Holmes and Watson.  This is a good movie, but I didn't like the fact that Rachel McAdams character was killed off.  I enjoyed the addition of Mycroft - talk about a character.  If Holmes is still alive - what about Moriarty?
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Rented this movie cause I am a coraline fan. This movie was just as good I Loved it. I would watch it again.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable outing that breaks little new ground but is certain to please the faithful. Not at all unlike a Steely Dan record (the only thing missing is Walter), this could easily blend in with either &#34;Morph the Cat&#34; or &#34;Everything Must Go.&#34; In fact, though it's 30 years after &#34;The Nightfly,&#34; they could have been recorded months apart, rather than decades.<br />Thematically, it's on the lighter side, and that's a welcome sign that Donald is enjoying life, and perhaps we can, too. My favorite track is &#34;Miss Marlene&#34; with compositional echoes of both &#34;Dr. Wu&#34; and The Nightfly, and the humor of Planet D'Rhonda is reminiscent of &#34;Tomorrow's Girls&#34; from &#34;Kamakiriad&#34; - but with a nice, jazzy guitar excursion. The funky guitar solo on &#34;Slinky Thing&#34; also shines. The album's production and engineering are first-rate as one would expect from Fagen and friends.<br />My only quibbles are the &#34;signature&#34; use of the melodica (should have left it at &#34;Century's End&#34;) and, despite the ironic Kelzmer-y clarinet/violin house-party vibe, &#34;Out of the Ghetto&#34; is fun, but merely okay as a song - not Isaac Haye's best work.<br />In contrast, &#34;I'm Not the Same Without You&#34; and &#34;Weather in My Head&#34; are both outstanding.<br />Overall, this is a very good album, and (the true test of success) stands up to repeated listening - in fact, I predict that it will continue to grow on me. A &#34;feel-good&#34; listening experience, and there's certainly nothing wrong with that. 4-1/2 stars.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Nice follow up but the ending is a bit abrupt. The good thing is that it leaves you wanting more. The bad thing is that it leaves you wanting more.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|This is a nearly word-for-word adaptation of Shakespeare's original.  I watched this with the original in front of me and there were maybe 2 or 3 very slight changes.  Overall, Mr. Branagh kept it true to its nature.  Very impressed.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love it very useful app, looks good and shows the information I need to know (time, day etc.) the weather and  wind speed is a plus.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|My love of flowers was doubled reading this book.  Very inspiring to have hidden meanings behind the beauty of flowers.  I will use this book as a resource when making bouquets and perhaps when I follow my dream to be a florist.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Enjoyed every song on the cd. :-) I could listen to the entire cd without skipping.<br />A must buy cd.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome whenever I'm bored I play this game.It has a ton of fun games please get it
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Brings the whole story full circle. Really very touching, lots of action. Lots of fun. You really get more depth.
0955153077|5.0|I have so many books in my personal library, I haven't had a chance to really put this one to use; however, I do love what I've seen & read so far.
B003VBNN54|4.0|I liked the movie I cant say it was better in HD but it was the first movie I saw on my ROKU player and was impressed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Whenever I miss a show I simply order it through Amazon and play catchup.  It's so easy! And best of all, no commercials.
1455508977|3.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks novel I read but have watched all of the movies. This book is very interesting until the end. You can easily predict the end that seemed little convenient course of actions.<br />Don't have high expectations, it's an ok read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|For whatever reason this game fascinates in real life arcades...it fascinates here.  I end up playing every day and sometimes wishing for more coins ...just like  when I have been mesmerized with the arcade machines.  Good game!
B0071T4BVC|5.0|Backed by all-star group of players, this album of pop standards can't be beat. Paul brings a lighthearted treatment to the lyrics that make it easy to listen to. One of my favorite albums.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Natalie Portman's portrayal of a ballerina going mad is superb. The dance sequences are both lovely and dark. Darren Aronofsky does a wonderful job in bringing you into Nina's twisted and fragile mindset without being too over the top. This piece is a psychological character study set in the world of ballet but could've easily been set as any other profession where competition is high. I enjoyed watching the story play out. Excellent.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Just ignore Drew Barrymore's accent. It's a good family film, romantic with sufficient pathos to keep you engaged. Some pretty amusing scenes. Enjoy!
B004UFEJVW|5.0|This movie is not just for kids. It's for whole family. Doesn't matter the age difference. I watched few times already.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I couldn't stop reading until I finished the book because it was so compelling a story. I'm also a flower-lover and could relate to Victoria's love for and need for flowers in her life.  I loved the book.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|This is a really good movie to watch. There is a great story behind it and the action in it is awesome. I think this would be one of Angelina's top movies
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Kids will love this movie for the story and adults will love the movie for the CIG.  Tom Hanks in it doesn't hurt either.
B0053O89XI|5.0|I got this game for 17 dollars and I love it! Quality looks so good on my TV and I love how I can share my DVD's with people that don't have Blu-ray. I love this show and I'm hoping I can buy season 6 on Blu-ray also.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Instructions state that in order to play additional different modes of video there is an additional piece of software you need to load. When you attempt to load it, you get a message that it is not compatible with the Kindle Fire.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|nice story alot of adult language would recomend for adults so sos so so so so so so oh well
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I have read another translation (probably condensed) of this book. It is taking me forever to read this version--the book is very wordy and goes on and on about things that loose my interest. But I will finish it! I have found many passages to underline that had a lot of meaning to me. It really is a wonderful story.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Like most continuing sagas, it's getting harder to remain new and unique! Probably time to let this theme go and move on to something else...!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Lousy options (or the absence of options) on the notes. Lags badly on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I will probably uninstall it. It just doesn't have enough usable...and user friendly...features. It's just a bare bones reader that lags going to my notes or the table of Contents etc.
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|5 stars is not adequate for this unique expression of rythym and music. Give it a Milky Way. Rest in Peace, or if possible Move in Peace and Grace.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Excellent game. Many, many levels. Hours and hours of fun. Very responsive. Creates no lags or problems on my tablet.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game! If your parents won't let you have a pet you can have a lot of virtual pets! Love it could. not find a better game then this(:
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loves this book! Read it several times. I can't wait for the next installment about how he views it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy to play and worked well on the Fire..  Free is always good!  I am new to the fire and still require easy apps!
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I really liked this book and the characters really stuck with me. This is a great book to share with young or teenage girls.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I only have a 2mbit/sec Internet connection but most of the time, to my surprise, that bandwidth is adequate to watch a non-HD episodes of Walking Dead. My wife and I were hooked on the series in Season 1... We couldn't wait for Season 3 to show up on Netflix so we purchase on-demand episodes from Amazon. If Netflix doesn't start providing on-demand instant video just released content, like Amazon, we're going to make the switch from the Netflix subscription service to Amazon's Prime. Amazon, your \\"Kindle for PC\\" product sucks but your Amazon Instant Video, as it runs on my PlayStation is pretty darn impressive.<br /><br />Re: Walking Dead Season 3: we're not as crazy about this season as the other ones. We're losing hope in the fate of the characters. Although, we're glad Shane is dead, I mean, really dead. He drove us nuts from the start.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|It is the prince that gets kidnapped by a fiery, fire-spewing dragon. It is the princess that gets to go and try and rescue the prince in distress. The princess has nothing to wear except a paper bag, and hence the title of the book. What happens next is a mix of intelligence, spunk, and a don't-take-nonsense attitude from our young princess. A welcome change from the fairy tales where the princess has nothing to do but pine for the dashing brave prince to rescue the princess.<br />The book is beautifully illustrated, with a a couple of lines of text for each full-page color illustration. I purchased and read the Kindle e-book version, and on your computer or tablet, the book is a treat to read.
1449410243|5.0|saw this, bought it for my friend, i read it and about died laughing. Gave it to her for a present, She was laughing so hard she had tears! This is a GREAT gift for any cat person! It's very funny and a joy to read!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I owe the first 2 movies love them.  I will also love this won as well. I would love adding this to my dvd movie libray. see it for years to come.
B003ZJJFKE|3.0|Joe is a virtuoso.  He is always impressive with his technical abilities, but as with ALL the other &#34;Guitar Gods&#34; (including Van Halen, Vai, Petrucci, etc) , there comes a point when technical ability fails to keep the audience's attention and stimulate an emotional response.  Fave track on here:  &#34;The Gold Room&#34;.
B004RE29PO|5.0|Excellent adaptation of this movie to Blu-ray. I saw details never seen in the original (both good and bad, like smears and fingerprints). The audio was excellent, and takes full advantage of a surround system with subwoofer. This Blu-Ray version is definitely a movie that requires watching on numerous occasions.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|JUST AS DESCRIBED<br />RECEIVED EARLIER THAN FIRST TOLD<br />WORKED GREAT NO PROBLEMS WITH ORDER OR VIDEO<br />HOPE TO PURCHASE FROM AGAIN
1594203334|5.0|I loved reading this book and wish it had been around when my now-28-year-old daughter was born.  I bought it for my niece who just had a baby (and had spent a semester at the Sorbonne), one for me, and one to give as a gift to a friend.  I first bought it for my e-reader but needed to refer to it to share parts with my husband so I bought the book.  It has a lot of great child-rearing ideas that American parents should use!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was a very good book. It kept my attention and I wanted to keep reading till the end. I recommend it.
B0079J28NW|5.0|The audio on the blu-ray version of Yellow Submarine is far superior to the older DVD release - so much smoother, natural and well-balanced. I own the older DVD and it was worth every penny to update to the blu-ray.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was a very good book. It kept my attention and I wanted to keep reading till the end. I recommend it.

0060526491|5.0|Quirky book but what else would you expect from Tim Burton.  It is short, and more of a coffee table book than a long read. If you like Tim you will like it.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|i have read it before but enjoyed it just as much the 2nd time. Great classic novel for anyone to read.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Love this show.  I thought it sounded stupid until I caught a few episodes on TV and got hooked and had to buy the whole series. It is hilarious.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Another great album from the greatest band to NOT be in the Hall of Fame. Perhaps it's because their Canadian. No doubt Neil Peart is the all time best rock n roll drummer
B0091V6TF4|4.0|Needless to say, there will never be a Bond soundtrack anthology to satisfy everyone, but I'm more than slightly surprised by many of the comments and objections here from various \\"fans.\\" Anyone with a serious interest in the films and the music will own the material on this set, often in more than one incarnation. There's nothing new here, and everyone has his or her favorites. If you're NOT familiar with the music, look elsewhere and don't complain. Obviously this release is meant for people with a more casual interest, and for those among us it will serve as a perfect collection of all Bond theme songs (including the From Russia with Love instrumental, which was not part of any of the previous \\"Best of Bond\\" CDs) and most of the songs heard over the end titles or featured prominently elsewhere in the films, plus a few rarely heard and/or unused tracks (most notably Shirley Bassey's \\"Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\") and select instrumental cues from many (if not all) of the films. The exclusion of \\"If You Asked Me To\\" from Licence to Kill is regrettable, but most likely due to the fact that the rights to that soundtrack are owned by MCA (now Universal).
B00973902K|4.0|I first time I heard this song and I fell in love with it. The DJ played this with Gangnam Style so I thought it was alright. Also I have no idea who this chick but she does A nice job singing.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I enjoyed the overall action theme.  This is truly an adult version of the classic Snow White story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I personally struggle with listening to British accents.  I have an incredibly hard time understanding the words.  It was tough for me to follow the basic story since I could not understand the dwarves, Willaim and parts of the Huntsman's spoken words.<br /><br />The special effects are great!
1451638450|4.0|As the many fans of the adventures of Miles Vorkosigan know, Miles has reached the age of forty (in _Cryoburn_) and is about to enter upon a new and very different phase of his life. (No spoiler details for new readers, sorry.) His days as the Little Admiral are far behind him and probably even his work as Imperial Auditor is going to be affected. But, of course, Miles isn't the only inhabitant of the dozen or more novels about him. Throughout the series, in fact, one of the most entertaining supporting characters has been his loyal but leery cousin, Lord Ivan Xav Vorpatril, who, like Miles, is a descendant of the emperors of Barrayar -- although, unlike Miles, he's not in direct line for a countship, for which he is profoundly grateful. The setting for this latest installment in the series is about five years before _Cryoburn_, which may be how Bujold now plans to expand the story -- thickening it up instead of just lengthening it.<br /><br />Ivan and Miles are of similar age and pretty much grew up together (along with Gregor, now emperor, who is five years older) and have long been mutually supportive semi-rivals. Ivan, now a captain in the military (there aren't a lot of career choices for someone in his position), has a reputation for an idle and sybaritic lifestyle and other people often regard him as a bit thick, just a pretty face with good manners. (His nickname is \\"That Idiot.\\") He's certainly a (usually) successful ladies' man. But he's also very, very far from stupid, beneath that carefully cultivated and protective exterior, and his closest relatives and friends are quite aware of it.<br /><br />When they were younger, Miles was the default heir to the throne, more or less, with Ivan a step or two behind him. But it was questionable whether Miles, with his physical limitations, would ever be accepted by the conservative Vor council, should such an event ever become necessary. And that would put Ivan on the succession hot spot. Ivan knows this full well and has always been extremely careful to never be thought to have any ambitions in that appalling direction. But now Gregor has married and produced a couple of kids and Miles and Ivan are both extremely relieved. Miles also now has a family, which puts extra distance between Ivan and the top of the heap he doesn't want any part of. But at thirty-five, he's gotten into the habit of things. Presently, he's serving as aide and general assistant to the admiral in charge of operations for the fleet (and doing a first-rate job of it, too) and so he finds himself accompanying an inspection team to Komarr. And there he's approached by a distant relation, Byerly Vorrutyer (well, nearly all the vor are related, one way or another), who works for Imperial Security -- ImpSec -- an organization which has been responsible for most of the trauma in Ivan's life and from which he tries always to maintain a careful distance. But By drafts him to try to protect a young female fleeing from a political takeover of her House on Jackson's Whole -- a very unpleasant place, as Bujold's readers know. Ivan is nothing if not chivalrous (and a sucker) where damsels in distress are concerned, so he agrees, reluctantly, to help out. And so, willy-nilly, he finds himself custodian of Tej and her odd-sister Rish (who is very odd indeed). But in his desperate efforts to hold off the local cops and Komarr's immigration authorities, he finds himself -- to his consternation -- getting married. That makes Tej a Barrayanan citizen, Ivan's dependent, and immune to local harassment. Besides, it's only temporary; they can organize a quick divorce as soon as Ivan gets his new wife back home. Right?<br /><br />You can see where this is going. It all has certain aspects of Shakespearean (as well as Wildean) comedy to it and Bujold has a terrific time spinning out all the plot threads. And, for some reason, the author finds not-unwelcome opportunities for various characters to recount incidents and explain relationships from throughout the earlier books in the series. But you'll definitely find yourself grinning as Ivan tries to retake control of his suddenly overturned life. And you absolutely don't want to miss witnessing the final fate of ImpSec in Chapter 23. Memorable, to say the least. In fact, my only gripe with this book is the terrible cover illustration. It makes Ivan look like a cross between David Schwimmer and Jimmy Durante.ationships from throughout the earlier books in the series.

B0054SMIH6|4.0|Excellent acting, several twists in the plot that were totally unexpected.  Great ending to the story as well.  Would recommend to friends.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|A simple case that fits just fine. Only improvement I would make is to add a small pocket to keep notes.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I loved the first season, and would give it 5 stars.  This year the show is darker and more evil and warped.  It is on the verge of being disgusting.  Still quite scary, and fascinating, and I can't turn away, but without spoiling things, so far it seems to have gone toward the gross-out side.  Lily Rabe is the outstanding star this year, innocent to evil in 1.6 seconds.  She is impressive!  Jessica Lange is once again outstanding, as is Quinto.  The acting is VERY impressive.  Since I haven't seen them all, I will withhold final judgment.
B005FISBTO|3.0|I'm hoping that the season is an aberration and that Dexter hasn't totally jumped the shark.  While there were things to enjoy overall (the work of Edward James Olmos is always interesting even when he's constrained by weak material) but I found myself feeling increasingly annoyed with (a) a weak villain, (b) the mildly icky Dexter-Deb incest theme, and (c) the total implausibility of how Dexter manages to just 'take off and leave' day or night without anyone raising questions or holding him to account.  Honest, people who have real jobs don't typically tend to have that kind of freedom.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is an EPIC game... buy it for the kindle and you WILL be pleased with it... I know I have...p.s. get it for the PC too. totally worth 27 bucks...(also watch captainsparklez on youtube)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really Enjoyed, great character development. Not what I expected. Well Done. Recommending to my book group friends as a fun read.
B000S1M9LY|4.0|A very interesting book, highly recommended if you are looking for a challenge. It's long, like 1000 pages, but goes by pretty quickly. Also nice in the Kindle version, so you don't have to carry around the bulk!
B007X4ECLY|2.0|This was a low budget badly written movie.  I'm surpised an actor like Guy Pearce signed on to it.<br />The only reason I bought it was because I'm studying Italian and this movie has a Italian language audio and subtitles.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Using this as part of a podcasting/IP Phone setup on Windows 7 x64, Lync 2013 for phone.<br />Works Great!  Never  dropout.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Since my first review of this app, My Clock has bit the big one. sometimes it works sometimes not. Not a very trustworthy alarm clock. Oh, And I never did figure you how to do the sleep mode and still have time showing. Deleted it from my device and the cloud. Not recommended.<br /><br />Great app. Been looking for an alarm clock for my kindla for awhile. Tried several that didn't pan out but this one has been great so far. I just needto figure out how to set the sleep mode but still have the time screen on. I'll figure it though. no big if I don't.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|I really like the app. This slide puzzle modifies to play in both angels on your fire it also has soothing music that you can turn off however if it annoys you. There are no penelties for going over the given moves to solve which allows you to try more puzzles.  It doesn't hold you back do my 6 yr old is happy after move 100 when he finally solves the harder ones but to be honest this only held his attention for three plays. I don't see myself playing it often but it is a nice game for those who enjoy these and to me was calming.<br />Florida Mom
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|For any Indy fans, this is a must have. Great box, awesome extras and documentaries, loved every minute of it!!
0143119680|1.0|With most trilogies each book is a complete story. After 600 or so pages this book stops in the middle (or 1/3rd way through) what is basically a Harlequin romance laced with pseudo-history/wine appreciation and repetitive gushing descriptions of vampire beauty. Plough through another 1200 pages of this mush to a predictable end? I think not!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend and it appears to be in perfect condition, brand new just like it said! :)
B001O3B5BK|2.0|Bought the original release of Tommy,, but it is not the one I remember.  Apparently the second release was better orchestrated, which explains the higher cost.  Live and learn.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I am beyond happy with this product! It was in great condition and got here really quickly! Great buy if you love One Direction as much as I do!
0307387178|5.0|He just has a way of pulling you in. Detailed research was obviously put into the writing of this book. I never did like the movie much but the book is excellent.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|its a great old time game and love that I can play with my freinds &amp; family online . Defintly worth it
B00A7CI82I|3.0|the same as above also fights were a bit staged jason fights seemed more real his training seemed unrealastic the cut aways were from a better movie
B001VFTYWI|5.0|Quite honestly, it is surprising to see that some have given this a low ranking,but I realize the subject matter is gruesome for some. However, I've followed the Kay Scarpetta series since the early days, and admire Patricia Cornwell's writing style. One can tell that the author has extensively researched the subject matter and also knows the locations that are described in the book.  Highly recommended if you are a Kay Scarpetta or Patricia Cornwell fan!
B001HTSCZI|5.0|Great movie. Really good direction in style and animation. Action packed and fun to watch. It was not a short and set as a real movie.

B009DCOU9S|5.0|it has a great storyline it is a great continuance to the first one it ties it all together please keep them coming I love sequels
B008N1V11U|1.0|well I was very excited for this game until I realized I need to free 731 Mb of space on my kindle, which is a lot. I deleted all my music and videos and it went down to 723. I have enough space for apps because I downloaded 2 games after this didn't work and they worked perfectly. I paid for 90% of my apps so I didn't want to delete them and now I am stuck with a digital paperweight pretty much...
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I was surprised at the date chapters at first, since I have not seeing anything like that before.  I wondered if I had to go back all the time to understand them, but it was not necessary.<br />Having worked in courts for many years I liked that it started with a court transcript.  I was caught immediately in the story, and it was hard to put it down.  When I didn't have the time to read it, I kept thinking what would happen next.  I love psychological thrillers and this describes OCD, abusive relationships and even torture.<br />Definitely I will read more books written by this author.
B000N2HBSO|2.0|I have read over hundred books on the American Civil War and have read several of Ms. Goodwin's tombs.  She is an exceptional writer and it particular, I enjoyed her book about the Brooklyn Dodgers.  In \\"Team of Rivals\\", she departs from her usually high standards of writing.  While there are many passages about the various cabinet members, the book is written as if a very talented research wrote a paper on the inner workings of the Lincoln administration.<br /><br />Ms. Goodwin would have better served to focus of Seward, Stanton and Lincoln.  I enjoyed the book but I can't recommend it.  From an historical perspective, it employs too many conclusions that in the 21st century would make sense.  Relying on dairies and personal letters, one should remember that in the mid-19th century, people wrote in a way that would be hard to duplicate today.  Lincoln's cabinet didn't have the affection for him during his lifetime as expressed in the letters and dairies.  This was considered common courtesy at the time.<br /><br />Lincoln's relationship with Stanton was professional until his death.  Making anything more of the relationship discounts Lincoln penchant to be on familiar terms with everyone and gives Stanton credit that he did not deserve.<br /><br />I would interject that Seward and Chase were well aware that their writings had a \\"historical\\" nature and were careful to project the imagine they wanted to convey to \\"the ages\\".  Chase was also well aware of his political status in Ohio and the rest of the nation.  His political \\"lies\\" promoting his own advancement was and is common.  He hoped for the presidential nomination but understood the realities of the time and didn't care if he made enemies.<br /><br />The epilogue was much too short and the footnotes overwhelming.  If one wants to read Goodwin for Goodwin (which I did and enjoyed) it is a good read.  The plot revolving around Katie Chase and William Sprague is an interesting subplot but most of the \\"story\\" could have been lifted from Google.  A complete research of the marriage, adultery and claims of poverty would have added to the story.  All in all, the book was probably a project of Goodwin's but with the input of research assistants and editors the project fails except by the sheer enjoyment of the read.
B002RI99IM|5.0|This book is a love-it-or-hate-it-but-you-cant-put-the-book-down sort of book. Taleb is a deep thinker and an intellectual. I love his idea and am deeply influenced by it. Some of the elements in the book are controversial and might evoke strong disapprovald from few, but it is a compelling read.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I really expected much more to happen in this movie. The acting was good but at the end of the movie, I was &#34;really?&#34; The special effects were almost null as well.
B0050KU3IY|3.0|This was not quite as good as the something borrowed. Perhaps because I just couldn't relate to the main character.
B0058YPL66|5.0|When I first heard about this series I was skeptical.  After watching the first episode, I was hooked.  True, it may not be for everyone, but as far as I'm concerned, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to give &#34;classic fairy tales with a modern twist&#34; a try.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|Disgusting sexual content was not necessary for the story content.  Hardly worth my valuable time to rate this<br />adolescent facination with disgusting and degrading content.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|I looked for this movie on different home streaming sites & couldn't find it. I wanted my kids to see it & was happy to find it here, and for a great price! I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This is a fabulous movie for those who like to share your deepest feelings, explore who you are, and want to truly understand the person next to you.<br />It is NOT for everyone. If you would rather not show your special someone who you really are, you'll probably find this movie rather uncomfortable if not plain boring. That's ok, but don't blame the movie - it targets very well a specific audience that you are just not a part of.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|A free game that gives you choice to pay with actual in game gold or store bought gems, wow it feels like Christmas.
B00448SE4S|5.0|Funny and delightful.  Well-made and put together. I really don't understand why this wasn't a bigger hit at the box office.
B00ADYYY50|5.0|If you aren't an avid listener (fan), I wouldn't expect you to like it at all. But if you give it a chance, you're destined to LOVE at least a few songs. LoL. = )
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Not worth the hassle. I will just buy the app to get away from the looooooong ads.<br />Lots of streaming videos.

B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie. It's even appropriate for my six year old, who found it funny as well! Will Ferrell is hilarious.
B001LM1456|4.0|watched it once,,,was good but not awesome.<br /><br />I liked the hulk actor better in the advengers, this guy was ok, just not the david banner I picture since i was a kid.

B002BI6SMI|5.0|I wanted to smack the mom several times in the movie!!!<br /><br />Liam was awesome and cant wait to see taken 2
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I loved the first book and went straight into reading this one but I was better able to keep up with Characters in first book. This one was a little harder to remember who was in who's family and who lived where. But other then that learned history with an entertaining story. I am just sad to be done now because next book not out until 2014. I feel if you are going to write a trilogy you should not have long breaks in between.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|we are loving it my kids and I are trying to steal it from each other to play we can not stop
1584233494|5.0|I bought this this book for my husband and he loves it. The compilation of prints from Farley all captured in one book is really great.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a movie that shows how ugly racial discrimination is. It also shows the fights made against it by some courageous women who triumphed in the end.
B0060D0Z0G|5.0|You don't have to love horses to love this film.  The real-life background is a wonderful story, and the acting is terrific.  A friend suggested it and I'm glad we listened and now can re-watch it any time we like!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|It was an OK movie, but not one for the whole family, unless you are at the stage of liking Saturday morning cartoons with the kids. Graphics were OK.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This books makes an excellent scientific case for life after death. I bought multiple copies to give friends for Christmas presents.
B00633W614|1.0|I will buy no more books written by this author! This was over priced and he does not give the benefit of the bargain. Ending the book on a cliff hanger after a great portion of the pages dealt with the issue is unfair.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this trilogy and the third book was by far my favorite. It really captured Ana as her own women for the first time in the books.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I liked the pace of the book, the unexpected dry humor.  It fell short of the 5th star due to overly drawn out ending.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game because I get to feed and Lear. more baout the animals of the ice ageand I get a lot of money to buy more land and more animals.

B006PKQQJS|5.0|Great time management game! Plays great on Kindle Fire, definitely worth the $! Lots of levels,I hope they make more Sally's Salon games soon!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Possibly the best of the franchise! Christian Bale is an excellent Batman and Anne Hathaway a superb Catwoman. Highly recommended!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Great time management game! Plays great on Kindle Fire, definitely worth the $! Lots of levels & challenging but not too hard,Exciting & Fun!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I was very pleased to open my email yesterday morning to see that \\"The Duchess War\\" was finally available for purchase. By 10:00 last night, I had finished the book and was already searching the author's website to find out what I could about the follow-up book, a Kiss for Midwinter.<br /><br />I believe I've read all of Courtney Milan's published books -- including the novellas. This book was truly one of the best. The two main characters are people that you would want to be friends with -- both are trying to do the right thing, while struggling with baggage from their childhooods. They are thoughtful, resourceful, intelligent and creative.<br /><br />The plot kept me guessing. When I thought I knew where it was going, it would go in another direction. And, their actions and decisions were believeable. I went back and read the last chapter and the epilogue of \\"The Governess Affair.\\" I loved that Robert and Oliver truly became brothers when they met at Eton, despite their respective families. Several parts of this book had me tearing up as the main characters remembered the events of their pasts.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the next books in the series when Lydia, Oliver, Sebastien and Violet get their stories.

B005OK725M|5.0|Columbiana is an action packed and inteligent sort of movie. She uses her smarts to carry out her revenge, its not just one of those blind revenge movies.
B0034G4P26|4.0|This is a gift for my 6 year old grandson so no reviews on the movie yet but it was a great buy and was delivered fairly quickly.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I am absolutely baffled by where the hype for this book came from. The plot is so outrageous that I had it figured out incredibly early on, telling myself \\"no, it can't really be what I'm thinking\\" and kept reading in the hopes that I was jaded from watching too many television shows with the same types of outlandish story lines. It was everything I prayed it wasn't. All I can picture is a bunch of miserable women sitting around hating their husbands and identifying with and living vicariously through Amy, who is a loathsome character at best, and then recommending it to all their miserable friends to read. The beginning was slow and boring, the middle impossible yet predictable and the end a terrible injustice. Save yourself a few hours of your life and read a better book.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Its not faced paced filled with destruction and mayhem along the way. It is a really good feel good movie. There are all the elements to a wonderful story line with a few little twists. The actors do their job with polish and style that only someone who has been doing it for years can pull off. I was feeling down about not being as prepared for the future as I should be. I have been for the last couple years. Then this movie comes along, and sneaks up on you and suddenly Im going to get ready for an adventure of my own!!! Why not what am I waiting for???You really need to see this, they dont make them like this very often any more. And Id hate for you to miss it!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's like farmville but it's actually fun. :) DOWNLOAD IT! SERIOUSLY! warning : keeps you from doing your homework :)
B009RI4FRU|3.0|This was a so-so movie.  It was difficult to keep track of the story line.  It did have big name actors to keep interest where lesser actors might not have given the story.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I enjoyed this movie . I loved Julia Roberts in this very entertaining film. Easily downloaded to my Kindle Fire.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The ending is just the right thing to end the thrilling trilogy. It couldn't have been any better. This is truly a 5 star book along with \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\".

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really a young adult/teen book but I enjoyed it even though older. If I reviewed it as an adult book for an adult reader, I would give it three stars.
B00338QENI|4.0|I had never heard of HeLa cells before, and when someone mentioned them I decided to look up about them and found this book, which was not only informative from a scientific point of view but also from a human point of view. I thought the book was a little long for the story behind the HeLa cells but enjoyed it nonetheless.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Every one of his books is both a fun and an informative read from LIARS POKER on. Each one will give you more information about the idiocy of Wall Street. Hard to put them down. Read them all and have fun while you cry about your losses.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Not the expected McEwan of Atonement literary excellence.  More mainstream, less literary, but a page turner and good beach read.
0307454568|5.0|One of the few instances where the movies and the books are both great. It is a great read even if you see the movie first.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Excellent short stories from one of the best short story writers ever.  Some of these stories are more personal than those in her other collections.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Great watch for the money and love the dail and movement. looks great and is not too thick to wear with long sleeves.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was an instant favorite. The author brought me right into her world. I could see everything so clearly, and I could feel everything Katniss was feeling. I laughed and I cried. This book isn't just for teenagers, it's for anyone who loves a great story with memorable characters that make you feel.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Brought my first Seiko while in Nam, it was a automatic also. Like the dail and movement.  What I do not like its a product of China.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Christian at his finest! Ana at her finest! Definitely an amazing ending to and unforgettable series! Cannot wait to see what is next for EL James!
B000YHE4AG|5.0|This is a new holiday classic. I forgot how enjoyable this film is.  So many wonderful scenes, so many quotable moments.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An enjoyable easy read, the Hunger Games series keeps your attention and begs to ask &#34;What's next?&#34; Now I'm looking for a similar read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy rules, smooth gameplay. Well worth your time and free, even without the paid expansion packs. Grab it now and enjoy.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The book was very similar to the movie with only one major difference. So if you liked the movie, you'll probably like the book.<br /><br />There were two qualities about the book that distracted me from liking the story more:<br /><br />1.  The author is/was a crusader.  And while his cause is good, I felt betrayed in that in order to read a good story, I had to also read his propaganda.  I suspect though that his cause is a thread that winds through all three books.<br /><br />2.  The translation from Swedish to American English is not good.  Maybe it works better as British English.  There are dozens of places in the book where I sat back and thought, \\"What's he trying to say?\\"  or \\"We don't say things like that\\".  Early in the book I thought it would improve, but it didn't.  However the story's mystery and suspense overrides the suboptimal translation.<br /><br />Overall, good story, while those two points kept me from enjoying it more.
B003PVPXOE|5.0|Sunset Boulevard was nominated for 11 Oscars, winning 2. Most of the major awards for 1950 went to the equally brilliant All About Eve, but that in no way diminishes the quality and emotional impact of this film. This is an excellent two disc set. One disc contains many special features which take the viewer behind the scenes, and provide some interesting trivia. Montgomery Clift originally accepted the Joe Gillis role and then withdrew, which was William Holden's good fortune. And before Gloria Swanson was cast as Norma Desmond, such past stars as Pola Negri, Marlene Dietrich and even Mae West were considered!!<br /><br />The movie disc is first rate. The film exposes the darker side of Hollywood. Norma Desmond is a delusional , aging and misguided star who expects to make a comeback. Joe Gillis is a near penniless desperate screenwriter who meets Norma and decides to help her rewrite a mess of a script she wrote about Salome, a role she expects to play. Norma falls for Joe and when he realizes that he has become a kept man who is fooling himself and Norma, it is too late to back out of the situation. Erich von Stroheim is menacing as Norma's butler with a secret and who is also protective of her. And Nancy Olson is excellent as a  budding writer who ultimately falls for Joe. The story is well told and wonderfully directed by Billy Wilder. This is an emotional roller coaster which leads to a tragic crashing ending. Very highly recommended.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I am a big fan of John Grisham....he always entertains. No other author can describe in simple<br />terms...each of his characters. As the plot is revealed..one can clearly visualize the settings and<br />each colorful character. His sentences are brief but clearly reveal the subject and circumstances .<br />I often laugh out loud at his descriptions.  The subject matter educated the reader regarding  the<br />court, juries and the back room deals during courts cases. Very interisting... Highly reccomend.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book started off odd, but as it went on, it was okay.  Weird how things just &#34;fell into  place&#34; as she had hoped.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer  provided another enjoyable read. John Grisham's description of characters and setting<br />once again provides an interesting plot to keep the reader engaged. As usual..I laugh at the circumstances<br />and unpredictable events.  I certainly could not predict  the final pages.  Grisham informed<br />the reader regarding  federal courts, judges and  prison systems in th U.S. and  other countries.  This is a book<br />you will want to add to your library.
0425263916|5.0|If you like the 50 Shades books, you will love this serious.  This is number 2 and kept me suspense the whole time.  The Human Service person in me is trying to fix them both.  Ha, ha.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn books never disappoint.... Although ficton....the events and characters are a mirror<br />of the events in real time. The only negative ...is that I stayed up late each night reading.  I<br />found it difficult to put the book down. Could hardly wait to see what was in store in the final<br />pages.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Historical based novel told through the voices of two of the main characters. What a great insight into how life on the plantation was like for both the slaves and the slave owners. It provided much to think about in terms of this era of our history.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you liked the movie &#34;The Sawshank Redemption&#34;, you will love this fast-moving tale of a man who seeks justice for a supposedly undeserved jail sentence.
B008BM9L72|5.0|This Trilogy raised a lot of interest and had most people talking about the outcome.A most enjoyable read and i hope there is a follow on.
B00124DQ2W|5.0|I am a lifetime Chicago fan, and  I thought this album was very innovative. Chicago is one of the most accomplished bands ever. My favorite song is and will always be 'Beginnings' from CTA 1.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My son loves watching this movie.  This is the 3rd time we've downloaded it.  We may have to buy it!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|The Mircle on 34th Street.<br />This is the only version to watch.  Yes, Santa does exist.<br />This is a true classic to watch every Christmas.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I loved this book, bought it for my mum also who never read more than the first chapter. Yeah sure mum!!! Anyway, now we have all read the books we will wait and see who plays Mr Grey on the big screen. We can all agree that the books were not well written but they obviously did something right!!
1451695195|5.0|I ordered this book a while before realizing what was going on with my father....not knowing how ill he was.  The other day he passed....WWII and survivor of Normandy.  Although I have always been a person of faith, having this book now has made his loss so much easier for me.  I was meant to get it when I did to help me get through the grieving process.  Wonderful book!  Thank you!
B007QNRMUU|5.0|I love almost every track. While less alternative and more (but not too) pop, this album is still Mraz puro.
B002RI9SC4|3.0|From my point of view it wasn't the best ending in fact i heard they changed the end of the movie because the ending was so bad.the rest or the book was good though and i think if you read the other books it is probly a good thing to read breaking dawn.
B005QYKE2Y|3.0|Eh, Shia Lebouf is a great actor...but everyone was just dumb in this movie. If I'm a hot, British actress... I don't think I should stand in the middle of giant alien robots shooting each other. If I am a small human man, I shouldn't venture into the heart of Chicago, where ALLLLL the alian badguys are, to JUST find my girlfriend(although she's fricken hot).<br /><br />IT felt rushed. Good movie, but Revenge of the Fallen is way better
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is fun for the smaller kids and I should know because I'm eleven years old. So if you have kids I recommend it for your kid. Only one commplant. I have a kindle fire and sometimes when I am moving my dragons it throws me to the water and won't let me go back. That's it. Personally I think it's a fun game with cool dragon. Some cute and some less than others. But the more you feed them the cooler they get. Sorry for the long writing but I hope you read all of this.:)
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Good story, great I am guessing computer animation. Looks good on HD TV.<br />Good entertainment for the whole family or just for you for some down time.
159420411X|4.0|The fame of Nate Silver (which one hopes will last longer than fifteen minutes) reached a crescendo with his prediction that President Obama would win reelection by a comfortable three-point margin, while all the pundits, talking heads and demagogues were either proclaiming the election too close to call or a certain victory for Mitt Romney.  The fact that Nate Silver made such accurate predictions in favor of your candidate, however, does not necessarily mean that The Signal and the Noise is likewise a revelation. It so happens that it's a pretty good book, although I suspect that many people have failed to read it thoroughly.<br /><br />If you have fallen by the wayside and given up on the book, because the topic -- statistical probability -- is one that naturally induces one's Eyes to Glaze Over, may I encourage you to have another go at it, because several of the chapters can be skipped without missing the gist of Silver's techniques for prediction.<br /><br />The book reads more like a series of magazine articles. Chapter 10, for example, is an account of professional poker playing. Obviously, mastering statistical probability is essential to winning that game, but if you have no interest in table games, you will not gain much from reading this chapter. Chapter 9 is completely off topic, because it is not even about chess, specifically, or how the laws of probability apply to the game; it's merely an account of how grandmaster Garry Kasparov  apparently lost his nerve and was unable to defeat IBM's computer, Deep Blue, in a 1997 match, a story which has been told by others many times before and to greater effect. If you have no interest in chess, it is not essential that you read this chapter either.<br /><br />Over the past few years, I've read practically all the books on the financial collapse (my favorite term for which is \\"The Great Unraveling,\\" although that seems to have lost out to \\"The Housing Bubble\\") and ongoing economic woes, and I seem to have left reviews proclaiming each book to be the best ever written on the subject. But due to the complexity of the topic and amount of information one needs to digest, all those book make for somewhat tedious reading. If you have not done your homework and studied The Great Unraveling, chapter 1, \\"A Catastrophic Failure of Prediction,\\" is the clearest and most concise account available, because it explains what happened without naming names or describing personalities. The chapter could be called \\"The Bubble for Dummies,\\" and it's a neutral account, free of blame. (Of course, most citizens in our polarized society want exactly the opposite. They want to be able to merely point fingers at *them* without having to learn complicated details.)<br /><br />The one chapter which must not be skipped is chapter 8, \\"Less and Less Wrong\\" (although the first nine pages --about the sports gambler-- are not essential).  Starting with \\"The Improbable Legacy of Thomas Bayes,\\" it's where Silver divulges the secret of his success as an oracle. Alas, it's also the least entertaining and most abstruse part of the book, and those of us who are mathematically challenged may suffer an epileptic reaction while trying to understand Bayes's theorem and its formula: &lt;&lt; xy divided by xy+z+[1-x] >>.<br /><br />(Uh . . . you wanna `splain that by me one mo' time, Kingfish?)<br /><br />Even more distressing is that Nate Silver demonstrates that, as with most people, my \\"frequentist\\" way of thinking mimics that of [[ASIN:0122575504 Sir R. A. Fisher]] (1890-1962), so I now must master this new syncopation and think like a Bayesian.  (I can imagine that those who are learned in the dark arts of higher math and probability theory must pity us non-quants who stumble over such basic and obvious concepts, but at least we're making an effort to understand such things by reading this book.)  Silver issues our marching orders: \\"The strategy requires one giant leap and then some small steps forward. The leapis into the Bayesian way of thinking . . .\\"<br /><br />The reason that I suspect that many people have failed to make it through The Signal and the Noise is that chapter 12 is a thorough examination of one of the most divisive of all issues here in our divided nation: Global Warming. About six weeks prior to this review, the righteously unbiased and angelically neutral PBS network broadcast a program in their Frontline series titled \\"Climate of Doubt,\\" which stated as fact that anyone who disputes or even expresses reservations over the most dire predictions of doom issued by the environmentalists must conform to most or all of these stereotypes:<br />§ Is in the pay of the oil companies<br />§ Is obviously a goon hired by owners of coal mines<br />§ Believes that Global Warming is insignificant because Jesus will return next Tuesday (as a guest on the Glenn Beck show)<br />§ Is certain that Barack >Hussein&lt; Obama was born in Kenya (or on Mars)<br />§ Circulates videos which prove that 9/11 was an \\"inside job\\"<br />§ Has a large cage in the yard housing pit bulls which fight at clandestine sporting events.<br />§ Is also a proponent of Creation Science<br />§ Has a lifetime membership at a hunting club in Montana where you can shoot tame animals that walk right up to you<br />§ Is grossly obese<br /><br />If anyone (anyone not fitting the above descriptions) had read as far as chapter 12, \\"A Climate of Healthy Skepticism,\\" there would be hundreds of one-star reviews here (posted by those who haven't read the book) denouncing Silver as a villain in the pay of the oil companies, the NRA, &c.  Even if Nate Silver's heresy becomes known only through word-of-mouth there will be more than the 317 one-star reviews (\\"Garbage,\\" \\"Rubbish\\") given to [[ASIN:0061782661 State of Fear]] by Michael Crichton, a book which posits roughly the same conclusion about Global Warming (although Crichton did not make the effort to be accurate that Silver does here) .<br /><br />The peril Silver faces is despite the fact that he handles warming-skeptic Scott Armstrong roughly, and in reference to Al Gore's risible [[ASIN:B000ME5B30 An Inconvenient Truth]], he timidly suggests that \\"Films like these are not necessarily a good representation of the scientific consensus,\\" Silver knows that, at any moment, the environmentalists, should they hear of his blasphemy, will come charging after him like a pack of enraged wolverines, so he's trying his best to be  circumspect.<br /><br />Despite Silver's soft-pedaling, this is still the most rational explanation of the Climate Change controversy, because Silver is not trying to sell you on anything. He's not raising any alarm about our impending doom, nor does he suggest that the entire issue is anti-capitalist malarkey cooked-up by the people Ayn Rand hated (you).  He simply presents the facts. Yes, the increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is causing average global temperatures to increase somewhat. No, that's not what caused the recent hurricane. (This last sentence will remain relevant, because there will always have been a recent hurricane.)<br /><br />So that's another essential chapter in the book, but to get the most out of it you must first read chapter 4 on weather forecasting.  There is a wealth of important information to be had here, but I still can't imagine all readers being interested in each of the various chapters. This is especially true because, although Silver thankfully avoids jargon and the pidgin English favored by economists, his writing tends to wander at times.  He's a good writer, but being a >great&lt; writer requires that one be focused and succinct.<br /><br />Nate Silver remains in my personal list of heroes (along with [[ASIN:0674062191 Richard Posner]] and Ralph Nader), but somehow, I had more enthusiasm for this book before reading it than while reading it.is into the Bayesian way of thinking . . .\\"<br /><br />The reason that I suspect that many people have failed to make it through The Signal and the Noise is that chapter 12 is a thorough examination of one of the most divisive of all issues here in our divided nation: Global Warming.

B008HK3QII|4.0|My second case. I did not like the added bulk of the book style case. This is just right. Protection. Easy on and off. Easy to pack.
142311339X|5.0|As with the original Greek Percy Jackson series, Mr. Riordan once again delivers all the excitement I've come to expect in the world of the demigods.  I absolutely loved it and would strongly recommend it!!!<br /><br />And while this book/series/world may appeal to teenagers, those of us with just a few more years (okay, a couple of decades more) are just as delightfully entertained!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|A refreshing vision of Sherlock and Watson. The stories are fresh, if not particularly challenging. Production values are excellent. Good show. Doyle might even approve.
1423140591|5.0|As with the original Greek Percy Jackson series, Mr. Riordan once again gives us ringside seats into the world of the demigods.  I was hooked from the outset!  I could say so much more about this book and the series, but I would hate to give anything away.<br /><br />I absolutely loved it and would strongly recommend the book, the series, the author!!!
B0039TD826|5.0|I don't have a lot of Rolling Stones albums but this one is a gem.  The recording is excellent and the music is classic.  Nothing like it being made in pop music today.
030758836X|4.0|I picked this up on a lightning deal whim since it was only 2.99, and read it over the course of 3 or so evenings.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm assuming you've read what the story's about on the product page, but basically: man's wife disappears, did he kill her or not?<br /><br />As the reviews make clear, there's a pretty big plot twist about a third of the way in the book, which is written in first person alternating with the husband (guilty?) and the wife (a diary leading to the day she went missing).<br /><br />You fall in love with the wife's stories as the husband becomes more despicable with each passage he makes, which is clearly the intent of the story's author. When the twist happens, you realize both parties are not exactly what they present the reader with at first, and there's a final twist in the story's final two sentences that's (as I read it at least) very subtle and seems to have many readers frustrated over it. I thought the last bit was what made the story a solid read, but I doubt I'll read it again (I rarely re-read novels).<br /><br />All that said, I feel 3 bucks was a fair price for this, and I think if you pay under 12 for the novel, it's worth it, but anything over that you may be left flustered and a little cheated of cash.<br /><br />All said, I think it's a good way to pass a few hours reading it and definitely not as bad as some reviewers seem to think.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|It is a bit of a quirky read.  Hard to stick with it in the beginning, however later I could not put it down.
1451620829|5.0|Peter details Kiss better than the other members have, and discusses the reunion era of the band more than it's been discussed by the others. Peter doesn't hold back on any of the members, including Ace. Peter gives credit to those who helped Kiss make it. Peter talks about his own bad side too. You probably won't like some members as much after reading this book. Like Ace's book, Peter barely mentions Eric Carr. Most of Peter's book is accurate, except he says Bob Kulick redid Ace's solos on Alive II, and that they did 3 nights at MSG in 1996, when they did 4 nights.
067960085X|4.0|I found \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" a desultory story with un-engaging characters. The whole thing - plot, character interaction, atmosphere - all seemed rather flat in my opinion. Perhaps it was the bohemian nature of the story - it just didn't do anything to me. I finished it because it was short, only over a hundred pages in my edition. Longer would have been prohibitive!<br /><br />However, there were three other short stories added. These were wonderful! They were \\"House of Flowers\\", A Diamond Guitar\\" and \\"A Christmas Memory\\" where you can taste the food! These had feeling, emotion and tension, altogether lacking in \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\". (These three short stories brought my rating up to four stars.)
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this sweet and funny story.  A definite for marrieds at any age.  The focus on sexuality/intimacy, though, and the frank talk around this made it entirely inappropriate for our younger kids generally allowed to watch PG-13.  We didn't expect they'd want to watch it, but also didn't expect we'd have to lower the volume so they couldn't hear it!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|It has been right up my wife's alley. It has been dark and disturbing. Thoroughly enjoying it. Well written, great cast.

B008QI6EHQ|5.0|Ok, I had written this big long review about the holocaust but I've just deleted it all. The book is an interesting perspective on a man who had an impact in the world.
0143038583|4.0|Food, food, food. If you eat food, then you better read this book. Easy to chew, a joy to digest.<br /><br />Michael Pollan's first book, the Omnivore's Dilemma talks about the four paradigms of food production, from industrial, pastoral (big-organic and self-sufficient) and personal.<br /><br />The book starts from the large producers of corn then goes down all they way to a hunter gatherer experience.<br /><br />I was engaged throughout the whole book as the topic about food is so personal. Something we hold and touch everyday, something we put in our mouths and resides in our bodies for hours. Nothing is more personal than food and yet we take it for granted.<br /><br />Starting with industrial agriculture, Michael walks us through a brief history of corn farming and how it has shaped the modern farms of America. How big corporations were able to control the corn production and how much money farmers lose for every yield of corn. How much corn has infiltrated our daily lives, from breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even from driving and the tools we use at the office. He shows how much corn has been a part of the modern world beyond it's intended use of being food.<br /><br />From industrialized agriculture, he moved towards a more vile scene of industrialized farming. A place where cows, pigs, chicken, and other animals are grown to serve the purpose of feeding a \\"higher creature\\". He visits several farms hoping that he'll be able to track the progress of the calf he bought as he wanted to follow it's journey from birth to plate. It proved to be a difficult task just like following a husk of corn from the field to the plate.<br /><br />Industrialized farming and agriculture has it's fair share of enemies from liberal environmentalists and the general public who has seen those scare videos from PETA showing them how animals in industrial farms are like prisoners in a concentration camp. One common complaint about the book is its lack of macro economic analysis of thewhole food industry. Sure, it's a great way to mask the book from being a capitalist view on food but there is a reason on why corn can grow so close to each other and why cows and chickens live in dire conditions to feed our insatiable appetite for food.<br /><br />The author achieved his goal in leaving a bad taste in my mouth upon reading the section on industrialized farming and agriculture. How we can enjoy out of season vegetables and meats from all over the world without batting an eyelash. How we can have meals that looks like and tastes like chicken and yet is made from corn. How we can afford to throw out totally edible corn to the sea just to balance out the over supply. His goal is for us to rethink where our food comes from and the sacrifices made for us to enjoy a single meal.<br /><br />The first section reminded me of the few weeks I was in the US, and how large the portions are and more importantly how much meat I consumed, even the salad tasted like meat. Compared to most of the meals I eat here in Asia, eating in States felt like a feast. Large portions, lots of condiments and lots of meat. Reading how they are produced made all the bad memories of all the weight I gained on these trips. No surprise on why USA is suffering from an obesity epidemic, I can't imagine having to eat enormous portions everyday.<br /><br />The pastoral section started by introducing us to organic farming, a relatively recent fad in the states which of course gets so much interest from the hipster/hippie folk, and how badly we fall for well written stories. He visits several organic farms and sees first hand how manipulated the meaning of organic has been. How farmers abuse the system of lax rules in the effort to pass off their products as organic. He visits several farms in California and see little difference between industrial CAFOs and the so called organic farms.<br /><br />I greatly enjoy books that open our minds on marketing gimmicks, especially about common misconceptions that somehow become common knowledge, one of which is the organic farming movement. It's clear that even though they are marked organic, the process, once seen, can hardly pass off to be organic. Crowded chickens, unnatural farming, and assembly line like processing just can't be called organic in it's pure essence. Luckily, I'm not a big sucker for organic products and I'm lucky enough to be living in Singapore where (hopefully) the animals and plants don't go through so much trouble that they have to grow out of unnatural circumstances. This does bring to light how we are easily fooled not just by the companies creating the products but by our ideal pictures of how farms are supposed to be run. Lush grassy knolls, chickens and cows running free across the fields, a happy family running the farm with their farm truck used to haul feeds to the barn, this is what we associate organic farming with, a beautiful farm operating just like in the books we used to read when we were young. Pollan shatters this notion and exposes us to the hidden truth.<br /><br />There is some hope to all this madness as he visits Joel Salatin's Polyface farm. Here he discovers how Polyface tries to maximize the energy of the sun by admitting that they are grass farmers. In essence, every farmer is a grass farmer as this is the first organism that harnesses the sun's energy, that then gets eaten by cows which then gets eaten by us. Salatin doesn't believe that cows and chickens should be trapped in a cage but rather, he grazes them in his huge farm. The cows eat grass then move around the farm with the chickens a day behind the cows which then feeds on the cowpies and other by-products of the cow, as was designed by nature. It's a sight to behold as Polyface has gotten down what farming is as to how the animals were designed to live. Here's a short clip from USATODAY to give you a better idea. Pollan spends a week helping out at Salatin's farm to understand how he can sustain suchfarming methods in our industrialized world. In the end, after trying their products, the chickens tastes more \\"chickeney\\" and the eggs more \\"eggy\\".<br /><br />Polyface is a great counter example of how our race for profits has made us alter even the natural tendencies of animals so that we can maximize yield. Salatin acknowledges the limits of nature and his farm runs along with how the animals interact with nature and other animals and plants. He has accepted the fact that the environment is not mono-specie, something that large farms do, but rather animals interact with other animals. Cows don't just eat one species of grass. Chickens don't eat just one type of feed. Cows graze on their own and eat grass upon their discretion. Chickens eat after the cows have trimmed the grass. This is nature at its best and that interaction is something that industrialized farms can't mimic or don't even bother about. Their cramped cows and their manufactured feeds will produce beef, but is it worth all the toxic byproducts, the diseases contracted by the animals due to their environment? I haven't seen a large farm to be able to pass judgement but just using logic one can discern which type of farming is better. But again, this is where Omnivore's Dilemna fails. The macro economic benefits of feeding a nation is something that Polyface can't tackle. Their costs are higher and their yields are lower compared to industrial farms. Salatin and Pollan makes a convincing argument that the face value of food produced by CAFOs are cheaper, yet we pay for it through other means like damage to our health and the environment, something that is very hard to quantify, unlike a price of a dozen eggs.<br /><br />The final part of the book tells how humans have lived before industrialization and farming, through hunting and gathering. Here, he learns how to hunt wild pigs and gather wild mushrooms through the forests of California. It's quite a fascinating part of the book as he gets to meetpeople who hunt for fun, while other who hunt and gather for profit. His goal at the end of his expedition is to create a meal from ingredients that he has harvested himself. From the fowl, to the mushrooms and other ingredients.<br /><br />Here, he shot his first gun with mix feelings. He hesitated gathering mushrooms as he is unsure if it was the \\"safe kind\\". He went through a lot of introspection especially when he was hunting as it was his first time taking a life. The ethical hunting also became an issue with his guides giving good explanations on why they continue to hunt.<br /><br />This section had an air of 'hipsterness' for me. It didn't seem as right as sustainable farming as most of the hunters are doing it for game or to get a better tasting patte. I do believe that there are pros to hunting and most of the hunters are not invading any territory or over hunting but the thought that this game is used to feed those with better palates is just alien to me. Coming from a third world country where food is scarce, every morsel of food is sacred and is valued. It doesn't mean that we don't appreciate good food, it just means that there is not enough for everybody and one has to share, else feel the guilt of eating expensive meals while a family outside can barely feed themselves (socialist in me talking).<br /><br />He concluded the book by sharing a meal he created from scratch with his friends. With the pork and wild mushrooms he gathered, pasta he kneaded himself and other more \\"natural\\" ingredients. He analyses the whole food industry, through the corn fields and cattle farms, the grazing cattle in Salatin's farm and wild pigs of California. He doesn't struggle to realize how much we have altered the environment in an effort to produce more and more food beyond our needs. How we have destroyed nature in order to grow animals beyond their natural environment. How we have created products that the main ingredients are beyond recognition. His analysis again gets you think of what you eat and where it comes from.<br /><br />An easy read and a great eye opener for something very personal, The Omnivore's Dilemma is something you should chew slowly else you might spit it out.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I've tried half a dozen free solitaire programs, but this one has the best looking cards.  Large and clear, easy to play with just tapping your cards instead of having to drag them.  But the ads, oh man, the ads. Between EVERY game you get a very distracting ad pop up that you have to click on &#34;No thanks&#34; or &#34;Skip&#34; with no way (that I can see) to disable these by purchasing the game.  I'd pay a buck or two to get a &#34;full&#34; registered version without the ads, if one were available.

B001ECE6C6|5.0|Pat Metheny and Anna Maria Jopek's music on this CD creates many moods and feelings. I am left with a feeling of peace and happiness after listening to this CD.(ethereal.in some cases). I hear the music in my head during the day or night, I play it daily.  It's different in a great way than any other of his CDs. I  played it for my Polish best friend and she was mesmerized by it. She will be buying it<br />I applaud all that were involved in the creation of this CD and recommend it highly.
B002ZG980U|2.0|The reality is that this movie just wasn't very good.  In particular, the action scenes were for the most part a real mess.  Case in point the attack on the fort, a clear sign of a director with no clue.  The zero g scenes were interesting though.  The story itself was a mess and the cinematography was nothing special.  The acting was okay, but nothing exciting.  The movie was best described as a watse of time (not to mention all the money spend making it).  Oh yeah, and the pimple forehead woman was very distracting.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|If you're a true redneck you will love this movie. There is a lot of gunfights and violence in this movie. However, it sheds some very dramatic and entertaining drama on the light of prohibition and the events that occurred during that time.

B004GVUPFE|5.0|This game is fun, challenging, and attractive. There is no timer which is great.  A nice touch is that the hints give you the option of more help or to take it from there. I don't particularly care for how the moves are counted, but hey, that's minor stuff. It also could be considered an additional challenge.
034580404X|5.0|I just finished #1 and couldn't put it down.  My daughters told me they loved it, but I thought I'm too old for that!  Not so - at least so far.  I love the characters and will keep reading as long as there is a chance for a happy ending.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The thing that is great about this show is not only the fantastic make up effects of the Zombies, but also the story line and the excellent character developement. The acting is good , the story is good......what more could you want from a Zombie show?

B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Entertaining.  I found the characters to be very 2 dimensional, but that matches the books.  I have the feeling they were going for more of the soap opera angle than the character/drama angle.

1400067820|1.0|Humans, fragile or not, are differentiated from other robust creatures via tool use. We spend our days designing, using, selling, training in tools, or all/some of the above. So, to help you decide on whether to spend $16 of your hard earned money on this Philobabble (vs Psychobabble): are there really any tools here that can be used?<br /><br />Nope. The book is really just railing against a whole host of \\"targets\\" with nothing useful at all as a take away. I can write a book about business weakness indicators, which doesn't mean I can run a business, but at least that topic would provide usable ratios. \\"Convexity\\" and antifragility are only valuable as criticism of other techinques for surfing secular or shorter cycles. HOW you hit the trend right is about real tools-- you get none here. To say \\"it's not good to be behind the trend or before it, you need to meet it just right\\" is an older form of antifragile's restated curve surfing, and the older form was and is way more useful.<br /><br />If you MUST spend $16, get Bluttman's excellent [[ASIN:047056816X Excel Formulas and Functions For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))]]. It has numerous real tools for analyzing real life concavity and convexity. Plus, it doesn't require the creation of yet another deification neologism about fractals. The math in antifragile's appendix is juvenile, and misapplies stats to nonlinearity-- a space much more amenable to ODE's. If you really want an outstanding text on nonlinearity, with robust, juried math, try Steeb's [[ASIN:9812818537 Nonlinear Workbook: Chaos, Fractals, Cellular Automata, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Gene Expression]] -- requires advanced math skills, but is filled with useful tools, including from the much more nonlinear-relevant work in Dynamic Systems.<br /><br />I have no relationship with any of the above books or authors or the currently reviewed text. Comments are solely for the good of readers and an attempt to save the expense of prospective buyers who might assume there are any tools of value in this volume, which basically starts and ends with words.buyers who might assume there are any tools of value in this volume, which basically starts and ends with words.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!! This is one of those very, very, special books, that does not leave you! It changes your thoughts on particular things forever! I am a dog lover, but you need not be. This book made me laugh and absolutely sob while reading. Garth Stein knows how to grab and pull you in, he tugs on your heartstrings as if these characters are our own family members. He writes so intense and beautifully. I had crystal clear images of his characters brought to my mind from the very first pages. I lay in bed at night and still grieve for the losses that occur in his story. I highly recommend this book! In fact I told my best friends and avid readers to make this book next on their list! I will now be searching out the other books written by the great Garth Stein!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|We love this show... interesting and fun with good casting as well.  Definitely an adult show and not for young kids.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Almost a decade after the last film, Men In Black 3 hit the big screen in May of this year. It was a movie I was excited about, but one that I missed when it was in theaters. Well I watched it last night and I must say this is definitely deserving of the MIB title.<br /><br />Because there was such a huge gap between films I was a little worried at how this entry would turn out, and as the movie started some of those worries came to life. The worst thing about M.I.B. 3 is that it starts off slow and in the middle it can get a little slow. That and the main villain Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) isn't really anything to brag about. I found his character to be pretty boring and, for me, Clement overacted the part. He tried too hard to make him feel intimidating but in the end it was just annoying.<br /><br />What this movie does well is have an amazing story, interesting characters, and some great acting, aside from Clement. At times the story can feel like it's going all over the place, but once you reach the end the writers did a phenomenal job at tying everything together. Which leaves us with probably the deepest story we've seen from this series. Also, it gives us a little insight on just how far K and J go back.<br /><br />I want to give major props to Josh Brolin who played Young Agent K. This man... just wow! He did a fantastic job at replicating Tommy Lee Jones' facial expressions, tone of voice, everything. I wasn't expecting to love his performance because from the trailers I wasn't sure how I was going to like the idea of a Young K, but they chose the perfect man for the job. Which leads me to my next comment. This isn't really a complaint as much as it is an observation, but Tommy Lee Jones looks terrible. The man is not aging well and it shows. It made me kind of sad when I was watching this because I love TLJ, but I'll get off that before this becomes depressing.<br /><br />Finally, Will Smith's performance was fatastic. He may make some iffy decisions regarding roles in other films, but he never fails to come through with this series. He's funny, he's interesting, he has a lot of energy, and he hasn't lost his step as J. That was one of the most important things, for me, regarding this film. I wanted Smith to still feel like J. One question though: Will, where's your song on the soundtrack? I was really looking forward to another M.I.B. song from Will, but sadly there was none.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - In short, this film is a joy to watch. If you're a fan of this series then I would definitely recommend watching this. If you're a fan of sci-fi films then I would recommend watching this. Lastly, if you're looking for an entertaining movie then, you guessed it, watch this. It may get a little slow at times, and the main villain can be a little boring, but in the end it's still an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Last minute edit: I wanted to give credit to Michael Stuhlbarg who played Griffin in this, but I forgot. I'll just say that Michael did a fantastic job and Griffin's character was amazing. He probably wound up becoming my new favorite character in this series even though there's a good possibility we won't see him in any future films.
B008X8RSTM|1.0|The app won't start nine times out of ten tries on the Google Nexus 7. The one in ten times it starts and doesn't shut down on its own, can't bring up any of the maps I downloaded.  Not recommended.
B00122RFOO|5.0|This download, does just what i expected it to do.  easy to down load and easy to use. i like this product.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|a little glitchy for Kindle Fire and a little easy but great if you hate being forced to look at walkthroughs. game length is good and things do get more complicated as you progress. love true point and click games!
B000UOOT1W|5.0|This CD, does just what i expected it to do.  easy to get and easy to use. i like this product.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|It was great. It was like HD and very intense. They made a great story line and great graphics. The movie is very, very creative.
B0080K3G4O|3.0|Good Book.  Some good ideas.  Easy read. Glad I bought it on Kindle.  Would recommend to some of my friends.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great movie and a clean, brand new disc. When I first played it, there was no freezes or sudden skips. Great disc and movie.
1419707671|5.0|My nephew wanted these books to complete his set of Wimpy Kid books. So he was really happy with the gift.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Another very long Batman movie but very good and in keeping with the theme used from other Batman movies.  Just watch it and judge for yourselves, and don't rely on another person's taste or review.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It is a very entertaining book! It is not just erotic but also a very valid account of a young girl's first love and all the confusing feelings that come with it.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|The worst of Hollywood............so very stupid and the acting is Z rate........boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|This is based on a true story and is a story of true loyalty - although maybe not the way we would think it should be expressed.
B009O2XY12|4.0|fun game can be a challenge and a great time filler while waiting for a appointment or just looking for a quick game
B004SUDQE0|5.0|I watch this film over and over as it is a charming, heart-warrming story.  It is quirky (although based on a true story) and very sweet (but not cloying).  The pride of being the first &#34;mountain&#34; in Wales permeates the town and their efforts to mantain this honor go from the ridiculous to the sublime.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a really super book.  As always, every book that Vince Flynn writes is a big winner in my book!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game. We have tons of fun plying with this game. It looks incredible on our new Kindle Fire HD.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham once again has hit it way out of the ballpark.  I have every single book the man has ever written
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a great book, disappointed in the ending but I understand why it ended that way. There were some grammar errors that detracted from the book. All in all, great book.
B0097UO87U|5.0|I think he did a great job with the music he chose. I was not a huge fan of If I Loved you until I heard him sing it. His rendition of Smile and Beyond the Sea is really great. Thank you for gracing us with your musical style again Mr. Lynne!
B0032FPVKE|4.0|After looking a number of different types of camcorder bags I opted for this one. The bag is excellent in terms of built quality and a value for money. The only place of improvement I found is the space. To me it should be little bit more spacious. I use to keep camcorder's battery unattached while it is not in operation so need to put it separately in the bag. Also, I need to put the charger in the same bag. I think that it's design may be refined to accommodate these things properly while maintaining the same compact shape.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so inspired by all the wonderful recipes, crafts, and gardening ideas. And I just love the photography of nature and animals.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was good, do not get me wrong, just not as good s I expected.  It would have been better if Quinn Rucker and his brothers had chased him all over the country trying to kill him. A good book, just not up to Grishams standards.
B000SW4DXK|3.0|For many, the original, starring Edmund Gwen and Natalie Wood, is the ONLY version.  I see their point.  But this remake is no total waste of time.  I found it quite entertaining.  It's best points are Mara Wilson's Susan and Sir Richard Attenborough in the central role.  If he's not the real Santa Claus, he ought to be.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book was amazing..couldn't put it down but boy this I cry at the end. Have told all my friends to read this,
B009OA57MI|1.0|My Kindle Fire crashed twice while my grandson was playing this game.  I removed it quickly and  have had no problems since
B006O7XOOW|3.0|Four AA batteries, and a about 15 minutes in assembly (break out the tool kit -  we had to use some force to get the battery cover off) we had this behemoth of a toy up and running.<br /><br />Combined with being pretty big, and having limited functions - I'm apprehensive to recommend it.  I could see where it would be awesome in a baby day-care type center.  Somewhere with space and a multitude of little minds each taking their turn watching the balls fall down the sides and then disappear to the corners of the room.<br /><br />My daughter could not have cared less about the balls.  She just wants to dance to the music.  It does play a pretty upbeat short little clip, and she LOVES it.<br /><br />The concept is basic, the volcano function leaves a bit to be desired (you place the balls on top, spin the little wheel, music starts and pushes the balls up they then tumble down the sides) and the constant search for the \\"lava balls\\" annoying.  My two cats, however, seem thoroughly entertained. They seem to love the entire display - including chasing the runaway balls into the alternate universe where i imagine there is a ton of missing (baby) socks and hair-ties, but unable to be found or seen by adults.<br /><br />If you have multiple children, and extra space - this may provide some fun entertainment.  However, for my singleton (16 months) she was relatively unimpressed after about 5 minutes making this a space-hogging brightly colored decoration.  She does get pretty excited when she remembers it plays a sweet beat that she can twirl to, so I guess thats something.<br /><br />All in all, I think it gets turned on - by her or on accident - once every few days, becomes a hit for a couple minutes, then lays dormant and forgotten once again.<br /><br />As a cat toy.... A+
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Just as good as his first novels.  Surprise ending always gets me.  His &#34;word pictures&#34; make each page fun.  Try it.
B00973DDN2|5.0|Really good CD, it just grows on you each time you hear it.  Diverse styles across each of the songs.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love Spider Solitaire, and this a really good mobile version. I have a Samsung Vibrant and Samsung Tab 2 that I downloaded it to. Great graphics, and I like the setting options.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I was listening to NPR and they were interviewing this interesting man. Then he played a song from his current album and I knew I had to look him up and order it. I suggest you do the same.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|He didn't write 'em but they are &#34;Jeff Lynne&#34; through and through to ear candy perfection!!  The only 2 songs I'd heard before I've never liked...  Until now!  The others are just new to me; even though they date back half a century.  They sound wonderful! :)
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A story of struggle and redemption in the lives of women who are abused and controlled by their husbands in a tyrannical culture.  I read the book in 24 hours because it was so intense.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Jeff Lynne has been my musical hero since 1978.  So YES!  I'm very pleased to have some of his hits re-recorded by him alone!  He's &#34;the&#34; studio wizard and the best producer in the world for a reason.  Listen to these versions in the headphones or as loud as possible!!  Amazing :)
1434427986|5.0|The same classic almost everyone has read, except the person I bought it as a gift for.  I'm sure he will feel the same.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|This was a very heartfelt movie. My family and I enjoyed this one. It can drag a little at first but there's something that makes you keep watching.
B001XVD21Y|5.0|Incredible movie. Gripping and a strong solid cast. You wont know what hit you. The movie is very unpredictable. Its a must see.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great movie. Humor throughout, stunning visuals, an excellent cast and amazing director, and an interesting, if slightly contrived, story add up to a brilliant movie and a perfect new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I purchased the 4-disc combo, so this review is for that version.<br /><br />3D<br />This is by far the best done 3D graphics I've seen on a Blu-ray movie so far. Even the menus have incredible depth. Unfortunately, the price seems to have gone up in line with other 3D movies; on release it was down around $18 on Amazon, miraculously.<br /><br />Packaging<br />The typical Blu-ray case comes wrapped in a cardboard sleeve with a thick, holographic cover image of the Avengers, plus Nick Fury, looking intimidating on the streets of New York as you can see in the product image. The hologram is pretty nice; it shows a good bit of depth but has very limited range before it repeats. It's pretty much the same image inside the sleeve minus the hologram. Inside, the typical ad leaflets sit on the left along with your code to unlock a digital copy (haven't redeemed it yet, but it says it works with iTunes and Windows Media Player, so it doesn't seem to be Ultraviolet which is nice), a digital music album (see below for tracks), a free digital comic book *offer* (have to be registered at Marvel.com), and a free* movie poster ($3.59 shipping and processing). Another comment mentions having difficulty with the digital copy and downloading the tracks in different regions, so be careful with that if you're interested in those. Rather than have a plastic middle insert with two discs attached to it, both sides of the case have extra deep CD slots that hold two discs each. If you press down on the center plastic mechanism hard enough, the discs come out easily without the death grip some cases seem to have on discs.<br /><br />Discs<br />The four discs consist of one Blu-ray 3D copy, one Blu-ray copy, one DVD copy, and one standard definition digital copy. The DVD and Blu-ray discs have several skippable previews before you get to the main menu; I don't think the Blu-ray 3D copy had previews.<br /><br />Special features<br />You can find lists of special features in several places, so I won't list them all. The special features vary by disc. The Blu-ray 3D disc has no special features, the DVD only has commentary by Joss Whedon and Assembling the Ultimate Team special features, and the normal Blu-ray disc has all of them. The deleted and extended scenes are interesting if you enjoy those, but my two personal favorite special features were the gag real and the &#34;Marvel One-Shot: Item 47&#34; digital short. The gag real was funny, though certainly not the best I've seen. A couple scenes near the end of the real are pretty hilarious, though. The Marvel One-Shot is a short film (11:20) about a couple finding one of the pieces of alien technology used by the Chitauri and getting it to work. It was a humorous extra piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe starring Lizzy Caplan (Party Down, True Blood, Cloverfield, New Girl) and Jesse Bradford (Hackers, Swimfan, Guys With Kids) with Maximiliano Hernández and Titus Welliver.<br /><br />Digital album tracks<br />1. Soundgarden - Live to Rise<br />2. Shinedown - I'm Alive<br />3. Rise Against - Dirt and Roses<br />4. Papa Roach - Even If I Could<br />5. Black Veil Brides - Unbroken<br />6. Scott Weiland - Breathe<br />7. Redlight King - Comeback<br />8. Bush - Into the Blue<br />9. Evanescence - A New Way To Bleed (Photek Remix)<br />10. PusherJones - Count Me Out<br />11. Buckcherry - Wherever I Go<br />12. Five Finger Death Punch - From Out Of Nowhere<br />13. Cherri Bomb - Shake the Ground<br /><br />Overall, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone, especially those looking for a quality 3D movie to show off a 3D TV. Since this was $18ish at release, I was really hoping this would be the one to stop the annoying $30+ 3D Blu-ray trend; alas, it's not. If you're lookingfor one 3D movie to actually spend the $30 on, though, this one would be an excellent choice.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|I am proud to have this album as my the first ever vinyl. Music is simply great. I just listen to it almost every night. Soothing
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This story is based on the day JFK was assassinated. Since I lived through the ordeal, I could really relate to the events. It's a long read, and my first Stephen King novel. Quite a page-turner (even on my Kindle!). I hated to have it end! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I always like the Lee Childs books.  Jack Reacher is one of my favourites.  The Killing floor is fast moving in her usual style
030758836X|4.0|This story was very intriguing - held your interest and the reader can't wait to find out how it ends. Although, I did not enjoy reading all the &#34;potty&#34; language (unnecesary), especially the dialogue of the female, and I wasn't happy with the ending, it is a good read!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Excellent book. It evoked so many emotions in me. Beautifully written and I was surprised with every turn if the page. Nothing was predictable. I will look out for more  books written  by Alice sebold.
B00A2XU9IS|2.0|very hard to figure out what to do with each new day. Some days have great animation, other days not so good.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This  book as with all of Nelson Demilles book is a pleasure to read. If you have not read anything by him  - you need to!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It is well written, but it is disjointed, what appears to be a new story line, completely removed from the story up to that point.  It does eventually, after a long &#34;other story&#34;, join up again.  Unnecessarily repetitive activity.
B001DJLCPO|5.0|Despite being written and produced by the studio after the death of Jim Henson, this movie is still great. Creepy, interesting, visually fantastic - following in the footsteps of Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. Critics have given mixed reviews, but all agree that the visuals are praiseworthy, even if not all are interested in the teenage angst of the protagonist. Watch worthy.
0345803493|5.0|Very happy with the quick service and the used book &#34; fifty shades darker&#34;. The used book looked new to me. Thanks
B002FQOI0A|4.0|Im Haylee Fain a sixth grader in NC and my teacher is making us read this we were all like uuggghhh and then we started to read it indepently and discovered we love this book . I give it a four star rate because all though we love it and can connect with the story some how ....... Its a little dull and then interesting . Like a movie . I am a indepent twelve year old that poves to read books . Thank you and God Bless !!!
B0041KVWI4|4.0|Ok so I have to give this a moderate review. The album had visible scuff marks and is very noisy. It does sound great...the hype raised my expectations on the sound quality I was getting.  Unfortunately the new vinyl suffers from insane surface noise. Unlike my original remasted vinyl 20 years ago on thinner vinyl.  The Packaging is beautiful. Quality control problems seem to be a big issue on these releases.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This had a crazy ending and kept me interested the entire book. I can't wait to read the next one.
B009F1ZYQK|5.0|Ok...so I was worried about the Picture Disc versions coming out. In comparison to my \\"like new\\" original vinyls these are superior in every way. They are not as noisy as other famous bands releases...I have 4 and I hear no massive pops... there is surface noise but that seems to be there no matter what in the new 180gram releases everywhere. Ultimately I loved this package and would say it is a must have for any Maiden fan.  Up the Irons!
B004N6369Y|5.0|Hotel Vendome<br />Danielle Steel did not let me down. Kept me reading til the end.<br />Can't want for more to come
B0041KVYIW|5.0|Ok ... so I purchased this vinyl at my local record store. The pressing was beautiful. Its sound was majestic as advertised. Viewing the album there were no visible scuff marks from the factory like my versions of magical mystery tour and Sgt Peppers. Just awesome.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing. This book has opened my eyes and opened my world. This book has summed these past few months up for me, in some ways more than others. Brilliant. Fantastic. There is no greater feeling for this book, nor no better adjective.
B0041KVV8U|5.0|I purchased this Vinyl at a local record store. This release is noisy but lacked any visible scuff marks on the vinyl. I am not sure if the Record Company is doing us a favor by the increased \\"loudness\\" of these pressings...compared to prior vinyls with a thinner thickness and lesser \\"loudness\\" from 20 years ago..which on my system are by far less noisy. Again the Hype of these releases make me much more critical of them than I would be of other new pressings. Example: the Pink Floyd new vinyl releases left me with no expectations and they sound better....in my opinion.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|My 4 and 6 year old boys love this movie. It is funny and sweet, and we all enjoy watching it together.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|This is the best TV series I've seen since The Sopranos.  The acting is wonderful. The story line is interesting.  I can't wait to watch Season 2.
B00004T1C8|4.0|I think this tunnel will be really neat to add to our train table for my sons Christmas gift. Although it arrived MUCH smaller than we had anticipated, it still appears to be well made and I think my son will still get a kick out of using it.
B0062P3392|5.0|Killer Elite is based on the 1991 book The Feather Men by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, which is suppose to be based on true events that took place in the 1980s. Jason Statham plays Danny Bryce who comes out of retirement to help save his old friend Hunter (played by Robert De Niro). In order to save him, Danny must put together an elite team to help assassinate three ex-SAS agents.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Jason Statham movies, but his more recent outings have been on cruise control with thin plots. Killer Elite has a tight, well written script with great acting and action. I bought the movie for under five dollars at a Black Friday Sale a few weeks ago and I'm more than pleased with the movie as it has everything an action fan would want.
B00785P2QC|1.0|This game is a fun way to kill some time... until you realize how much money you'll spend to keep playing. You need investment points to get most of the buildings and if you wait for the natural progression of the game earn them it'll be days before you can complete one building. You're supposed to be able to post achievements to Facebook to earn them but when I try to connect to FB I just get an error message. To top it off, the points I do earn don't always load. So I'm supposed to drop $3 a building? No, thanks.
B008R14YBK|5.0|It seems like every teen star of a Disney series will eventually bring out an album, such as Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, Ashley Tisdale, Miley Cyrus, and others. Some have had a mild success at a singing career and others have bombed.<br /><br />Now Bridget Mendler of Disney's Good Luck Charlie has released her debut album. One would think she would face the marketing curse of the other ex-Disney stars/singers, but unlike the others, Bridget actually co-wrote all twelve songs.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Disney's Good Luck Charlie every since it began airing in 2010 as it reminds me of the old TGIF sitcoms. I was aware that Bridget Mendler, who plays Teddy Duncan, was releasing an album, but I just happened to stumble upon it yesterday for ten dollars. I was having a bad day and listening to music always cheers me up, therefore I bought the Hello My Name is...Bridget Mendler.<br /><br />The songs are your typical pop/dance music, but with catchy lyrics and Bridget's amazing vocals. My favorites from the album are Ready or Not; All I See Is Gold; Love Will Tell Us Where To Go; Rocks At My Window; 5:15; and Hold On For Dear Love.<br /><br />Overall, I more than enjoyed the album and I recommend it to others.<br /><br />The Complete Track List:<br /><br />1. Ready or Not (3:20)<br />2. Forgot to Laugh (3:09)<br />3. Top of the World (3:28)<br />4. Hurricane (4:04)<br />5. City Lights (4:00)<br />6. All I See is Gold (2:54)<br />7. The Fall Song (3:38)<br />8. Love Will Tell Us Where To Go (3:22)<br />9. Blonde (3:08)<br />10. Rocks At My Window (3:12)<br />11. 5:15 (3:56)<br />12. Hold On For Dear Love (4:00)
B000YAG00A|1.0|The film is excellent, the \\"Deluxe Widescreen Edition\\" DVD (the non-Blu-Ray version) is not. I purchased the first copy and it skipped, froze, and would not play the end sections of the bootcamp sequence. Seller sent me another copy and it did the same thing. Problem occurs on two separate DVD players.<br /><br />Another customer wrote a 1 star review in June 2012 detailing the same problem & experience. Likely the manufacturing run of these DVD discs is faulty. And most or all of the discs available at Amazon sellers will have this problem.<br /><br />If you buy the Deluxe Widescreen Edition (non-Blu-Ray) and it freezes/skips/etc. save your time and money and return it for a refund. Hopefully in a year or two the sellers will have returned all the mis-manufactured discs and a new printing will have occured.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Well done series based on the many, many Sherlock Holmes resurrection variants which have been done over the years, both written and on screen.
B0020M99LC|5.0|We didn't really care for this film - too much time in the casino and we didn't know what was going on.  Not your usual Bond flick and I didn't care for Mr. Craig.<br /><br />Having said that - they seem to have revamped 007 and gone back to more classic Bond in SkyFall - and we thoroughly enjoyed it - especially at the theater -<br />The title were great (like they used to be when Bass did them), the music was great, the Bond girls were there, the special effects were awesome, and Mr. Craig wasn't quite as 'street' as in Casino Royale - though not your typical Bond - he did do a great job in SkyFall -<br />All in all a successful flick!
B001JAFYFG|5.0|1 of my top 5 Movies - Looks better and clearer and was more fun to watch !!<br />The price was right and I just love this movie - A must have !
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once again we see Michael Connelly's mastery of detail in fiction smoothly interwoven with the reality of historical events of which we are all familiar. In this book he uses his prize-winning expertise and intimate knowledge of the LA riots which followed the acquittal of the police involved with the Rodney King beating as the backdrop for a cold case murder to challenge Detective Bosch. The twists and turns of this story seem to make the Kindle pages fly off the screen - you won't be able to let your Kindle sleep until you've finished.
B005K15XR4|5.0|Over the years I have composed this kind of choral / orchestra arrangements in my head but never &#34;heard&#34; them until now. If you are perchance someone who bought the soundtracks from the movies &#34;Gladiator&#34; and &#34;Lord of the The Rings&#34; (with a nod to Ennio Morricone in one piece) and enjoyed listening to them more than once, I suspect you'll love this CD.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|I hate this movie and the first one, but the guys in my life like it, so I got it for them for Christmas.  Believe me, though, it was DEFINITELY not by choice.  It's just not my type of movie.
B005R473G8|4.0|Ce roman agreable a lire et pas du tout rebarbatif nous replonge dans le Paris du tournant du 19me et 20me siecles dans lequel un jeune homme fort ambitieux et sans scrupule mais egalement sans le sou et sans connections decouvre le pouvoir de son charme sur les dames pour arriver a ses reves de fortune et reconnaissance sociale.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I never heard of the Lorax until this movie came out in theaters, but I love it!  It's definitely worth the purchase!  It's very inspirational and has great voices!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|If your a Who fan then you know what it is all about.  Daleks, Cybermen and various odd and tasty creatures.  A must for any Whovian collection.  BBC....  more please.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|That is the line that caught my attention. I heard this song over Christmas holiday and fell in live with it and the entire album. It was my Christmas gift to myself (I liked it that much)
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|this movie was very entertaining and we really like it, it is kind of slow but you will like it
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|When I listen to this CD, I get tears in my eyes because you can feel her emotions in her singing.
B000HL09MG|3.0|I think my favorite part is actually the beautiful artwork that is on the walls in the N.Y. apartment by the couple played by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Or the excitement and wonder that there really could be parties like that. I mean seriously, a 50 person costume-orgy thrown by the ultra-wealthy, social elite in a 50 million dollar mansion in up-state New York? Holy S. This film is incredibly erotic so don't watch it with your family unless you're totally insane.
0399536108|1.0|I was always interested in travel and alternative ways to live life which is why I started to follow Chris G'S blog awhile back. However,many people I know live a truly unconventional life. There is nothing about him that appears unconventional or truly non-conformist. Does having a goal of traveling to all the countries in the world sound non-conformist? Who the hell cares? Is this supposed to be some enlightened path of living or just a narcissistic vision of personal grandeur which has no intrinsic value? I believe it to be the later.<br /><br />What I see in his writings of books and blog are nothing more than pure unadulterated horse manure! From what I see in his informational products he is nothing more than a cheap hack. He reads someone else's material and rewrites and repackages it as something original. Just keep putting out more crap and sooner or later something will stick to the wall. This is pop culture garbage at its worst.<br /><br />One of the atrocities of the internet is the fact that anyone can achieve so-called leadership/guru/know-it-all status fairly quickly without any authenticity or life experiences. His audience is geared for the younger generation who are lost and trying to find themselves and find where they fit into society, or just lazy kids who don't want to work for a living. The problem I see is that he comes to them as their pied piper, leading them down a nefarious path with visions of grandeur if they do things his way.<br /><br />This self-appointed guru is playing the old confidence game of giving his pricey advice through the sale of his products on the internet. Its been done for ages. You name the niche, and there is always the seller who supposedly has all the answers.<br /><br />The con-man out in front making a fortune selling tons of \\"how to get rich,\\" \\"how to live on your terms\\",\\"how to live a non-comformist lifestyle\\", \\"how to\\".....I think you get the point. Then, some of the followers/army/tribe break away from the pack and become more self-appointed gurus themselves regurgitating the same  old \\"how-to\\" information to sell to another generation, army, tribe, bla, bla bla, to the blind followers.<br /><br />It becomes a never-ending daisy chain of petty con-men and blind sheep following their anointed ONE regurgitating the same info over and over again. Is it really any surprise that most people see a cheap rehash of Tim Ferris here? Other than the style and use of words there is really little difference.<br /><br />The problem is you buy it because you Honestly want to find out how you can live a happy, constructive life on your own terms.<br /><br />Once I saw where his blog was going I opted out immediately. His \\"products\\" are being bought by the gullible followers who need a \\"leader\\" in their life. He even has a monthly membership site for frequent flyers. Why would anyone pay for this advice when all you have to do is search by yourself on the internet? And I believe most people on his site probably spend  a lot of time on the internet anyway. If you really feel you need assistance with frequent flyer programs, just go to \\"thepointsguy.com. His site is much more valuable and concise, and besides that its free.<br /><br />If you think my comments are too cynical, perhaps they are, but I think most of the \\"followers\\" need to become more aware.

B009POCG2C|4.0|Clint Eastwood plays an old talent scout for the Atlanta Braves. He has failing eyesight and doesn't have a computer. He has a strained relationship with his successful daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) who is a workaholic and about to be offered a partnership in a law firm.<br /><br />Clint's latest task is to scout Bo Gentry, a slugger from North Carolina. At the request of her dad's associate (John Goodman) Mickey torpedoes her chance at being a partner to be the eyes for a father, who is not exactly grateful for the help, yet uses her talents. While away, she meets a young scout for the Red Sox (Justin Timberlake).<br /><br />The movie is enjoyable as Clint plays a man perhaps too much like himself. Amy Adams was magnificent as the shunned daughter in what amounted to an improbable film. The movie spends time to develop character for a plot that lacks the action associated with Eastwood films. A heart warming film for Eastwood fans. Worthy of a view and might make for a decent date night film. Border line chick flick.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb. Some spicy language. No sex or nudity.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|I've had my fill of Christmas and it's only the ninth of December!<br /><br />The reason is after years of promising myself, I finally read Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol. And my book club selection was A Christmas Story: The Book That Inspired the Hilarious Classic Film by Jean Shepard. The first created our modern Christmas. The second, well, the second was the basis for a gag-filled, funny movie. Both are touchstones of modern, American Christmases<br /><br />I'm not a Dickens fan but in reading these two short works almost simultaneously, I was surprised by one thing: even though I'm separated from Dickens by the Atlantic and one-hundred and seventy years and unfamiliarity with the Victorian world and a familiarity with the the settings -- if not the times --- of Shepherd's stories, I so much more preferred Dickens to Shepherd.<br /><br />I've given some thought to this. It's not like I'm was surprised by the narrative. They're pretty much what I've seen on the TV for decades. It's not that I knew that after Jean Shepherd divorced his second wife, he completely ignored his under seven son and daughter he'd had with her for the rest of his life. Dickens' wasn't a great husband or father either. (Then again, he at least didn't publicly deny their existence and did support his children.)<br /><br />I finally realized why I liked Scrooge's story over Ralphie's. It's that Dickens is Charles freakin' Dickens and Shepherd is, well, Jean Shepherd.<br /><br />Dickens can be \\"a vein of saccharine sentimentalism\\", true. But it is called A Christmas Carol. People are wanting saccharine sentimentalism. Ayway, it is leavened with rather dark passages that offer great balance. In fact, there's one scene that Dicken's writes that I've never seen touched on the the many films. It's part of the tour that the Second Ghost gives Scrooge.<br /><br />\\"Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remember those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\\"<br /><br />I found that wonderful and joyous. It's Christmas.<br /><br />Compare that to the moment after the Bumpesses hounds ruined the Christmas turkey. In the short story, it's actually an Easter ham.<br /><br />\\"Finally, he [the old man] spoke, in a low, rasping voice: \\"All right! OK! Get your coats. We're going to the Chinese joint. We're going to have chop suey.\\"<br /><br />Ordinarily, this would have been a gala of the highest order, going to the chop-suey joint. Today, it had all the gaiety of a funeral procession. The meal was eaten completely in silence.\\"<br /><br />Not quite a chorus of Chinese Fa-La-La-La-La's of the film, is it? Not very....Christmas-y, really?<br /><br />In other not-so-obvious ways, you can feel the sharp edge of post-modernism -- or is it nihilism? Well, whatever -ism it is that tells you not to have joy in this world -- creeping it's way into stories.<br /><br />The final thing that turned me off a bit to Shepherd was, again, the Bumpuses. The family -- not just the dogs -- is detailed in the story. I found it offensive. While Dickens almost beatifies the poor. Shepherd depiction is so full of cultural smears and stereotypes that would be considered very bad taste if applied to another group of people. And Shepherd just keeps going on and on with pilling cliche after cliche on them including a mentionof father-daughter incest. It just got tiring.<br /><br />With A Christmas Story, stick to the movie. With A Christmas Carol, read the book...and watch the 113 movies made of it.of father-daughter incest.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|For the time allotted this was a wonderful rendering of the book I so enjoyed. Many scenes were very close to what I envisioned which doesn't usually happen when you see the movie version of a favorite book.
0307341542|1.0|I would never recommend this book to anyone.  I actually regret reading it.  I agree with other \\"One Star\\"reviews, that the book contains graphic images that I really wish were not in my head, especially the mother pigs. I do not understand the critical acclaim associated with this book. I did enjoy \\"Gone Girl\\" which prompted buying \\"Sharp Objects\\". Save yourself, don't buy this book.

B008JH5CVS|5.0|When I first got this movie I was recommended that it was not a very good movie.  I think that it was a pretty good one.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|This was absolutely awful. Instead of giving us another great sci-fi movie, Ridley Scott decided to treat the audience like mindless movie goers. Without going into detail about plot holes and such, there are just two glaring obscenities that I can’t get past in this film.<br /><br />1. Having a creature grow from the size of a grapefruit to the size of an entire room without consuming anything or any explanation of how all that matter manifested itself out of thin air in an hour or two is not acceptable for a sci-fi movie like this to use.<br />2. Having an antagonist in a movie which is supposedly a highly advanced being should not act like a psychopathic slasher film villain who just runs rampant through the scenes flailing his arms about attacking people with no rationale behind their actions.<br /><br />There are certain aspects of cinema that we come to expect from super hero movies and magical beings in fantasy settings that are purely for action; or mindless illogical actions from slasher and horror movie villains purely for the fear factor, but neither of these are acceptable for a sci-fi film of this caliber to use.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|Not his best but a very good album nonetheless.  Believe it or not, I wish he had recorded a couple of more ballads for this one.
B004WDRT1Y|3.0|I'm a lover of 3D movies, I've seen dozens in the theaters and watched several more at home, but this is not suited for home viewing.<br /><br />When I saw this movie in the theaters I was skeptical how it'd come out, but it was actually pretty good. It was like watching a popup storybook because the 3D was flat images since it was converted from a 2D movie, unlike the wholly computer animated newer movies which are more easily rendered in 3D.<br /><br />But... in the home setting this just doesn't come off as nicely and doesn't work well. I would assume this is how other 2D -&#62; 3D conversions would go also. For home viewing I'd recommend sticking to movies that were initially designed to be 3D.
B00979CS50|5.0|This album sounds like it was recorded in the 70's and I mean that as praise.  The Horse sounds great and Neil hasn't lost anything off of his fastball either.  But it's not a nostalgia trip.  The lyrics are timely and biting.  It simply sounds like an old rock and roll record that you just discovered in the attic that you haven't heard before.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Pretty good.  Good for a home movie.  Entertaining.  This movie shows who the real life bad guts are.  I recommend.
0140143505|5.0|This charming book is written in letter format. That is my favorite type of book. It is about a woman who orders hard to find books from an English bookseller. A professional relationship develops between these two people as letters cross the ocean and great literary works are made available. The letters are wonderful. They tell a beautiful story filled with high hopes and drama. 84 Charing Cross Road is a quick read. You will get to know the letter-writers as personal friends. You will feel the love and all that goes with professional relationships. It is a beautiful story and a great beach read. You can finish it in one, intense reading. I hope you love it as much as I did.

B00979CS50|5.0|This recording has some great playing on it. I have been listening to it over and over. The only negative comment is that I think some of the lyrics are a little weak, but I would highly recommend it to any Neil Young fan.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|For anyone who has watched the original series (and remakes), this send-up is hilarious! One of Depp's best tongue-in-cheek performances!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After seeing the Hunger Games movies, I finally got around to reading the books. The books are better, perhaps unsurprisingly. There's much more of Katniss' inner life, and, perhaps more importantly, more *hunger*. The film did a mediocre job of really portraying how desperate life is for those not in the capital. Also, the book is more brutal and visceral. It says something about the antiquated standards of the MPAA that a book written for tweens needed to be toned down for a PG-13 rating; if 11-14 year olds are reading these books, they should be trusted to be able to handle seeing an accurate depiction of them on-screen.<br /><br />All three books in the series have a lot to say about modern attitudes towards media, celebrity, government, and so on. There's a refreshingly honest cynicism about power and those who seek it, and how you can easily become the thing you wish to fight against, balanced with a message that even if you know perfection is not possible, this doesn't mean you should stop fighting to get things as good as you can manage.<br /><br />With a few exceptions, the author rarely has characters explicitly state whatever point is being made; rather, the reader is trusted to take what's being shown and figure out the message themselves. (It's easy to spin things according to whatever political bias you have -- is the decadent, consumerist, Capital an anti-capitalist message, or is the Capital's total control over all production, ownership, and distribution an anti-communist message, or is the message, more correctly, &#34;Power corrupts, and it really doesn't matter what the catchphrases are or what justification the tyrants offer.&#34;?)
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Name of the Wind is one of my all time favorite books.  Others include The Warded Man and its sequel Desert Spear, the Mistborn Trilogy, and Way of Kings.  I recommend all of them.  If you like great fantasy, or more simply a great read, then you will not be disappointed.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Like a good book I could not put down.  Hooked me from the start.  Lots of Tv does not hold my interest.  This gas a pleasant surprise.  Lead characters are likable.  I care what happens to them.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Good game.  Sometimes the touch screen functionality is non-responsive. With that said I still enjoy playing this game. More free puzzles would be nice.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This is a great game. Just wish that it was a little longer and hints and instructions were a little clearer on what to do next.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I love this movie and saw it int the theater twice. I bought it because of all the special features and footage there was supposed to be but there wasn't anything I hadn't already seen on the internet so it was disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was curious about this series. Wow! Well written and completely absorbing. The plot is well engaging, even with the pornographic parts.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|And that just describes the cinematography. This has to be one of my all time favorite movies. The storyline, the cinematography, the music, the acting. All first class.<br /><br />I bought the movie and the soundtrack from Amazon. I love them both.<br /><br />Among the highlights of the movie and soundtrack......Oh just forget it. The whole movie and soundtrack are highlights.<br /><br />Please buy both, as they are a real treat. Visually and sonically stunning. Musically superb with acting above par.I love this movie.<br /><br />Five stars don't do this movie justice. I'd give it at the very least 10 stars.Did I say I love this movie?<br /><br />Movies don't get any better than \\"Barry Lyndon\\".
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have heard so many people talk about how fun ANgry Birds is and I am not much of a gamer, but I decided to try this and Wow-it is just totally fun.  I am having a blast with this, and i am 51 years old. Now I know why my grandkids love it : )
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This has to be on everyone's Christmas movie watch list. Funny and great family viewing. It is pop culture and is still referenced to this day when people decorate their homes for Christmas.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I liked the mystery style writing and plot twists, but this book eventually got to be too much for me. It got to be too dark and sordid -- I finished it but at the end was annoyed i had read it.
1595825045|5.0|I believed the other reviews.  I was expecting an awesome book filled with art.  This is still WAY more impressive than I was anticipating.  They made use of every margin, every page, in a very stylish and classy way and it's a book I'm really proud to have in my living room.  It's awesome.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I really enjoyed ready this book. The way the story was told, in present and past really was interesting.  I found myself not wanting to stop reading and the author just gave enough information each chapter to keep me wanting to read more.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I rented this for my grand kids and they loved it.Good family entertainment. What else can I say? It's Disney!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This series is one of my favorites to date, and this installment is no exception. There were a few things I thought the author took the easy way out on, but it in no way took away from the brilliance of this book. There truly are too many good things about this book than I could even begin to mention. Please do yourself a favor and read this series!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great comic, and now a great show. Hats off to Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charles Adlard, as well as the talented actors that made it real!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I chose this book because of personally knowing shy, quiet people (students, families, and myself) and wanting to see what the author had to say.  It was great!  There were so many stories and examples to remember and recover when needed.  I've already shared some of the author's findings with my teacher friends....and almost think it should be on a required reading list of prospective teachers!  As an aside, my husband attended an unrelated workshop and the speaker kept referencing this book.  He came home and mentioned it to me....but I had already decided to get it.<br /><br />Please read this if you have a chance....it's good for introverts as well as extroverts!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Some people may not watch this show, because of the title.  I know that the title kept me from watching it for the first season; but there is so much more to the show than Revenge.  It is actually more about what Revenge Requires; the Attitudes Required, the Sacrifices Required, the LOSS Required.  It is about what you give up when you take Revenge as your one and singular goal (emotional [Love] attachments, peace of mind, the safety of your friends, family and your own personal safety).  It's this lesson that makes the show a Positive Force against Revenge.  The characters are all wrapped up in their own lives and struggles and everyone makes mistakes.  It teaches us that as well.  It teaches us Perspective and Forgiveness, but Most of All, it teaches us that life is just a lot Simpler, if we do not keep secrets from the ones we love and trust.
B008RBL87I|5.0|...and I saw a provocative, inspiring work that I've already watched several times - oh, and it was also a well-filmed, good documentary.

B008WCP2PG|2.0|I was disappointed in the tale.  I guess I'm of the age that the drug culture is not my bag.  I know it exists, just a fratricide exists.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I've chosen to watch this excellent series on Amazon, since I can do it when I want, and without advertising.<br />Am really enjoying Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock.  Also highly recommend him in Eli Stone.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|If you play, or like guitar, or wonder about what it like to be a thoughtful major rock guitarist this is a great film. It's much better than I expected.
0393340244|5.0|Great book.  Everyone should read it.  Well written and very enlightening.  Apparently I have to add nine more words to this review.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Dark as usual, but the main character still has demons to overcome.  It takes a junior police officer who grew up under the same circumstances as Bruce Wayne to bring Wayne out of his funk and bring the Batman back to life; to make him believe again.<br /><br />If you like action (The Unit, Breaking Bad) this movie will draw you in, make you identify with the characters and then put you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I bought this for my Indian therapist's daughter because at that time it was her first experience with snow and she loved it.  They took it home to India with them when they went to visit and everyone there enjoyed it also.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|Jo Nesbo created a terrific hero or, more likely, anti-hero in his detective Harry Hole but in his latest foray into Oslo's seedy underworld Nesbo's hero is exhausted in every sense of the word. Harry has no possibilities left. Although the plot is straightforward enough, its execution is anything but. There are long italicized stretches told in another voice, two or three voices in all, whose identity is not always clear. In detective fiction there is a crime and a detective to solve it. We read it because we want to see how the mystery is unravelled and we like the detective. We enjoy following his clever mind. We get a lot of bonuses with Jo Nesbo: he's a good and clearly intelligent writer, he creates interesting and complex characters and situations, the Norwegian setting is new to most American readers and the city of Oslo is fully realized. Nesbo is a masterful craftsman and fully aware of what he is doing and how he is doing it, but in the end Phantom is less satisfying than Nesbo's previous Harry Hole novels. It is just a little too clever, a little too tricky. Nonetheless, Jo Nesbo's novels are better written, better crafted, and richer than the novels of his fellow Scandinavian, the late Swedish novelist Stieg Larrson. Nesbo deserves a wider readership. It you've never read one of his Harry Hole novels, don't begin with this one, begin with The Redbreast, the first of the Harry Hole novels to be translated into English.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Best one yet, although the final one, hope that someone picks up the series and keeps it going for a long time!
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|Well, it cleared up the questions I had about the episode I missed...but the whole show is getting TOO WEIRD and TOO GORY. Way too much gratuitous bloodshed and mayhem...particularly the Santa episode. Just hope some NUT JOB doesn't try to copycat...

B003ZSJ212|5.0|im a big star wars fan and I know people say its not the original so it sucks. Those people can piss off! The movies are great the quality is better then ever before. George Lucas always wants things to look better and with this set they do. Well done
1591841992|5.0|This is right up there with Milo Frank's &#34;How to Get Your Point Across in 30 Seconds or Less&#34;  except it covers how you get to that point visually. which is much more effective for complex ideas and concepts.  It gives you the tools to develop those ideas and concepts simply and effectively as a group or in front of a group.  Very powerful.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|The G13 is bad ass! Every game I use it for (Call of Duty, Diablo, Left 4 Dead 2, etc.) makes playing easier then using the keyboard. With the new drivers its a lot easier to make custom profiles. My FPS skills have gone way up after getting this! Very very good!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like the icon in the status bar at the top of the screen. Its' small but keeps me imformed of charge status while in any program.  The rest of this app is exceedingly thurough; lots of helpful info.  It works flawlessly on my fire hd 8.9.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I use this app on a daily basis for home, for work, and for fun. I always find awesome ideas. Highly recommended!!
0099501473|3.0|It's a bit of an odd tale, and more racy than I expected.  The broken English is a great technique, it makes you feel like you are right in the main characters shoes.  This book is like a cross between The Help and Fifty Shades of Grey
B00A8ECU24|4.0|its cute and addictive to a sis brony like me.I collect their stuff and now I have the app.... yes.
1400067820|5.0|Antifragile is one of those books that really shakes up the way you view the world and conduct your life.  Taleb takes a simple thesis (that certain individuals and systems actually benefit from unpredictable risks and are thus \\"antifragile\\" to them, while others are prone to destruction from such risks) and uses this central idea to propound a comprehensive philosophy of ethics.  Although his biting irreverance and his unbridled criticism of certain professions (including editors, pundits of any sort, bankers, pharmaceutical companies, big-company executives, academics, and economists) will be a turn-off to many, and while some of his conclusions are derived from questionable anecdotal evidence, it is always admirable to see a writer express his convictions in a manner that does not bow to convention or political correctness.<br /><br />What I found most fascinating about Taleb's theories is his disdain for much of modern trappings and his respect for long-standing traditions.  (He claims to drink nothing but water, coffee, and wine, as these three beverages have been arouund for thousands of years.) In a sense, his philosopy on ethics and risk is quite similar to Percy Cerutty's philosophy on athletic training.  Both embrace the Stotan concept that the key to personal growth and success is stressing your body and mind in a low-tech state of nature.<br /><br />My only criticism (likely a negative byproduct of Taleb's allergy to editors) is that his writing is a bit rambling and awkwardly phrased in places.  There are even portions of chapters that he encourages the reader to skip or disregard, which could have been easily cut or relegated to an appendix. There are so many important ideas in this book, however, that it merits five stars in spite of the lack of polish.<br /><br />-Kevin Joseph, author of \\"The Champion Maker\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really fun. I saw someone else playing on their device n thought &quot;boring&quot;, however the moment I started playing I was hooked. Now I have to pace myself so it will last awhile. It's so addictive.
0684857219|5.0|My husband is very much so into physical fitness. There are a million fitness gurus out there, but who better than multi-time Mr. Olympia himself?
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|As a 20-something male, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. At several points I found myself laughing out loud at the frank and clever humor of Tina Fey. Women may find some parts more entertaining than men, but it is great for both sexes. I have several guy friends who also love this book. Highly recommended if you enjoy 30 Rock or Tina's work on SNL.
0857685848|5.0|For those interested in paleoart this book is without doubt a wonderful way to journey back in time on a lazy afternoon or rainy evening as you leaf through its glossy pages and is well worth forking out the money for if you are a lover of dizzying dinosaurs, bizarre beasties and creepy crawlies of all shapes and sizes in general! Focusing on ten of the key artists who've helped popularise the aptly termed \\"Dinosaur Renaissance\\" given several pages each to showcase their meticulous art, explain the creative process and offer scientific insights every page is full of vivid, vibrant and often visceral imagery. Usually the work of art itself will take anywhere from hours, days or weeks to finish but the painstaking research the artist has to do beforehand to get the proportions, anatomy and also the natural environment the animal is portrayed in true to life can take many gruelling months. This normally involves consultation with palaeontologists, studying a plaster cast of the fossil and a rigorous process involving several other disciplines of science as well as fieldtrips to comparable landscapes still in existence today if possible. There is also an ongoing discussion of creating art for natural history museums, popular scientific publications or for release to the press to help publicise a new find using traditional media versus digital media. I've always found that art created using traditional media feels much warmer, stylistically unique and more natural looking but art created using digital media often seems cooler, more impersonal and somewhat artificial looking though of course using digital means to update an older hand painted image does make sense. Interspersed throughout the book are illustrated two page descriptions highlighting a particular species of prehistoric animal, presumably hand chosen by the artists who over the years have developed an especial fondness for depicting it in their artwork, or that the publisher chose and asked them to provide illustrations for. The wide variety of animals featured in these segments include both the familiar and unfamiliar; Brachylophosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Smilodon, Coelophysis, Aerosteon, Scelidosaurus, Nyctosaurus, Bonnerichthys and perhaps the oddest Concavenator. On the last page or so there's a glossary of terms and also a timeline spanning the various epochs the animals within its covers lived in which is helpful. With dinosaurs no longer being seen as dull witted, cold blooded and lumbering beasts that dragged their tails on the ground (like lizards or crocodilians) but as fast moving, warm blooded and superbly adapted creatures that were in many instances feathered (and sometimes quite smart) paleoart has had to keep pace with the science. This superb book discusses and illustrates that dynamic process, and how in turn, paleoart can sometimes inform the ongoing scientific investigation and inspire the palaeontologists themselves to think out of the box. Over the decades both palaeontology and paleoart have evolved together in an almost symbiotic relationship which has fostered a link that's helped make it one of the most popular fields of science to this day. Yet many of the artists clearly feel it can be a difficult, thankless and underappreciated job with untrained hacks sometimes being employed to illustrate books on ancient life with little or no prior knowledge of even the basic science behind the art. Although when looking through this volume it's very easy to see that paleoart isn't just another form of illustration, but at best a unique branch of science in its own right.<br /><br />While I agree with another reviewer here who criticised the inclusion of ancient marsupial species in this book when the title says Dinosaur Art: The World's Greatest Paleoart, the publishers did actually make it clear in the description that there was some non dinosaurian art featured as well. I think they should probably have titled it Ancient Life: The World's Greatest Paleoart or something along that line just to be more accurate in the description of the contents, even though well over three quarters of the book does indeed cover dinosaurs. Although I do understand their logic as words like \\"Tyrannosaurus Rex\\" \\"Dinosaur\\" and \\"Jurassic\\" hold a larger cache with the general public but that's a gripe best left for another time! If anything I was in fact the exact opposite to my fellow reviewer, as I'd have loved to see yet more non dinosaurian paleoart of extinct megafauna from the geological periods preceding the evolution, and following the extinction of the dinosaurs and related flying and marine reptiles included. I must be different to other people because for me dinosaurs were only one family of amazing, wonderful and often bizarre prehistoric creatures that ever lived and hopefully they won't be the last and also because at the end of the day I'm fascinated by the evolutionary story of all ancient life whether they be dinosaurs, mammals or other. Especially when you consider that 99.9% of all the species which have ever lived are now extinct, an extremely sobering statistic when you think of it! Furthermore many of those species left no trace in the form of fossils that they ever existed so sadly we'll never get to learn about them and the world they lived in. The artists lucky enough to have been chosen for inclusion in this book are; Julius Csotonyi, Gregory S Paul, Mauricio Ant&oacute;n, Douglas Henderson, Todd Marshall, John Sibbick, Luis Rey, John Conway, Robert Nicholls and Ra&uacute;l Mart&iacute;n. As for suggested artists there's one well known individual living here in Australia named Peter Trusler who's a wildlife illustrator and talented paleoartist to boot and several other people as well mentioned by yet another reviewer of this book; Mark Hallett, Larry Felder, James Gurney, Michael Skrepnick, Bill Stout, Karen Carr, Bob Walters, David Peters, Carl Buell and Jorge Blanco. As something of a paleoart novice I don't know many of the artists listed but it would be a shame for them to not get the same treatment as those in these pages have. I also think it's a shame female paleoartists have been completely overlooked which is a bit disappointing as there must be quite a few out there whose work is as good, rigorous and beautiful as their male counterparts. This however is not a criticism of the book at all merely pointing out that the subject so fascinating and the art so beautiful I wish its scope had been expanded even further, as paleoart is an excellent way to offer a tantalising window onto the past or snapshot in time. Although who knows perhaps they could all be included in a book two one day, I hope so for it'd be most welcome! Till then I'll be more than happy to pore over the fabulous art while thinking of all that once was, now lost to us in the mists of time untold thousands or millions of years ago.<br /><br />In the end more fascinating to me than any imaginary, legendary or mythical beast could ever be because they actually once did exist dinosaurs and the multitude of other extinct prehistoric animals will continue to hold sway over the minds of people for generations to come. Books like this can only feed that fascination and maybe help inspire the palaeontologists, paleoartists and prehistoric dreamers of the future. Just so long as the fossil record of life on Earth keeps on giving up enigmatic new secrets, wonders and treasures I think that outcome will surely be guaranteed for as long as human beings exist.rt or something along that line just to be more accurate in the description of the contents, even though well over three quarters of the book does indeed cover dinosaurs.

B005K2XM94|3.0|This case does the job.Honestly when I got it, there weren't many other options. It has kept my Kindle dry on several occasions, and in generally good shape, but is not very exciting otherwise. I would have preferred a skin or shell, but if you are looking for a durable sleeve, than this is the way to go.
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|I didn't like this one. In theory, it seems like it will be good. This story is about parenting a psychotic child. The failures of the parents are highlighted in this tragic tale. It just doesn't go anywhere fast. If you want to read a book that has a slow start with a few interesting parts, this is your book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you are a Grisham fan you will enjoy this one. It moves at a good pace and would make a great movie .
0812982622|4.0|The only negative thing I can say is that it starts off a little scattered. Once you get into a rhythm, you're hooked! This tale follows a semi-orphan and his depressing, yet noble life in North Korea. This book is enlightening about the culture as well as, just an all around good, page-turning novel. It has it all: love, hate, tragedy, and triumph. It is a must read!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|We liked the end to the trilogy.  It was definitely not as good as the second one and there were some very cheesy moments and acting as well as special effects.  There were also some really awesome special effects and Anne Hathaway was amazing.  She really made the movie.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I read Gone Girl first, and I was hooked. I loved this one too. The characters are so flawed, that you know they really are human, and could even be real. It was a riveting story about a brutal crime - a whole family murdered. The entire book is devoted to finding answers. You may not love where it takes you, but it is really interesting \\"going\\" there.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Downloaded for my Kindle Fire HD and continue to get an error message and close down.<br /><br />I will be deleting this app and finding a new weather app.<br /><br />I would not reccomend this app
0451232852|3.0|I have come to love Ken Follett's books. This one does not disappoint. The backdrop is World War I, a war that authors normally overlook. Some of the characters are so enchanting and interesting to follow. Some are a little too boring. This book is okay. The best thing about it, is what I've learned. However, it is good enough to get me to read book two...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game. It makes you think. It doesn't repeat and it is addicting. Lots of fun on speed play.
1400032717|5.0|This book chronicles the story of a 15 year old with autism. As a special education teacher, I have a place in my heart for all disabled individuals, but you'll love this one! He is on somewhat of a journey trying to solve a \\"crime\\" but really the reader is discovering the details of his life, right along with him. Christopher, the main character, is riveting all the way through. You come to love his quirks and could find autism as endearing as this character. What a wonderful boook!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|When I discovered Sigh No More in the autumn of 2009 it quickly claimed the number one spot on my iPod. Even now, three years later, listening to that album from start to finish is a joy. As such, I was beyond excited for this album and when it dropped I was not at all disappointed. Once again M&S have produced an album which is very much like one's journey to, and through, faith rather than a simple musical experience.<br /><br />In Babel, they have not only stayed true to their roots but they have expanded them and now I have two albums I can listen to back-to-back, from start to finish, on repeat.
0316223239|5.0|Wow! Emma Donoghue really knows how to write from the perspective of a 5 year old so well, that it's as if you know this little, dynamic character. I won't spoil the book, but it's about a kidnapped teenager locked in a room with her five year old son that was born in the room. It's the only life little Jack knows. The story exudes love from this young mother. It is so compelling, heartfelt, funny, intricate, dramatic, and most importantly easily the best book you will ever read!
B0053VKP8S|3.0|I use this device to connect my optical toslink out of my tv to a stereo mixer. It's a great solution that allows me to watch things on tv or play games and use headphones. Unfortunately, the digital conversion isn't perfect all the time. Anytime you get digital out at a different rate than the converter can handle, it freaks out. You get a horrible screeching/squealing noise...not something that's great to have blasted into your ears when you accidentally configure a new device correctly.<br /><br />When it's working at the right frequency, it's great. No apparent delay, and the quality sounds fine. Just a shame that it doesn't just produce silence when it can't figure out the signal (and that it can't handle different signals at all).<br /><br />If price is a concern, you will probably be ok with this. For myself, I'd have rather purchased a more expensive item that could handle more ranges of audio.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|The vampires in this show were amazingly strong and scary as hell. The plot was exciting and had some very good twists.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I usually hate android games that involve digital buttons. Fortunately, the developers of Muffin Knight really put a lot of attention into this design aspect. All of the buttons can be re-sized and moved around. Furthermore, they're very responsive. It's not perfect, and I'd still prefer real buttons, but they work well.<br /><br />As for the game, it's a great time waster. You have a great amount of challenge trying to last longer and longer in different stages. It's fun unlocking new characters, and there is some strategy involved in deciding in what order to upgrade each of the new ones that you get. For $1, it's pretty good purchase!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Product got here faster than expected and was perfect. Excited to have it in time for Christmas and to enjoy the low cost.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery APP is really great! It lets me know when my tablets about to die. And lets you know how much time you have left on whatever your doing, wether its reading, music, videos, or wifi, before it shuts down. I recommend definitely!<br /><br />I have this APP on Kindle Fire.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|To be honest I knew maybe one of their songs and I bought it and it exceeded my expectations. Awesome artists!
B0098VXCR0|3.0|The evil queen was the best thing going on in this whole move! There just was little to no dialog and poor acting, the actual story idea was great. Wouldn't see it again
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Been wanting to read this a long time. So glad I finally got it. Read this book in one dsy
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I have read books that carried the sauce much better then this. Book one was good but this was just stupid and yet I bought book three.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a beautifully written novel. Although I ready a lot of fantasy books as a teenager, I had drifter away from them as an adult. Not because they were bad, just often simplistic and formulaic. Not this book; the story line is complex and invigorating exciting. I couldn't stop reading, because I couldn't wait to see what happened next!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have read books that carried the sauce much better but this book was different because the leading lady didnt know if she liked or was going to like it.
B00A992NDO|4.0|Only had 5 songs I liked on the first album and this one had me liking almost all of them..thinking of you and crazy kids are my favorite
B00992CF6W|5.0|The first time I played this I wanted to play it again and again. So if you see this game buy and you will be sure to love it.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|This a a great season! I love seeing Booth and Brennan together as a couple and having the baby! Fantastic season!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|a bit on the dry side with the humor, could have played it up a little more. Needed more action.
0062231375|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It's that simple. I just love the way that Anthony Bourdain boils down his life in kitchens into stories that not only have name-dropping, but also the self-deprecating moments in his life and the low points that you don't usually see in memoirs. There is an honesty to him and a flow to his writing. As someone that has spent a decent amount of time in kitchens, I can say that the atmosphere definitely holds true, at least to the lines I worked.<br />In the end, it is more about the fact that it is a fun read about the life through the kitchen door more than any sort of expose for me.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|I've seen many Christmas movies and this one is my favorite!  Ron Howard created a Masterpiece! Never get tired of watching it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really enjoyed every season of Walking Dead so far. I recommend this show to everyone that loves zombies because this show does a better job than a lot of movies do.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Loved diving back in to the world of Scarpetta!  Always look for to the next book have been reading this series for a long time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|THE BEST VERSION I'VE SEEN..LOTS OF CARD BACK CHOICES THO IT COULD USE MORE  BACKGROUNDS JUST FOR VARIETY..VERY CLEAR &amp; CRISP GRAPHICS..I'M REALLY SURPRISED THIS IS FREE, GIVEN THE QUALITY...I'VE PAID FOR A DIFF VERSION W/NOWHERE NEAR THE QUALITY OF THIS GAME - VERY IMPRESSIVE...only one glitch i've seen is...i tried the WINNING version several times &amp; it won't always let me win..!?! STRANGE....otherwise, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG W/THIS AWESOME FREEBIE - D/L IT!!  ;-)
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Not a bad clone of the classic Myst game. Not the best game I've ever played, but it was pretty good for a buck. I rather enjoyed the seasons mechanic.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I was a little disappointed in pursuit of honer, so I was a little hesitant to pay the premium price for the eBook.  I am glad I got it.  It was a very exciting ride throughout the full story.  I can't wait until the next installment of the series.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is so far my favorite of the Angry Birds games. It is so much fun. The puzzles are very interesting and some very fun new &#34;bird&#34; types.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|What can I say ladies? Its Channing Tatumn, and its male nudity! Don't expect good acting or a plot, but who cares?! Less talking, more stripping!! Great for a wine and girls night! Watched twice in the first 24 hours! :)
B008Z9L94O|2.0|I bought this reissue and was quite disappointed by the quality of sound. It's overly distorted sounding in places, has plenty of stereo image smearing and the stereo balance seems off throughout. This vinyl pressing also doesn't sound anywhere close to being as full-bodied in the low-mid range as the CD remaster, causing much of the guitar and drum tones to sound less powerful.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Loved the fact that this movie kept you on the edge of your seat.  Good film that was a mix of science fiction and thriller but also so out there that is was unbelievable at times.
0316228532|5.0|Wow, just wow!!! I just finished this and I thought it was nothing short of brilliant.  A tour de force. I heard some say this was boring.  Boring??  I thought it was anything but.  I thought she could make a tense dinner party just as exciting as a wizard duel.  The writing was top notch, very polished, and the pace flowed beautifully.  I also thought the characters were so well realized and believable. I've heard the complaint that so many were unlikable, and that is fine with me.  I don't need saintly characters, there are so few of them in real life, but I want characters that read real and are complex and interesting and I personally found this to be the case here.  In even the worst characters, she gave me insight into why they are the way they are.  I didn't think she excused anyone's behavior in the book, but at least gave some understanding of what led to the behavior.  I found the ending incredibly moving and emotional, just a powerful book.  And the story was very relevant.  Not an American book, not set in America, but after this past election I thought the exploration of rich and poor and how the rich views and treats the poor was handled very well.  The book had something to say without beating the message over my head.  I for one think her first non Potter book was a stunning success.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Had been a few years since i had seen it, but i remember now why i loved it so much. Cheesy but a great movie
0979019710|5.0|I definitely recommend The Miracle Morning. The premise of the book is that you can't really handle outer success without developing your inner self. And since no one really has time throughout their normal day, we need to make time. And the best way to do that is get up earlier; to have a Miracle Morning.<br /><br />Hal gives tips on how to make yourself get up early, tips that have greatly helped me. I was never a morning person. I always wanted to be one, but never seemed to be able to. My alarm would go off early in the morning and I would roll over, talk myself out of getting up (my morning mind is very good at debate), and hit the snooze button. And then I would feel guilty for the rest of the day... Not any more. With this book's help, I am now a morning person. I get more done in a day than I ever have (Including reading about a book a week while going to school full time as a theology and philosophy student, working as a research student, working a more than part time job, and keeping up with my blog), and am way better for it... Just so you know, I got up at 5:00 this morning, and it's a Sunday. Before The Miracle Morning I had a hard time getting up at 8:00.<br /><br />He also lays out his idea of what the Miracle Morning consists of, but he does say that you can change it some to fit you best. I did that. Because I believe I need different things, I changed it up quite a bit to suit me... The point is to work on YOU. Whatever that consists of.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Not quite as riveting as the first one, but filled in some blanks of the story.<br /><br />A bit darker than the first book.  Again - not for those under age 12 - maybe not under age 14.

B007G8MMP0|5.0|My mom recommend this movie to me because I'm a Mel Gibson fan, and trust me, it's a good movie! It's a pretty well-done take on the &#34;Taken&#34; plot idea, and done just as well, I'd say.
B000T433CO|5.0|Thought it was going ti be a corny chick flix but it ended up being funny with good acting. Would recommend.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was one of those Star Wars fans who was reluctant to buy the Blu-Ray set.. Well, even though it's missing \\"Empire of Dreams\\" and all the previously released material aside from it, including deleted scenes from previous releases, the six films have never looked or sounded better! I have no regrets.<br /><br />EDIT (12/10/12): After realizing just how many one star reviews this has, by lunatics who have no lives aside from crying over the fact George Lucas likes to (in his mind) \\"perfect\\" his movies, I've decided to add on to my review.<br /><br />Content:<br />I'm not sure if you've all heard about some of these legendary deleted scenes, but they're amazing. Some of them really make you wonder what could have been.. Extra passing mentions to Luke's father in A New Hope, Luke and his friends at Tosche Station, Luke building the lightsaber he used in Jedi, all kinds of great scenes that could have been, and, some that should have been. The deleted scenes add about half a star, if not a full star, to the value of this release.<br /><br />More great content comes in the form of vintage making-of documentaries that most fans have never seen before. They're a fun watch for anybody who wants to get the feel of what it was like to be around as the films were being released.<br /><br />Also included are a section for each planet in each film called \\"The Collection\\", featuring a number of models and clothing pieces, as well as matte painting, often along with revealing and very interesting video commentaries from people like Joe Johnston and Steve Gawley and Doug Chiang.<br /><br />The bonus content does a lot for the value of the set, and I'd say it alone is worth at least a star and a half.<br /><br />Picture and Sound:<br />There's really nothing that needs to be said here. HD sound and picture were long overdue, and here they are. Another half star, all 6 films look far better than they used to.<br /><br />The Movies:<br />Okay, there have been changes, so what? It's the same Star Wars, the story and theme have never changed, it's not life-altering. Take a half star off if you must. The movies themselves, not including the optional negative half star, are at least 3 stars.<br /><br />There you have it, a set worth no less than 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Honestly, people are too fanatical about the changes thay have been made. Yeah, a lot of times they're unnecessary, or just plain bad, but the movies themselves still have the same effect on us and our kids, and nobody loves Star Wars any less, even if they hate Lucas. This set IS worth it if you love Star Wars, and don't let anybody tell you different.e same Star Wars, the story and theme have never changed, it's not life-altering.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Compare to the first and second Batman, I'm afraid this one did no come out as it should/could have. The street fight between the cops and the bad guy didn't impress me at all, and the chirography didn't deliver the \\"realism\\" it should have.

0312430000|4.0|Book is easy to read with a lot of interesting stories. It has many good ideas, however, it could have a few more practical tips on how to apply them.
0470876417|3.0|This is the first in a series of 4-5 books, so you need to wait to get depth. Still this book provides the overview.<br /><br />One of the better books for entrepreneurs to understand strategy. The author calls it \\"business model\\", but this really is classical strategic management. To understand the key points that underpin the success of any company, you need to think about customer needs, ways to get revenue, controlling costs, etc. This particular book is inspired by the lead star-up movement. I suppose there has also been a give-and-take with the blue-ocean crowd ([[ASIN:1591396190 Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make Competition Irrelevant]]).<br /><br />The book is very much a rehash of existing business writing, but it excels in two areas:<br />* First, everything is put together into one cohesive framework. Too many books just list disconnected framework after framework. I personally have some quarrel with the author's overall framework, but that is besides the point if you are a practitioner. The framework as presented is still pretty good.<br />* Second, the presentation style is very graphical. You can move directly from the book to the whiteboard in your conference room. That is a nice touch and helps you put the ideas into use.<br /><br />The book has one massive problem: It classifies, but does not analyse. An academic will find the book awful, because there is absolutely no deeper knowledge in the book. How are things related? Which of the nine components are the more important? What data should be used? This is also a problem for readers in larger companies. If they start doing business canvasses, then they are almost doomed. There is for instance nothing about buy-in in this book. The approach leads to mechanical ticking-the-boxes, as opposed to deeper thinking about competitive advantage.<br /><br />I can recommend the book for entrepreneurs that do not know anything about business decisions. Everyone else should look elsewhere. Or if you read loads of books, read this too. Three stars.ks, read this too. Three stars.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is so much fun. The choices of easy to hard continue to challenge you. I play this at night when I'm having trouble falling asleep.

B0084BMUFA|4.0|A classic for a reason.  I like to re-read when the consumerism of modern day Christmas makes me feel like saying bah humbug.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have a low end android device & have had nothing but trouble attempting to download and install it.  I received very little in the way of help, unless I want to tie up my telephone with an overseas help desk.  I am NOT an inexperienced computer user by any means, but this is not only beyond me, it's downright frustrating.

B004X2M3N8|2.0|Although I like Pond, Matt Smith just plays way too far over the top and is generally hard to like.  I give this 2 stars because of the supporting cast and the fact that it is Dr. Who, but please regenerate this lousy Dr. and bring in someone interesting.

B0015AARJI|4.0|I would have rated this a 5, if it had the same feel as my original controller.  Athough ti works and feels great, properly weighted and smooth all around, it feels like it is a step down in material quality.  Still a great deal.

B007BVMVDU|5.0|I won't describe too much of the action to avoid spoilers, but this series is certainly a diamond in the rough when it comes to recent tv series.  The acting is way above what you would normally expect and the story is quite interesting.  My wife, who is less interested in such stories as me absolutely loved it and could not stop watching, so we would end up staying up way to late to watch the next episode.  My only regret is that there are only 10 per season.
B0086700CM|2.0|Ok so I got this app on my kindle because I heard if was really fun and I have it on my iPhone. But I got it on my kindle and suddenly, BOOM! It stops working! I mean, it won't let me tilt and I redownloaded it many times but it's not working! I ,&lt;3 this game so please fix! Thx
B004U52VPS|5.0|Has a set of cards with different configurations for the blocks, giving the option of more structured, puzzle-based playtime than just setting up the slingshot. I was pleasantly surprised and can't wait to give it as a gift.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a huge Nelson DeMill fan but I think he needs to change course on the whole John Corey plot line. This book dragged on and was very predictable.  But then again, how interesting can a book be that takes place in Yemen.  Now that is a more serious issue.

0307960471|5.0|Nesbo has outdone himself with this newest of Harry Hole!  Story told in an interesting way, from different angles.  Many plot twists that make sense in the end.  Suspense keeps the reader turning the pages, making it hard to put down.  Not only is Harry's detective mind at it's best, also shows his human side as well.  One of the best, if not THE best, in the Harry Hole series!  Looking forward to more from Mr. Nesbo!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of my co-workers suggested this book to me, I have to say i was a little skeptical at first but after reading the first few chapters I was hooked.  By far this one of my favorite story lines and I would recommend this book to any one looking for a great book to read.  This books keeps you hooked and offers lots of twist and turns...
B00364K6YW|5.0|Superb acting, writing, and scenery join forces to do justice to Jane Austen's classic story of love and marriage. This DVD set is a fantastic gift for anyone who enjoys masterful storytelling and first-rate actors. The Blu-ray version is breathtaking!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|The set is up to date, All Region and on Blu-Ray.  The Price was unbeatable and shipped extremely fast and arrived in good shape.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|Music was good though repetitive.  Scoring seemed off in that a single move would sometimes count as more than one.  There really needs to be a reset button you do not have to dig through menus to find.  Also the reset button does not work right if you have finished the level.  It puts all the bricks back but does not return the red brick.  Finally the controls seem to be off because when I drag a block all the way across the field, i find i have run out of screen before I get the block half way across which means more moves since i have to lift my finger.
B008AYCSE4|1.0|Well basically a guy with a sexual addiction. . which he demonstrated over and over and over. . Didnt want to get to know his parts that &#34;well.&#34;  I have gotten rid of very few movies. . this one was taken out. . and tossed to the trash..

B0095ZMMCK|1.0|I don't think this is the full edition. The hardback has over 800 pagee. I got thru this Kindle edition too fast to be a a full book.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love it Ellen is so funny!!!! She makes you feel so happy!  I would love to meet her. Love it
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Great special effects and plot.  As always, full of twists and turns and more than a few surprises.  Does not fail to meet the standards of the Batman legend.  I think it leaves a great stepping off point to begin the next Trilogy.  Anne Hathaway may be the best Cat Woman yet and is certainly the best looking in the suit, for sure.  Christian Bale did not disappoint nor did Gary Oldham.  I am curious about some of the secondary players supporting Bane.  I am going to have to do some &#34;digging&#34; to identify them because they struck a familiar chord from past sinister performances.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|This debut CD \\"Torches\\" by Foster the People is amazing. From start to finish, this is one of the best I've ever heard. They are amazing live too. These guys have their own style, but at the at the same time cross different genres. Already looking forward to their follow-up project. These guys are talented musicians, who came on the scene in a hurry. Get this CD.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Imaginative and compelling.  The story flows well and Howey's writing style makes for comfortable readng.  I could read this series for long stretches at a time without being bored or fatigued.  Howey certainly has the gift of being able to paint a canvas with his words and puts the reader right in the middle of the &#34;Silo&#34; as well as the key players' minds.  He is able to skip back and forth among characters and timeline without losing the reader.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the story line so far and look forward to completing the series.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|A great game,  with all the levels and the option to compete with best possible score or to just do your own thing and compete with yourself.<br />Even share your accomplishments if you wish or not.<br />I Like Choices ! !<br /><br />Can be fun for hours or just a free minute.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|There are a lot of opinions about Linkin Park's &#34;new&#34; sound. Yes their sound is different from when they first came on the scene and a lot of people complain about it, but I have to say &#34;Living Things&#34; is a good mixture of their first few albums with the new sound. In my opinion this is the most complete, best overall album by the band. Whether I am in my car or working out I have this album playing. I may start with other music but always go back to it, it is that good!! If you went away from Linkin Park because you do not care for their new sound, check out this album. You may be surprised.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I loved it and cried a lot too......such a sweet story...shows animals are more loyal than some humans,Richard Gere was great......
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|If you like action at all this one KILLS!  Lots of humor action and even some shooting! The best of the best.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I enjoyed Magic Academy 1 alot more than magic academy 2, # 2 is more intence but worth the price
B009ETEEAU|4.0|Picked this camera up (720p) and quite a few other 1080p's at the same time for motorcycle track days, to test them, i mounted all of them to the dash of my truck.  This camera easily had the grainiest picture, but was the easiest camera to pick out details from (license plates, signs, etc).  For the price, this little bugger is awesome (doesn't come with any mounts, but has the standard screw hole size in the bottom of the case... simple to use, power and record buttons are easily accessible without opening the case.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I'm only on chapter two. It hasn't engaged me or made me want to continue. The wording isn't something you'd want to quote like in her previous books. She's trying to make you think about relationships. She should have done it differently.

1416955070|5.0|I saw the teaser trailer on you tube and it intrigued me to read! I picked this up and its AMAZING! I can't put it down. All the characters are so great with well rounded personalities to keep you guessing what they're going to do next. If you haven't read this then do so before the movie comes out in August!
B004P1I016|5.0|I started using this book when I first took lessons about 45 years ago and after 2 years of lessons I got tired of reading and just wanted to play by ear which I have done on and off ever since. About a year or so ago I decided to start learning how to read again and started taking lessons to do so. We use a variety of different books and when I am having trouble playing something I find that I will constantly come back to this book to practice the exercises that pertain to the problems I am having. I probably refer back to this book more than any other book I have and I think it is great for any level of skill or ability that you have. I regret not keeping up on reading like I should have years ago but it's never too late to continue to learn and I highly recommend this book to anyone just beginning or who has been playing for years. It's only 8 bucks!

055357342X|5.0|After reading A Clash of Kings I tought the series could hardly get any better. George Martin amazed me with this sequence in the series. Some parts of the book were actually hard to absorb. I had to read it again just to be sure the text was actually stating what I just read.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the book where the Red Wedding event, the new kin killing at the end of the book and Dany acquiring her Unsullied. These were all memorable parts which I would stil be reminding in the further sequensces of the series.<br /><br />This book alone makes the ASOIF series well worth reading. This one really was a masterpiece, best fiction book I've read in my life (and I've read several hunderds of those).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0756697875|5.0|I bought this for my son.  He loves the mini figure that is attached and says the book is very detailed.  The pictures are great.

B005HSG3VK|4.0|Great Kindle Fire cover for the cost.  You won't be disappointed.  It will fold completely back when reading and it also will set up as an easel if you like that feature.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't know. Maybe I'm infected, too, but I love this series. Season 1 was a head-turner. Season 2 was wild. Season 3 is hands-down, off-the-charts juicy! The original group from Season 2 are being pushed to their limits, new characters are popping up like kettle corn and now &#34;The Biters&#34; or &#34;The Walkers&#34; aren't their biggest problem anymore! Bring on the crazy. I've got my seatbelt on!!
B004UXUUDA|5.0|What an outstanding historical fiction book.  As soon as I finished I went and searched for the movie.  I learned a lot about the Jews and France in WWII.Everyone should take the time to read this book.  It is a great piece of historical fiction.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Fantastic series for the fans of the genre! Jessica Lange and rest of casting are a cut above the rest out there.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a fantastic novel.  I was keep on suspense throughout the whole book and would recommend this to anyone who loves to read!  One of my all time favorite reads.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I really liked this book.  It has a lot of twists, turns, and emotions and kept me wanting more.  A great start to a wonderful trilogy.  BTW, I'm an adult and I enjoyed this.

B005LAII12|2.0|I saw Ted as a cheap movie at my college, and long story short, I didn't like it. The story was very predictable and felt cliché, your average \\"guy must choose between his lazy fun loving best friend and girlfriend who wants him to do something with his life.\\" The jokes were nothing but Seth doing what he can't do on TV, mainly dropping the F-bomb. And I really felt like it was just a waste of time. The acting was really good though. You really did feel like the actors were actually talking and interacting with Ted.<br /><br />Now before I get comments such as \\"it's Seth MacFarlane and an R-rated comedy, what did you expect?\\" Truth be told, I didn't know what to expect. Yes I saw the uncensored trailer and know what Family Guy is like, but one also must consider that Seth made the awesomeness that is Johnny Bravo, with the help of Butch Hartman, the entertaining series that is American Dad, and the ok Cleveland Show. I went in knowing it could be great, or bad. What I wasn't expecting was that the ONLY \\"jokes\\" would be \\"I'm a living teddy bear, I curse, drink, like hookers, and it's funny because I'm a child's toy.\\" Really that's it. One trick pony where the trick gets old really fast. I'm sure Seth could have done something else, maybe develop the stalker character some more and draw humor form the fact that he's stalking a teddy bear, but nope, just the contrast of a teddy bear cursing and getting drunk. Also he's made episodes for his shows that have had some really interesting stories. The episode where Johnny meats Adam West and they go on a ridiculous adventure to rescue Mama, good story with excellent execution that led to very funny situations. During Ted however, I sat there, thinking \\"this will happen next...aaand I was right, now he's gonna, yep he just did. Yep, he said f*** again.\\"<br /><br />Here's a way to tell if you'll enjoy it or not, watch the uncensored trailer on YouTube, and ask yourself \\"will I enjoy 90 minutes of just this?\\" If you like whatyou see, you'll enjoy it. I for one, didn't enjoy it.
B000NY12LO|3.0|I was told to read this book from a friend who said she couldn't put it down. However, I find it VERY SLOW! I read only the first few chapters and I haven't picked it up since.

B009VB97EY|2.0|I have seen Channing Tatum dance before in another film and he was awesome. His moves in real dancing is second to none. This was just too much F language and gyrating rather than dancing. The storyline was only fair.  Rather depressing.

B007V65R54|5.0|While this is not the easiest read, I enjoyed this book very much; Nate The Great is insightful and methodical.  He is the Bayesian master of the obvious.  He pushes through the the awful crapola that clouds our world.  He takes the Mumbo out of Mumbo Jumbo while searching through the straw and manure to find the pony.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I could barely wait for Rowling's first adult novel, but was bitterlky disappointed.  While her writing is excellent, the content is so incredibly depressing.  In the village of her novel, there is not one person that I cared for or cared about.  Each one was self-centered or miserable or immature or just plain mean-spirited.  Two young people, Krystal and Robbie, were sympathetic enough but could not make up for all the nasty adults in the book.  What a disappointment from a great writer.
B005LAIH4A|1.0|I don't understnad why it gets such a high rating. My husband and I really find it boring.  The plot is slow, there are several scene that can be eliminated.  We couldn't finish the whole DVD because either one of us would ended up distracted to do other things.  Managed to finish it in three days, but also regret that we've even started.  The bunnies are cute though.
B000005DQQ|5.0|A wonderful vinyl package for an amazing piece of work. This album really deserves to be heard in full, and this package does the album justice.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|I was sort of expecting this would be an entertaining movie, but I was wrong.  There was no humour element through out the story.  The plot is slow and not to the point for the first half.  There are too many scenes of characters chasing around, people falling, things falling to cause a mess....etc that created most of the movie, that is really anooying, preventing the story moving forward.  My husband found an excuse to leave the couch in the middle of the movie, and I've bear with it for another half an hour while surfing on the net at the same time, but couldn't finish the whole movie at the end.

ENJOY EVERYONE AND MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!
B007M45PMU|4.0|Like FUN the Lumineers lifts one to a metaphysical state. Emotional and thought-provoking. I hope they retain their purity and sound.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The feel and the look of the headphone is awesome. Been using for some time and the battery life is really solid. The wireless connection is stable and I did not face disconnections at all. The 7.1 surround is unbelievable when used in gaming to pin point the target. However, it is not recommended for music. The mic is alright for me and there isn't any static for it. My ears fitted entirely and it is really comfortable. However, your ears may get sweaty after an hour or so of usage depending on your room temperature.<br />I faced some difficulty while I was installing the software and drivers and my headphone could not be recognized. But after some research, it worked after i disabled my UAC.<br />The headphone is definitely worth for the price tag.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I hope they make another sequel. This was a very good movie. Give me more. Or to quote an old book, &#34;May I have another&#34;.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was amazing. You just can't put it down. It can get a little confusing though. But so many shocks, you cAN overlook that.
B007WA10IW|3.0|I enjoy NMTBHTSP more as a collection of really good punk songs than as an album-listening experience. I like the music just enough to want it as a part of my personal music library, which is why I went for only the single disc version.<br /><br />The remastering sounds fine to my ears, no problem there. What is disappointing about the single disc version of the 2012 remaster is how bare-bones it is for packaging. The standard jewel-case is acceptable, but a bit more could've been done with the insert besides songwriting credits and music-publishing info (Zzzzzzzzz!). I know there is a two disc version and a super-deluxe edition available that offers more, but would've it been too much to include an essay on NMTBHTSP's historical importance or some band photos at least . Even the [[ASIN:B000002KIE Warner Bros. CD version]] from the early 90's included more graphics than this. Then again this IS the Sex Pistols and NOT Pink Floyd or R.E.M., where such detailed treatment is to be expected.<br /><br />3 stars for my enjoyment of the music. 1 star for the print content.
B0086700CM|4.0|I think the kids are using it... So far so good. Please consider another review. I cannot tell much about it.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|let me just say this book was almost a complete waste of time and if the 6th book doesn't tidy up the story line I will not be reading anymore of his books
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I would start this review by saying that I'm not a huge Brad Pitt fan. Throughout the years some movies which he starred in I liked, others I did not!.However,  this particular movie he was brilliant!! I love a narrative, so right from the start the movie had an advantage. The story was just fantastic. They took a short story, and turned it into a great movie. Solid acting throughout, a good job of morphing through the decades. All in all just an enjoyable movie and one which my daughter and I role out at least once a year. Just add it to your collection and enjoy it with someone special as I do.
B003YUU6T8|5.0|You will be very happy. Super light and comfortable.....collect them in many colors. They stay remarkably clean and are also washable!!
B008S80OU2|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I am so happy with this Blue Oyster Cult collection I had to say a few words about it. I have been a fan of this band since my teens and have had all of their albums on LP and CD for many years. This new release is absolutely worth every penny. All of the albums have been digitally remastered and sound fantastic. All of the CD's come in mini LP replica sleeves featuring the original album artwork. The CD's themselves duplicate the original LP labels-a nice touch. The box comes with a digital download of four of their concerts from 1980, 1981, 1983, and 1986. When you go to the website to download these concerts be sure to download all of the songs before exiting the site. In this day of digital download releases I really appreciate Blue Oyster Cult and Sony Music putting this collection out in physical CD form. Thank you so much guys!
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I bought this to replace one I had lost and it is so wonderful to have this Sting album back in time for the holidays
B000O8OTNC|4.0|When you consider its size and price, this is a good product. However, I personally wouldn't and don't use the Pocket Pal to sharpen any of my pricier knifes.<br /><br />The carbide and ceramic slots basically shred blades. It's a very micro-shredding, and it does ultimately make your blade sharper, but it's really not ideal in the long run. This is a non-issue for most people who are just looking for a quick and dead simply way of sharpening their cheap knifes, ie: the target audience for this product, but I just thought it was worth mentioning.<br /><br />The diamond rod on the other hand is fantastic for sharpening serrated edges, like on my SOG Seal Pup Elite. I keep it in the front pocket of that knife's sheath.
1878424319|5.0|If you're honest enough to look in the mirror you will love this book.  If not, you won't &#34;get it&#34;.  I would rank this book in the top 3 most impacting books in my life.  It's definitely the shortest, which also makes it the most concise.  I buy a few at a time so I have a copy on hand to share with someone who is looking for some clarity in their life.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This is one of the best DVD's of all time.  I recently saw Bonamassa in Dallas and it, for me, really sucked.  It was so loud.  The lights were so bright and designed to kill the audience... ;-)<br /><br />But this DVD is just the best!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I didn't believe in true evil until I watched this. Amazing performances teamed with a great story line.  This is visual sex without protection.  :)
B00003CXIY|4.0|theres nothing like a little road trip to texas with some college friends.unless you don't have any money,and your in a car your not suppose to be in.this movie is loaded with antics and fun.i seen it on dish,and purchased it,and a 2nd.dvd for a 83 yr. old relative.he loved it and remembered more talking about it than i did.so back to the dvd player for a second viewing.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I just love this show. It is so entertaining, and I always can't wait for the next show to air. I am addicted. The whole cast is awesome.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|as far as christmas movies go this one is up there on my list.i've liked the whole concept of this movie,since i first saw it,all four stars did an excellent job,including the kids.and .the movie has been explained by others,so all i can say is,if you have not seen it.DO SO.
0060853972|5.0|Good Omens is just about the best book either of the two authors have written in my humble opinion. They do really outstanding stuff but this book about a boy growing of age to reach Armageddon is delightful. I have given more than ten copies away to friends. It's like my sister's books, one just finds more and more people who need to read it.
B000LC55F2|3.0|well it made my money disappear.a lot of hype when it came out,so i made the purchase.not the best decision i ever made,but not the worse.it was o.k.,but certainly not worth the price.
B0087URXZU|5.0|It seems rather odd to review an album called \\"Analog Man\\" on a site that is purely online.  But, that irony kind of fits with this album.  It is all Joe, with many songs with tongue firmly planted in cheek.  This is Joe's \\"Full Moon Fever\\" (this is produced by Jeff Lynne as well, and has some of the same elements).  But, this is still a Joe Walsh album.  The title track, Wrecking Ball and The Band Played On are simply great songs with great lyrics.  Joe gets personal at times talking about his family and his alcoholism.  But, then he revs up at the end with Funk #50 (and anyone who has listened to radio in the last 30 years knows this riff), Fishbone (a song that makes no real sense but gives Joe a chance to play some incredible guitar) and And I Try with Little Richard.  There is no Rocky Mountain Way here.  But, a great album nonetheless.
B003UESJ9M|3.0|i purchased this movie only because gwymeth paltrow was the lead actress,and singer,but this film can't hold a light to the movie DUETS she has a great voice.and i like country music.but this movie just did not click for me.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I bought this to protect my Kindle Fire.  It looks good and serves the purpose.  My granddaugter loves purple so I ordered her one as a Christmas gift.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|For anyone who has ever loved a dog or has believed that it is better to complete the race than to give up.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first time I have read a Gillian Flynn novel. It was super suspenseful.  Such an intricate plot but all the pieces fit together perfectly. I will check out her other books since this one was so good.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|How could one NOT love this movie?  It is beyond cute, but has enough there to keep the interest of an adult.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|One of the worst films I've seen all year! Wish that I could get a refund on the rental! Don't waste your money!
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|The story is not supposed to be taken as actual events.  The story is more symbolic than anything else, but it is a VERY good story and the music is mesmerizing.  GREAT date movie!
B00943SQCI|4.0|Johnny Depp has done it again. Well worth the wait to watch this one - glad I made the purchase when I did.
B00000K2UX|5.0|Has new somgs on this CD that the earlier versions did not have. My wife its a big top gun fan and loved the cd for her birthday.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|At this point, we are in the mid-season break. The first half of the season has been strong. This show just keeps getting better.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I'll put it like this, my mom being a school teacher dislikes the thought of children fighting to the death, it's heartbreaking for her. Plus, you cannot get this woman to sit still for ANY movie. One morning I was watching it, she came in... she wouldn't even get up to get her morning coffee! From beginning to end, she sat there captivated by it's events. It was soooooo awesome! I also watch this movie over & over again.
0984999302|5.0|This book offers excellent help. We all marvel at those inexperienced but lucky entrepreneurs, who successfully brought their innovation to consumers at the right time and place and became overnight millionaires, but we easily forget all those who tried and failed. Steve Blank's approach is not only extremely helpful in bringing startup dreams down to earth on solid ground, it also the look-up way in which this book is written. You have a question, you will find the answer in an understandable and informative way. The authors have the skills to structure the startup process in a tangible way, helping potential entrepreneurs to avoid pitfalls and to initiate an enterprise as a robust process on solid foundations.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie does a great job of tying everything together between Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Loki, Black Widow, the Hulk, and Director Fury and setting up for further sequels.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|This was a very exciting book, kept me going to the end. I saw the movie first then read the book and the read was still great.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|What a vivid imagination and understanding of underlying political issues then and now this author has exhibited. Each book in the trilogy just keeps getting better and better.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|A really balanced story incorporating all of the marvel characters. I especially enjoyed the Iron Man and Thor battle with Cap as comic relief.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|The book helps to understand how our beliefs and biology are related and it is a tool to achieve happiness.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Very nice movie so glad I bought it. One of the nicest movie's I've seen if you like a love story.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Cornwell has become, novel by novel, more and more enraptured by computer gobbledegook, and less descriptive of good old crime solving.  The character development of he standbys has frozen.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have taken this hiking, camping, sporting events, and pretty much everywhere.  it holds up very well.  It got knocked of the bleachers at a basket ball game with my lenses and filters inside, with no damage to my gear.  The stomach strap helps take a lot of the weights off of my shoulders.  this is a great product.
0316228532|1.0|I wanted very much to like anything written by JKR as I did read the HP books to my kids & loved them for their craft as well as the \\"ripping yarn\\" quality.<br />I did not find her work intended for adults nearly so compelling.  The writing felt awkward & labored.<br />I guess I need at least one character to like, and this book was chock full of nasties.<br />I felt myself becoming more depressed & more reluctant to pick it up again with each chapter. Finally I skipped to the end to learn that one person whom I might have felt sympathy toward was dead. I didn't bother to finish it.<br />Please try again, JKR!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome but I don't know how to light TNT or go to the nether portal so they need to make it to where I can do this stuff.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game eva i love the fact that you have such a variety of different games an yea
0930289234|5.0|One of my son's high school teachers offered this graphic novel as an option for a reading assignment. He thoroughly enjoyed it, although he said that some of the material is not appropriate for younger readers.
B007HIEBV2|5.0|Has a wonderful variety of sounds, and is great for anyone who likes to tear up the floor.<br /><br />Also good for working.
0446679089|5.0|I just love DeMille and am a huge John Corey fan! Plum Island is a terrific novel! It has the usual ascerbic Corey wit that I love!
030759565X|5.0|I'm a big fan of Deb, and have been following her blog for years. Smitten Kitchen is my go to recipe website when I need a recipe that I can count on for a great result the first try.<br /><br />I've been eagerly awaiting the release of this book, and am very happy with the purchase. Gorgeous photos, and written in Deb's signature witty banter - it's a must have for me.
030758836X|5.0|Very fun book, read it because it was everywhere in the media, it was the perfect beach read for the summer.
B005LAII08|5.0|This is a really good film with a good soundtrack. Good for all ages - not Toy Story 3, but definitely a good movie well worth the watch!
0307341577|3.0|I bought this immediately after reading Gone Girl because I enjoyed it so much. It's a bit dark but not in an overly creepy way and is a good read if you like juicy suspenseful crime novels.
B005LAIGLE|4.0|Not a burner at the theater, but worth the watch. Had some different twists to it to keep it going.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|First science fiction I've read in a while and what a great way to return to the genre. Highly recommended.
B006ISJQ1W|3.0|This was definitely not one of Depp's better movies. Real glad I did not go to the theater to watch and got it on sale.....
B002K99P7S|4.0|i enjoyed it, i think that it ties into the other movies good and that its a good beginning  for x men.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have watched these movies over and over again, and I started watching them as a young boy.  This set is a must-have.  If you enjoy The alien movies as much as I do, you will be glad you bought this box set.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|awesome game super addictive.  passed to many hours at work with this game cant put it down down load it right now
B009KKLQKO|4.0|I just purchased and watched the Blu Ray  Video and was disappointed that GOD ONLY KNOWS was left out,  I atteneded the concert last June and the show was great  but that to me was their best song of all time and it was omitted.  The video itself is great,  very good camera work during the show.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I truly  enjoyed the story and the the portrayal of Scotland.  Billy Connolly as a doting father was on the mark.  Pixar has done another lovely story.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|Enjoyed the updated holiday theme.  It is a fun family movie for everyone to enjoy while preparing for Christmas time.
B00377E5SG|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  In many ways better than the Katherine Hepburn version. Harrison Ford is perfect<br />for this part-smooth, cold, and sometimes awkwardly funny.
B000002I99|5.0|This record album was my first AC, loved by me, but bought for my young teen daughter. She lost it somehow, so this was a replacement. Arrived quickly & in good shape.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book. The only part I did not like was the beginning.  I was not thrilled about his religious findings.  I think this part of the book was too heavy. I finished this in 2 days. I will go to see the movie in 3d because the subject with the lion was so interesting.
B001706I5I|4.0|very entertaining it kept my four year old grandaughter seated which is very hard to do. The adults enjoyed it too.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really liked this book. The story telling really kept me enthralled in the book. I read it in a couple of days. I have ordered more of his books because of this one.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I bought this specifically so I could use it with the iPad App from Disney for Tron: Legacy. It wasn't as interactive as I thought but really cool step in technology! If you love this movie you definitely should get the App for the iPad!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham = 5 Stars. Need I say more?  There is not a book he has written that I have not enjoyed.
0979019710|5.0|Every now and then you come across that book that makes a significant impact on your life and Hal's book does just that! It's definitely the\\"Game Changer\\"for creating whatever you chose to focus on. How you start your day is so very important and applying the LIFE S.A.V.E.R. system has you not only looking forward to your day but in a BIGGER way!<br /><br />I was implementing some of the concepts in this book but often times it was sporadic or neglected all together with life's busyness. Now I've learned to set the tone for the next day, the night before. I look forward to quiet \\"ME\\" time where there are no interruptions or excuses...my dog doesn't even want fed at that time of the morning! I love getting up early and often times without the alarm and how accomplished I feel before most people are awake. Everything is put into a simple system and it's been making the difference in efficiency, goal setting, focus, and overall appreciation. This book will no doubt make the difference in how you PLAY this game called LIFE!
0345803485|5.0|This book was my private Mother's Day gift from my husband.  The plot brings you in.  The sex keeps you reading.  Enjoy!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is awesome. at first I wasn't sure if I wanted another teamlava game but as soon as I started playing I was awfully glad I did. unlike restaurant and bakery story, your crops and eggs do not spoil. also, this game has objectives to keep it interesting. I really love this game!
B0000714BP|5.0|Awesome Awesome best purchase ever!  I suggest everyone to get this as soon as possible. You won't regret it at all.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I was actually not expecting much from this attempt. Note: Everytime an artist brags about how they are going to release something great, it usually never is and she went overboard I think saying that it would be the greatest album of the decade (I am paraphrasing here).<br /><br />You definitely have to listen to it a few times to kind of get into it. I am not a huge fan (I do like some of her songs) and had it not been $0.99 I definitely would not have bought it but, because of the price, I decided to take the plunge (better than buying a single or two for $1.29). Most of the songs sound the same...I do like Americano, Hair, and Marry The Night but they are by no means groundbreaking (I like the beats/background). I feel like on this attempt she was just trying way too hard to please all of her fans (which every artist is guilty of) and I feel like she is being too preachy just to be preachy rather than being sincere.<br /><br />Just an okay for me.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is truly a nice little app. I have enjoyed. It is especially nice that it was free.  I usually don't play games, but this helps keep focused.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Will Smith's character J wonders how Tommy Lee Jones's character K got so ornery, but he finds out it is because of a weight K bears for J's safety that he has carried for a long time.  This is a touching storyline that shows that K and J have a longer history together than J thinks.  The aliens in this one are interesting and more developed psychologically than the aliens in the first two MIB movies.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great picture and sound. Not sure it's worth the $4.99 price tag though but overall a good quality matching game.
B003SNKBXW|2.0|Lacks the intensity and perpetual motion of Da Vinci code. Starts off on an interesting premise, but misses the home run by the mile. Characters lack depth. An ok weekend read, but good details for Dumas fans.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This was briliantly done and invites the youth of today to seek more of American History and to ponder upon the past and relivence of the coming future. I am not a vampire movie fan but this was great. Heres to you Tim Burton!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I had seen the previews when this was first hitting the big screen and felt that it was going to be a good one, I was right. It held my interest from the start, the action was great, no dull moments. The best part was that it gave me another insight on the Alien & Predator movies and books, where did it start. But wait this is still not where it started, will there be another movie made showing the gal that survives following the trail back to the beginning, I hope so, I also hope someone really good at making these movies makes the next one just as exciting.
B005HSL626|5.0|playes this game while out on date night with my husband at Dave and Busters.  I enjoyed it so much that I purchased it for my Kindle Fire.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great little game which is highly addictive.  took me 2 nights to complete, but kept me entertained and relaxed playing it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game to fill the gaps of down time that I might have.  I like to compete with family to see who can get the highest score.
