B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is an amazing, touching story! Couldn't help but become emotionally invested in the characters, especially Charlie. The movie was just as good! I recommend this to anyone!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is fun. A great game to keep younger children entertained as well. The only downfalls of this game so far has been that it makes you wait between lives in order to keep playing and it will ask you to log in using facebook in order to give you more lives. I`m sure the full version will not require you to wait between lives. Other than those 2 reasons this game has been a fun game for free!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it gives me something to do cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love love love. Please give us more to read. I cannot wait to see what kind of movie they will make out of this!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is so fun I would even pay for it. It is the best game I have the end
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|arrived in good time and good condition .the quality was good. the colour. reproduction<br />it was just not as funny as I remembered maybe upon 2nd visit it will of regained it's sparkle everybody looked good performed well<br />I suppose I was looking for the bells and whistle's maybe I can add more check back the cuz
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It was really great at the start but then I started a game with someone we and they were calling me bad words so I wish they could have a report on someone button and you could press that button and that person should be a punishment.
B0019IB0II|4.0|This is the second time I've read this book for a study group. I liked it even more this time. The first few scientific chapters are a bit tough, but her lessons of recovery and our ability to take charge of how we can choose to use our brain is inspiring. Certainly anyone who cares for stroke victims should absolutely read this book Any caretaker should read this as well.
B009KEN87O|4.0|It is a fun, fun, fun game. It is fun. Easy and fun. I enjoyed this game. It is fun.
B000W9399S|5.0|I love the Discworld series, but it's more than that. With well thought out characters and a truly unique look at life, Terry Pratchet lampoons everything from the government to Death himself.<br /><br />Whenever I need a good escape from the daily grind, Pratchet is one of my first choices.<br /><br />In this, the first novel of the Discworld, Terry Pratchet introduces us to a whole new world of fun and excitement - with tongue stuck thoroughly in cheek the whole time!
B005LAIH54|3.0|Plot:<br />It's a decade since the events of the Clash of the Titans. The demi-god (half-humna, half-god) Perseus has become a fisherman, raising his son alone because his wife has died. His father Zeus warns him that the time of the gods is coming to an end and tries to recruit him to the task of ensuring his granfather (Zeus' father) Cronus does not escape Tartarus and bring death to all. Perseus refuses and not long afterwards all hell breaks loose (literally). Therein follows a quest to make things right again - and maybe kick a few monster and divine butts.<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />- the special effects were superb<br />- the cinematography was great<br />- it has fierce giant monsters (who doesn't love fierce giant monsters!)<br />- the costume design for the Greek warriors felt just right<br /><br />Things I disliked:<br />- the film felt brutal and rugged at most times and the few attempts at either humour or intimacy were incredibly poorly done. At first I blamed the scriptwriter or actors, but when I re-examined those scenes where these things belonged I found them there and the actors attempting them. Hence I could only find fault with the director who was unable to convey them to the audience. Truly, if these things had been evoked this would have been so much better a film because without them it was difficult to find the characters engaging.<br />- the sound-track was completely forgetable.<br />- the dialogue was a bit average<br />- the emotional entanglement between Perseus and Andromeda required a lot more work in the script<br />- so much of the landscape was bleak and stoney<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Buy it, watch it if you like fierce giant monsters and great special effects but have no particular need for character engagement.
B00821OX98|4.0|I just started watching Falling Skies on Prime and it seems like a good show.  Still more to watch.  I can't wait to watch more of this season!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would have liked to know that there was going to maybe just maybe be an upgrade. The upgrade is cool. These games are easy after a while.Everyone should get this game. I recommend this game for temple run fans.<br />Free
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|\\"Evil Dead\\" is great! This is how the story goes: In the much anticipated remake of the 1981 cult-hit horror film, five twenty-something friends become holed up in a remote cabin. When they discover a Book of the Dead, they unwittingly summon up dormant demons living in the nearby woods, which possess the youngsters in succession until only one is left intact to fight for survival.<br /><br />The cast led by Jane Levy (as Mia) & Shiloh Fernandez (as David) is great. The directing by Fede Alvarez (also did the screenplay) is great. The screenplay (based on the original 1981 screenplay / story by Sam Raimi, who also produced the film) by Alvarez & Rodo Sayagues is great. The film, of course, was produced by Raimi, Robert Tapert & of course, Ash himself, Bruce Campbell.<br /><br />The music by Roque Banos is great. The cinematography by Aaron Morton is great. The film editing by Bryan Shaw is great. The casting by Sari Knight & Mandy Sherman is great. The production design by Robert Gillies is great. The costume design by Sarah Voon is great. The prosthetic design by Roger Murray & make-up design by Jane O'Kane is great. The set design by Alistair Gillies is great. The special effects supervised by Jason Durey is great. The visual effects supervised by George Ritchie is great. The stunts coordinated by Shane Dawson, Allan Poppleton & Erika Takacs is great.<br /><br />This is a great and well-made, well-crafted remake that is entertaining and also an interesting companion piece to the original 1981 film. Fede Alvarez makes a great directorial debut with an interesting choice of film to do, with the help / guidance of Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert & Bruce Campbell. Jane Levy & Shiloh Fernandez give solid performances as Mia & David. This is one of the best horror films of the year, thus far. It is also one of the better remakes, horror film or not, in recent memory.
B000TRXRUY|5.0|This is probably the best film bruce lee ever made. His other films for the most part were low budget and only served to show his skill as a martial artist but this had a much higher production value. It was done in english not dubbed, it had great audio, and outstanding martial arts choreography.
0670023329|5.0|I brought this book home from the library and started reading immediately.  It at times made me ill and at times very angry.  I would recommend this book as a teaching and learning tool for ages fourteen and up, possibly in schools.  At this time we must know all we can about North Korea and this gives us some insight into the camps there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game! The only thing I do not like is how long it takes to get to a new level.No rewards for collecting all of the trophies?
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app is the best! It is definitely your alarm clock! Even if the app is not running your alarm will go off! You also can leave the app open all night by keeping your device on and charging!
0792163710|5.0|Shane is a movie that never grows old for me; each and every time I watch it...it is again like watching it for the very first time.  Jack Palance or Walter Jack Palance as he was known at the time, plays the bad guy like nobody else can...and brings a whole new dimension to \\"PROVE IT!\\"  Alan Ladd plays his role convincingly showing the viewing audience a kind and compassionate man, though a man with a dark past, who can be driven to violence when provoked.  Van Heflin; Jean Arthur; and Elisha Cook, too were quite impressive in their roles...and newcomer young Brandon De Wilde held his own with the best of them.  De Wilde in his acting career would play in such classics as Hud and In Harms Way.  Shane is such a great movie, if I had two more thumbs it would get this reviewer's four (4) thumbs up review!  \\"Watch it and have a viewing experience you'll never forget!\\"
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I read this book straight through and enjoyed it.  I do not &#34;normally&#34; read such books; however, I wanted an &#34;escape&#34; and this book provided just that.  Very good.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Like a Facebook game these days you run out of lives and have to wait for a certain amount of time to elapse for more. Other than that the game is fun you just can't play it for a long time at a time.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|If you are a writer or aspire to write this movie will lift your spirits. I have seen it several times and it always puts me in a good mood. Follow your dreams and your heart.... listen to Hemingway and avoid the pedantic one.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I've read this book twice and it's amazing to read about what the media doesn't report on.  Chris Kyle was a great patriot and I'm certain he is missed deeply by many.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|After I got this app I'm playing it 24/7 and I'm happy because it was not an internet I will go everywere
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This app is so fun i play it again and again and again the best thing is the game doesnt stop the first time you make a mistake
B0000793ZC|5.0|The energy on Simple Minds Live in the City of Light is just astounding.  There is not one single bad track on this 2 record set, it NEVER gets boring or tedious. I've been listening to this thing since it was released back in the late 80's and maybe it isn't in constant rotation anymore and hasn't been for some time - BUT... whenever I come back to this collection, it ALWAYS sounds fresh and fantastic. Lisa Germano's contribution on Someone, Somewhere in Summertime adds something magical that can make me tear up every single time I hear it. In many ways this release was the zenith of Simple Minds; it's such a shame they somehow let it all slip away... they are still around and still make some good music... I even met Jim, Charlie and Mel in Denver CO on the Real Life tour but felt the energy had definitely dropped off a bit by then with Michael's departure.  In my mind this was just the top of the top of the top of the heap.  The musicianship, the energy, the whole vibe is just fantastic.  so good that this is the 3rd... maybe 4th time I have purchased it (just purchased this remaster.<br /><br />Oh and I certainly agree with an earlier reviewing that many of these songs from New Gold Dream, Sparkle in the Rain and Once Upon A Time are better experienced in this live setting.  Just a wonderful wonderful set that I will NEVER get tired of.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I watched this movie with my 5 year old and she loved it. Her favorite character was Sandy. I would recommend this to other families with children.
B0054JELTI|5.0|Love this movie ever since I was younger. The quality and sound are great and no problems with color etc.
B008OOYALE|1.0|The android version. has too many problems,  it's slow playing,  doesn't have all the cool things - such as trading,  and some of the dragons. It used to force closing now and then, now it's. doing it every time I try to visit some people. Very frustrating! I'm. glad I kept it on my iphone!
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This book is much like Hosseini's first; An emotional story about war torn Afghanistan and the plight of those within it. It's a page turner for sure, but it is not a light read.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I had seen the movie and wanted to read the book.  It was very touching.  Brought tears to my eyes.  I recommend the book.
B0054SMID0|5.0|A lawyer first recommended this book cause it really does portray what it is like for a criminal defense lawyer much of the time.  And it is well written, not easy to find.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I thought the movie was amazing and sad to realize the fighting that occurred during that time in our History of the United States.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I have really enjoyed the whole series and I can't wait for this fall for the next in the series.
0439023513|5.0|I fell in love with so many characters that having this book be about war broke my heart. I loved it, but so many deaths left me crying that I could barely put it down. It is the best one because the characters realize who they are and Katniss realizes how many things she took for granted. But is much more humor in this book than the first. All in all this book is a must-read.
B008YI91HS|5.0|A long time ago when I first saw Jurassic park, I knew that for the rest of my life I would be afraid of Velociraptors and so I was.<br />That said this is a excellent movie.  Everything is very well done and fits perfectly.  In closing I would like to say Velociraptors are going to get us all.  Fare thee well.
B0007TKH66|4.0|For for a myriad of reasons, I've never seen even a single episode of this series. However, I do have the entire original collection as well as The Next Generation collection. Star Trek Enterprise didn't, for me, generate the bond to the characters that the earlier series did but, in all fairness, for a franchise that has been around as long as Star Trek has, maybe this was to be expected. I will end up buying all four seasons.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|if you dont have this app then you need to get it your life depends on it plz its free
B0053TMP24|5.0|I have really enjoyed the whole series and I can't wait for this fall for the next in the series.
B000MR1V22|5.0|This movie is about a family who is dysfunctional. They have 2 weird kids, an inappropriate grandpa, and some strange parents. I won't give anything away, but even they have fun. This is one of those things that you just can't help but love and watch over and over again.
0307950654|2.0|I have never read a book by Jane Austen, although I'm quite familiar with the films based on her novels, especially the Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth.  I have also never read any of P.D. James' books, but I read this because of her excellent reputation as a mystery writer, and I love mysteries.  Am I the only person who guessed the killer about one-third into the book?
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Although the plot is formulaic it is appealing with an imaginative setting, the world of video game characters. It has all of the movement of video games so it is fast-paced.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a fabulous app!! This is certainty not a waste of money. One thing you should add is villagers on April 17,2013. I'm dying to get it! People who are reading this definitely get this app!!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Very good quilality!!! came fast in the mail also!! Love the extras!!! One of my favorite shows!!!! packaging was great also
0439023491|5.0|.  I think I speak for everyone when I say we loved the \\"Hunger Games\\" , but I like this book even more! I fell in love with the characters and I couldn't put it down. I finished it twice in one day!  The rebellion and the Games left me shocked. I will say that Peeta is way to love-sick, and Katniss is kind of a jerk. But that is okay since the story rules!
B007R41E8O|5.0|So far I'm enjoying this game. I like the scenery and the storyline. I can't wait to see what happens in the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like subway surfer as the destinations are amazing. I also like how you can upgrade your powers so that they last longer. I would recommend this game to anyone who has played temple run as it is very similar to this. Anyone should buy this as it is enjoyable for anyone who's everyone. Purchase now.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My three year old son is enjoying this application. Each level offers a new variety of questions which helps keep his interest. Would recommend.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Excellent and only just the beginning a must read for everyone.  Moore,Kirkman,Adlard and Rathburn are the best starting a new rave.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Best of all the &#34;tap&#34; games I've tried. But after awhile, the only variety is the different animals you can collect. Game play and goals stays the same.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm addicted!! I love this game! It is now one of my favorite games! Definitely going to have to download this one! I play it every day!
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|Well first of all ,I am from Quebec City,I met Celine she awe twelve and since then she keep getting bigger and better.this album is by far the best French album of all.i would recommended for any Quebecois to buy it you won't regret it and Celine q deserve to have the album  Most sold in the history.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The characters relive their lives in a way that makes the reader also examine their past. Not finished yet, but on my best books list.
B002N57KG2|5.0|Whether you're a fan of Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, fast cars, or racing, you are sure to love this movie with an all-star cast of well-known actors and actresses.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is sick. So much more adicting than temple run. If you have played subway surfers Rome it save your items into th new subway surfers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's really fun I like everything about it it's fun because my horse is playful and loveable.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Really enjoyable on a scene-by-scene basis, but there was no real story here, just a bunch of scenes of a couple dealing with turning 40. Still enjoyed watching it, but if you're looking to be swept away by a story, this one's not for you.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|The movie was visually appealing, however, it was the same scene over and over again. They get into a life or death situation, just barely get out alive. Then they travel for 5 minutes and get into another one. Hardly any character development in between.<br />Meh, its ok.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Any fan would lave to have this collection of movies starring old favorites as Spock, Scotty, Bones, and Kirk.  Admittedly, the first and fifth movies I thought were rather dumb and dull, it just wouldn't be a proper collection without them.  The bonus DVD, 'Captain's Summit' is an interesting addition as it's more of a discussion with the many of the characters from both the original series as well as the Next Generation where they share their thoughts and opinions on not only the movies, but each series and the parts they played in them.  All in all, a really nice collection and at a price that can't be beat; I've looked.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Nexus is not well designed if you need to charge and listen by earphones at the same time.  This allows you to free up the USB and avoid this situation of two plug-ins competing for space. I am not sure if it charges faster, but it does not matter, I leave it connected most of the time and hence it is seldom needing an emergency charge. It comes off easy, almost too easy, but if it did not, it might snap given its location while using.  So, I will be ordering another one to serve as the primary means to charge my Nexus 10.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|It's a neat game but very glitchy and boring. Don't let the other ratings and reviews fool you. Ice age village is  just another game you shouldn't waste your time and energy on. I highly DON'T recommend this game.
0307719774|5.0|Journal gives short prompts for daily writing. Fun way to capture the mood of a given day and to compare responses over five years.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's a good game still playing it . I got addicted to it for a min . But I came out.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|A classic thriller that is semi-based on a true story and with a music score that is sure to bring chills to anyone who hears the music.  And don't be surprised if, when walking on dry land, you inevitably turn around to check for the fin of a shark.  Even my cats leave the room when they hear the music of Jaws.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Cute puzzle app really keeps you thinking.  Fun for kids and adults alike.  I've experienced no glitches during use on my Galaxy S III.
B009S33I68|4.0|I like this type of book. A detailed overview of the events on the Ia Drang battle. A good background for the events occuring in this era.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|A great Star Trek series cut to short, just when it was getting interesting. One of the best spin off series.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|This album is pure epicness. Jesse comes back to Killswitch with epic vocals and just rapes these songs. Adam D and joel never disappoint when it comes to the rifffs and solos. I recommend this album to anyone who loves old killswitch as well as Howard days.<br />Cant wait t get tickets to see these guys.
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|What was Weber thinking when he created this sequel?  Was he drunk or something?  The storyline does not follow in line with the original Phantom of the Opera.  Had I known this beforehand, I would not have purchased this for my mother who is a big fan of the Phantom of the Opera (featuring Gerard Butler.  In my opinion, they could have done MUCH better.
B004KA9UXO|5.0|Dune is one of the sci-fi classics that I managed to completely miss, until now.<br /><br />The tale of a planet and a three generations of a family, with religion, politics and conflict finely intertwined. Some of the slightly middle-eastern and European approaches (the Ramadan, the landsraad) bring it a familiarity and make it easier to relate to the characters in that strange, desolate Arrakis planet.<br /><br />A final mention on how the one-on-one fights are described, with the thoughts and observations of each of the intervenients and spectators mixed with the action, making them a fascinating read.<br /><br />If you like science fiction, or a good novel with political overtones, read this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As a huge fan of the Resident Evil video games and movies, The Walking Dead is the TV series I've been waiting for.  The writing, directing, acting, and effects are all top notch!  If you haven't seen it yet, you will be hooked after the first episode!!!
B001D0DQUC|3.0|It's an old movie.  I bought it so the grandkids could watch it when they were here visiting.  I remember their parents liking it years ago.  Still funny.
1419701533|3.0|while these used books were very in good shape, they cost more with s&h than in a local store. plus waiting for them...
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This one blew me away.  The way in which it was done felt more like watching an actual movie as oppose to just seeing another play up close.  And Gerard Butler; for someone who has had no voice-training and a Scottish accent, you'd never know it and he brings in just the right amount of emotion to the character of the Phantom.  In my honest opinion, they could have left out one of the many times Christine told of her father's promise of an angel of music watching over her (was repeated almost four times) and kept the deleted scene of the Phantom singing, 'No One Would Listen' in as I think it would have really added that extra something to the storyline, but then they didn't ask me.  Still, I would highly recommend this one to any Phantom of the Opera fan.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Fabulous movie. If you like scary and mysterious movies, this one is right up your alley. I didn't see the ending coming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfer. I play it almost every single day. It is amazingly fun to play and very addicting. I like how the the place your running through changes, it makes the game more exciting. Every time I die I have an urge to play more and to beat my high score. It is really fun. I recommend it to everyone!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|A very well written season with the perfect actor for Frank Underwood. Kevin Spacey is electrifying and the new technique of having him talk to the audience directly in small asides is nothing short of a brilliant fit.<br /><br />The series itself portrays congressional/political dealings in a very frightening manner, I fear that this is probably closer to the truth (but with more pizazz) than many other attempts to capture the nature of our government.<br /><br />This series has tremendous promise and i expect it to keep up its HBO style quality in season 2.
1419700049|1.0|there was no space to write anything on it. i ended up buying a new one in a local store, but at the same price.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My three year old daughter started enjoying watching the Sofia series on Disney Junior. So she actually started watching the after story before watching the movie. Nevertheless, this movie is very cute. Very fun for your little princess and the DVD has a sing along special feature where you can show the words kareoke style during the movie, or watching the songs only skipping the movie.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|new updates make the game run better. at first was not allowing  allies to send and receive gifts.  other small things but good platform.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My score rises really slow. If my friend && I start playing at the same time they'll be at like 20,000 within seconds && I'll still be on like 5,000.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Not as impressive as Casino Royale. Some more &#34;over the top&#34; Bond action, but a little too drawn out for my taste.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is the a great movie.  I saw the play on Broadway and the movie does it wonderful justice.  The singing and acting is spectacular.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like the first temple run but when I heard about this on my reaction was yessssss it a little bit glitchy  but not enough to bother you and i like how its more of a challenge then the first one was
B000P0J0G0|5.0|Surprisingly, it's my teenage sons (17 & 15) who absolutely love this program!  The humor is so dry that it is hilarious!  I'm sure it's a matter of &#34;taste&#34; but we find this very entertaining.  We also like &#34;I love Lucy&#34; and &#34;To the Manor Born&#34; but we don't like Benny Hill.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'd give it a lot more stars than five! It's a really cool app! I recommend this for ages 7-14! Minecraft is a easy fun game for kids! The free version doesn't have as much features, so you should get this!=)
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Well developed characters and plot. One of the better, more believable Bond movies. You won't be disappointed by this one!
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|Though it says a review must contain at least twenty words, the reaction to this can be summed up in two:  \\"OUCH\\" and \\"WHY?\\"  Painful as ever to hear more than 2 notes and if anyone can come up with a reason how this collection of hacks is still allowed near a recording studio, you can start to answer the \\"WHY?\\" part.  Every single attempt at music by this NJ embarrassment has been to try to copy anything that Springsteen had done, be it harder rock than these spandex/hair banders could ever dream of (even with noted song doctor hack Desmond Child finishing all their songs for them), a feeble attempt at Americana/country and now another johnny-come-lately (or is it 'jonni' for the spelling-challenged fan base?) effort at social commentary after \\"Wrecking Ball\\" set the bar higher than these clowns can even see through a telescope.  From the people who brought you the shopping bag-inspired \\"Have a Nice Day\\" comes this collection of flat, banal, tuneless dross that will be lapped up by the females who can only explain their popularity by \\"how cute they are\\" or \\"they are such nice guys\\" which only adds to the tone deaf explanation for any success achieved outside of friends and family.  And after all these years of playing the tough guy poser with the phony growl, isn't it about time he passed that kidney stone?  Because singing every note like you are in agony only passes that agony on to the rest of us.  Take a cue from Bruce's song and go \\"Bye Bye Johnny\\" please.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|Purchased online streaming and unable to stream the entire video after purchase! Also purchased season 2 but never got delivered. Somehow it disappeared in the mail so I purchased online streaming for season 3 instead. Horrible, horrible, horrible!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book is just as good if not better than the first with more twist and turns then the first!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Ok people the adds aren't there on purpose FUN game FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|after watching this movie and understanding this movie is based on a true story,<br />i think it was very well made and showed what really happened to the guy and<br />the sex therapist was played very nicely and true to the part by helen hunt
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this is not a waste of space!!!! Even I'm saying this and I'm 11......its even better than leps world 1 I have both on my kindle
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis great. Excellent acting by all.  Very good movie.  Recommend to anyone who wants to see a good movie with a good script.
B005K17RU0|2.0|App may work on a small screen, but it is very poor for the larger Kindle fire hd. Left blank.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I knew that subway surfers was to good for me when I first heard about it.And man was it awesome!!!!!!!!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Pros<br />Charges fast<br />Really fun to use<br />Convenient<br /><br />Cons<br />Should have logo to show which way to plug to charger in<br /><br />Overall, excellent charger.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I know that this is a business book and it does have good business references, but I actually found more value in reading it as the parent of two preschoolers.  It causes you to think about the opportunities that you give your kids that will set them up for success.  Great read!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|very good as entretainment, and there is a point where you can say stop enought and let the angry bird rest!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great series, once I started reading it I really didn't want to put it down.  This was a great addition to my kindle library.  Now the wait for the conclusion of the series in Dust.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was amazing a breath taking novel. I couldn't stop reading,every page I turned I was ready for new excitement.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a very helpful game<br /><br />I think all the features about minecraft are insanely awesome<br />You should really check it out
014312093X|5.0|I wish I had read the book before seeing the movie because the book makes more sense than the movie and the characters are able to be more developed.  I like the historical or maybe even personal perspective he gives for the motives behind the characters.
1439190275|5.0|I selected a used book this book was practically new . the seller delivered fast . this book is my new best friend.  its easy to read .its helping me with my un-solveable issue with Gerd.

B0083ZRAJS|2.0|Watch the movie forget reading the book. In most cases I enjoy the book far more than the movie. But this time I liked the movie better than the book.
B005HSG3U6|1.0|cAN'T GET MY KINDLE FIRE TO STAND UP. DIDN'T RETURN IT. FORGOT TIL TOO LATE. WON&#34;t buy another one. won't reccommend
B0000508U6|4.0|I really love about 4-5 songs on this and the others I just kind of tolerate but I like the sad guitar sound and the lead singer's voice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome i love it thank you guy who made mincraft it is really worthet but if you want more people to buy it make the price like $4.99.
B003VDZK8K|5.0|I will not start speaking of Avenged Sevenfold otherwise I will need a website on its own. For the non-metal and rock fans, listen to the classics and drama behind the screaming. If you only hear screaming, heavy metal and rock, you don't have a music ear. The singer Matthew Sanders (M. Shadows) has an amazing talent reaching highs and lows with a strong scream-like voice with no miss whatsoever even live. Thank you A7X for switching me from the Madonnas, Trances, EDMs, and Club Music, to only YOU. Love you, your style, your voices, the talents of the guitarists syncing with the drummer, and the hard work behind each and every song. I hear their Hail to the King new album being released on Tuesday the 27th of August 2013 and it is already pre-ordered. This latest album is inspired by the group gathering and listening to classical music from Bach, Mozart and others, and trying to understand what makes these classical composers so great. And they understood, wrote and produced songs that are nothing but their own style but with a greater classical and drama sense only a music ear can hear. DADT; dgaf
0143117009|5.0|This is one of those books that, after reading it, if one has a sane mind and a clear conscience, he must write a review about as soon as he finishes reading it. I will be short: if you want to understand what happens to others and soon will happen to you if your leaders just sit and do nothing, then read this book ASAP. It has been said ( by Winston Churchill, I am not sure.....and a host of others, so the definite authorship is still in doubt.....) about nations and peoples:&#34; Whoever forgets his past is condemned to relive it &#34;. This stills applies to today's nations and goverments.
1449410243|4.0|Great and witty book. Wonderful for anyone who has little felines in their home. Illustrations are great, comics induce giggles- great for both adults and older children.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I loved this book love it its about Roderick harassing his little brother you have to read  I love this book I recommend it
0439023521|5.0|A captivating fiction. The reader cannot guess what is coming next, keeps sometime glued till the end of the book.
0525478817|4.0|A mixed bag but one that I enjoyed immensely.  I hesitated to read it, afraid it would be too sad and depressing.  But I was pleasantly surprised and couldn't put it down.  It WAS sad, but it was also hysterically funny with clever and engaging dialogue between the characters.  It will change the way you look at -- and treat -- people that have a terminal illness.  Definitely recommend this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it this game helps time go by so fast and it can get very intensive, this is so far the best game I've downloaded
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Is a very fun game I would recommend this to any one who likes any of the temple run games cause its pretty much the same thing but this is just a fun game!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I wanted to like this book, given how it came to market. However, I prefer reading novels with an overarching plot, characters that you get to know and like, and a thought-provoking theme. I either didn't get far enough to see those things, or this book just isn't for me.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|Well conceived well acted movie that makes us reconsider the nature of relationships and intimacy.What is the basis of human connection? What tools do we need?
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Although I basically only bought this for A Thousand Years I found that I liked all of the songs on it.  I don't think that you have to be a Twilight Sega fan to enjoy the music in this Breaking Dawn soundtrack just have a love for good music.  I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun and good for all ages. You run through the subway dodging obstacles and staying away from the inspector. As you go you collect coins (which can buy you New characters, boards, and upgrades) and special items (coin magnet, mystery box, jumpy shoes, jetpack, and score multiplier)
B00B4804KS|5.0|I am writing this review after having seen the 3D-IMAX version of this movie yesterday at the theater.  I can only hope this is the version being released later this month (April 2013).<br /><br />All I can say is WOW! I and my family were immensely pleased. This is every bit as amazing as I remembered it, and then some.<br /><br />The 3D was definitely a benefit here, and it heightened my appreciation of the movie. While of course Spielberg had no inclination that this would eventually go 3D, the movie has several sequences that really seem to have been made specifically for it.  As anyone who has seen the movie can guess, there are all sorts of scenes that almost literally jumped out at the audience in the original, and they're even more super-charged here.<br /><br />While this has to be one of the most-watched movies ever, I'm sure there are many who have never seen it -- in fact, I could tell there were a few in the audience nearby me, as they jumped more than a few times at key moments.<br /><br />What's really terrific is that the 3D was never obtrusive, but only improved the movie and made it more intimate.  It is as if we gained a new sense of experiencing a film beyond regular sight and sound.  And yes: the sound was even more improved as well.  Believe me, it kicked butt.<br /><br />See it if you can at the theater: on the big screen this is mind-boggling. I will bet those with a big 3D screen in their house (and a suitable sound system) will be totally impressed as well, but this was amazing to see on the big screen.<br /><br />It was stunnning: \\"Jurassic Park\\" HAS NOT AGED ONE DAY since it was released 20 years ago. Spielberg's movie is that good. Credit is due his special effects team (Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Phil Tippett and Michael Lantieri), who received Oscars for their work (the movie won two Oscars for sound editing and mixing) and they deserved every penny they earned for their work.  Even on the big screen there was not the slightest hitch with their work.<br /><br />See it at the theater if you can, but I am sure you will love it at home, too. It is an exhilarating movie that hasn't lost a step in 20 years: truly AMAZING!<br /><br />NOTE: It makes you wonder if we'll ever see [[ASIN:B008XBHIEY Jaws]] re-released this way, or [[ASIN:B000VECAD0 Close Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition)]]...can you imagine them as 3D?  One can only hope.with their work.<br /><br />See it at the theater if you can, but I am sure you will love it at home, too.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everyone should play this game. It's really addicting I never wanna stop playing! I hope I make everyone else start playing!
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|WOW Powerful.  Did it again Mr Cage.  Wonderful movie. Oh yes, I think this is a you would be so sorry you didn't add this to your Nicolas Cage movie collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a really good app!!! I love it. it has so many features and is kind of addicting and fun
B00957T6X6|5.0|Very happy with books as well as the HBO series I bought! I have just finished book 1 and starting on book 2.
B007RTAR64|5.0|My daughter AND son play with this doll/action figure (don't tell my son it's a doll!). She looks a lot like Katniss and the accessories are great. Well worth the price.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This thing is so crazy -  love it - addictive - you get started and can't stop.  Enjoy and good luck
0786958731|5.0|My family and I have owned this game for about a month and played it 20 times at least. At first I assumed it wouldn't lend itself to being replayed, but it certainly does. We played the second adventure 5 times before we moved on, we lost three times and won two. Can be a little difficult for beginners to understand if they haven't played a Dungeon and Dragons based fantasy board game before, but there are plenty of places online with videos to explain things you might not understand.  The game really gets fun and challenging when you open the advanced deck for later adventures. Also you can find adventures online if the ones that come with it aren't enough. So far everyone who has played it has loved it. With one of our guests saying it was his favorite game ever. I will certainly be ordering the other two games in this series. 5 Stars. Ease of play 5 Stars, Replayability 5 Stars, Set up for each game 4 Stars (It can take about 10 minutes to set up for game play) The Dungeon tiles would lend themselves to other fantasy games easily. If you are a gamer, buy it. You will love it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Purchased this CD as a gift for my sister and another for myself after I had heard several tracks on the radio.Love the CD, loved being able to purchase it online.
1476733953|1.0|This is not the first time I had high hopes for a book due to the many 5-start ratings and ended up being disappointed. Started out quite interesting, got very tedious after only a few chapters. I skipped probably 3/4 of the book to get to the end, and still don't know, or care, what the deal is on these silos. Once again, I have been suckered and end up thinking &#34;I should've believed the one-star reviewers&#34;
0744014549|3.0|IMO way too many screenshots of the game, not enough of Lara, its a beautiful book though and a must for any enthusiast of the Tomb Raider franchise.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love love love love love love love love love this game! it is amazing and better than temple run and it is also amazing. did i mention that it is amazing yet?
B0058YPILY|5.0|Excellent series.  Can't wait to see the next season.  Enjoy all the characters and show themes.  Really can't wait to see what happens next.  Awesome show.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|My daughter loves this movie so was so excited to receive!  Only complaint is case seems a little cheaply made.
0805092447|5.0|Excellent condition, Came in a reasonable amount of time, My grandson loves the book. The books pages are nice a sturdy for  toddler use.<br />Thank you
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|it is a good game with only one problem. It has no way of spawning the fish again, so after about ten or twenty minutes, your shark guy dies of no more food. otherwise its a good game.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|When a book is turned into a movie/tv show, lots of people judge it whether it did justice to the book or not. According to some the movie wasn't the same as the book and I totally understand your anger but we're reviewing the MOVIE not the book. I loved how finally we get to see the main character as a guy and not some girl who's life is all about a love triangle. I loved Ethan's personality and what he aspired to do with his boring typical life, I think anyone could relate to such thing. The acting was great, it was humorous, the effects were good and the ending is filled with \\"feels\\". What I didn't like about the movie was that Ethan and Lena fell in love too fast even though I like them as a couple but the development wasn't too much. Other than that the movie was everything you expect in a fantasy/semi-romantic movie. Loved Emmy Rossum's character, the one we all should hate but love instead. Anyhow, review the movie by the movie, not the book. \\"It's Kind of a Funny Story\\" was nothing like the book but the movie was amazing.  Books/Movies, completely different things.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I thought this was the one with the long dual gutair solo at the end of hotel california. But staill cannnot find the one I was looking for but the one I got is great also.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Yes I said it,<br />Good premise, bad movie. Sorry Bond. Fell short in my Bond book. But hey, if you a James Bond fan your going to watch it anyway, just like me.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This was an amazing read which inspired me as a young author to peruse my dreams and gave me a good perspective on what I should be focusing on. John not only tells you how to achieve your goals, but also describes in detail how to do it so you to can have a best selling book<br /><br />Thank you John Locke
B00001U0GQ|5.0|I was so surprised to receive the DVD much earlier than I'd expected.  I'm looking forward to viewing the extras in this edition.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book held my attention as it was hard to put down.. I love a book that keeps me guessing as to what is going to happen and with a happy ending.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great show! I've been a fan of Smallville, and since that ended this is a good viable replacement :-) Very exciting!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun amazing best app ever like a real horse
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love My Horse the movements are so realilstick. I also like that there are tips to keep your horse healthy and happy.  I would definitely get this game again!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The series is one of, if not the best thing that has ever been on television.  UK has done it again, I just love it!!
1452105111|5.0|We are busy planning our one year olds birthday party and we are doing a Hungry Caterpillar theme. This is perfect!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Gosh.  I can't say that I've ever gone into a movie with lower expectation and STILL been as disappointed as I was with The Hobbit.  I watched the first 20 minutes, had to stop; watched 20 more, had to stop.  I have another day left on my Amazon Prime rental, and am not planning on finishing it--it's unbearable.<br /><br />To be fair, all of the disappointment comes as a direct result of having had so much respect for and enjoyment of the original three LOTR movies.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It took me some time to get in  the mood for this book.  I usually hate books that have another book that we have  to wait for. With the next book out, I thought why not. It was  a really good book. Can't wait to read the continuation of Travis' thoughts.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|I read Fooled by randomness and liked the author's way of seeing things.<br />Now, Antifragile is some sort of self-help but without new age or religious approach. There's no messiah, no promise of feeling better after reading it, just making peace with the fact that we can't control anything so we must stop making plans, schedules and building our lives assuming that everything goes according to what is expected. Once you realize that chaos and random mess with life more often that you thought, Antifragile proposes a way of facing life where you can gain and become stronger after a huge shock/crisis/black swan and maybe start looking for the next one.<br />A refreshening set of ideas that make this book a must.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|It was a great price and buy at the time my watches have batteries that kept dying so I thought this would be a great solution however I cannot wind it and when I take it off to go to bed it hasn't stored enough power to work the next day or if I don't wear it on the weekend it also goes dead. I am constantly winding it and re-setting the date.
B0012NO4WO|1.0|I have seen this movie countless times on tv and LOVED it!  But now I decide to buy it to enjoy anytime I want to and before it was into the show 15 minutes....................the F word was used about 8 times.  Forget it!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect in this  book but as always  the author does a wonderful job. Thank you!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|The rough, awesome version of getting through life's little ups and downs. The whole experience was solid gold. Cupcakes and cigarettes!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I have really enjoyed this app! I love it when I am watching a movie and I want to know a song. I don't have to wait for the credits to know what song it was.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have nothing bad to say. I was very excited to see all the video blogs on the second disc. I had seen them on theonering.net, but it is great to see those on the big screen too. I am looking forward to the extended version in the fall/winter.
B008B92U32|1.0|It did not work properly on Asus Transfermer TF101a, it would load and choose photo to 'face swap' but after that nothing worked.
1439170916|5.0|Can't put into words how great this book is--it's the best non-fiction book I've ever read. Somehow strikes the balance between being accessible to the layperson without talking down to those more familiar with science and medicine. The book itself is also beautiful, and looks and feels great.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|A very good and relevant book. Right to the point - precise, brief and good advice.<br /><br />Recommended for startups and entrepreneours
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I have read most of these Reacher books now and still really enjoy them but maybe not as much as I used to. An indestructible hero like Superman but with no actual magical powers sounds like a fantasy story but the book bounces around and speeds along with enough twists to keep you picking it up until it is quicky finished. Maybe 3&1/2 stars.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I am in love with this game... i have played both 1 &amp; 2 and I'm waiting for a hopeful samurai vs zombies 3!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Amazing movie, sad to see what's going on in the industry and the government. We try to buy local and organic when we can which should be always.
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie was on my son's short list of movies he might like to own. Buying it from Amazon was easy and it was priced right for the occasion.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Bought this straight after reading Black and Blue about Inspector Rebus and really enjoyed it. As i said in my review of 'Black and Blue' will take me awhile to get used to the endings of the books but I really enjoyed this book and will be buying more. If you like Jack Reacher give one of these Rebus stories a go as they as Rebus is a really different hero but still a bloody good read.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys James Bond movies.<br />The DVD came very well packaged and protected.<br />The cost was resonable.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|... about an extraordinary man. I wish I could have meant Steve Jobs. He will be missed.<br /><br />This book was an easy read and very interesting! I would recommend it.
B0038LB4TE|4.0|Although I loved this book which kept me page turning into the early hours, it left me wishing that I could have known what was on the memory stick!
1616550414|4.0|For a hardcore Legend of Zelda fan, this book is without a doubt worth purchasing.  I'm not sure how much longer it will be out in print, so get a copy (or two) while you still can.  The presentation of the book is astounding for its price - sturdy hardcover, beautiful cover art, and thick, glossy pages within.<br /><br />  It's quite a voluminous book replete with concept art, lore, and designer notes for each individual game in the series.  The only flaw (for myself, at least), is the focus of this content.  There is far more bookspace devoted to Skyward Sword, the newest game in the series, than any other game.  Perhaps it is because of its recent release that they have more content still around to share, but this was quite a let down for an older fan such as myself.  I was far more interested in seeing the concept art and design theories for games like Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, not only because I think they are superior games compared to the more contemporary releases, but also because I grew up playing these and so I have a stronger connection with them.  Either way, it's a small gripe, and not one that should stop anyone from purchasing this book.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|At first when I received the product/CD I was disappointed that it came in a paper looking cardboard container which held the music. I'm so use to plastic cases that it caught me off guard. However, I folded it out to find these wonder full pictures. It was a very creative layout that the artist and company did for this CD. Not only that but the music was fresh and very different from the last CD. I enjoyed it very much! Also, when you buy it through amazon you get it a digital download of it as well. I thought this to be grand since I could listen to it right away while I waited for the tangible copy to arrive.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|My whole family loves The Walking Dead and everyone has enjoyed watching it.  The only thing we DON'T love is Season 4 doesn't start until October.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This so is amazing I have played it and it is like the older version you cannot change your skin but if you r on the go you will love . It
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written page turner set in suburban Boston (my home-base).  Excellent! Interesting characters and thought provoking theory on &#34;Nature vs. Nurture&#34;.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie gave me diarrhea. I mean, really bad. Only watch this if you (a) have a death wish or (b) are planning on breaking up with your girlfriend immediately after.<br /><br />Beacause I assure you, it will set the mood.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|I nominated it for my book club after reading a review in The Weekend Australian and it came up to the review. All the guys enjoyed reading it and the insights not only into the capture but also into the life and training of a Seal. Well written!
B00C40DJ1G|5.0|I purchased this from bandcamp.com in March and I rate this as one of the best albums of 2013 so far. Spock's Beard has crafted another excellent musical experience in this album that continues on the tradition of their music, mixing an almost stadium rock sound with the complexities and quirkiness of progressive rock based elements. When I listen to this album I usually have to listen to it from start to finish, it's so good it's hard to listen to just a couple/few songs without just playing it all the way through. To be honest I enjoyed Brief Noctures and Dreamless Sleep more than Steven Wilson's The Raven That Refused To Sing (which is a great album in its own right), but I find that BNaDS is more of an entertaining listening experience to me .<br /><br />A heads up for potential buyers, if you're going to buy this either get the 2 CD version or find a place like Bandcamp.com to get the full download version from. The mp3 album here on Amazon is not the complete version, it is 5 songs short.
B000FC0V3E|1.0|I know Ernest Hemmingway is a famous author but, I do not enjoy his books.  He portrays himself as a pompous, &#34;would be&#34;, &#34;near-do-well&#34;, who philanders, wanders European hot spots and acts like a he is someone and something he is not.
0679805273|5.0|This book is wonderful for kids and adults.  It's amazing insightful Dr. Seuss is.  It's full of life lessons for you and the children in your life.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Prefer this model for the side buttons to advance rather than the touch screen.  nice size.  Easy to use and pack..
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I think Jeff Kinney books are so cool. You rock Jeff! I also think books are the best things in the world
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm still reading it.  Can't put it down.  No pleased with the cost of the Kindle version.  Too expensive but I'm hooked on the Kindle as I can read it so easily .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is very fun. You have to be focused tho. Not much to say be its pretty cool I suppose.
B008602KQI|5.0|Follows the book exactly! Excellent movie. It can be watched without seeing the sequels which I wondered about because when I finished the book I had to get the other 2 and couldn't wait to finish them all. It really is a fair rating. The subject matters sounds like it would be rough for teens, but it's really not. It's a great story of bravery, survival and love.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Put this in my Synology DS1812+ and it works just fine. It was about 1/10 to 1/5 the cost of the one from Synology so I definitely suggest getting this instead.
145470246X|3.0|I am an experienced beader and had a difficult time with some of the patterns in this book.  Unfortunately, the editor missed that some of the patterns do not identify bead sizes and fail to include all the steps.  I was able to figure out the patterns missing the steps and bead sizes after studying the pictures for a while. Thank goodness the pictures are good!<br /><br />Why isn't the publisher testing the patterns?
B001QB5SFO|3.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  Have had a VHS copy for years, and watch it a minimum of a few times a year.  But my VHS player died and we decided to upgrade our collection to all DVD's and blu-ray.  The colors on this DVD are somewhat obnoxious.  Some reds too red, and definitely some greens, too green.  And since part of the reason I LOVE this movie is the costuming, the colors being improper is frustrating.  But I will still probably watch it a few times a year until someone comes out with a properly remastered dvd or blu-ray.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Its exciting! Always a new twist cant put it down and the updates are wonderful....I would recommend this game to all ages...
B004EBT5CU|5.0|she is such a great singer, I am enjoying my CD very much, and I look forward to her other CD's in the future!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This film is in my top ten movies of all time. I love the performances and it has a heart of gold. A must see!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I choose this book because I have heard it was a very good book that was recommended by my teacher .This book should be a great book for readers who have deep feelings in their hearts.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I bought this movie for my 15 year old sister yesterday because she had been begging to see it and raving about how good all her friends said it was. I'm not really a film person and as long as something is entertaining I'm fairly easy to please so I went into this movie without any real expectations.<br /><br />I know Les Miserables because I read the book in college and as a kid I really liked singing to the soundtrack. I thought the opening scene was decent despite weird CGI in the beginning and I settled in to enjoy the film. Thirty minutes later I decided that I couldn't take it anymore and walked away.<br /><br />The frequently off-pitch and weak singing was driving me up the wall to the point that I couldn't stand listening to it anymore. Maybe it's just because I'm vocally trained that this bothered me to the extent that it did, but I just could not deal with it. I then looked up the movie online out of simple curiosity and was astounded to find that the general public loves this movie beyond all belief.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I know the storyline, I am moved by the storyline and I really like the songs in this musical and have since I was a child but I cannot understand why they chose to make people who obviously can't sing try to sing. It's painful and I found myself cringing in embarrassment for the actors the entire time I was watching.<br /><br />Reading all the reviews I found out that they didn't edit their singing so that it was more \\"honest and raw.\\" I get and respect that but for the love of god why didn't they choose to cast people who can sing AND also act? It's a musical for crying out loud. Some degree of technical musical proficiency should be a requirement. The fact that they chose to forgo this route in lieu of casting a bunch of easily recognized, A-list, money drawing names just makes me lose respect for this movie. To me it seems like this \\"unedited\\" gimmick is really just a cop-out and a way of making mediocre and even bad vocal performances sound deep and artsy. Honestly, if Broadway performers are required to give raw unedited technically sound live performances on a regular basis than this movie definitely shouldn't be given a pass.<br /><br />That being said I don't think the movie was horrible. It was aesthetically pleasing, the story line it retold is obviously a classic, and the actors are all visually appealing. However, to me there is nothing groundbreaking about this film. The story line can be read in its original form for a more powerful emotional impact, the songs (which are the backbone of the musical) have been performed far more adeptly many times before, and there are so many pretty Hollywood films already that adding another one isn't anything terribly impressive. In summary, it was a passable movie but it really doesn't merit all the hype that it's receiving.
B0064QNS62|5.0|it ok and I like it very much so dnt take it off here it a good gamethnk u much
B005NJU8PA|2.0|I don't appreciate the radical far left commentary thrown in so far.  I don't need to be told how to think.  I just wanted to learn to cook.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|An enthralling tale that takes you to where every good author should, with brief yet elaborate words that really leave you thinking what is it to be a human.

0736092269|5.0|This is the detail you've been looking for. Men and women are both covered. Each muscle group is shown to you. Each group has exercises explained with proper positioning and what to expect when done wrong and how to fix it when it does go wrong. That's right, rehab is covered.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Obviously the writer knows psychology, ( I've read it was her Major) because ALL of her characters have mental problems and behave as folks with those problems would behave (I had a Psych Minor).It was interesting to have a &#34;heroine&#34; who wasn't the strong perfect person we find in most of todays books.A very depressing story but so well written I couldn't stop reading.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game subway surfers is a very fun game to play. There are two different versions of subway surfers. The two different subway surfers are subway surfers:Rio, and Sydney
B000J103PC|4.0|Good movie.  Brings to the forefront the things people go thru to make serious money and the losses they suffer with front chasing the buck...
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was a great story that left me thinking about its core issue long after I put it down. I'd recommend taking it on a long flight or reading it during a rainy weekend. It's a quick read that tugs at your heart strings.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The plot was fascinating, the writer kept the story flowing...BUT the descriptions of each animal being killed in more detail than a CSI tv show....being torn apart and eaten while still alive....not just 1 but over and over throuoghout the story. If the writer was trying to turn us into Vegetarians, he certainly made a good start. Ok, I understand he was against brutality and created an anology with animals representing humans and humans behaving like animals. I loved the movie....the same exact plot, but they didn't show close-ups of what happens when a hyena, tiger or starving human eats his screaming prey alive. Too bad because the search for God in all religions by the boy was beautiful and the miracle of survival was exciting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved it because the game has different characters and you get to choose your person if you get enough coins.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|A classic.  Nothing more can be said.  Kierra Knightley is wonderful in this movie along with many others.  I have seen it with other actors but I beleive this is the best.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|even if you are a adult you still will enjoy this fun game with all those challenging turns its cool but the awesome part is when you can change the characters I am telling you you will enjoy this game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing I love being able to take care of a horse or I guess my own horse. Try it
B005COO1X6|5.0|I have to admit, I love the Stephen King horror books most. The great writer that he is creates the scenes directly in your head as if you were there witnessing the horror with the characters. This story was one of those simple but complex stories that I wished was much longer than it was. I would have enjoyed it as a full length novel.
B007FXLWKW|5.0|kids love it cant stop them from watching it. Very funny and to me is a great family movie i really recommend it
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not without flaws — here I'm thinking of the yellow-card man portion of the story. It's almost an alien/advanced civ theme. Why go there? The evidence of Jake's changed world would have been enough.<br />Hard to explain the portals, but it's fiction. Why work too hard?<br />On the whole, the story was excellent and kept me burning through it until I finished — even the second time around.
1401937519|5.0|This is a very, very special book - it shows why self-love is so important. It's simply a state of being...
B004NOH9LC|5.0|A great movie to watch when you're in the mood for something fun, light-hearted and amusing. Appreciated how clean and family friendly the movie is. Definitely enjoyed watching it with my hubby.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Before I Go To Sleep had me hooked from the first page. I can't remember when I last read a book I can say that about. I enjoyed the way the tension mounted. A new &#34;memory&#34; by the main character would come charging in on her and on me at the same time. I would often think: &#34;Now how does THAT fit in?&#34; Early on I knew something was &#34;off&#34; about the story as presented to the woman with amnesia but I did not figure much of it out until reading the actual page on which a new revelation was made. My imaginary movie score was definitely in a minor key from the beginning. Rarely do I think I will read a book a second time but this one is a possibility.<br /><br />I read this right after I read Until I Say Good-bye by Susan Spencer-Wendel. Together these books have made me grateful for my life and my memories. Until I Say Good-bye is about a woman who knows she will be dying from ALS and sets about creating memories for her family and friends. The main character in Before I Go To Sleep can't remember anything about her recent life when she wakes up every morning. Both of these books depict the human being working hard to make sense of their days and to find their way to a future they believe can be better.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Excellent book about the true hero's of the United States of America. Thanks to each and every one of them.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|The Avenger's<br /> Before I critique this movie, in all fairness I am writing this review without watching Captain America or Thor. I also know nothing about Black Widow and Hawkeye. I never even heard of them until this movie. With that being said, the movie did a good job of making that of little importance. I'm sure I would have been more interested if I had seen them but I was easily able to follow the story line.<br />The story was the typical super hero movie. There is a bad guy and a good guy (in this case several) that fight to destroy the world or save it. I am not saying this is a bad thing though, it's what you expect and want. Everyone loves a hero, especially because they are fighting to save us.<br /> Some of the acting was bad, like Mark Ruffalo. I am comparing him to the other Hulk films. In 2003, Eric Bana played the hulk. Which I thought was awful, not just him, the entire movie. Then five years later, Edward Norton played the hulk and he did an excellent job. With Mark, throughout the movie was unbelievable as the nerdy scientist, Bruce Banner. I feel the same way with Samuel L. Jackson but only because when I see him I always think of \\"bad fother mucker\\" from Pulp Fiction. My second thought is Jedi master Mace Windu. So I guess I wouldn't say it was his acting just the role did not suit him.<br />The action was great. There is a scene when they first meet Thor. He tries to rescue Loki so he can handle the justice himself. The cocky character of iron man, well played by Robert Downey Jr., does not take well to that, so he chases Thor down and they end up trading blows. With Thor being a Demi God, Iron Man certainly holds his own. At the end, sticking with the typical super hero story line it looks like the bad guy is going to win, but the hero's save the day. The scene is great though. A lot of action in it and with each hero having their own skill it is not just throwing punches. The director manages to keep if fresh and entertaining.<br />The movie overall is fun and entertaining, but with today's cheap rental services I wouldn't go out and spend twenty dollars on it. You are better off waiting for Redbox to have it or Netflix. Or just wait till someone you know to buy it. With its popularity I am sure it will be in your pathway soon, but if you love marvel and all the prequels to this movie I could be completely wrong it your twenty dollars will be well spent.

1432794426|5.0|(My dear friend Myrna Ramos asked that I post this on her behalf.)<br /><br />This is just the book I was looking for!<br /><br />People say so many incorrect things about Michael Jackson - and most of them are not true.  But it happens because of the yellow media and the tabloids that repeatedly lie and for such a long time and it is becoming the \\"copy and paste\\" truth.<br />Dr. Karen Moriarty's Defending a King, His Life and Legacy has created for us a master piece.  We can finally breathe a sign of relief and be in peace with this beautiful tribute to our king!<br /><br />Dr. Moriarty reveals many special and unknown stories that we can now treasure, and she does it with the support of a long-time investigation.  Michael`s human side and his artistic and humanitarian legacy are treated with so much love, respect and care.<br /><br />I am deeply delighted with this extraordinary life.  In the pages of this book I can find who Michael Jackson was, IS and will be as the best entertainer, musician, dancer, singer, composer of all times and, of course, the best \\"daddy\\" in the whole world.<br /><br />That´s why this is the book I was looking for.  Now it is resting in my hands and blessing my heart.<br /><br />To Dr. Karen Moriarty:<br /><br />Thank you so much, Karen, for this amazing and humble gem that you share with all the people who sincerely want to know about the man that gave us so much with the only desire to make us happy. Dr. Moriarty, you are definitely a singular, generous and beautiful woman.<br /><br />God bless you and Michael and God bless Robert.<br /><br />L.O.V.E.<br /><br />Myrna Ramos<br />Emotional therapist and author<br />Mexico City, April 6, 2013

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|A different view of the impact of Technology in the economy. Much has been written about the grandiose possibilities of technology and how it has transformed business, government and people, yet very few do it from the perspective of this book. It really opened my eyes to the downside of technology, without vilifying it, but by making an objective analysis of its impact in the overall economy.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Based on  the book, Team of Rivals,  this movie takes two geniuses and outstanding actors to bring authenticity to a part of American history that every American thinks they already know.  Spielberg and Day-Lewis' incomparable talents combine to create  historical characters in front of frightening images of the destruction caused by the five long years of war within ourselves. Sally Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln, using her brave, unaltered face to show the worry for her loved ones the War etched.  The screenplay lets the dialogue support the authenticity of the battles within the leadership of the victorious Union .  Famous for his direction of children, Spielberg coaches Daniel Day Lewis into a time warp that humanizes perhaps our greatest president, so completely, that the assassination is heart-breaking.  The audience is left with the same question historians have asked for 140 years, what would America be like now, if Lincoln had lived to 'bind up the nation.'
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My nine year old grandson wanted this game.  He plays it when he is here visiting and has now mastered it.

B009AMANH4|5.0|I am an admirer of movies with Daniel Day-Lewis but his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln is tremendous. He brings out a side of Lincoln that we have not seen before. It was very interesting to witness the politics that occurred during the re-election process and up to the assassination. Well done!!

B000SEGQNS|5.0|This book provides a handful of recommendations and techniques to make your websites easier to use. The examples are a little bit dated, but the lessons are still valid. Highly recommended not only for web developers but for other professions, such as marketing and communications, that are involved in the development of websites.

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|History Channel teamed up with MGM to produce a series revolving around a Viking willing to break with tradition.  Travis Fimmel creates a central character who processes a way to navigate the open sea.  Braced by his strong family ties, he combines the new technology with his own headstrong pursue of treasure from fabled lands in the West.  Gabriel Byrne plays the Earl, leader of the tribe, to whom all members owe absolute obedience.  The first conflict comes between the Earl and the rebel, followed by the conflict with the bold explorers and the sea, then the people they conquer and steal treasure from.  The excitement is constant and the viewer's interest is captivated by the human element.  This series shows the excellent writing, casting, locations and production values of a movie created for theaters.  The authenticity is surprising from a channel that shows &#34;Ancient Aliens&#34;
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|The book was fantastic because of the twists and turns and how it all concluded to the end of Lena`s story

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play this game every day and it is entertaining love the prizes that you receive and also is very relaxing
B00005JLEU|5.0|Love, love, love Hayao Miyazaki movies and this one is my favorite.  I agree for children it may be a bit scary; my 17 year old son finds it a bit creepy.  I like it because behind the scary is a lot of humor; if you look past the creepy, the scenarios and the character's reactions and comments are very entertaining.  It is also heart warming and the character's are very endearing.  I really like peeking into the Japanese culture that passes by in the background.  Recommend this one highly for periodic viewings.
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|Any major Dexter fan I would recommend this to. Only if they have the time though. This is because having seen every episode ever, this was at least different by the half of the first season. Very key things in things in the first season were not in the original book. What I am saying is the show is much more exciting & suspenseful than this first book. I would however suggest it to someone who wants to know everything possible about Dexter like me, only to see the origin of it all. Sadly, i was disappointed. Thank you Jeff Lindsay for an inspiration to the greatest series ever made to date.

B0002VEPRQ|4.0|Got the (then) new 2-disc DVD of Mary Poppins shortly after it came out 9 years ago (has it been that long already?).  This movie has always been a favorite of mine, and the DVD set does not disappoint, except for one little thing....<br />The default audio is an \\"enhanced\\" 5.1 home theater mix that is notably different than the older sound mix we have been used to for so long.  The dialogue and sound effects are \\"buried\\" beneath the musical score, nearly inaudible at times.  It probably sounds great on the proper audio setup, but something is just amiss for those of us watching this film on a regular television set with 2-channel stereo sound.  Fortunately, there are several audio options for the feature on this DVD: 5.1 enhanced (default); 2.0 enhanced (which sounds just as bad); 2.0 original theatrical mix (this is the one I prefer, as it's the one I'm used to); French 5.1; Spanish 5.1.<br /><br />Otherwise, an excellent set packed with features!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|My husband and I both play this game and love it. It's fun, easy and entertaining. I do wish that it didn't take quite so long to level up  though But i think that's with any game. Looking forward to seeing the under water park.
0140557741|1.0|I just purchased this off of Amazon and the printing is wrong.  All the pages in the book are supposed to be original, and after the bus scene the book reverts back to the first page and continues.  Then it suddenly jumps from the bus scene to the airplane, which made no sense.  I would have not understood why this was had I not searched the web and seen screen captures of how the book should actually flow.  Where is the quality control, Puffin Books?
B0046ECJBY|5.0|it's always good to know your own country, people, and culture, from a different perspective. Kissinger clearly did his work well.

044661758X|3.0|Rating is 3.5 stars.<br />The Concrete Blonde is simply another Harry Bosch mystery with the same old cliche's.  There is enough there to warrant the read if you are really into rogue police detectives that are down on their luck.  Personally, the storyline got a little long in the tooth for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. the only thing I have a problem with is that once the competitions are all complete it gets really boring. add some new stuff

B008OM0M4U|3.0|This is just another one of his crazy movies.  It had it funny moments but at time I found it a bit out there to much for my taste.
B0094K1K8I|3.0|I watch a lot of scary movies and don't get scared easily however I am a nanny and so movies involving children usually scare me more than others. This is the 3rd Paranormal Activity and I didn't love the concept to begin with so by now you know what to expect and it was fairly predictable but there were some parts that really scared me when the demon was messing with the girls. Also, didn't expect that ending which was nice but they still could have done a better one. Clearly I have mixed feelings but if you've seen the first two movies, I think you should go ahead and watch this because it lets you know how it all started and if you haven't seen it then I think you could still get some entertainment out of it because you don't know how it ends making this some scary movie where some demon is just attacking these girls.
B00B23O96A|5.0|For any Clapyon fan this is a definite must to have. The songs are a bit different than what we're used to from him but they are all very enjoyable. Glad I bought it.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I was a disappointed  with the film quality. The image did not fill my high def screen. I found the picture dark and was full of  numerous dropouts and digital artifacts.<br />The movie was interesting in that it covered primarily the congress approval of the 13th amendment much more thoroughly than Doris Goodwin did in her book. The portrayal of Lincoln was excellent.

B0070XFNDE|4.0|This is third book in The Cemetery of Forgotten Books series. I had read the first two with expectations that this book would be as enthralling as the first two. The Prisoner of Heaven picks up with the characters from book one. shadow of the Wind. I felt like this book was just trying to tie up lose ends from both books. It never really took the time to create a solid story line that could stand on its own. I had read &#34;Winds&#34; a few years ago before I knew it was part of a series. I had recently read The Angel's Game, book two, and then dove right into this book. Some of the characters from Angels Game were in this book as well. I had a hard time with this mainly because their stories in this book didn't match up to what happened to them in the original stories. There where a lot of holes so to speak. As a stand alone book, I think read could get lost.
B00003CXWV|5.0|A must-see for any Johnny Depp fan. A classically good film. Great plot, great actors, great ending. Can't believe I didn't buy this sooner.

B008KEQM3W|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It's appropriate for all women - those who have kids or are currently pregnant or are thinking of having children. And on a side note, even my boyfriend even liked this movie!
B00005JKNC|5.0|It would be a great mistake to overlook this movie.  A period piece that looks and feels authentic to its core, The Majestic is a touching story about lives affected by World War 2 as well as the McCarthy Era when witch-hunting for Communists hurt many innocent folks.  Jim Carrey is spot-on in his two roles.  In the beginning of the film, we are introduced to Peter Appleton who is a good-time guy/Hollywood screenwriter.  After a car-accident induces amnesia, he surfaces in a small town and becomes recognized as WW2 hero Luke Trimble.  Appleton unknowingly assumes Trimble's life.  It's a story of big city America and small town USA, a tale of redemption and belief in American ideals and values and what we hold most dear.  Most of all it's a story about heroism that is epic as well as small everyday acts that serve to make our lives better.  I cannot imagine anyone more skilled and talented than Jim Carrey to play these roles.  I believe this film may very well be his greatest role as an actor, for he makes us laugh and cry, sometimes simultaneously.  It is a movie of heart and soul, a movie that teaches us not to judge others.

B00BI73CVI|1.0|I've seen Les Mes live at least 3 times in the theater. I've seen the anniversary shows. I can sing most of the songs...<br /><br />...in fact, I can sing most of the songs better than any of the lead roles, including the ones out of my register. The only ones with any vocal talent are in the chorus! NONE of the lead actors can carry a tune decently, let alone portray the characters accurately through their voices. Anne Hathaway's Fantine is as weak and unappealing as her voice. Crowe's Javert sounds like a dandy in a cop uniform out for a bit of role play. And Val Jean? No. Just no. Sancha Baron Cohen would do better to stick to Borat, as his M. Theianender (sp) is limp, lazy and as flaccid as his wife (in the play) insinuates. None of them do the musical justice.<br /><br />One star for the cool costumes and the very nice scenery.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is one of the best musicals I have ever seen. It might be good to know that, literally, almost the entire movie is sung - there are only a few sentences of dialogue. Anne Hathaway's rendition of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; was incredibly moving.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|When I bought this book it was more expensive than it is now. Still, I do not regret buying it then, I've read this one more than twice, and that says a few things. If you have not done so, get it and read it, its the best long story from Sanderson so far. Its only problem is it will really make you want to read the next one.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|A great movie that is all about girl power. It has twists and turns that make you wonder what will happen next.
B0033WRUN2|1.0|I was sent a movie that would only play in Europe. Until I recieved the movie and it wouldn't play, I didn't know that there was a difference in regions. I recieve a region 2 instead of a region 1. Even when I went to amazon there was no place to let you know what to do and there was no info on the envelope to return it either. I had a friend who is real good with these web pages to look and he couldn't find any way either. It wasn't worth my effort, time or money to persue it. So my review is this. It is the last movie I will buy this way.

1451695195|5.0|This book, at 171 pages, was a quick read; I finished it in two sittings in one day. I enjoyed it very much and see it as validation for a few things in my own life experience. The author's passion for his subject is clear and comes through beautifully. It was refreshing to read about this doctor - a surgeon no less - who was able to change his thinking on such weighty subjects as NDEs (near-death experiences) and the Afterlife (heaven, hell and angels) - and at a later stage of his life (his 50s). He lends possible answers to a few perplexing questions, and opens the door to many more. He explains that it wasn't really that he didn't believe in the Afterlife, but that he just felt everything could be explained by hard science ... eventually, if not with our scientific limitations of the day. Now he feels that there is definitely more than cold, hard science. And he does it all without actually getting into religion. I commend him for writing this book. He could have taken his experience, shared it with his family, and be done with it. For someone as highly educated and disciplined as I am sure he is (and all that that entails) to go out on a limb this way and write with such passion about a personal and delicate subject such as this is quite extraordinary. He is obviously a fan of Einstein's and quotes him a number of times, such as: \\"There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\\" And \\"I must be willing to give up what I am in order to become what I will be.\\" I liked the fact that at the end he included a Reading List - 6 pages! And an Index of over 7 pages.<br /><br />For my own Amazon/thriftstore purchases in the future, I typed up Dr. Alexanders' \\"Reading List.\\" So thought I might as well add it here and share with y'all. The list is about 95% complete. Please excuse any typos!<br /><br />Captain of My Ship, Master of My Soul by F. Holmes Atwater<br />Near-Death Experiences, The Rest of the Story by P.M.H.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Purchased the Hobbit prior to it's release date. Selected to have it delivered the day of release (anticipating it to NOT arrive on that day being that I live in Alaska. I figured the next day would be more likely.) To my disappointment it arrived days later (like 5!). I had already gone to the store 2-3 times by then, and could have picked up the movie so I will not be purchasing pre-released movies anymore from Amazon.<br /><br />Movie itself is fantastic! Love it even more than the LOTR movies. GREAT characters, dialogue and filming. Can watch and understand the movie even if you haven't seen any of the LOTR movies before.
B0090SI460|5.0|Caution shoppers. holographic front insert case missing. Many movies 3d i have ordered amazon is missing holographic cases.Now how messed up is that. Because the case is the charm of that movie itself. Checked with walmart and other retailers and they all have it. Did contact amazon and made a complaint. Dont just settle for the movie without the case.

B005LAII4E|3.0|I was excited last year about seeing this. I like The Rock & I love Bruce Willis but the delays and latter previews made me weary to see this film. So what made me see it? A free ticket I received from a Blu-Ray Purchase [Minority Report if you need to know]. So even after debating using the ticket I caved and went to see it. It's much in the vein of Transformers, a plot barely there but to serve for an excuse for action scenes. Now this was a mixed bag of good ideas [ex. Storm Shadow's Secret, Cobra Commander's Demeanor & Ray Stevenson's Firefly] & terrible ones [ex. Motorcycle Rockets, Firefly's Bug Bombs, DJ Cotrona's Dumb as a bag of bricks Flint]. It's a movie that begs suspension of belief and when applied it's alright and has it's moments of glory but it never ever really draws you in or amazes you. No one performance in this movie will blow you away. This is one of the movies where the villains were the more fun on screen than any of the heroes. I don't want to spoil this for you so I'll make this cryptic but the villain's assault on one facility in this film was the most fun I had watching this film.<br /><br />Many of the heroes were the major buzzkill for this film for me... Especially Flint. Have you ever seen a character that you were hoping was going to get killed? Well Flint [D.J. Cotrona] was that character for me. He was useless & never seemed likeable or remotely interesting. Roadblock [Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson] & Lady Jaye [Adrianne \\"Super Hot\\" Palicki] were fine. Snake Eyes [Ray Park] was well Snake Eyes yet his mandatory sidekick Jinx [Elodie Yung] was forgettable. The RZA as Blind Master even draws more question marks about the casting on this film. Even Bruce Willis as Joe Colton aka The Original Joe was pretty much just Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis. When half of the heroes seem like interchangeable, dull, lifeless whiners you either kind of hope for their deaths or just brief cameos. All in all it's not a bad movie especially in comparison to The Rise of Cobra but it's nothing you'll remember fondly even after the credits roll. It's a reason to go to the theatre munch some popcorn with a loved one, a date or the kids and enjoy their company. Best advice go in expecting little and you won't be disappointed.n to The Rise of Cobra but it's nothing you'll remember fondly even after the credits roll.

B004EPYZQM|5.0|An amazing movie to add to a terrific movie series. greast explosions and car chases. Awesome picture quality and great bonus features.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Setting aside all the quite legitimate criticism of the film (the lack of black agency, etc.), when is the last time the central character has been less real?  Quite literally, it is like the film apes Disney's Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln.  Animatronic.  Day-Lewis is an excellent actor, I think this is dismal Spielberg, as though every great sign from A.I., parts of Minority Report, that he would mature into a Kurosawa-level director, was just a tease, and instead he has regressed to the earliest and most dismal and hackneyed elements of his career.

B008Y5OW20|5.0|Have been a &#34;Lynnatic&#34; for many years now, since the &#34;Evil Woman&#34; days. This is a nice collection of songs Jeff Lynne grew up with and remade his own way. Only two complaints: one is that I wish it were longer, and two, it's so good my husband stole it and took it back with him on his deployment!  CD played fine, bought new and of course had no skips, and I like the material on the case instead of breakable plastic.
B004WE01YA|5.0|beauty and the beast is one of those disney classics that you must have. It has an amazing story and great soundtrack. The bonuses on this film are nice to see behind the scenes and able to watch more than one version of the film.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A  well-written description of a complex and talented person who has had a profound effect on our lifestyle and culture for the past twenty years. I especially enjoyed this book because it did not oversimplify (not too much, anyway) the dynamics and personalities  involved.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is awesome and fun for anybody but could use a little more things you could buy in the shop not just upgrades boards and characters.it would also be better if the multiplyer cap was raised.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural is a great series that has both a mix of monster/demon hunting and the great brotherly bond that is shown. The box set has a great package and is good quality.

B007BVOF8E|5.0|Well, one can never go wrong with Gary Oldman.  Gary is one of the best actors working today.  My only issue is his talents are utilized more but I guess if there isn't much material to complement his acting, what's the point.

B0075MFS9Y|3.0|Wish there was more vocal variation. The lead singer's voice is redundant. Good songs, but gets a bit tiresome song after song.  I like the group, checked out the album before purchasing, am not sorry, just bored after 2 or 3 cuts . . . better listened to when shuffled with other stuff.
B0033WDCRA|5.0|Boy did this bring back some great memories.  I was not expecting the additional cd of music so I was greatly surprised that that was included.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I didn't really know who Jay was, or that he was a real young man till I saw the beginning and it said, 'based on a true story'.  I loved the cimematography and the mood of the film. It was a very easy to enjoy. The acting was good, as was the script, and the story was just so uplifting. I saved it for my family to see and I've recommended it to others as well. A great story about a VERY young man who decided to throttle the waves!  A great father-son movie that had  wonderful messages about how important a father REALLY is in a young boys life, regardless of what the PC people say today. A FATHER can make all the difference in a childs life, just as a mother can as well. But only a dad can fill that position in a boys life. This was a great movie about love, friendship, drive, committment, and courage.<br /><br />I've seen some rather unkind reviews of this film and my personal opini is that they didn't understand the idea of it. If you want a purely surfer dude movie, this is NOT it, nor did they advertise it as such. I saw the previews of this, and it WAS described exactly as they delivered. This had a surfing theme and element, but it was more about the training, the emotional bond that developed between Jay and Frosty, and how he overcame certain obsticles. I, personally, would've found it extrememly boring if it had focused totally on surfing, as it wouldn't have done the film, or the story, justice. It's the journey, not the destination.<br /><br />As for the 'film critics' that panned this when it came out. WHO CARES WHAT THEY THINK?  I think people who listen to 'professional' reviewers end up missing these little pearls. Ever hear the term, 'sleeper hit'?  Like OCtober Sky, Somewhere in Time...the list goes on.  This might've been panned by dead from the neck up, washed out of school former film students that never made it...but they don't know what the he!! they're talking about.<br /><br />5 STARS all the way!

B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Great--I mean GREAT cast, talented director, beautiful camera work, AWFUL MOVIE. I absolutely hated this film. So slow (and I can usually take slow movies) and laborious that I considered cutting my losses and giving up. I stuck it out waiting for it to get better, to no avail. Don't waste your time on this stinker. Even with all the aforementioned talent, it was insufferably bad.

B005LRWRZ8|3.0|Upon initial release of Thirt3en- I thought it was a decent follow up to Endgame- and for the most part- it's a decent record.However, once you sorta had time to digest Thirt3en after a year or so- does it hold up repeated listens? Yes and no. This release does at least start off decent- with a lot familiar trademarks of Megadeth- and also a much welcomed return of Dave Ellefson- the sound is bit reminiscent of past glory gems like Rust In Peace- and the concise songwriting of Countdown Of Extinction and even a bit of the meandering of Youthanasia. The first two tracks feel good for what they are- and really do a good job of getting it's point across without overstaying it's welcome. Lots of great fretwork from Mustiane and Chris Broadrick. \\"Who's life (Is it anyway?)\\" is where things fall apart- laughably bad lyrics that could have been by 15 year old child. \\"We the people\\" has at least some decent hooks that in my humble opinion anyway- get killed by Mustaine's vocal performance. When Megadeth is in it's faster tempos Mustaine's vocals seem to benefit more- but when you start to get into midtempo grooves, it becomes painfully obvious that Dave's just not a singer. But for some wacky reason- it's one of the stronger tracks on here- perhaps its the memorable chorus- who knows? \\"Guns drugs and Money\\" is another laughably bad song with again decent moments but then gets repetitive in a hurry. \\"Never Dead\\" sounds like riffs leftover from Countdown era- decent headbanging song. For the most part from a clearly production standpoint- it's one of Megadeth's best. \\"New World Order\\" is another track that feels reminiscent of 92' era Megadeth- with perhaps a moment or two Rust In Peace era riffage- familiar leads that could've been on the song \\"Five Magics\\". (Even the chromatic riff used in that song sounds achingly familiar) The next couple of songs kinda feel like filler tracks. \\"Millennium of the blind\\" is a bit of a slower number with lots of acoustic moments before throwing temper tantrums about the end of the world according to Mustaine.  The last two tracks are for the most part ok. Again, I don't know if it's just me- but when Megadeth goes into slower tempos I don't care as much for them. Sure, the music is played well, - Does it move me? Sometimes. Sometimes not. I can't say I recommend this album, but I say you could do worse. Some tracks are pretty killer, some are just ...blah. 3/5

B003FSTN5C|5.0|I saw a few espisodes of this show on television and borrowed the first season, just to see how this show got started (and if it was good enough for me to continue watching).  I had previously watched 9 seasons of NCIS (Washington team) and was tired with the plotlines, characters, and general look of the show.  By comparison, NCIS: LA was lively and humorous, with great characters and interesting storyarcs and plots.  The chemistry between actors/characters was great.  The show was fresh and original.  I really liked how the humor was present, but the seriousness of the agents' conditions and circumstances were very real.  I was impressed enough to decide to buy the following seasons, because this was a show I actually wanted to watch all the way to the end.<br />My favorite episode of the first season was probably \\"Callen, G\\" (very emotional, a bit tense, and definitely mysterious).  I also loved the scene in \\"Ambush\\" where Callen and Sam are locked in the shed. (Callen: \\"Before you [Sam] came in [to save me] I had a gun and a hostage[...] Now I'm chained to a stovepipe with a concussion...\\") And I loved the Swan/Duck Oragami Scene in \\"Search and Destroy\\", when Sam and Callen were in the car on a stakeout, bored to the point of arguing over Callen's tootsie pop wrappers, which Sam had turned into oragami birds!  Hetty Lange was awesome, Kensi was super-cool, and everyone looked like they were having fun doing this show.<br />This is great television, with all the necessary parts to make it one of your favorite shows.  Don't miss the chance to see some NCIS: Los Angeles to decide if it's for you!

B004I8WD7S|5.0|I had the clear version of this for my white iPhone 4S and decided to get this for my wife's iPhone 4. The combo of the case and the screen protector make it a great value. I have definitely put this case to the test, and it has done well. The screen protector has done its job well, also! The back and sides of the case are a bit on the slick side, but that hasn't been an issue for me. It's quite form-fitting and fairly easy to take on and off. I definitely recommend it!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is one of the best ones I have downloaDed. I love it because it always updates and makes the game deal fresh and new.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|Fantastic blu ray transfer and product packaging for a very reasonable price.<br /><br />Movies like this don't get made anymore, which is sad.<br /><br />For some reason this film triggers some sort of menu glitch in my Sony blu ray player, but I've confirmed that the problem lies with the player itself and not the disc.
B0037471TE|5.0|It must be twenty years since I first read The Bourne Identity and it still stands up today as a first rate thriller.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best!! I used to be addicted to Temple Run un till I played this!! I enjoy the charactors and the world tour. It was a great touch to the app!! [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00ABA1OP4|5.0|Awesome Videos. Sounds Great on my surrond sound system. Used the PS3 to play. Only dislike I had it that I cannot select the subtitles or change the language, guessing its the PS3 that is not allowing me to pick the options. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the Rammstien.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Not many books about WWII can summon the &#34;good&#34; sides of that horrific war ... but this on does! Highly recommended!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers passes time is that good? It has updates to keep you interested it that good so if that's not good enough for you. You can also spend real money on it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Good sharpener for the price.  Good at maintaining an edge not so good at putting one on. For the price I would buy it again.
0393342212|5.0|This book not only teaches parents how to raise kids to be cooperative but also how to communicate, collaborate, and act as a team within the family unit. The lessons in this book are life-lessons that every human needs to be successful.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Honor the patriot that puts his or her life on the line for our country. Thank God for them everyday!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it!  Plenty of activities to keep you interested. Could always use a few more.  Would also like to see all my horses at once if that would be possible.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a great book that had me hooked from the beginning. I also liked that each chapter had its own story and was just the right length for a &#34;just before bed&#34; read. The fact that it was based on a true story made it all the more inspiring and interesting!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like it but it keeps freezing my Kindle and there is no clear way to to update it so i think this app needs some work
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show has great acting, and story lines.  It's not like she comes in and takes over the law firm...  she looks at the human/family side of each case...
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie, it sends a great message in a good way, kids never moved thru the whole thing.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a great app for kids (even up to 14 years).  Creative and interactive through game center where you can visit your friend's dragons homes.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Creative, innovative, inspiring. Brings you back to greatness in music. Somehow it's familiar yet very different. I hope we see more.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|There needs to be more shows like this one!  It is a show that you can actually watch as a family.  The story lines are very interesting and often make you think a little about how it ties in with past episodes.  The writers of the show are very creative and clever.
B005HSL626|5.0|My son chose this game shortly after getting his Kindle Fire, he really enjoys playing it and even recommended it to his older brother.
B006U9IY76|5.0|good quality toy... not cheap plastic. Holds up to my son crashing them into other trains and toys he has. No paint chipping, no broken parts (yet) and he loves to play with them....
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow oh Wow oh Wow!<br />This has to be the best new Scifi I've read since I first discovered the genre 25 years ago and happened on Arthur C Clarke and Ray Bradbury.  Old school- great science, real problems, good engineering, man v space, and one of those wise-cracking old-school true blue science heros that saves the day with ingenuity, brains, and a good wisecrack.  THANK YOU Andy Weir!  Write some more please.  I'll wait.  We need a whole space program full of these guys.
0609610570|5.0|This gives great advice in putting plans into action. I recommend this book for anyone in management or needing instruction to get things done.
B0037VIBGY|5.0|Charles Bronson is a very interesting and suprisingly lovable man considering his propensity for violence. Having read the book, i think the film is a very good adaptation. Tom Hardy did an amazing job portraying Charlie Bronson. It was truly a great performance. It is a well rounded movie that is extremely funny at times, yet also illustrates well, how sad and scary the life of a prisoner can be. I would highly recommend this film to all.
1400031524|5.0|Kurt Wallander series  = great  This is 2nd book after Faceless Killers  These books definitely rival Steig Larson who wrote Girl w/ Tatoo
B0094BB4TW|5.0|im never on my computer becausebit needs a new battery so i got the facebook app for my kindle fire. it works so great. and it gets better with the new updates every noe and then.

B007MDB6L0|5.0|Good movie, just what the kids like. The DVD never starts up with one push of the controller, the fast start is a trick.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I was really looking forward to this but you buy more photos/puzles yet you have to pay $3.99 to remove the ads
1451683405|4.0|Soren Kierkegaard got it at least half right: \\"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\\" But does it follow from this that our sense of freedom is a mere illusion? Perhaps.<br /><br /> Sam Harris thinks free will as an illusion. It is an error, he says, to \\"attribute agency\\" to the action of others and even to our own acts. \\"There is no question that our attribution of agency can be gravely in error. I am arguing that it always is,\\" he writes. \\"[T]he idea that we, as conscious beings, are deeply responsible for the character of our mental lives and subsequent behavior is simply impossible to map onto reality,\\" he continues. He makes his case in a splendid little book entitled, appropriately enough, Free Will, (Free Press, New York, 2012).<br /><br /> I am not as persuaded.<br /><br /> I don't doubt the scientific evidence. Neurological activity, that is, activity rooted in our hardwiring, reflects that nanoseconds before something comes to mind, a neural storm explaining and accompanying any action and thought has already gathered. In other words, matter precedes the phenomenon of the mind. We don't summon ideas; ideas happen to us, or so the argument goes.<br /><br /> On this view, our sense of freedom may be an illusion. But, I suspect, like so many other illusions, the illusion of free will seems to be necessary, at least for the time being.. The next scientific revolution, the next intellectual frontier, will consist of reframing, or understanding, the relationship of mind and body. If freedom is an illusion, just how are we supposed to comprehend the truth about how we live?  Harris doesn't really have the answer.<br /><br /> Of course, Harris is not arguing that we don't have choices to make in the lives we live. He is not a fatalist. \\"To declare my `freedom' is tantamount to saying, `I don't know why I did it, but it's the sort of thing I tend to do, and I don't mind doing it.'\\" Or, as he also puts it: \\"Yes, you are free to do what you want now. But where did your desires come from?\\" Finally, \\"You are not controlling the storm, and you are not lost in it. You are the storm.\\"<br /><br /> I can't help wondering whether there is an element of narrative license at work here. I have agonized over choices in the past. The most significant ones -- a divorce, a career path -- seemed unbearably difficult at the time the choices were made. I can see reasons, decades later, for how these chapters in my life turned out. But I am aware that rendering these choices in terms of reasons is the creation of a narrative arc satisfying very present narrative needs. How do I explain a life lived defending folks who find themselves on the wrong side of the law? Why it is because I grew up amid chaos and misfits, and now insist that every voice is heard. There is something almost too simplistic and formulaic about this explanation. I am aware that it justifies the life I live now; I have no idea whether it is \\"true\\" in the sense of providing an actual account of causation. It seems just as apt to say that the narrative drive is in our genes, and that the concept of freedom is a necessary theme.<br /><br /> Criminal defense lawyers know a lot about this giving of reasons. Our clients come to us accused of often horrible events. We recreate the past to exonerate, justify, excuse or, at the very least, explain what has happened - we cast a broad net to show that no one is simply the sum of their worst moments. The prosecution, typically, focuses on the moment of choice, and argues that a defendant must be held accountable for the horrible act he or she was free to avoid. I often get the sense that prosecution and defense are talking past one another.<br /><br /> Harris's book offers a bridge that both the defense and prosecution can walk.  There may be no morally perfect world, in which agents are \\"free\\" to do whatsoever they will. We're all caught in a web of desires, instincts, predispositions that are a function of evolution, genome, early childhood, social pressures, and the felt necessities of the chaos that becomes out biography. A man of dangerous dispositions may need to be isolated to protect the rest of us, but that doesn't make him a moral monstrosity.<br /><br /> Moral condemnation is a quick fix for the ignorant, Harris suggests. What's more, isolating the choice a defendant makes, and punishing him for that choice, may work gratuitous cruelty. As Harris puts it: \\"Our system of justice should reflect an understanding that any of us could have been dealt a very different hand in life. In fact, it seems immoral not to recognize just how much luck is involved in morality itself.\\" Again: \\"The urge for retribution depends upon our not seeing the underlying causes of human behavior.\\"<br /><br /> Criminal jurisprudence is still steeped in Victorian fantasies about agency. Harris sheds much needed light. That we still see so little about how we come to do the things that define us is a reflection of how much more work needs to be done in this area.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|A boy named Tolly (Alex Etel) goes to spend Christmas with his grandmother (Maggie Smith) in an inherited estate. The film is set during WWII and his father is missing in action, so his grandmother tells him stories about the family to keep him distracted. One night, he sees a ghost (in a very startling scene) and when he approaches his grandmother about it she doesn't deny that there are ghosts at the estate. As time goes on, he sees more and more apparitions and actually participates in the past. In doing so he solves a very old family mystery.<br /><br />I spotted four actors from Downton Abbey, which makes sense because the director of this film created Downton. The actors, including the many child actors, seemed comfortable in the early 1800s setting which was brought to life with beautiful bright camerawork which contrasts the dreary WWII atmosphere.<br /><br />I find that most PG movies these days are aimed solely at kids with a few adult oriented jokes tossed in to appease the parents, but this movie wasn't condescending in the least. It is appropriate and exciting for all ages. I know I would have loved this movie as a kid (It reminded me of the Secret Garden) and I love it now.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I guess I like to have a character that I can side with, who I feel is somewhat worthy.  But there was no one like that in this book.  And the ending left me feeling somewhat disturbed.  So after I read this, I basically felt like I had wasted time and money.
1579129129|5.0|Interesting for one and all who pick it up! Layout and photography is outstanding. Worth every cent spent on it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game an its great for my daughter as well. I have fun rebuilding the town
B00136JS12|5.0|I have always liked this band. The guitar is still one of the best ever. Boston just gets better with age.
1400082773|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it broke down all of Obama's childhood with his Mom, Father and grandparents,  The part where he cried when he met his father really was a tear jerker.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Maybe it's because I'm not 40, or don't have children, but this movie was horrific. A true insult to comedic films. I didn't exactly have high expectations-- I really just thought it would be funny, probably a little bit awkward, but still worth the two hours of my life I'd invest. I could not have been more wrong. Between cringing, wanting to vomit, and just downright feeling depressed because the film was so bitter, it occurred to me that there wasn't even really a plot. So unless you're a die-hard Paul Rudd fan, in need of a stomach cleanse, or masochistic, I would highly, highly suggest avoiding this movie at all costs.
B002RI98BA|4.0|I bought the book after I  saw the film which helped me appreciate the characters. Lincoln turned his &#34;enemies&#34; into friends and supporters and then used them to succeed with his policies. Very interesting story.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I enjoyed playing it when I could play. My daughter just loved it. If you like Angry Birds this is for you!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can check the weather here or in other cities as well and get a 10 day forecast along with other related features
B009YP9L7U|2.0|it's a little too fast paced for me. They could have went into more detail of the morning after rather than just say they talked for hours & the next thing I know he is SO attracted to her all of a sudden & thinks he's in love with her... Even fairy tales don't do this so it's not a very good story. I did not read the whole book but I bet they stay married and live happily ever after...
B003VANOFY|5.0|does all that i expected. had them a month no problems.i would recommend them to anyone looking for  wireless headphones.
B0017ANAZO|2.0|Liked some of moments but this is not a movie I would really recommend to my friends as something really worthwhile.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A social web site I can look at my face book any where ther is wi fi and communinicate with friends
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Surprised this didn't get more hype that it did. Kept our attention for the entire movie packed with stars. Excellent
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun and addictive. I love how you can beat your friends on Facebook. I love it so very much!!!
1400034205|5.0|I am reading this book for the third time in my life.  I love that this copy is a used paperback because I can take it with me, write in it, turn down the pages and thoroughly OWN it in every sense of the word.  Maugham is an incredible author and this story is<br />beautiful, the characters so clearly drawn; I feel like I know these people personally and this tattered volume is the perfect &#34;vehicle&#34; for this tale.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Its a great site for communicating with friends on the go and also communicate with my daughter who is in college
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This is a very exciting book. Love the character development of Sadie and Carter. Their encounters fighting for the 'good' are constant. Fun read for the intended age group. Reading this first book in the series made me want to read the rest.
B005LAIHR2|2.0|Performing over produced and cheesy renditions of popular songs isn't new, but it's become de rigueur thanks to that abysmal show American Idol and all of its unholy spawn, including Glee. Now we have this attempt to combine the familiarity of MTV's golden hair-band age with a Moulin Rouge twist.<br /><br />This movie was not the most awful thing in the world, but to think that they'd make a movie that uses gag-inducing pop metal from the 80s to tell a clich&eacute;d story of love and stardom is mind-boggling. Of all the eras and genres that this formula might've been applied to, the choice of schmaltzy Starship, Quarterflash, Extreme, et al seems curious to say the least. It isn't like I can't hear any of Journey's bigger hits in dozens of other movies (Adam Sandler must own the publishing rights), so why shove these rather generic songs at the public yet again?<br /><br />There is a near-criminal misuse of some talented performers to boot. Giamatti, Zeta-Jones, and Baldwin try, but they're given so little to work with. Cruise hams it up as a jaded, drunken, leather-clad rocker, and seems grossly miscast, as does Baldwin as the nightclub owner.<br /><br />The love story is tepid, the songs are memorable more for their cheese-factor than anything else, and the few surprises are forced and underwhelming. I had high hopes for Rock of Ages, but then again, I had high hopes for MTV, too...and look at how that mess turned out.  Jersey Shore any one?
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|If you can deal with the idea of a boy's best friend getting hit by a car then sewn up and given a new life by the grieving child, you may find this movie amusing.  As dog owners, we found the whole thing incredibly sad and disturbing.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I don't have to hold a big giant book and I just Love The Twilight series so I think everyone should read it
B005C9YZIW|4.0|Great photography, breath taking. Would only play 1080i @ 60 hz.<br />should have been 1080P at 24hz. Otherwise, a great collection.
B002M87V0A|5.0|\\"I like the movie because it feels important. Also, I like the music! It is good for five- and six-year olds, and also ten-year-olds. It's fun. I like the band.\\"
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|If you know the story, you might be able to follow the elaborate production conceit that turns the setting into a theater.  If you haven't read the book, you'll probably get lost in a tangle of intrigue, made even more difficult by characters played by actors who look like one another.  My advice is to read the Cliff Notes (or a plot synopsis on the web) and keep notes during the movie.  Otherwise, gorgeously produced and well acted.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A game to play whenever I get board like at appoinment that seem to take forever to make the time move more quickly
B003L77G10|1.0|We were eager to start season 2, watched the first few episodes and disks 3-5 are basically unwatchable because the discs freeze and skip.  No wonder the seller wanted us to \\"write a review as soon as possible\\" because the first 2/6 discs were fine.  Don't ever buy from this seller.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob has done it again!  Could listen to this all day, yes it's that good, any Dylan fan will appreciate.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Amazing movie. If you have seen it, you know that and need to add this to your dance collection. If you haven't seen it, add it to your collection! You won't be disappointed!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was very good app for me as it is soooo addictive! Better than temple run! subway surfers is brilliant!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Loved this game especially the adventure game.  Very hard to put down.  Highly recommend for any one that likes match three games
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I just love reading this book to children. It helps them read for fun and understand the purpose of reading books.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book Dr. Alexander's words are the best I have read describing his Journey. Letting his readers<br />experience what he had. This is both encouraging and after reading his account it takes the sting out of death.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It holds your interest to keep you going in the game. A very good finding things and solving puzzles kinda of interest for any person.
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book. Very emotion-driven, good story, whether all the info was factual or not (its for entertainment, not education!).
0740745271|5.0|This is just what I wanted and came in a timely manner. I would purchase from this seller again. I needed this for a sensory and perception class and now my grandkids get to enjoy it.
B00BRR66SA|1.0|I got Justin`s new cd and i have to agree this cd is by far the WORST i ever heard(this cd shouldn`t have 1 star) hope justin can get it together and come up with some new and better music as for this cd it`s yard sale bound that`s hard earn money gone
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose this rating because even though sad things happen it is still a great book. I encourage everybody to read it
0547884591|2.0|I'm usually a fan of Tim's books because he gives so much information but I didn't find what I needed from this book. I'm going to use the 4 Hour Body as an example but the books are totally unrelated. With the 4 Hour Body you're able to find a chapter about any common question you may have about diet or fitness. This is why I recommend it to others. Within the chapters of the 4 Hour Body, the answers to those questions are also explained to the fullest extent, how much of it you choose to read is up to you. You can also find applicable knowledge within those chapters. The 4 Hour Chef, on the other hand, is simply a collection of some of Tim's notes and that's not useful to me or many other people.<br /><br />If the book is about cooking, learning and eating it didn't answer the common questions that I have or others have about these topics. Tim answered his own questions about these topics but not enough of ours and that's the real downfall of this book. When it did answer my questions, it didn't do so extensively. The 4 hour body didn't expect anyone to develop sets of exercises, it gives you everything you need to know. That's why it was useful to both fitness gurus that just needed something new and fitness novices that needed to get started. So there's a lot of underdeveloped information here and, like others already said, the information is all over the place and hard to navigate. I'm still a fan and look forward to more of his work but I can't recommend this as a reference for cooking, learning or eating.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the entire series.  Great Kindle reading. I would recommend it for young and old alike.  You will be riveted
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I really liked the way this movie portrayed such an iconic part of our history. Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Fields, and Tommy Lee Jones all did phenomenal jobs on their roles. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the speech wasn't completely clear the whole time. Some times they were sort of mumbling. Also, some of the dramatic moments in the movie were a teeny tiny bit off in my opinion. I felt the effect, but it didn't drive it home 100% in some moments. It definitely made it to a good 90% though, so I have no real complaints. Great movie and I recommend it to everyone to check out! :)
B0067R0APK|5.0|It's so good! I Hiley recommend this app. It tells you the weather how it really is. It's great for when you want to know the exact temperature. Love it
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|The grand kids love the angry bird things and this one is right up there. They will play this one until you tell them its time to stop.

B0048PU7TC|5.0|I've been a Norah Jones fan for sometime. This compilation of collaborations is a nice addition to my collection. I would recommend it to any fan.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator as it does the job perfectly. I just wanted a simple calculator for my kindle and this fills the bill and then some. I really like the layout and colors and clarity. Other apps looked as if results would be difficult to see. This one is perfect. Use it at work and at home to balance checkbook.
B000K7UG34|5.0|This is very heart moving and encouraging to live for honor integrity. Good movie to watch with your girl appeals to both men and women.
B002VRZEYM|3.0|It's all over the place going from one point to the next randomly without finishing the point. Not very well done.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|Bad timing on our part, knew I wouldn't see whole movie in 1 sitting, but my husband was really upset he missed it and and it didn't replay at least once.  Pay per view on our dish is for the whole day, won't make that mistake again because I never see a whole movie in 1 showing without getting interrupted so I won't be renting from Amazon again.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|it is a pretty good game... easy to learn and great at wasting time.  only bad thing is that it requires an Internet connection to play
B000V39KDO|5.0|This is a real man movie, no sissies allowed on this one. Good action, Hollywood made it sureal but historically this really happened, this is a time when men where men and women where women.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|First: I am a Lois McM Bujold fan, and have been since I read the serialized version of Quaddies probably in Analog X years ago.<br />I like just about everything she writes, including the non Vorkosigan material.<br />This is a fun read, kept me turning the pages, and kept me interested right up tot he end.<br />Typical fine LMB book, perhaps just a touch light. I'd give it 4.8 stars if I could, but it doesn't quite reach to 5 stars
B000JL9VVY|5.0|Well acted and moving story.  Even though it is an older movie, it is so well done and the story is solid.
B001RI3DZI|3.0|I really thought this would be an amazing movie given how incredible Heat was, but it really just fell short in every way possible. I thought Deniro did a really respectable job, but Pacino just over-acted throughout the whole thing. You would also think you would have great character development in any movie with the two of them in it, but you don't get it. I guess I would say it's worth watching one time, just barely though, but there are a million other choices I would recommend over this one. In summary, I would just have to say that you feel really unsatisfied when this movie ends. You keep wanting more the entire time you're watching it, but you just never get it.
B008RJFRTK|1.0|the app tries to come up but no maps and then it shuts off, hope you like the 5 bucks.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is what it is. A funny romantic comedy about acapella singing. Cast was perfect and song choices were even better. Over all just a great feel good movie that will make you laugh.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Love reading Jodi Picoult emotional and riveting as always! I loved reading this book and she always surprises me at the end!
B003F29D44|5.0|Anyone from generation X on back should have already seen this movie, and probably at least a dozen times each, but if you haven't, you are really missing out. You won't find better acting or a richer, more intriguing story line in any film, in my humble opinion. Definitely, most definitely give this one a look if you haven't already. It holds up perfectly over time and I never get tired of watching it.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|The actor portraying Anthony Perkins (James D'Arcy) was scary good, and his minutes on screen were worth the rental fee. The other performances seemed just a bit off, and story played safe at the cost of authenticity in some areas, but interesting look at how a classic movie gets to the screen.
B00BW6SOIQ|5.0|Saw this movie on a whim. Would not recomend for young audience due to nudity and subject matter. But for an older audience who found the 50 shades of grey books interesting, this is quite an interesting movie. The lead actors took the subject matter and played it without it being too silly or too serious, which in most times BDSM is portrayed. I had nothing bad to say about this movie.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I started this story with a set expectation of just another supernatural love story, but was pleasantly surprised with the depth of plot, completely evolved characters and intriguing pacing that kept me reading virtually unstopped. Enjoyed!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game keeps me motivated and I finally get a game that I will play all time time and I cant wait to see more updates in this game to have even more fun
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is like crack to me. I can't wait for each episode to come out. One thing I will say about this season is it takes forever for one little plot section to play out, but it doesn't get boring. There is always some little thing that keeps me coming back! Braaaaiiiiiiiins!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is very catchy and addicting, its hard to put down once you start. Its also very challanging so you won't get bored.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love the game and all but like someone said below I wish the servers were better when it came to friends and other parts of the game.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|The movie's packaging is superb and a quality build! The discs are held safely and securely in the box along with the ultraviolet and digital copy code. Don't forget to save that sheet! Do not throw it away in case you need to redownload it again from iTunes. Not a lot of people know that.<br /><br />The video and audio quality is everything you expect it to be. Spielberg and company do not disappoint in this arena - as if they ever do! While the movie is long (and what quality movie isn't?), I think you will find it a moving experience.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|weird buy this. app it is sooooooo toats awesome buy the app now or I will come play with you
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Great cinematography, good story and acting.<br />The scenery is amazing.<br />Since it is based on the life of a real person, it is even more interesting.<br />We see what willpower can do for us.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show but there shouldn't be a minimum amount of words required to do a review! Is this enough words?
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Really. What's not to like about Firefly. Maybe that there's only one season. I would loved to have one or two more seasons of this beloved show. It boggles my mind that some of the garbage TV shows are in their 4th or more season but we only have one season of Firefly.<br /><br />The writing is great, the characters are brilliant. There's really nothing wrong with this show.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game a lot!! You can create your own hair styles in anyway! My favorite part of Toca Boca is that it is very creative. It feels like you are a real hair stylist. :) But 1 thing I would like to add is that they should pit Toca Boca 1 as well. BUY THIS APP!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This series is great and the price is ridiculously cheap! Normal two dvds are as much as this entire series set! You like the movies? Even if you don't watch movies buy it!!! It's a great collectors item if you collect and it'll will definately be worth something later.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game.  I have tried a lot of games and I love this one one!  I am sure this will  keep my interest for awhile.lots of fun!!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Nice booklet on preparing your kindle edition.<br />It should be useful when writing a formal book on pretty much any subject
B004N622EY|5.0|Sanderson is an incredibly talented creator of personas, making this book glimmer with deep and intricate characters, each with elaborate thoughts and standards, working together toward common goals in a way no less rich in details and subtleties. The change, or should I say revolution in the way things unravel in the Final Empire when bringing to mind fantasy stories sets an incredible, new, and non-Tolkien world with which Brandon Sanderson managed to create an addicting story for all who lay eyes upon it.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|Another page turner by Jeffrey Archer.  His imagination is fantastic.  I could not have guessed how the story would pan out.<br />It was just fantastic
B0053TMP24|5.0|I would recommend it. It is a great book for all ages and has a great ending. I love it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|OMG this game is like a drug to me can't get enough of it I play at lunch dinner in the restroom
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I don't have any thing to say because all I want is the gems but I do like the game.I have a horse name Bell and this game helps me take good care of Bell and it makes her happy so I am happy with game.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|I could not put this book down when I got it.  I love the Clifton Chronicles and can't wait for the next one
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|It was a really cute show. Some parts were scary for small 3-4 yr. olds (similar to other Disney classics that always have an evil character in it), but it was certainly up there with other Disney cartoon movies. The children loved it and watched it over and over and over and .... you get the picture. :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved every frame of this season as I did the first. A refreshing break from the violence on regular television. Bravo Masterpiece Classics!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is AMAZING!!!! U should really bye it; it is not a rip off. If u get it u Will be glad that u did TRUST ME.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a good game. I just wish it didn't cost so much. Lots if good puzzles and it took about 4 hours to complete. I just hoped it lasted longer for $4.99 I spent.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We discovered this series near the end of the second season.  We tried On Demand from Cox Cable, but had a hard time navigating, so I looked for the DVD on Amazon and found it.  It was much easier than navigating on our cable TV.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The first season is short, as well all know...but that does't stop us from collecting it! This item has some great special features, and the HD quality is all you could want. It arrived in mint condition, and look forward to collecting the whole series. A MUST BUY FOR TWD FANS!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Gxxcf d f d for kids series of us who are not allowed contact with an eye out to the ttnhhhhggff g f
B00571F26Y|3.0|I don't believe the author has done a good job of proving his opinions with scientific evidence. The studies he cites are often taken out of context or used in an incomplete way. While there many good points, I believe he's taken his conclusions too far.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Great read. Morgan Rice didn't let me down. This is a book that I could hardly put down,wanted to see what would happen to Thor. Can't wait to start the next in the series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait to see what is going to happen in book # 3 hope it is as good as the rest
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hate to admit it, but I'm hooked. I don't watch much TV at all besides sports, but this storyline drew me in!
B006LSZECO|2.0|At first I couldn't put it down, a real page turner! As time went on I kept reading just to see how it would end.  The book ran out of gas by the end and left me disappointed.  This is my first book from Gillian Flynn and I may read Dark Places, only because it is a NY Times Bestseller.  I have to remember that just because an author has one great book, doesn't mean the others will be good as well.  With limited time to read books, I must choose more wisely and stick to only the bestsellers.  If this is you too, don't waste your time reading this book.  The investment in your time isn't worth it.  Choose something else...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book.  From the beginning, I couldn't put it down.  This is one of the best pieces of science fiction that I have ever read.  I want more!!!!
B0015DRPJU|5.0|The passion the two of them share is so gripping. I had a hard time finding a stopping point to sleep. This serious has me enthralled that nothing else matters.
B004YZ3MHK|5.0|I have watched this over and over. If You like the Bee Gees You have to have this dvd. Arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Much harder than Strange Cousins - they've been touring with Motorhead and it definitely shows.<br /><br />Another excellent album from a band that should be getting far more attention than it does.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I am really enjoying this game a lot.  My only issue so far is that the attack button is too small for my big fingers.  If I miss it, I send my guy half way across the map.  Other than that it has been great.  I haven't spent real money on it yet, but may do it to make it even better.  Gotta reward those developers when you find a good game!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I luv this app the pets are so cute and the graphics are great it is really fun to play
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|I REALLY ENJOY THIS AP.  I CAN USE THIS NO MATTER WHERE I TRAVEL.  MY 13 YEAR OLD GRANSON CALLED THIS TO MY ATTENTION AND HELPED ME FIND AND DOWNLOAD.  THANK GOODNESS FOR SMART AND SAVY 13 YEAR OLD GRANDSONS.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Has the locking teeth so it doesn't slip out of my kindle charger. White is east to locate. Nice length.
B000YABS8E|5.0|My kids belly laughed often. A little cursing, but contrasts that a little clean decency is still in vogue, never goes out of style
0316018953|4.0|The items I reviewed are too numerous for general characterization. I marked the by quality of craftmanship , artistic or technical
B00181JGI2|5.0|It is good to see that some things can turn out okay for a lazy american too.Primarily a laugh riot.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can do this &#34;FLOW FREE&#34; really well, it takes much concentration, it is like therapy for me. It is a very clever, well done, it really makes you think and that's a good thing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|i love these games and this one did not disappoint.  the graphics were awsome and the story line did not let me down. great job g5
B002SAUCBC|4.0|I was sucked in right from the start, like usual Stephen King tells a wonderful story. Kinda disappointed in the ending - there should have been more instead of just stopping like that.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Love this interpretation of Tess - great acting and of course, gripping story! I Will watch this again and again.
B00136JS12|5.0|THere are few other words to describe this album. It is assuredly a classic and it belongs in my collection.
B009AMANBA|5.0|A very historically accurate chain of events . Arguments leading to the signing of the 13th amendment were so realistic. Daniel Day and Sally Field were excellent in their roles as Mrs and Mr Lincoln .
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The Wizard of Oz has always been my favorite movie but I never had gotten around to reading the book.  I am so glad I did!  I love it just as much.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig is absolutely fabulous in the role. He has that cute little twist of a smile. He is very focused. Lots of action, great locations, unbelievable photography.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I find everthing I need. It is convenient and easy to use. Very good access on my tablet, phone, and pc.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I chose this book because of the good reviews.  I was not disappointed.  The story is fascinating  and symbolic and poetic. a darned good read.!
B00BR4QNJ0|2.0|the game itself is fun but I had to remove it from my kindle because it used up all my storage and I don't have many apps.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|If you take a lot of photos with your smartphone and upload directly to blogs/social media then this app is absolutely necessary. I always find I need to rotate, boost contrast, trim out distracting backgrounds, etc. This app is super easy to use and can do soooo much!
B005LAII80|4.0|First, a couple warnings.  I'm not a comic book reader, but I have read a few graphic novels so I understand the appeal.  Secondly, I never saw \\"Judge Dredd\\" with Sylvester Stallone, successfully warned away at the time by my son.  Frankly I've begun to put some distance between myself and many of these loud, violent and poorly scripted films.  Coming late to the party, I have to say this is a pretty damn good movie.<br /><br />Karl Urban is Judge Dredd, perhaps the most feared of the new judges in the new order where they investigate crime and act as judge, jury and executioner as warranted.  It's a different futuristic world.  One where 800 million inhabitants occupy a metropolitan area that stretches from Boston to D. C.  We're not sure how this all happened or what the rest of the world looks like, but who cares.<br /><br />The area is a concrete jungle mostly run by gangsters, thugs and other miscreants.  Attempting to keep everything under control is the police force and the judges.  Dredd and his rookie training partner, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) are sent to a high rise to investigate the falling deaths of 3 men.  This is also the headquarters of Ma-Ma (a scarred up Lena Headey), who is in control of the manufacture and distribution of \\"Slo-Mo\\" a new drug.  In a plot reminiscent of \\"The Raid,\\" Dredd and Anderson are trapped inside the high rise and are forced to battle their way out.  This is mindless pap, but it is also wildly entertaining and well made.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Surprisingly the film isn't flush with color nor should it be.  The director, Pete Travis elects to go with a muted, surreal effect.  The exteriors are grey and yellowish.  The interiors are likewise intentional bleak looking.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 and is amazingly excellent throughout the movie.  I was really impressed with the constant envelopment with me in the middle.  I'm set up with a pair of sub-woofers included in the mix and they were earning their keep with this film.  The dialog comes across crystal clear and when the bullets start flying, I started ducking.  Sure, check it out.d in the mix and they were earning their keep with this film.  The dialog comes across crystal clear and when the bullets start flying, I started ducking.  Sure, check it out.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|A mind game that adds trains is called something for everyone.  May frustrate little ones but big kids need toys to. It is fun and will make your mind work so give it a try.
B006M4F67A|5.0|..I enjoy the variety of puzzles. Racing against the clock adds to the challenge. Sometimes I find myself playing way too long. I'm not usually a game player so the family teases me!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book. Overall, I thought it was very well written and very genuine. It was a little too technical, but a wonderful story.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Naturally, I had to ask the younger ones what the film is all about but received no answer that I could understand. Nevertheless, despite an entirely haphazard script, it was entertaining and successful as a meaningless form of  escapism. Only the slightest of slight nods in the direction of a meaning, mostly youngsters doing a good job at playing youngsters caught in the middle of chaos.  The price is light  so gather under the Christmas Tree (or whatever) and relax for a couple of hours.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I was skeptical.. but when I tried the first puzzle..wow..amazing!!..something to keep me busy I had to finish I couldn't stop it was addicting.!!..love it!
B005K17RU0|3.0|I hate the new graphics, and I wish that Accuweather had left a great app alone. It's still accurate, but not nearly as easy to use as it used to be, or as informative as it was.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|It was great the first time and I wanted to have the same good feeling - so I bought the movie.  It's a girl thing.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Wish the game was longer.Loved the hidden objects games.Kept the interest going all the way to the end.Enjoyed it immensely.
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|this is one of those classic movies that you just have to rewatch every couple of years. fix me a chicken pot-pie
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This app works great! I use yahoo whereas the other apps want to use Gmail or only works on phones. This app works great on my Kindle Fire HD. I set a reminder, and on the specified time and date, an email is sent as a reminder to my Yahoo account, which is linked with my Fire HD.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|The worst of the Bourne movies. Renner is awesome. He makes it watchable. The girl in it is good also. It's an ok way to kill 2 hours if you have seen everything else.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ordered this and didn't read right away. Very upset that I waited to read it. Not much to say besides I love...love...loved it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book...... Omg I couldn't put it down. Sylvia penned this novel perfectly. Cannot wait int the sequel. Love it
0061703087|3.0|Prey is a science fiction drama that answers the question \\"What would happen if a self-sufficient, violent AI went rouge?\\"<br /><br />Crichton's story answers while delivering a plot that keeps you busy in a bold, engaging style. I found it to be a fun read to finish in one or two sittings. In addition you can consider some of the cool implications of distributed computing and nanotechnology while you read.<br /><br />However if you're looking for a story that challenges your observational skills or tests your philosophical inclinations, back off. This book is basically just action. The characters are simplistic and the only thing I was worried about was who would survive (other than the narrator).<br /><br />On the other hand, not all novels are about in-depth characterization, so if you liked other Crichton or Clancy books, pick this up and prepare to enjoy. If you're going on a long airline flight this is also a good choice. Have fun!<br /><br />Cross-posted at Librarything and dragonldy.blogspot.com
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the most amazing game ever my horse is in th  us world series already and i just got it yesterday
B00BF123WG|5.0|Not sure how accurate the movie was, but regardless, it was very entertaining.  I'm not too concerned for accuracy of events.  I just enjoyed watching the whole process.  It was nice to actually enjoy a move that lasts longer than 90 minutes.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book is definitely not his best peace at times it can seem repetitive and somewhat boring but it does hold up to the series name and can be somewhat funny at times if you  are a fan of the Percy Jackson saga you should definitely consider getting this book
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I really like the case. It's been a month, and the strap keeps it closed, the on/off switch works fine, and it stands up. The only problem is the charger. I have to leave it open to charge, and that's inconvenient. If the charger was fixed, it would be five stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game starts out when you spawn in a would with nothing and test your skill and try to survive in the wild by building a house, going mining to get minerals such as diamonds, gold, iron, and coal, and fighting off the creatures of the night. But be careful and use your skills. Minecraft is just awesome.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Smooth game!  Some of the scenes are soothing to play ...ocean scenes and such.<br /><br />  I would love to see more games like it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I found the story line very easy to follow and whilst at times it is incredibly sad the author has found a very fine balance between the sadness and a heartwarming story of hope.
076115678X|5.0|It provides great information in a concise and easy to read format or you can get the same information from the DVD that is included with the book.  A great combo for a great price.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very fun to play :) You can compete with your horse and you can Crete your horse if you have enough gems or coins.
B008220DIC|5.0|Different.  Took me about 2 views to actually &#34;get it&#34;. I still love it very much.  THe acting is top notch, direction is superb. I was half drunk on my first viewing so probably why it took me two views.  I would recommend for the acute observer looking for a great gem,, a diamond in the rough if you will
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I give it four stars cause it deserves four stars. I would give it 5 stares but the time runs to quick
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book! I could not put it down- well written annd full of excitement and  fun for every one to rrad
B0010SEMP0|5.0|This was an excellent addition to the adventures of Cat.  Twists and turns and very unexpected developments in the ongoing story.  My only complaint would be the lack of Bones on the cover art.  This one was even more exciting than the previous book.  Can't wait to begin the next one.  These are definitely books that will be the cause of limited sleep because you won't be able to put  them don't.  Resist the urge to call in sick, even though you'll want to.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|Not much to say about this book that my title doesn't express. A better title for this book would be &#34;Conversation Tips For Dummies&#34;, because that's the only audience that would find this book helpful.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Very well written with unique and clearly defined characters. Somewhat negative in tone, a bit dark and joyless. Would still recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found the whole idea of the Hunger games interesting and something that sheds a different view on our world becomes dominated by the media and silly TV shows. As far as the trilogy concerns. It is a good read and really movie like, visually strong text, the third book was a bit too much and tired. I think it should've been fit into two voulmes.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|I was looking for something to write notes in for my Nexus 10. I saw this app. Which has 2 listings with different covers. I THINK one is optimized for Kindle but am not sure because the blurbs aren't clear and the reviews seem also to be mixed. Eventually I close this (teal). This app seemed to have a lot of options for customizations. Then I found out that a lot of the customizable options required downloads of respacks. Some Of these are free, others are paid. Getting the packs to sync took some trial and error. The directions for using this app are sketchy, there are some tips, but I think that event a link to a page of video tutorials or a step by step help page would be useful. The other thing I noticed is that using the tablet keyboard is slower than I am used to because Swype is disabled. I would like to see that added as an option. All in all I am not unhappy with the purchase, but I know there will be a learning curve involved.
B001A5HBJC|2.0|I grew up in the sixties and so watching this show is a blast in many ways {My mom dressed like that!  We had a clock like that!  Oh, the awesome black telephone that I'm convinced is still a better piece of equipment than anything you could buy today).  And yes, contrary to what some reviewers think, people DID smoke like that; my childhood was spent in a smoke-filled haze, and the ashtrays were just as gross as we see on the show.  The producers recreate the early 60s in a very believable way.<br /><br />The acting is good, although the pacing can be a bit slow, but I can live with that as it takes time to plot out a compelling story.  My two main problems with the show are strictly a matter of personal taste:  I cannot get past that there are no truly likeable characters on the show (I need to be able to root for at least one person) and also I do not like its graphic nature - I don't want to see a \\"put your knees apart\\" gynecological exam complete with speculum thrown in for good measure, Draper pulling up his fly then flushing the toilet, and most emphatically the ad exec who regurgitates in front of his colleagues after walking up multiple flights of stairs.  I was midway through season one when I had to suffer that last gem.  That's just gross, and gratuitous; we could still have gotten the idea of what happened without it literally being pictured out.  Who needs that lingering in your psyche?  Not me, so notwithstanding nostalgia, I'm done.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I finished this in two extended reading sprints. The attention to detail, physics and logistics (except for the opening crisis, forgiven) make for *real* drama. You're constantly rooting for the protagonist who just plain refuses to quit. He solves his problems by being smart, careful, and working very very hard. Love it!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|A story doesn't have to be packed full of action to be a great movie, and this is a great movie. Regardless of the fantastic set and acting, let alone the historical hook whether accurate or not(I am no historian), this movie is good or great enough for me to rank 4 out of 5 stars even if I did start to doze off half way through it.<br /><br />I am glad I watched it, and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys a historical representation of one of the US's most popular presidents. But if you are anything like me, make sure you take a nap the day you decide to watch Lincoln; or... if you love slow but very well directed films, get your movie rituals ready and have a good time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great fun game! I enjoy it, and play it on my free time. Its a lot like temple run and just as fun
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great read can't wait for the second. They were on point with the show too definitely need to get my wife to start reading them.
0385333846|4.0|Well it'll definitely a strange book... All in all It's Ok I hope it gets better I'M on chapter 2 now an Man I'M almost confused lol but It's an attention getter...
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is great b/c my cousin is getting married  and it gives me . Ideas for her. My favorite part is looking at the recioies and just getting ideas for anything! I &lt;3 pinterest
0375842209|4.0|It is always bad for me to write a book review immediately after finishing a book like this. A book that reached me emotionally and made me cry and laugh and made me happy and sad. It puts me in an emotionally confused state. I loved this book. Really enjoyed reading it, but I have criticisms for the ending. Maybe it's because I hate for a good thing to end, but nonetheless, here they are...<br /><br />I felt as though the ending was a bit rushed. Why was there no reunion of Leslie and her lost loved ones in the end? She had a little sit down with death and talked about the book she wrote all those years ago, but no Rudy or Papa or Mama? Why?<br /><br />Why wasn't the reunion of Max and Leslie expanded on in the end? How did his life turn out? How was the relationship of Leslie and Alex after they lost everyone they loved? How did they cope with the pain together? How did Leslie end up in Australia? What happened to Papa and Mama's other two children? Did the son die in the war? Who was Leslie's husband? Who were her children?<br /><br />And many more questions about here living with the mayor and his wife and the effect it had Isla...<br /><br />Again, maybe the criticism of the rushed ending is just me not wanting to leave the story. Maybe they are actually valid and could've added more to the book, but I still loved the book. For the ending, it gets 4 stars.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I'm always beating up my gear. Whether it's a pen/pencil, a backpack, a towel, a pair of jeans...I'm always tearing stuff up. This knife I'm pleased to say is going to stand up to the Joshua test. This knife blade is thick and tough. The full tang is clearly visible and terminating with a hardcore pummel. You can use this knife to cut, hammer, pry, clean, hunt, etc! Oh and it has a nice notch close to the handle for striking fire steel, and yes it does work magnificently!
B008COII1Y|4.0|A zombie flick that tackles the \\"human\\" condition - very good writing, and the acting is realistic for the period. Times are dark given the end of the Civil War, and this is still a low budget production - so I am talking about renting it, not a purchase - but overall this movie worked if you allow yourself to identify with the characters. The zombies and gore are present, but not in your face, and that's because they take a back seat to the plight of the living. Sometimes the \\"living\\" are far more evil than the dead, and sometimes the very act of \\"continuing\\" with pain and loss makes us heroic. If you are looking for a mindless, big budget zombiefest - go elsewhere - and that's also why I can understand some people giving it a low rating. However, it's undeserved, or more a product of their expectations/interest level than the movie's intrinsic value. This movie is worthy.
B00B935SUY|4.0|Great documentation of the recordings of some classic albums.  This is for the true fan who enjoys the history of rock and roll as well as the music itself.  I found it pretty thought provoking and insightful regarding the change from analog to digital in the recording of music.  This film goes far beyond the history and story of the Sound City recording studio.  Loved the music, loved the story - great effort from Dave Grohl!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is a wonderful change from all of the reality TV that overruns the channels these days.  I highly recommend it!

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Sadly I will never have the chance to truly talk to a great warrior like Chris but this book is as close as anyone can get.  His perspective and candor and the fact he and I are both good old boys from Texas made this book like a conversation with a good friend.  One you love, respect , and are humbled by at the same time.  I wish I could really have a beer and bull session with him, but he was tragically taken at a place I had just visited, Rough Creek Lodge, a place I love and support in this tough time for them also. Please do the same as it was the kind of place Chris Kyle loved.  Shooting, hunting fishing and great meals.

B000KGY9CE|3.0|A friend recommended this film to me (based on my current tastes in Cinema) and I must say I am kind of one the fence with this one. The core story I thought was fascinating with it trying to convey the heavy concepts of how some Victorian horror novelists (in this case Mary Shelley) approached writing her next novel like some method actors prepare for their next role. Their are moments of brilliance particularly when Lord Byrone and his acquaintences read allowed from a book that seems to make their darkest fear come alive but only after ingesting hallucinogenic laced wine and praying to a skull (supposedly that once belonged to a monk gone deranged). From this point on we are emerged into a world which seems to give explinations for all the underlying themes in Mary Shellys most famous work Frankenstein. Unfortunatly with some of the worst editing in film history does not get covered up by excessive nudity. Or showing that men on drugs will come to terms with themselves being bisexual in nature only if they are inebriated.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I bought this cd as a gift to my dad and he loves it. Shipping was very quick and nothing wrong with it when I got it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love big fish games, making super fun games that I played on my computer. I'm happy that they are making apps. This game takes my favorite swap three and adds really nice graphics and power ups, plus a back story. The best swap three game I've ever played. I'm still on the free version, but will upgrade when I can.
B0052OZJQO|4.0|I really enjoy this soundtrack.  Several of the tracks constitute 'ear-worms' in themselves as they persistently sound in memory long after the track has finished.  Beautiful work.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|This game rivals minecraft pe. In my opinion it is better. It is worse than the computer version,  but I don't think you carry a computer in your pocket. Great for anything really. I rated minecraft 4 stars and I rated this 4 stars. Mainly because I only get 15 mins. to play in the demo,  but that makes sense. Another downside is the controls. They are very hard to get use to. I think minecraft pe is like a traiming excersize for survivalcraft.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|what a great movie! I never realized how hard this president had to pass that amendment. it actually made me cry when they were voting to dissolve slavery, and I am a Caucasian woman. they couldn't pick a better actor than Daniel day lewis  to portray Lincoln. he was spectacular in this role. a must see movie for history buffs as well as children of most school age and grown ups alike!! totally enjoyed it even though it was over 2 hours long!!
B00BFD8AJE|5.0|I took a chance on this and wow I'm glad I did. From start to finish this rocks!! This is one of rock's most underrated bands out today. If you don't buy this you don't know great rock music at all! So spend bout ten bucks for this and I promise you will not be sorry!!!

B008XG1X18|4.0|I know that pinterest is used for more than just recipes but that's my absolute favorite part of it. I love trying new foods and instead of searching the entire web for recipes you can find most anything on pinterest. It's a recipe book that I created right on my Kindle.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies! The price was perfect, too.. Can't go wrong with the Goonies!
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|Where do I even begin with this movie? First of course with the trailers we were made to think this would be a seriously scary horror film with a touch of paranormal....and it was but the ending makes this movie horrible and why I rated it with two stars.  So the action kind of starts immediately and continues thruout...storyline was ok but then we start seeing changes in how it goes from paranormal to downright dumb.  2 sisters born of the same mother who is killed in the beginning but are watched over by this paranormal mother ( who is not infant their biological mother).... She's starts trying to take the girls with her over a cliff she jumped from years. Earlier with her own baby....well the uncles girlfriend brings the paranormal moms baby and she flings the bones all over the damn place....(way to treat your own kid...lady) then tries to continuously to kill the two little girls that she watched over....succeeding to get one to follow but as they fall to their weird and paranormal deaths....these idiots turn into moths or butterflies....HORRIBLE HORRIBLE ENDING......Now I didn't know how this works when one sister stays and the other dies with a mom who wasn't even their own but god lord this movie sucks....the ending ruined my opinion of how good it could have been.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I Have enjoyed playing this on my Kindle, the only problem is the ads. They are only between games, so not too annoying. It gives you help if you need it and auto finishes for you.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The characters seemed too righteous in their political views.  Almost predictable in the situations that occurred, especially with Lloyd and Boy being half brothers.
B005CWRB44|5.0|This light is awesome for anyone looking for a really strong light in a compact package. It is just a little bit longer than the battery that goes in it. Great output.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app! Never had any problems with it. Play this every night. I definitely recommend downloading this app. Love love love!
B005804NCI|5.0|This is the SACD version.  On some of the songs the surround sound really adds to the song.  The exception would be Dreams, to me that sounds better in stereo.  I think this SACD approaches the pure analog sound that I remember from this album, but still not 100% there.  Stevie Nicks voice sounds a lot better on this album than my standard CD, that is worth the price.
1400031001|5.0|This copy is so nice I wanted to read the book again. I'd already read it from the library. Excellent!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I purchased this cover and it is great. It makes the Kindle easier to hold and the leather book look is great.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|We last saw Justin in concert with the Moodys March 2013 in Charlotte NC.  They were simply wonderful and this new CD is just fantastic.  I was so pleased that I uploaded it on my BMW's powerful sound syatem and took a little drive in the country to really hear each chord witn Justin's strong voice.  I would urge anyone to buy this CD.  It is great!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all three of the Hunger Game books and although not my usual style of reading, I really did like them.  To anyone that has not read them, I would definitely recommend.
0307346617|4.0|It was interesting getting a world view on how the Zombie war spread. It doesn't explain how it came to be but it told stories from different people around the world from their own experiences on what they experienced and how they survived. It was definitely interesting and a different take on Zombies. It wasn't gory and it wasn't nihilist because they are stories from survivors.
B009KEN87O|3.0|this game was a lot of fun except that after the fourth tier of levels, it changes to a completely different game. I do not like brick breaking games. I've never bought a brick breaking game. It makes no sense for a Space Invaders game suddenly to become about brick breaking and you playing pong with aliens. That makes absolutely no sense. Negative two stars for ruining the end game.
B00797MB0O|3.0|rated 3 just because of Charlize, however it wasn't some of her best work<br /><br />it lacked the ability to keep me interested and was quite boring<br /><br />not real sure that I would recommend it to anyone quite frankly
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one book that i could not put down. I will not go into details as i do not want to spoil the story. Love it as it is written great and easy to understand if you are not familiar with the actual space terms. Great book Great Ride!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A must read read for all parents and children of pre- middle school and middle school age! Excellent story that should be passed around for sure!
B0082PQ8KQ|4.0|This book was very well written - especially for someone who doesn't have a strong science background.  The author says her reason for writing the book was to bring back the &#34;humanity&#34; to Henrietta Lacks' story.  I strongly feel that she accomplished that goal.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I had it on my cell but love it better on the kindle got further on here then my cell
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Loved the movie, and loved the fact that I could rent it here at Amazon.I am waiting for the extended version that should be coming out for the holidays, but I was having Hobbit withdrawals (lol) and had to see it again.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|This is the kind of movie that makes you look back on your friendship with friends and just compare if you ever where/was in the same predicament.
B006WAIV6M|4.0|1) This is not an academic research book. Or mostly not except maybe for describing the \\"habit loop\\" in the beginning. Most of the book is made up of illustrative anecdotes around the incredible, underlying strength of our habits.<br />If you like Malcolm Gladwell, you'll probably like this style as well. I enjoyed it tremendously. But if you're looking for hard core science, this is not it.<br /><br />2) It's not a self-help book either. Although it does provide a very interesting perspective on daily life habits and gets you thinking, the aim is not to guide you through a step-by-step program to let go of bad habits.<br /><br />Better know what to expect exactly and if what you want is what you'll get out of it! I think it can best be dubbed an essay, somewhere between \\"fun facts & storytelling\\" journalism and psychology.<br /><br />Exploring how powerful habits are brings other topics around : memory, motivation, addiction,impulsivity, and , most interesting of all in my view, how our habits are monitored and analyzed for the purpose of Big Data and marketing.<br /><br />The book was recommended to me by a friend and I absolutely loved it!
1400069289|1.0|The Tony Dungy story was the final straw for me.  I kept waiting for some real scientific results.....instead what I got was pages of unscientific stories.  Tony Dungy was a good a coach who the players believed in.  However, coaches cannot win without great players....sad as it was that Coach Dungy's son died, that was NOT why the Colts won the Super Bowl.  They won because Peyton Manning was at the high point of his hall of fame career.  I stopped reading the book after this.  Tried to skim through the rest but could not continue.  The stories before that were simple success stories of people who overcame.  This is just as another waste of paper (iPad space for me) that corporate HR weasels will try to push forth through their organizations as the holy grail.  Blah blah blah....show me some real science!!!!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Touches on all the basics of publishing on the Kindle.  A good overview of the process, but not much detail.  Very appropriate for beginners.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I recommend this book to people who like action and romance. It is exciting and romantic at the same time. If  you like  these things then you will enjoy this book!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read the first two hunger games books in less than 2  days. Thu one started off a lot slower than the others. Nonetheless it was still very good. The ending seemed to pick up really fast so pay attention!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It's okay I have work with it more to really get to know it.  It could be better. Thank you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Starts my day off right it is really a good app.it reads to me every morning and gets me off to a good start

0812993845|4.0|Wedding Night is a light, fun novel that will remind you of famous madcap heroines such as Lucille Ball, Gilda Radner, and even the fictional Becky Bloomwood. The premise of Wedding Night is the loving dynamic between two sisters, Fliss and Lottie, and the crazy antics Fliss undertakes to prevent Lottie from consummating her wedding night.  This might sound like a thin plot, but it isn't--the back story supports and even makes such a crazy idea believable.<br /><br />Fliss, the responsible older sister, is in the midst of a bitter divorce, wracked with both guilt and anger for her young son.  Lottie, responsible at work but otherwise flighty, has been unexpectedly rejected by her true love in one of the funniest break up scenes I've read in a long time! Disappointed and upset, Lottie unexpectedly rebounds into the arms of boyfriend from her teens, and vows to remain celibate and change her romantic luck, leading to a sudden and unexpected wedding.  So far, this all seems relatively normal, but Fliss knows Lottie has a bad habit of making \\"unfortunate choices\\" when disappointed in love, and thinks this elopement will end badly for Lottie.<br /><br />Fliss then sets out to save Lottie, using her influence, personal, and business contacts to first try to stop the wedding, and next, trying to preserve Lottie's ability to have the wedding annulled.  Along the way, Fliss learns about herself, her obligations to her sister, and discovers a new romance of her own.<br /><br />Wedding Night is exactly the type of book we've come to expect from Sophie Kinsella--a funny, light, feel good story whose warm hearted characters end up with a happy ending.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Please it has to be fix I put friends to chat and it gives me more pages or sometimes pages I don't even put
0316228532|4.0|Pretty much every man, woman, and child in beautiful Pagford and its ugly, socioeconomically depressed appendage known as \\"The Fields\\" lives a miserable existence. Children hate parents, spouses hate spousees, everyone is mean or depressed or abusive or abused. J.K. Rowling's first post-Potter book The Casual Vacancy shows us that muggles can be every bit as unpleasant as Death Eaters. I did eventually become somewhat interested in Rowling's characters, and ultimately the story was moving, but it took much longer than I wish it had for me to become invested, and all the while there really wasn't anyone I wanted to root for. (Okay, there were a couple of teens who were more abused than abusive, but I still wouldn't want my daughters hanging around with either of them.)<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh my goodness! I'm obsessed with this game! Great for all ages still many different levels every month!!!!!! I recommend this game to anyone
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|I don't understand why people are so angry about this movie.  It's a Conan movie done in the style of a Conan movie, that is, camp and B-movie style.  There are hunky muscular men for the ladies, topless women for the men, over-the-top gore and ridiculous hats all in keeping with the genre.  If you want to watch something innovative, then don't watch a remake.  If you want to watch refined art, then what are you doing looking at this movie!?<br /><br />Jason Momoa is perfectly cast as Conan and he does Conan as one expects Conan to be played.  The female lead isn't a whiny helpless twit as in the old Arnold version, but can fight for herself and still look good in a silly dress.  Also, it has Ron Perlman and the bad guy from Avatar.  Come on, it's worth the rental price provided you have some good snacks and friends to riff it with.
0143143492|5.0|Great way to share this incredible book with my husband on our road trip. Wonderful to have some tools to progress with. Thank you.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|While some of the characterizations of how each nation would react to a zombie plague are American-centric, this book was a very good compilation of military history, epidemic biology, ecology, and anthropology...with zombies. Enjoyable read.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|The title says about all I have to say. I'll read more of this series with real pleasure and look forward to more from Scalzi.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Once again a great story with many twists and turns. It is hard to keep things straight and in many cases jaw-dropping when you realize what happens. My only disappointment, missing many of the previous characters.<br /><br />Read them all before HBO spoil them.
B002ZG974M|4.0|One is the daughter of a late-thirties couple in San Francisco.  Another is the second son of Mongolian herd farmers.  The third, a girl, is the youngest of nine in rural Namibia.  Finally there is the first daughter of young Tokyo yuppies.  In French director Thomas Balmes' documentary \\"Babies\\" we follow Hattie, Bayar, Ponijao and Mari through their first year of life, and despite their vastly different surroundings each baby approaches its new world in much the same way.<br /><br />Although you hear the parents of each baby speaking to them no one talks to the camera, and there is no narration nor are there subtitles.  Sequences are loosely grouped together around various developmental or behavior points and how each baby handles them.  Ponijao, the Namibian baby, is raised in a communal environment, watched over by the women and children in the village (she is the only baby whose father is never seen in the film).  She happily gnaws on things she picks up in the dirt, bites her brother when he won't let her have a plastic water bottle, and gets blissfully dirty crawling around her hut.  Bayar, the Mongolian baby and quite possibly the scene stealer of the movie, is an active, vocal baby who quickly figures out how to get his brother into trouble, has a fascination with water, doesn't mind if a rooster walks around on his bed and triumphs when he snags a roll of toilet paper while tied to a bed and gleefully unravels and eats it.  Mari, the Japanese baby, brings the viewer into the first world with her baby movement and music classes, but offers a genuinely hilarious moment when at roughly eight months old she throws a screaming, gasping tantrum that is obvious babyspeak for GAAAAH I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TINKERTOYS WORK!!  THIS SUCKS!!  Hattie, the American baby, is at once the least interesting and the most truthful.  Her earnest parents show her the right books, give her the right toys, take her to baby yoga classes, etc., but there's a scene where she and her dad are in a class and a group of affluent late-thirties white women with their babies are singing some sort of fake tribal song about how the Earth is our mother.  Hattie looks disinterested, then gets up and toddles to the door and bangs on it, wanting out.  Don't blame you, kid.<br /><br />You don't have to be a parent, an expectant parent or a child to enjoy \\"Babies.\\"  Yes, there are breasts, but they are presented in their useful context.  Your kids' eyes won't rot out of their heads if they see them.  The germaphobes will have difficulty with a lot of scenes involving Bayar and Ponijao.  Ten bucks says those kids are healthier than your slathered-with-sanitizer offspring.  But what I loved most about this film was how similar the mothers' interactions are with their babies.  All of them sing to them, jiggle them while they're cooing so that they make funny noises, smooch them as they giggle.  All of the babies have moments of wide-eyed wonder that only a baby can pull off.  All of them poke and prod at tolerant household pets.  And all of them have their moment of glory when they are finally able to stand by themselves, the Mount Everest of babyhood.  A very entertaining documentary, and many thanks to the late great Roger Ebert for bringing it to our attention.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars had it not been for the ending.<br />It felt as if the author was tired and just wanted to finish the book and wrote what she had to to end the story.<br />Very disappointing finish toa fabulous beginning.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Well just when you can't imagine another variation, Grisham's latest protagonist is a convicted black lawyer.  The author weaves another great story, walks you through his latest labrynth, and leaves you wondering how he can top this one .

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to read, easy to get to. Like the reading of the bible feature. Like the choices you can make.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|This movie will catch you off-guard at your first viewing in a good way.  There are some jokes and situations that are extremely funny. But the movie just got stuck with trying to throw too many bad jokes at you and trying to be too tongue-in-cheek.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great this is my faviorit game all my friends have it. this is just like temple run<br />isn't this the best game ever
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Like Knocked Up, this movie was funny and impactful in that it was very down-to-earth and accurately depicted real life struggles families can go through.  However, I personally found it a bit depressing and can't understand all of the conflicts; simple communication would have solved all of the problems.  But I guess that's why it's a movie, right?

0062086529|3.0|We had to return our first copy of this book because the binding was ripping after about 10 minutes of being played with by my 7 month old. The second copy isn't faring much better. It seems to be a poor quality board book, I might recommend holding out for the hard cover &#34;grown up&#34; book for your child instead. I don't expect this to last long!<br /><br /> But the story is WONDERFUL!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking up married was a fun read. Although quite predictable it did keep me entertained. :) If you are reading this review to test the waters, read the book. You won't be disappointed.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this thriller; the plot was engaging, interesting and Denzel Washington performed very well.  It was good to see Jim Caviezel in this - he played a very believable motivated bad guy.  My wife and I were more interested in the plot which kept our full attention.  We loved the movie recommend it highly.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is a brilliant storyteller!  What an exceptional story written to perfection. I loved it! Finally, finally, finally a modern author who measures up to the greats.  Brontes, Austen, make room for Kate Morton!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I have always been a fan of Jt so I'll support anything for him. This is the best album so far
B000000H3Z|5.0|Released when Max was still in the band in the late 80s, \\"Beneath the Remains\\" is arguably Sepultura's strongest album. A perfect mixture of brutality, speed, and melody all help balance out into a perfect formula. It opens up with a slow going haunting melody that suddenly goes full throttle with heavy guitar rifts and intense drumming. Max's guttural vocals match the music well and it keeps a steady flow from beginning to finish. My most favorite tracks on this album are \\"Inner Self\\", \\"Mass Hypnosis\\", \\"Slaves of Pain\\", and \\"Stronger Than Hate\\". Though that isn't saying much given that all the songs on the album are great. Save for the tenth which really doesn't follow the tempo of the album and by the sound quality was probably just thrown in as a bonus. Overall one of the best heavy metal albums ever made and if you like heavy Thrash on par with Kreator then you'll like this one.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Dame Judith and Maggie make this a very watchable story.  I do hope it doesn't give<br />American women a false sense of security in walking around the streets in safety.  The movie, however, is funny and touching and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) is very cute and funny as the owner of the hotel.

B00BESKTMG|4.0|I am a big fan of Martial arts and when I saw the trailer I had to order it.  This movie was good, action packed, and kind of corny at the same time.  I plan to make this movie a part of my collection.
1594744769|3.0|Let me start by saying that, 1) I think the description of this book is a bit misleading, and 2) When I started reading it, I didn't know that it was the first book in a series. Because of this, I found reading Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, well, peculiar.<br /><br />Jacob Portman grew up listening to the fantastic stories his Grandpa told of his youth; Tales of monsters and children with extraordinary talents. No matter how incredible they seemed, he always believed the stories to be true, until the day that he didn't.<br /><br />\\"We cling to our fairy tales until the price for believing them becomes too high.\\"<br /><br />When tragedy strikes and Jacob happens to witness it, everything he believes is put to the test. Traveling to the place of his Grandpa's past, searching for answers to help ease his mind, Jacob learns that even the tallest of tales are sometimes based on the truth.<br /><br />I genuinely liked this book. Even though it wasn't what I expected due to the somewhat misleading description (I'm not going to go into that though because I don't want to spoil anything), I really did like it. Had I known it was the first book in a series, I may have liked it even more. However, having not known that, I found the book to be a bit slow.<br /><br />I enjoyed Jacob's narration and I thought that the use of the vintage photographs to enhance the story was creative and at times disturbing (Hello Creepy Santa, please step away from those kids), but I felt that the story wasn't really going anywhere. It was interesting enough, funny in all the right places, and had a few elements that I didn't really see coming (so kudos for that), I just expected it to be. . . more. More creepy. More sinister. More action packed. But it wasn't. I felt like the story kept building and building, but nothing happened. . . until the last 60 pages or so that is. The end of the book really picked up some steam and that's where it earned its 4 Stars for me.<br /><br />Knowing now that the story will go on, I think Miss Peregrine's sets up a good foundation for the next book. The world has been built, the characters have been established, and the plot has thickened. I'll definitely be picking up the sequel when it comes out and I, for one, hope the next leg of their journey is anything but ordinary.<br /><br />\\"I used to dream about escaping my ordinary life, but my life was never ordinary. I had simply failed to notice how extraordinary it was.\\"<br /><br />Originally posted on brilliantlynovel.wordpress.com
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book one hundred percent no doubt about it!!! It's so detailed filled with information description!!! Rick Riordan keep up the good work!!!!! These books are definitely legends of Amazement!!!!!
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|In today's world of electronic music that is overcooked when produced, it is wonderful to listen to an album like this.  When you first play it, you think that you are playing a record from the 1930s. Yet, you know that it is new.  As you listen, you find out why these musicians fell in love with the classic age of jazz. It shows in how they play and in the quality of the music produced. Consequently, this has become one of my favorite driving albums (music to play when you are driving). All of the songs (especially Avalon and Love is the Drug) are great. Highly enjoyable and a true homage to the past.  Buy it if you love classic jazz.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This book shows the real pain that an innocent child had to suffer in Ireland at the time.  Angela's Ashes is one of my favorite books, I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes historical novels.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book in that it addressed some thoughtful issues and emotions in a very real way. The ending was lovely, though sad. The writing engaged me through the entire work. It was such a good read that I immediately purchased her other book and also read it.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good story, would have liked to see more action. Actors were great, liked Bigalow. If you believe this stuff really happened your right.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|This is another great LEGO Avenger set.  Wish there were more about that size instead of just larger sets with the Avenger theme.
141694737X|5.0|Our librarian chose this for toddler story time, and the kids loved it so much I had to get a copy for at home.  My 3 1/2 year old likes to read along and shout out the animal names.  My 18 month old loves to open and close the flaps over and over again.  Its a favorite for both of them.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|WoW, Enjoy the Music of Classic Musicans at their Best and I even Happily sang Along... Good Tunes & Good Times Remembered!
0689829590|5.0|My kids love this book.  The Eric Carle illustrations are great, and it is also a fun story.  The book has several pages that unfold, so our copy has gotten a little beat up.  The fold out pages are a great gimic for a kids book, but it can get more beat up than most board books.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Such a fun movie! My 13 year old son loves it and watches it all the time! Great fun movie!
0590259385|5.0|My son loves this because of all the rhyming words.  Its great to find a board book version, since our paperback copy got trashed after so much use.  This one should last a while!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is a great show, and I would recommend it to anyone with a liking for sci-fi. I haven't seen much of the original series, but if its anything like the new version, it must be good.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|My four year old loves this game its a little hard for him to play but he loves it something fun we play together :)
0375869026|5.0|i read this book in two days, was the kind of story that stuck with you even when you weren't reading.<br />i read it aloud to my middle school students.  they asked for more copies to house in the library.  it was<br />a great example of taking what you're given and making the most of life as it is.  Realistic in how some of<br />the characters rose to challenges and how others just couldn't.<br /><br />a must read for all students who are in middle school and are at that stage where physical appearance defines them.
0470913029|1.0|Very strick diet, boring & hard to follow.  I found the Mediterranean diet much easier to follow, tastier & made more<br />sense to me.<br />DMM
B0000E5PEE|4.0|I got this primarily for two songs that I had herd on Cinemix. Most of the songs are very good, though the singer tends to go a bit over the top at times, for my tastes, wailing and over extending her voice. That said, she has passion, and she exudes this in her work. I love Morricone's music even more, and if you like the Euro-Hollywood sound, you will enjoy this CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to keep practice on hand eye coordination and I like the scenery changes periodically from Rome to Sydney. Great game
B006LSZECO|3.0|A mystery / thriller with all the twists and turns you'd expect.  Great guilty reading, and maybe something you don't to recommend to a significant other.  They might get ideas or think you're implying something.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Unfortunately, I read &#34;The Fault In Our Stars&#34; just a few weeks before &#34;Me Before You&#34;...and I loved &#34;The Fault In Our Stars&#34;. I thought &#34;Me Before You&#34; was very similar in story line, but written more in the fashion of and with all the elements of a romance novel: handsome rich man suffers loss, Cinderella comes to the rescue, wins over rich man's wealthy dis-functional family, dreams come true. I'm just not a fan of romance novels. If you are, you will love this book!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was pretty cool a little. Too much romance though. Still awesome though<br />I was kind of mad she didn't get the arrow in the beginning to.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read! I am from a Philly suburb and can verify that the characters' attitudes and persona fit, the neighborhood is perfectly depicted and I don't need to mention Philly's support for it's sports teams... another bulls eye. The author did an awesome job of writing a magnetic story, with very real insight to the public and private perception, and reaction to the characters' mental states within the context of a Philadelphia setting. I would recommend this book to any avid reader: female or male, to book clubs, and to anyone, or family members of anyone, struggling with the acceptance of mental health issues.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever! way better than temple run. I like that u don't have to tilt.your device&hellip;so instead you swipe.I Also like get different people and hoverboards. REALLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!
B004YXE438|4.0|Love this app. Came across it by accident. So glad I found it.<br />Great pictures. Great puzzles. Planning on purchasing the next package.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I've had to learn over the years not to expect movies to be as good as the books. When you can do this, and just let go, the movies based on your favorite books are more enjoyable. Yes, this varies from the book. Yes, the reoccurring goblin villain is unnecessary. But the visuals are stunning, the action is thrilling, and the trip is fun. I'm ready for the next one.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl did a wonderful job talking about challenges that women face throughout her careers. I'm not sure this was her plan but if she was not &#34;likable&#34; before, this book definitely helps her image by making us see the wonderful human being she is - aside from or along with the super successful professional. Regardless of the criticism, I think she speaks her opinion in the book and I'm sure a lot of women out there, like me, will benefit from her message.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very good game makes you keep trying at the games.Not good if you do not like doing things over and over
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's very e entertaining. I live In the city and have wanted my own horse since I was a child. This does it for me.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|Album started off strong. Final 3 song a letter weak. Guess the first 4 songs so strong that it was a high mark to match with the final songs did not keep up.
B00B23O96A|4.0|Good interpretation of songs that strike Clapton's fancy in his old age.  Playing this while nursing some good single barrel sounds about right.
B009TSA6YE|3.0|I'm just trying to keep it real here. I love Michael's playing all the way back to UFO and I really like Doogie Whites work with Rainbow and Cornerstone, but I'm not sure what happened here. Did he have a stroke or something? His annunciation of the words in the lyrics was bad, like he was slurring the lines. It really detracted from the great performance of the rest of band. Schenker was on fire, playing flawlessly! I really think Schenker should have just used Michael Voss for all the vocals as i think he was a much better fit and I like the fact that there would have been 3 great lead guitarists on stage! The other thing wrong with this DVD is that I wished there would have been more songs from the MSG catalog. I could have done without some of the Scorpions songs, like Coast to Coast, which is really boring.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|i hear it evryday I love the songs on here everyone who has listened to it loves it too. I am glad I bought it. A must buy.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Anyone could like this film.  I'm tempted to call this a family movie but it's great for anyone to see alone or not, and yeah I guess it's a well constructed holiday movie too but I ordered it in April.  Plenty of Will Ferrell type humor and he steals the show here...see this film.  It seems as soon as Ferrell locks on and \\"gets\\" a part, he doesn't let it go and takes it to its limits...Elf is great Ferrell.  Bob Newhart is perfectly cast in his small role here too.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I loved this movie!!  Watched Part 1 and 2 on same evening.... Wish it weren't the end! Maybe Kristen Stewart will make another one??
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very good end to a great trilogy  Very compelling and hard to put down.  I highly recommend this book  to fans of the hunger games
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|This movie was pretty good, didn't get to watch in 3D as I didn't realize I had to have a special DVD Player for 3D...<br />I enjoyed the movie.
B00AEFXZEO|5.0|I first saw this movie when it first hit the big screen and really liked it and the Dancing suburb
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|it was everything  you could ever ask for. suspenseful,  well paced, emotional. the only word for it is amazing. Just amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its very fun. When I started playing I couldn't stop. It truly is one of the best games. I think everyone should play.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book!! It's a great great book to read!!<br />I want to get all the other diary of a wimpy kid books
B004DP9QFS|1.0|The app is unable to look up place name. I wish the description said it doesn't work on Kindle Fire.
B008602KQI|5.0|Lot of unnesesary killing but i really liked it 😜😜😜😜even when it was too long doesnt feel like it very entartaining and all the caracters are cool<br />Awesome movie.
B00002SWEM|5.0|to bad most of the artist are dead. they left behind great cuban music. everyone that has a ear for Latin music must see and hear this video. God bless all the artists that were a part oF the \\"BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB\\"
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Really fun especially after learning the details.  Nothing falls off if its above a brick.  Also, if you get 4 in a row, you get benefits.  I like that each puzzle is a little different and they aren't all easy.  I have found a long the way that sometimes I'm pressing one square and it thinks I'm on something else.  This is my &quot;go to&quot; game right now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this version is so awesome i cant even explain it also this version have the save me's so if you die you can revive yourself thats all i got to say.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is exactly what I was looking for to put on my Kindle Fire HD7. .I didn't want anything complicated. This is very user friendly. Installed with no problems, ready to use. Thank you for this incredible free app!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this story! There were a few unexpected curve balls that I didn't see coming and kept me glued to the book until I finished it! In one sitting!<br /><br />I loved Will. How can you not? He's sweet, funny, thoughtful, and loving. What is there not to love about him?<br /><br />Lake I also loved. She's dealing with the curve balls that life has thrown her way as best she can. Then she meets Will and life is bitter and sweet. Do they overcome?<br /><br />This story was wonderful and I can't wait to shout it from the roof tops!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this game it is so much better than antithetic games!!! you should really get it but it is kinda blurry for the original kindle (not kindle hd).
044024613X|5.0|This was a page turner.  Very interesting storyline and ending.  Would make for excellent discussion for a book club.  Read it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just wish you could collect Redstone otherwise this pretty freaking freaking freaking out the world is a good place to explore too so definitely one of the best games
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|it's the best album of the century.  Just listen to what the critics have to say... &#34;you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you mr. jones?&#34; ---bob dylan, and &#34;his brain's been splattered all over manhattan&#34; ---rolling stones&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for playing on the bus. Its the funnest game that I have so far. I would reccomend this game to anyone that loved playing temple run one and two.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|What service-For 3 weeks have been trying to exchange defective unit.  All they are interested in is getting a photo of the unit before I can get an RMA.  Dont have digital camera so cant provide.  Customer service is the worst I have ever encountered!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am a walking dead fan and this season is great  I do recommend everybody to watch these exciting shows.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|King's talent as a storyteller is so staggering, I always find it difficult to state my feelings in large enough words when I finish one of his books.  I've long held &#34;The Stand&#34; as his most supreme effort, but now I'm not so sure.  &#34;11/22/63&#34; has left me with a hangover of the most exquisite sort.<br />The most surprising thing - man this feels trivial to mention - is that this book is, more than anything, a love story.  But I suppose most great tales are.  Most?  All great stories are about love.  This one's dripping with it, and not in a corny way.  It's love in that painful, bittersweet sort of way.  It's love in the King way.
1451695195|5.0|This is a cool and rational narrative of one highly credible individual's experience in afterlife and being in the presence of God. Thought-provoking and utterly fascinating, this account quickly captivates the reader's interest and stirs the imagination. The experience completely changed Dr. Alexander's life - one has to envy his experience. It would be difficult to read this thoroughly engaging account and not have it change your life as well.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I've thought about exploring Veronica Mars on a couple of occasions. Just never got around to it. The 2013 Kickstarter inspired me to finally check it out. The episodes were available to stream online, but the bandwidth was just terrible. It staggered and stuttered, but I made it through the first episode. I decided to look into boxed sets here at Amazon, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Kristen Bell leads up a great ensemble drama. I know I'm not telling \\"the marshmallows\\" anything they don't already know. If you liked Buffy, this is the same sort of young adult vibe, minus the vampires. Veronica lives in a town that has some pretty distinct class lines. Somehow she manages to revolve in both orbits. She tries to hold down a typical teen job at the local coffeeshop, but really thrives while moonlighting for her dad, a private investigator.<br /><br />I really don't want to spoil this season, because people are likely to rediscover the show thanks to the Kickstarter. Lots of fun, unexpected turns headed your way in season 2. And I must say, kind of cool that the famdom is finally getting their movie several years later, ala Firefly.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I watched the movie first which really hit me hard emotionally.  The book gave me a better understanding of what was goingl in Charlie 's mind on a continuous basis.  Charlie went through a lot of hardship. I could also relate to all of what he was going through at that point in his life.  High school is such a difficult place.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|a good take the will hook you and make you keep playing. trying to get the best dragons ten out of ten
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a typical Nicholas Sparks novel.  The guy hepls the girl and they fall in love.  Very entertaining and a quick read.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Wow, when it comes to writing a thriller, James Rollins has a monopoly on the genre... His books are fast paced and the way he mixes truth with fiction is amazing. In my opinion, he is one of the best....
B0093OGBL6|5.0|This is one of the best books out there about Michael. Trust me I have read most of them. This is a must read for any Michael Jackson fan. You won't be disappointed.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Clamp works on many iPhones without removing the case. Tripod you can throw away nothing special. But it's quick, easy & secures phone tight.
B00001OH7N|5.0|The man who sold the world was the first in a run of albums that helped establish Bowie as the legend he became.<br />A very dark album with brooding menace all the way through it was only ever rivalled in that aspect by Diamond Dogs.<br />The rock relationship with mick ronson is very obvious here ,( ronson was a vastly under rated guitarist ) but all the band step up to produce an album of great quality that was carried on through Hunky Dory,Ziggy, Aladin Sane and into Diamond Dogs. For me his finest works with only Station to Station and Heroes really coming close.<br />It's good to see he is still producing good work in (parts) of his latest album but  he would produce nothing after that would compare to  this period of his musical life and this album stands up with the best of them.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|Started out good.  Now freezes up my kindle fire hd.  Also, at times it played well and then would make beginning move mistakes while set high on the level bar.  Deleted from my kindles.  Hope to find another chess software.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|A remarkable filming of one of the greatest Broadway and London Stage musical productions. The music and singing was recorded on the set - this makes the  performance especially meaningful with true dramatic depth.
0988262592|1.0|Terrible prose.  Flat characters.  Completely unenjoyable as an actual novel.  As an senior analyst at a Fortune 100 company, the fictitious company in this book doesn't resemble ours in any meaningful way.  I sat down with the thought of writing a big review, but frankly, this book doesn't deserve one.  It reads like bad fan fiction.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I bought this on a recommendation from my sister. It was intriguing and fun to read. The last book seemed to drag some. It was almost too descriptive about everything. But the story really hooked me in so I kept reading. Parts of it reminded me of The Host but without all the relationship/romantic stuff.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is a personal hero of mine and her memoir did not disappoint. Her funny stories about her childhood, marriage, and time spent at SNL will keep you laughing page after page.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|it would have been nice to be able to route for someone. They are all pretty despicable. But not too bad for a first novel.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Wonderful color and story as usual for Disney.  I wish the beginning had a little less shooting but not hard core violence is in it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This was not what I thought it was. I thought that it was just about a boy being lost at sea with a tiger, but found out it was about a whole lot more. Really made me think about my beliefs and how I justify them.
B005721Y7Y|3.0|I was assigned to watch this for my film class; this movie was crazy weird and unpredictable. A lot of sexual scenes came popping out of nowhere. Overall it wasn't too bad, but honestly I wouldn't watch it again.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Visually stunning. I will watch this again when it make the television re-runs for the costuming.<br /><br />Matthew MacFayden was perfection. Vronsky was wimpy at first, strong showing in the middle, and wimpy at the end.  I had no sympathy for Anna the last 25 minutes--pathetic.[[ASIN:B000I9YLUI Pride & Prejudice]]
B00A8ECU24|5.0|1 big game that takes you into a diffrent world little people &amp; big people can enjoy this game with twilight sparkle you enjoy the world
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Three stars to the story and the writing, five stars to the portrayal of Google, the info on Hadoop, Mechanical Turk, and the Accession Table (three internet apps featured prominently in the book that I thought might have been sci-fi fantasy before I googled them).
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I would classify this as pure fantasy. Being set in the future as it was, you need to assume that two societies diametrically  opposites and dependant on each other could exist as portrayed. The computer generated scenes were great. The dialogue predictable as was the finale.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I play this game all the time on my tablet. It keeps me sharp& exercizes my brain! I' m seventy years old and need all the help I can get
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv this game it's so funny  but sometimes it gets so boring&hellip; Anyway this game is amazing if you don't have it you should buy it!!!!!! &lt;3
B008EEWN6I|4.0|I was mixed between 4 stars and five stars. I wish there was a 4.5 on Amazon<br /><br />The music on this album simply rocks. All of the fast songs have that awesome, driving rock pulse. The slower songs tend to be intricate and melodic. Serj's vocal style was always unique, and he uses it well in this album<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of System of a Down, though now I'm curious how the rest of their albums sound compared to what was on the radio
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I rented this movie with my fiance.  It was very enjoyable and we felt that it was a great reflection of us as a couple.  We felt very close to the couple in the film.  The only complaint was that it felt a little too long, but the film needed that time to make its point.  All in all it was a great film and a very good value.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers because it is a very addicting game that you can play with your Facebook friends. I also like it because it is a very fun game that updates every now and then which puts you in a different part of the world. So I highly recommend this very good game!
0876852630|1.0|I had no idea what the synopsis of this book was prior to purchasing it. Wow. I like Bukowski, but this book was just plain boring. I had to force myself to read it the entire time. No message at all behind the &#34;story,&#34; which is just about a drunk guy who loves wine too much and moves from one dead end job to the next. Not worth the time to read this, sorry.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was an easy, fun and thought provoking read.  I did not see the movie but now I would like to!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I don't use Twitter a lot, but this app makes it easy to do so whenever I feel the urge.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings is #1 on my list of all time top fantasy books.  I highly recommend this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great, intuitive interface makes accessing Facebook easy and enjoyable. Recommended for anyone who uses Facebook on anything resembling a normal basis.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I used this ap on my kindle fire over a year and loved it. Then last month it downloaded an update and not nearly as user friendly.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Great for reading any pdfs that you have on your device. Recommended for any one who plans to read a lot of documents.
B001W63DX2|5.0|got this for my brother as a gift i hope that he enjoyed it as much as he seemed glad to be getting it
B004SBULWE|5.0|Really easy to use app that allows you instantly shut down any open apps you have and preserve battery life.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Once I first watched the first season I was hooked ever sense never thought i would be but it just kinda happend
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A really simple game that can keep you entertained for five minutes or an hour, depending on how much time you have to kill.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Haven't put it down in two days! Highly recommend this if you are looking for something to do to kill time.
1451695195|3.0|Dr. Alexander gives us a 'peep' at his NDE but his ego got in the way. The book is greatly a composite of his vast accomplishments, credentials, and life experiences. It's a vanity press.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I Sell furniture so on my down time(which can be hours at a time) this baby makes the day fly by. I can't believe I am getting paid to game and sit on my butt, the life. The case shell is very sturdy, make sure you pack everything the way it was meant to be(neat) and you will not have any issues. This is not a toy to take likely, respect it and it will serve you well. I never had any issues to date and I have not a single complaint. As far as gaming, PS3 will be darker in contrast to Xbox 360 overall even when you turn up all settings. Games like God of war and Uncharted are kinda dark in certain areas(caves are tough but you can manage well) ,Street Fighter 4 looks AMAZING. Gears of war1-3 and gtv 4 on my xbox looked better then ps3 but dark areas are still tough but I find with the Xbox, once I turn up the settings during dark areas, the issue is resolved where as in my ps3, Im maxed out the whole time(expect for fighting games, they alway have brighter colors which look good on both systems without having to max out setting). I wish I found this sooner, it has made work a place to look forward to,lol. I would buy this again even if it broke.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Very touching and artfully made.  Very glad I took the time to view it....very worth it.  Very emotinal but also significant touch of very humor.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Eye opening, frustrating, guilt producing and motivating look into the food industry. I had a preconception that this was mostly about the meat industry and how the animals are treated, and while they do touch upon this, it is about the entire food ecosystem and how we as consumers and our government are destroying it with the help of the greedy omnipotent and all powerful companies that profit from it's destruction. Watch it. Share it. Change what you do.

B0021L8V0M|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Very good plot, and gets you thinking. I would recommend this video to any person who loves a good story about government and the US.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Good family series. love sitting down with family and watching this.  my daughters got me to watch one episode and now i cannot stop
B003QSIM30|5.0|This was a great movie for Friday family movie night! I have a 3/12 yr old girl and a 2 year old boy. We all loved it. It had a very great lesson regarding money not being the root of all happiness.
1250012570|3.0|I enjoyed Rowell's second novel.  (I really enjoyed her first.)  But I thought the ending to this was too abrupt.  There should have been an Epilogue.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is fun but some of the games can be very hard and i like that it does not give you all the games at once . The best part is that you do not haft to pay to get more games so the games totally free.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I like the way Rollins uses embellished facts, turns it into fiction Definitely will more of his books soon, Judas Strain was the first one I read,
B00BJA2VFW|2.0|Love these types of games, I bought this hoping to play it. Won't even go passed first page. I hope you fix this soon.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|I chose this rating because of profound &#34;foul & offensive&#34; language that I loathed. Denzel did excellent in handling that plane and<br />saving lives. But the titty scene & language dropped MY rating from OUTSTANDING to okay.:(
1616550414|5.0|It is bigger than I expected, Love the artwork, story line is cool, Nintendo and Dark Horse Comics out did thereselves.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|I would recommend this product to ALL students who were NOT taught the Truth about the Holocaust.  To EVERY White American who ignores the TRUTH about anti-semitism and racism.
B00AIBZM40|3.0|A creepy and mostly original ghost story. Jennifer Chastain is excellent as the goth and reluctant surrogate mother ... a nice change from the suburban mom that is more typical for these character types. The youngest actress who plays \\"Lily\\" does a great job juxtaposing cute and creepy as the most screwed up \\"wildling.\\"<br /><br />You can clearly see Guillermo Del Toro's influence given his obsession with bugs. There is too much use of \\"The Grudge's\\" groaning sound effect -- someone needs to come up with a new and more original sound.<br /><br />When they eventually show \\"Mama\\" in all her glory it starts looking a bit cheesy.  But of the three similar titles put out in the last six months (Sinister, The Possession), this is the best of that lot.
B004Z8ZFAI|5.0|Got this for my six year old.  She loves it. There were a couple of scenes where someone was really mean to someone else and it upset her.  It is rated G, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger than 6.  That being said, the animation and the choreography is amazing and the story is cute.  Its a good family movie.
B00124DSR0|5.0|When you consider the competition at the time - Beatles, Stones, Pink Floyd, Zeppelin, etc - Chicago didn't stand a chance as being one of the premiere rock bands of all time. But this first outing demonstrates the vast and varied talent that they presented time and again in their lyrics, music, and production. Unable to keep the name because a lawsuit brought by the CTA against them, the band CHICAGO went on to become legends in our time and will forever be in my book as one of the greatest rock and roll groups.
B00111YM5G|5.0|This is a wonderful movie starring Andy Whitfield (Spartacus). Gabriel is sent to purgatory to try for maintain the balance of good and evil. He is the last of the 7 Arcs that were sent. I will watch it over and over.
1476733953|5.0|This is my first time reading a sci-fi novel and I finished all 5 books within two days.  Awesome story line, character development and my favorite item about the book that it wasn't \\"techy\\".  I plan to purchase the rest of the Silo Series for my Kindle.<br /><br />Awesome job Hugh!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Excellent film! It arrived as promised. I wanted a personal copy for my collection after seeing the movie in the theatre.
B00BI745AA|3.0|The movie was good, but Russell Crowe's singing and acting was cheesy! Since he was in a VERY large portion of the movie this kind of ruined it for me. Also Anne Hathaway who was AMAZING was only in it for the 1st 30 min and last 2-3min.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Excellent film! It arrived as promised. I wanted a personal copy for my collection after seeing the movie in the theatre.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I felt as if the story was lacking substance. Delirium the first novel came out of the gate leaving you wanting so much more then the second novel left you in the middle of a love triangle. I was expecting something BIG to happen in delerium or at the very least all of the loose ends to be tied up, but I was left feeling dissatisfied.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Lincolns biographies have a lot more quotable pieces than used in this biopic. The exposition is littered with viewer catch ups of the Chief of Staff educating Lincoln on the government system for the purpose of bringing the viewer up to speed. The better and more timely story would have been focusing on the reconstruction. Talented actors could not save the slow, contrite portrayal of American History.
0765365278|5.0|I loved this book and put this series as #3 on my modern fantasy list, behind Martin's Song of Ice and Fire and Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicle.  Can't wait to read the rest.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Brings new light to a period of history that often is thought of as the Dark Ages. For the curious.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|Once again Baldacci develops fascinating characters who, despite their hard to fully accept abilities, keeps the reader involved.  Once I managed to &#34;suspend my disbelief,&#34; I was able to fully enjoy this tale.  If you can't relax your fixed notions of reality, you will find this novel hard to swallow.  But if you can, you will leave the book with very warm feelings for the characters and will have had a thrilling journey.  After all, it is FICTION!
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|This is one of the best auto racing films ever made.  The accuracy of the racing is spot on, and is what the movie is about.  Not much plot or story line, very little dialogue, just racing.  And it certainly doesn't hurt that Steve McQueen stars.<br />If you like racing films, this is a &#34;must have&#34; for your collection.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is super fun I downloaded thinking it would be for babies but its really fun u get to make your own town awesome!!!! fun for all ages unless your a boy!!!!
B000IOM0WY|4.0|One of the few movies that the remake is better than the original.  Very entertaining heist movie, totally improbable, which is of course, why it's fun.  Good cast and well acted, and a great advertisement for Mini Coopers.

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Beautiful album with many hints of bowie's nostalgia for the berlin years (low, lodger. heroes). The album is strangely depressing but very moving, poetic, romantic, rocking, ...
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|My mouse logitech G500 mouse's left mouse button began to fail a few weeks ago. I tried to fix it desperately, I took it apart, tried the switch fix, air canned the usb ports and plug, but alas it finally convulsed to death in the middle of writing a research paper. The word document cycled between highlighting a word, sentence, paragraph, and the whole article at a furious rate. I unplugged the mouse to keep from losing my dozens of pages of work. It was time for a new mouse. Where to begin? This last mouse was fantastic and i was admittedly spoiled by it, I couldn't stand my old optical mouse. But it was a gift and I was not thrilled about spending $60 on a peripheral.<br /><br />When I found this mouse I was skeptical, but I had just bought a laptop charger from this company for my mother and it was a solid quality product. And for $30 it was very reasonable, especially given the 8,000 DPI and 9 buttons. Alright, let's do this.<br /><br />When the mouse arrived I was very impressed by the packaging. The box sold the mouse very well, I could see it standing next to any number of Razer products in a brick and mortar store on the &#34;high end gaming mice,&#34; shelf. When I removed it out of the box I was immediately hesitant. It was very light, so I proceeded to stuff all of the weights into the bottom of the mouse. It still felt light, well let's give it a try I suppose.<br /><br />I could tell right away this was going to be a different mouse all together, the older G500 was hefty and you directed it. This mouse was very form fitting and comfortable, it's lighter weight and very smooth pads at the bottom allowed the mouse to effortlessly glide on my desk. This mouse wants to help you guide it. But like an over excited helper I found myself overshooting the mouse on the screen, after some configuration (I prefer 1600 DPI as my default speed) the speed became manageable but it was still very eager to zoom across the screen. It's been about a week and half and i have grown used to this light and nimble mouse but i still find myself missing a button or icon (or person) by a small margin from time to time.<br /><br />The buttons make for very useful tools, whether I'm in a game or just general use, I missed having back and forth button on my mouse. Additionally, I enjoy being able to load separate profiles for different games, just make sure you leave the same button as the &#34;switch profile,&#34; button otherwise you're stuck until you get back into the mouse software. The software, by the way, is very easy to use. The only con being the color options, 16 million colors may be a little too optimistic, but you can certainly get all your ROY G BIV colors without difficulty. Standout features are 4 DPI settings, ability to add acceleration to mouse movement, up to 1000 hz poll rate, multiple profiles, and complete customization in mouse buttons.<br /><br />Overall very solid mouse. Looks and feels great in your hand, it has quality feel to it as if I spent much more than $30. it is also extremely comfortable and ergonomic as far as button placement. I still wish it was heavier so it would feel a little less jumpy, but this may just be me. This is the only reason I will deduct a star, otherwise 5/5.
B00821OX98|5.0|The storyline is great and the action is spot on. If the human race was threatened to extinction by an alien oppressor, this would be the most likely outcome.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I find this game fun and would like to see the new Canterlot update added.  The game has kind of stalled for me and would like to see the new content.  Id  rather get the update than starting a new game from a competitor.  Please update soon! :-)
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Mr. Miyazaki's movies tend to deliver a solid message, and Nausicaa is no exception. If you liked the astounding creativity, wrapped around a strong moral message that was in his other films, then you'll likely love Nausicaa too.
B00BIPCXJM|4.0|I liked this series because the lead is a strong woman who is married to a philandering spouse.  She was stressed by his cheating but it did not overwhelm her.  She is working for a legal firm and her boss is one of her previous beaus from her old school days.  Boss is still interested in pursuing a relationship, but our heroine has two children to think about.  I like the fact that television is now portraying strong women, showing the world that we are not little &#34;birdies&#34; that have to be protected.  We can protect ourselves and our families, and carry on regardless of the situation because we have to.  It's what we do as mothers, sisters, and wives.  We can get it together when the situation calls for it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Several of my girlfriends couldn't stop talking about this series.  I watched seasons 1 and 2 on Hulu Plus, then just had to see season 3.  Loved the price and quality of these videos!

B009X2CVXA|5.0|The beginning is almost like the beginning of the TV series &#34;revenge&#34; in fact I would not be surprised if the writer of that series had read this book.<br /><br />Very gripping easy read.
B003R50AW8|5.0|While not a book I would normally read, i decided to give this title a go after reading the Book thief (Which I loved).<br />I did end up enjoying this book, and found it easy to identify with the characters.

B005EGXTHG|4.0|Satisfying ending to this trilogy however felt that this book lost it's way in the last chapters.<br />While the sister being killed was not really necessary, I felt the ending was not well thought thru and rushed.<br /><br />However over all I loved the trilogy, the characters and the message
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pines was a lot of fun to read.  A great little thrill ride.  You will definitely enjoy the mind trip taken by Ethan as long as it doesn't happen to you. :)
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Very much enjoyed the Hunger games trilogy.<br />Fast paced, actioned packed, with characters that we can identify and form attachements to.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I love how the movie uses multiple forms of narration to tell the story, from the beginning with pictures and voice over, to the way the characters tell you what has been going on.  The language can be a bit over the top in the f-bomb department, but given the circumstances I did not find it excessive.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a taste of the late seventies early eighties and American Middle Eastern relations.<br />I also enjoy that the movie lets you see how politics works, and how in many cases it does not.
0143122010|5.0|Some books keep you thinking for weeks and months after you have finished reading them.  Pinker's Better Angels is such a book.  This book looks at the whole of human history from the perspective of violence and its trajectory.  Conventional wisdom gets demolished by careful research and engaging prose.
1573226521|5.0|What ever happened to Alex Garland?  I ask this, knowing that he moved on from writing novels into penning screenplays (for Danny Boyle no less, the man behind the big screen adaptation of this very novel), but I ask it also knowing that his voice is missed in the world of literature.  I just got done reading his debut novel (written in 1998), `The Beach' and I have to say I was blown away with the depth of storytelling here.  After writing this novel he moved on to penning two other books (neither of which I have read but both I which I plan to eventually) and then disappeared to write for the big screen.<br /><br />It's a shame, really.<br /><br />Now I've seen the film version of this back when it was released and I must say, I was almost hesitant to even read this novel because I didn't respond all that favorably to the film.  That being said, this was such a ridiculously rewarding read that I have to highly recommend this read to everyone fearful it's a generic rehash of the film.  This is so much more inspired.  Reading this, I can understand why certain things were done in the film (the ill-advised video game sequence gets colored in more in the novel and becomes slightly understandable and yet still ill-advised), but they are just so much better suited for the printed page than the silver screen.  The themes presented, of isolation due to fearful disgust of the plague of modern civilization and the innate desire to find something pure and sacred in a world polluted by creature comforts and selfish traits, are beautifully etched into the fiber of this novel without once ever being overwhelming or bombarding.  They just flow with such effortlessness.  As the true colors of our hearts desires become evident (especially as Richard, our anti-hero of sorts, begins to realize his own shifting personality) we are given a brutal shock to the system as the world comes crashing down on these richly developed characters (developed through such subtle nuances).<br /><br />The story, for those unaware, centers on three young travelers, Richard, Etienne and Francoise, who find in their possession a map to a secret beach untouched by tourists.  Throwing caution to the wind, the three venture to the island and find a group of isolated individuals who live in a tribe of sorts, segregated from the rest of the human world.  They feed off the island, work on the island, and basically relax all the time.  Before they know it, the three are brought into this world and become taken over by it.  Months go by and they forget what it is even like back home.  Home doesn't exist for them anymore.  But eventually all good things must come to an end, and in this case it is more like all good things uncover themselves to be vile and deadly things, and the final pages of this gripping novel uncover a barbarianism that is wholly appropriate despite being completely baffling.<br /><br />Garland is a marvelous writer.  I'm saddened that he's given it up for screenwriting.  Not that screenwriting is a step down since I do love me some movies, but his gift for storytelling deserves to be fleshed out in the form of more novels.  I want more from him!<br /><br />I want more of this beach./>The story, for those unaware, centers on three young travelers, Richard, Etienne and Francoise, who find in their possession a map to a secret beach untouched by tourists.

B0058YPL66|5.0|My teenage daughter complains I don't spend enough time with her.  She loves Once Upon a Time, but it is in its second season.  She recommended that I buy the first season on DVD so we could watch it together.  &#34;Out of the mouths of babes.&#34;<br /><br />It was a brilliant idea.  We set up at night and share quality time together watching the season one shows.  They are all there, the product is great, it arrived in a sealed container, no scratches or damages of any kind.  We love it and thank you for your prompt response, and great merchandise.<br /><br />Now I am ready for the Season Two shows!<br /><br />I will be back again for more.

B006JN5KBG|5.0|It really disgusts me that sellers would inflate the price of this Blu-ray disc. Sure only 2000 copies were sold. Sure the movie is a classic. But that is no reason to ask outrageous amounts of money just to turn a profit. I own a Blu-ray copy and purchased it for $29.99 from Screen Archives Entertainment (the issuing company) in October of 2011 when it was released. If I ever sold it, I would do so at a FAIR price of $20.00 because one, it has been viewed over 12 times now, and two, it is not my intention to rip people off.<br /><br />This movie is surely the benchmark by which all other vampire films should be measured. But, why rip people off to get rid of it? I don't, can't, and never will understand human greed. You people all sicken me. The reason you haven't sold your Blu-ray copies is not because the movie is not popular. It is. You haven't sold your copies because you are trying to steal from your buying public. It's too bad Amazon has not shut you down yet, worse, that they allow it.<br /><br />Good luck selling your copies. I hope the buying public reads MY review before they see yours. I am sorry to all those people who feel they need to spend such a exorbitant amount of money for the sake of a two hour movie. I know it's rare people, but the asking prices here are just not worth it. I give the film 5 stars. I give those of you ripping people off nothing but my utter contempt!
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I loved NSYNC and I loved Justin Timberlake but this album; the 20/20 Experience; missed getting a spot in my heart. It's like he took too much time off in between releasing cd's. His First cd was ok but it was upbeat and you could dance to it. His second cd was AWESOME. His convert was EVEN BETTER. This cd however...it's all slow songs that are about 8mins long on average! I understand that he likes the retro feel and stuff but this one just puts me to sleep. I skip to the next song once the extra 2-3min ending starts playing. I haven't put this cd on replay either.

B00BSBXA98|5.0|We streamed this movie via Amazon and could not be happier. The family (consisting of a four and five year old) thoroughly enjoyed the entire film. There was not a time that either of my kids were not glued to what was happening during the movie (a feat that most films have a hard time doing). The movie linked act to act flawlessly and was an amazing film to watch. I highly recommend this to anyone with children who like circus type performances, or anyone who has never seen a Cirque production. As always the streaming was perfect from Amazon solidifying why I use the service.

Many times while reading aloud to my husband I had to stop I was laughing so hard. I can't recommend this book enough and just writing these words is making me want to read it all over again.

B00A2DOKLU|5.0|So, I admit, I wasn't too fond of The Weeknd....at first. The only thing I knew about him was that he sung the hook to Drake's &#34;Crew Love&#34;. Then I heard &#34;Wicked Games&#34; on the radio and was somewhat impressed (except for the lyric &#34;...dancing with the Devil&#34;). The video was okay. Different. But then, I heard &#34;Coming Down&#34; and immediately purchased the album. Beware, this album has 30 songs. That is unheard of nowadays. You will be addicted very quickly. He has a different style; not very mainstream. He uses off-beats to capitalize on lyrics. A bit eclectic I might say. &#34;Coming Down&#34; possesses strong emotion. My favorite songs include &#34;Gone&#34;, &#34;The Birds Pt. 1&#34;, &#34;The Fall&#34;, &#34;Same Old Song&#34;, and &#34;What You Need&#34;. If you are looking for something to add to your music player, look no further than this album.
B004V9MU86|4.0|I thought this could have been accepted as a realistic reproduction of life at the time in Germany where people could not even trust their closest friends. Despite this ,many risks were taken by good people in the face of certain death if they were exposed.<br /><br />I could see myself witnessing the experience of the principal characters.<br /><br />Almost a page turner for me.<br /><br />I am looking forward to seeing the film.

B00CHVJODE|5.0|This is an animated tale of a teen girl and her natural desire to explore the world and the angst that it causes the father who wants to keep the family safe in a cave...in this case it is not a metaphor. Emma Stone was perfect for our on screen teen girl Eep, complete with her signature crackling voice. The world around them is falling apart and their only chance for survival is to follow the new Guy (Ryan Reynolds) to the objection of Grug (Nicolas Cage).<br /><br />In spite of what sounds like an adult theme, it is aimed at the kids. The comedy is slapstick and simple jokes. The animals are wildly colorful so as to not be frightening as they chase humans. As an adult I didn't find the film boring, yet its lack of depth allowed me to have frequent breaks and not miss any plot points. Eep provides girls with a positive role model, something that is finally becoming the norm in these animated sagas.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman played the voice of Gran, most likely because Betty White was too busy playing football. Great film for the kids, so-so for adults.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|I loved this movie a long time ago on VHS. And I still love it. Sure, some of it can be unreal, but the cars and the car chases are great. Lots of action. The actors do a good job, too.
B005LAII44|4.0|This is a fun popcorn action film with loads of action, great banter, and a ridiculous plot. Fifteen minutes into the film the G.I. Joes are enemies of the world and the president is an imposter. The Joes must rekindle old alliances and friendships to save the world from the evil-doers.<br /><br />The film incorporates advances in science, miniature drones, and nanotechnology to the extreme. Bruce Willis is added to the mix and James Carvel plays himself in a cameo. The most incredible scene is the mountain fighting which happens about midway. The film appears to be designed for an action game, one in which my character would die in the first 20 minutes. Worth a view on the big screen if all you crave is action.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Plenty of killing

0385536828|4.0|This is a story about a minor British spy scandal in the 1970s.  Serena Frome is a young woman studying at Cambridge who has a brief affair with an older man who is grooming her for recruitment into MI5 (the British Secret Service).  She is given the mission of recruiting a writer with acceptable pro-Government attitudesinto a non-profit foundation which will give him funding to write.  While this seems unlikely, it is apparently inspired by real events.  Serena is assigned to a writer called Tom Haley and they embark on an affair which won't end well.<br /><br />The book gives you a wonderful sense of 1970s Britain.  I have to admit, I didn't particularly care for Serena who seemed a very passive and not at all worldly wise character but I liked the way that the plot twists and turns and just when you think it's going to end in a very predictable way, it goes it a completely different direction.  When I was reading it I thought it would amount to a three star read for me, but looking back on it I realize I liked it more than that.

1603429999|5.0|All the glowing reviews were right! When I received this book I almost read it cover to cover the day I got it. It opened up my mind to all the possibilities of knitting in the round and I started using some of the new techniques immediately.<br /><br />I learned a new cast on and cast off - and converted a (VERY simple) pattern from flat knitting to knitting in the round and it worked out beautifully. No boring sewing at the end of my project - Ha ha!  And the use of more than one circular needle blew my mind - what an ingenious idea! It enables you to try on a garment BEFORE you finish it, so you can adjust your knitting - or okay, you might even have to start again. But it's so much better to find that out after knitting, say 3 inches, than after you've finished.<br /><br />The only downside? Now I've got to buy a lot more circular needles! :)
0385535147|4.0|I'm stepping back into the John Grisham stream with his latest novel The Racketeer. It's been a while since I've read a Grisham novel, mostly because my enjoyment of his work seemed to be on a good/bad/good/bad cycle. For whatever, The Racketeer caught my eye when it was put into circulation at the library. Having finished it this weekend, I'm more inclined to want to catch back up with his books. The Racketeer was pretty good...<br /><br />The storyline revolves around Malcolm Bannister, a small town lawyer who was inadvertently caught up in a larger fraud scheme and sent to prison for ten years. He quickly got the reputation as a jail house lawyer and gained the trust of many inmates who were hoping for a legal miracle to get them out. When a federal judge is found murdered in a rural cabin, Bannister makes the Feds an offer... he'll tell them who killed the judge in return for a Rule 35 commutation of his sentence, entry into the Witness Protection Program, and the $150,000 reward for finding the killer. With no other leads, the Feds accept and Bannister hands over the name of the killer... but he's not done. That's only the first step of a larger plan designed to get payback for his conviction and become a very rich man.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the story. Grisham throws a number of plot twists into the mix that I didn't see coming. Once Bannister leaves prison, the action seems to be somewhat random and unexplained until the last fifty or so pages. I'll admit I was starting to lose faith that the book was going anywhere or would end up making sense, but there was a payoff for hanging in there. This was one of those books I would have enjoyed while on a plane or on vacation...<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun it makes me laugh. The mission is real fun and I think the characters are real good and I think they should pay less money like 950 for star coins.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I can't wait to read the rest of this series!!!<br />I loved the cliff hanger at the end most of all because it summarizes the whole book and tells u what's coming next.

B006ZN7KMM|4.0|Impactante Abortar en Londres, aquí en Uruguay tenemos una nueva ley que despenaliza el aborto pero, son tantas las trabas que se ponen que, seguramente, siguen habiendo abortos clandestinos y sobre todo las mujeres pobres y las menores tienen que abortar en forma insegura.<br />Me llegó muy profundo el caso de los emigrantes, muchos de los cuales eran compatriotas , hermanos e hijos. Hoy los mismos españoles que nos rechazaban vuelven a pedir refugio a los sudacas y se los brindamos gustosos.<br />Aprendí mucho con el maestro Pineda, que vuelve a ser actual.<br />El caso Maragall me ayuda a reflexionar sobre la vejez, la enfermedad y la eutanasia.<br />La mayoría de las crónicas son imperdibles.<br />En fin, esta es la historia reciente vista con \\"el diario del lunes\\"

B00371QQ0M|4.0|Dune has been out there for years, it was very imaginative for its time and it has not lost its shine over the years. The effects are good,and a necessity for any sci fi collection.<br />Frank Herberts novel  was the basis for the screenplay but it was chopped about a lot,  but the story still flows. it lends itself well to blu ray.To my knowledge there are at least 3 differents cuts of this movie currently in circulation mostly on DVD , some longer,  some in appalling quality. This blu ray version is probably the best  quality and the easiest to follow if you are new to this movie.I have not gone into plot detail, it is a good vs evil story, plenty of action , a typical David Lynch style film,  Sean Young  the love interest in her pre Blade Runner days does well and the blatant use of Sting to capitalise on his rock fame is not unnoticed
B00BF11STU|2.0|The movie had way too much dialogue and was hard to comprehend. The acting was poor and not very believable. I tried at least 5 or 6 times to give the movie a try but kept turning it off. It did not hold my attention and lacked any real substance or information worth viewing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the Omnibus edition because I enjoyed the free part one (the first one is always free, right?).<br /><br />I enjoyed the premise and the characters.  I knew I was into it when I would be impatient - he would go from one character to another, leaving a little cliffhanger when doing the switch.  Always a good sign when I continually wonder what's going to happen next.<br /><br />I wonder - why isn't this a TV series, or a video game?  The premise and world created seem like they would lend easily to that format.<br /><br />Anyhow, liked the book, worth buying and enjoying.  Bought the Kindle versions, only the third full-length book I've read that way.  Once I got engaged with the story, I didn't notice the difference between an analog book and a digital one.

B004UPAIDK|5.0|After seeing The Evil Dead, I knew that I had to see Evil Dead 2. While Evil Dead 2 is certainly not as scary or creepy as its' predecessor, it is by far one of the most inventive, funny and original movies I have ever seen. Bruce Campbell completely outshines everyone in the movie. Where The Evil Dead was completely horror, Evil Dead 2 mixes in Comedy and Horror in a somewhat equal balance, with comedy being mostly evident throughout. If you have amazon prime, go ahead and watch it for free. If not, rent it for a couple of dollars. Trust me! It's worth watching
B005I548B4|5.0|Compelling, kept me interested and wanting more<br />Love Sparks work, makes me hungry for more<br />Nice story line, recommended for sure
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As a dog lover myself, I found this book to be very good.  I loved that the story was written from the dog's perspective. A good read for anyone who loves dogs.
B0062OCNAI|2.0|I found this book very repetitive, it kept going over the same things over and over. The last chapters of the book were captivating but I'm not sure if it makes the book worth reading.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was great.  What a perspective of writing from the view of a 5 yesr old.  It was hard to put down.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This is the way Les Miserables was supposed to be sung. I have seen it on Broadway 3 times and own the London Recording and Original Broadway Cast recording. This rendition is my favorite. There is a reason they call it the Dream Cast.<br /><br />I'd get the video version first, as I think it's worth watching the subdued performances of the actors in this concert, however, I have both.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This was a good read.  It kept your interest throughout the book.  This would be a good read for a woman.  I loved the surprise ending.
0786956291|4.0|Our daughter was interested in playing D&D with some friends and this set really got her started.  We are used to quick shipping with Prime but this came from an amazon seller so it didn't make it for the day she needed it but came a few days later.  It was packaged very well and came in perfect condition.  We are pleased and she is enjoying it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Ran across this with little to no expectations, but after a few pages was completely hooked.  Definitely in the top tier of Sci Fi.

B009H1S56O|5.0|She's a Lana freak. So i decided to get her something she would just go absolutely nuts for. After looking through cd's and poster, i came across this gem. It comes with her cd's, little poster cards with her pictures on them, her music videos and a vintage record. She LOVED the record, and when she saw the posters she was just speechless. Felt awesome giving her this :) I noticed that people claimed 2 bonus songs were &#34;missing&#34; but for everything you get that shouldn't really be a problem. I got about a million kisses that day. No joke, best gift i've ever given to someone.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Kate Morton can keep you guessing through out the entire book.  She can tell a tale that makes you want to know the end, but also wants the book to keep going and going.  My favorite is The Forgotten Garden, but this one comes in as a close second.  Enjoy as you get lost in the story!
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I've been a fan of Resident Evil since it came out on Playstation over 15 years ago.  You have to be a fan to really like these movies because otherwise they are pretty bad.  I love Michelle and Milla so it's good for me :)

0688021492|5.0|One of the best works of historical fiction ever written.  A must read for anyone remotely interested in the making of an artist.  Extreme poverty and extreme obstacles could not stop extreme talent, and Weiss powerfully portrays that struggle with an absorbing, evocative tale about a man's all consuming need to sculpt, and sculpt his way, and how a woman gives herself so freely and completely to him in the pursuit of that goal.  For it is as much her story as his.  Without Rose, the woman Rodin would ultimately marry two weeks before his death, you wonder if he could have ever fulfilled his dream.  Powerful writing, inspiring story.  Needs to be rediscovered by the general public.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This a great series brought to life visually in a competent, creative manner. If you have enjoyed the books, I recommend it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Wish I had more free time to read for fun.  Enjoying the journey.  Have watched HBO's 1st season and trying to read ahead before watching the next 2 seasons.  Wish I had read first, but really enjoying
B00BD05PEW|3.0|You can find this piece of the collection elsewhere for 19.99. It is also fairly small but very detailed. I would recommended purchasing this piece, but from a different source that offers it for less.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|It had a few good laughs, but I felt there were a few too many argument-ish scenes.  Could have probably shaved off a good 15 minutes and made it a stronger movie.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I own the books but have yet to read them. If they are anything like the movie then they will be great.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This trilogy was a delightful surprise.  Well written, well developed characters, suspense, tension, relationships... Oh, yeah, the sex wasn't bd either!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was really good until I got to the part about the carnivorous trees. That was a bit too much.  On the whole it was a good story
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A great book for anyone who needs to review their emotional welling being.  I recommend it to both married couples and single people.  There is insight to better understanding of your emotional &#34;health&#34;.  A book you should several times and then again later.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|The movie is excellent.  Fairly true to the book.  Outstanding blue-ray picture quality and sound.<br /><br />The only thing I'm not thrilled about has nothing to do with the movie itself, but rather Hollywood's insistence on squeezing a few extra dollars out of consumers by jacking up the price and including a DVD I don't want or need, and an ultraviolet copy I don't want or need.  I'd pay $20 for just the blue-ray disc that I do want, but if this wasn't a gift for someone who really, really wanted this movie in blue-ray (and the fact that i couldn't find just the blue-ray disc), I would never pay $30 for three copies of the same movie, in two formats I won't ever use.  I could rent this ten times on blue-ray and it would have still been cheaper.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was riveting right from the beginning.  It could easily be a real next-door drama in your neighborhood.  I couldn't put it down once I started it.
0395389496|4.0|This is such a beautiful book! Gifted it to my daughter for Xmas. She loves the story. I gave it four stars because the ornament was disappointing but it's a beautiful copy nonetheless.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is for sure my favorite of Sparks' novels to date. He does a wonderful job with character building giving the reader the compassion required to root for their success. This is not a typical love story of boy-meets-girl and they live happily-ever-after walking away in the sunset. No. This book provides strong character relationships, an ever-present theme of abusive relationships, and the thrill of the hunt! You spend chapters and chapters falling in love with the story- and then you realize things are NOT going to be so easy after all. The uncommon element of thrill and danger makes Safe Haven a brilliant work from an established author.  Some may find that the story is predictable at times, but I did not think it made a bit of difference. The relationship between all the characters is strong enough to look past predictable and I was definitely surprised by the ending.  I have not seen the movie- so I do not know if it holds to this book, but I always prefer to book to movie anyway.

1455502758|5.0|This was an excellent intimate look into one man's mortality. The dignity with which Mr. Hitchens faced his ultimate end was moving.<br />I enjoyed the clarity and wit of the discussion. I highly recommend this book. However, proceed with caution. If you want to continue to believe that religion was not concocted by men do not read this book. Those who are afraid to think that what they were told is not correct in all of its' part probably should not read this book.

B000286SCO|5.0|I used to watch this concert (on VHS) and its great extras when I was touring nationally with a rock band back in the mid 90's. I always found it inspirational. Myung and Petrucci are among my favorite front line performers! If you are a fan of Dream Theater this show is a must.<br />On a side note I wish it had been available in zone 1 (USA) format so I didn't have to switch my computers zone designation and so I could play it on my PS3. (Instead of zone 2 UK that it came in.)
0307352153|4.0|I read a chapter a day, and thought about what I had read. And at the end of the book, I can say that I feel better about myself, and the other introverts in the world. I learned that if I believe in something strongly enough, introversion will not hold me back. That in fact, it is an asset. Yay, team!
B005LLSZNM|3.0|I am not sure what is going on with Amazon videos, but for me they are all starting (slowly) in SD. Then, after the recap of the last episode and about a two minutes in, HD becomes available and does work with some lag and sync issues. Problems are a lot worse on Chrome. Whatever you do, do not go back cause you missed something because you may loose HD again or it will crash altogether. As long as I leave it alone once HD is enabled, I can finish.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A definite must read.  I wasn't too sure about the concept initially but am a Mitch Albom fan so I went ahead and bought it. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down

B00B1E6FF8|1.0|I absolutely loved the movie so I bought it as soon as it came out. I ordered the combo pack with the UltraViolet digital copy thinking there'd be an iTunes download with it like so many other movies. There isn't and Sony and Flixster were less than helpful trying to remedy the situation. If you're hoping to get the iTunes download, don't waste your money on this. Go straight to iTunes to get it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I'm glad I only bought the first book and didn't pay for the whole trilogy because it was a complete waste of money. I felt like I should finish the book since I paid the Kindle cover price, but by the end I was only skimming, hoping to sight land in a dismal sea of bad writing. I was sorely disappointed. I've read better Harlequin novels. The only consolation is that I can write a review and possibly save someone else from wasting their hard-earned cash.<br /><br />The book reads as if it were written by an adolescent. There is no plot to speak of, only a vague story line to glue together the badly written sex scenes. The writing is hackneyed and repetitive, the characters one-sided and shallow. Christian Grey is the fantasy billionaire daydream of a teenage girl. He is portrayed as being so rich, powerful, talented, and handsome that it's impossible for a mature adult to conjure up any believable mental image of him. Ana's stumbling, blushing, naïvet&eacute; and her \\"inner goddess\\" were equally hard to swallow. I couldn't suspend disbelief enough to entertain the idea of even a romance between Ana and Christian, let alone a BDSM relationship. Adding to the pubescent feel of the novel, the relationship between them is portrayed as a painfully dysfunctional love-at-first-sight crush. As for the sex scenes, they are a bizarre mix of prudishness (\\"down there\\"), unlikely orgasms, and BDSM that disturbingly crosses the line into simple physical abuse. The book doesn't come to any sort of conclusion since it's part of a trilogy, but the direction is clear enough. Ana will overcome her lip-biting reluctance, marry Christian, and they will live happily ever after in James' bizarre idea of a BDSM relationship.<br /><br />All of this is portrayed in writing that left me wondering where the Random House editors were. Perhaps the book was given to an intern? Didn't anyone notice the repetition and stilted phrasing? Between the unbelievable characters, lack of plot, and bad writing there is really nothing to redeem the book. By the end I was completely mystified as to why there was so much social media attention. Don't waste your money and time.Between the unbelievable characters, lack of plot, and bad writing there is really nothing to redeem the book.

B004ZY0VHY|4.0|I have almost not been able to put this book down even to sleep. I plowed through it with an appreciation for the author's fine use of metaphors and generally flawless tone, coupled with a morbid fascination (how much worse can it get? When will we know exactly what he did?). About two-thirds of the way through, though, I got really angry and disgusted and I almost wished I could put it down or even toss it across the room. At some point, the fictional narrator completely failed to elicit any sympathy. At the end, I have to admit this was one of the most compelling stories I've ever read, if also one of the most desolate. Appropriately, considering the subject matter.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is AWESOME it is simple and easy to get a hang of quickly also its a great game to play in your spare time!!
B005EJNAK4|2.0|Though technically proficient, this movie has no message, profound or otherwise.  It turns out that the guy who \\"invented\\" the surrogates that folks can buy to act on their thought processes has decided it was a bad idea and wants to scrap the whole thing.  Some people don't want this to happen, but in the last reel, the switch is turned off, and all the surrogates drop dead at once.  End of movie.  We can tell who's a surrogate and who's real because the surrogates are really handsome and appear to have access to an endless supply of botox, while the real people look pretty raddled.  And they sound different.

B002N44XSG|4.0|This was a pretty good book I'd say. The only thing is if you want to read this and understand it completely you have to read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. All in all a pretty good book though.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|So much fun!!!<br />I bought this as free app of the day and very glad I did. It's fun, easy to understand, and not challenging enough to not be annoying yet not so easy to be boring. Great game. I rarely take the time to rate a game but I felt this game deserved the time.

B005K17RU0|3.0|I am dissapointed with the upgrade. I do not care for the appearance  or the symbols. They lightened up the backgrounds and in my opinion made it harder to read. I would like to go back to my old app.

Well the fashion was great (read:  Hugh was not hot - he was authentic, but not hot).  My biggest negative was the singing - it felt like all of the notes were clipped too short.  Until we got to Paris with the revolution, every song felt wrong.  Then the kids started singing and it got a lot better.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great addition to the Angry birds famliy.  A couple new birds and some pretty levels.  Good luck getting 3 stars on each level.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have to say, this has got to be one of the better Stephen King novels in years.  And as a fanatic of the Dark Tower, I was pleased to see an earlier glimpse of the world on the path to the tower.  To see a time when the thinnies weren't as wild, but more controlled.<br /><br />But that pales in comparison to the robust quality of the characterization and the smooth flow of the narrative.  I highly recommend it.  And not to worry, if you're not into the Dark Tower thing, it stands on its own just fine.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire was a great follow up to The Hunger Games.  In my opinion it was even better but kind of left you hanging at the end.  Great fast easy read with new interesting characters and situations.
067960085X|5.0|What more can I say that hasn't been said about Truman Capote's tight, lyrical prose style, concise and illuminating descriptions, brilliant metaphors, crisp and insightful characterization, and biting humor? So I'll just focus on the marquee character of the story, Holly Golightly.<br /><br />Golightly is an archetype for the female \\"orphan hick from the sticks\\" who escapes a dim agrarian existence in search of opportunity in the city using what resources she has--looks, charm, sexuality and guile.<br /><br />Holly, based roughly on Capote's mother, highlights the struggle of a category of American women rarely addressed in our literature. Poor and unskilled women of this post-World War II era who lacked education had few options but to perform housework or become a homemaker. Holly wanted more. Rags to riches was her chosen path with sex appeal as her chief means of transport. The horse in the book is a strong metaphor;  she was an accomplished \\"equestrian.\\"<br /><br />A perfect example of what Holly was aiming for, to marry well, was accomplished by a Polish immigrant, Barbara Piasecka Johnson. Barbara died at age 76 in April, 2013, capturing headlines just as she had when she married a consumer products tycoon who dumped his wife of 30+ years and left Babs the bulk of his substantial fortune. Barbara was a non-English-speaking immigrant example of Holly when she arrived at Ellis Island--poor, attractive, uneducated. And wily. Barbara was more successful than Holly, but then Holly was still in the hunt.<br /><br />Here's a link to an article describing Barbara:[...]<br />I readily recognized Holly because she is very much like my mother, one of a precious few things Truman and I share in common.<br /><br />Capote made Holly even more intriguing by giving her an existential dilemma; she prized freedom as much as she did wealth and was caught in a guilded cage of her own making in the pursuit of wealth through marriage.<br /><br />There's a little bit of Holly in more than a few women today. Most of them want to marry well, and they use their looks, charm, sexuality and guile to get them there. Holly is as fascinating to them as she is to men, perhaps more--a \\"classic\\" example.ore than a few women today. Most of them want to marry well, and they use their looks, charm, sexuality and guile to get them there. Holly is as fascinating to them as she is to men, perhaps more--a \\"classic\\" example.
1843106698|2.0|The author drags on and on and on and on. It might be because of his British culture to be boring and repeat and repeat himself over and over again and again. I couldn't complete the book as much as I tried. I had enough of it at the half-way mark. Aspergers and Autism is important for me to understand. I have read several other books and articles that gave me good information. I guess I got some \\"new\\" information out of this book but the drudgery wasn't worth the effort.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is AMAZING!!!! It's free and 4 1/2 stars! I rate it 5 stars! I am sooooooo glad I downloaded this game. I would recommend this game to every one but definitely all those horse lovers and animal lovers. Buy this app! You won't regret it!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I haven't been reading for sometime and decided to pick this up and see where this goes.  It's been a long time that I finished a book in a day's time and this book motivates me in many personal level. I wish Shin the best of luck and the profit of this book will help freeing the sufferring North Koreans inside the camps. Highly recommended!
0385337388|5.0|This book was published the year I started medical school. I remember feeling both intimidated and confused when I first read it in my preclinical years. Then I started my 3rd and 4th years, which are purely clinical, and finally my internship. Reading it now some 35 years later feels sweetly nystolgic, and brings back some of the best and the hardest moments of my life, and remarkable people and experiences.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Many emotions throughout this story and not extremely predictable. Could have been hotter and more erotic but, not really that type of book. Worth the time.
0061906220|5.0|My 22 month old grandson is an avid book lover and when I saw this book, I just knew he would love it and that he did.  He carried it around with him all day and I must have read it to him 20 times!  Interactive and fun, the art work is wonderful and the story is cute and educational at the same time.  I bought two more Pete the Cat books to surprise him with.
1595827684|4.0|A nice book and a nice view of game. I think it is worth to buy for a fan of mass effect.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The entire movie was political positioning to pass the 13th amendment. About as exiting as watching paint dryer grass grow.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was good read for a good age range of readers. Interesting  and full of adventure.  Worth reading and a must read before seeing the movie
B008HK3XYK|5.0|For those who said you are not able to charge your kindle while it's in the case, have it in backwards.  As to it not fitting properly, mine did fit perfectly.  Snapped in tightly and has never popped out, even after dropping it from a standing position, although the floor was carpeted.  Everything works great and still does, even after the dropping mishap. Stands up for movie watching, sleep/wake cover feature works, which I didn't think was that important, but I certainly do now.  Wouldn't want a cover without it. Some reviewers commented that the band left marks on their screens, I have no idea why anyone would need to put the band over the screen, unless it's in backwards.  I don't  submit alot of reviews, but after having this case for almost 6 months, I have not found one thing wrong with it. Not that it should matter, but I ordered the orange color.

B004MKLRYC|5.0|I love this book! The poor Queen of England, discovers a new love of reading. Yet everyone in her staff is against her new \\"hobby\\".

1400067820|3.0|Not many authors are as fearless and eloquent advocates of their views. That makes Nassim Taleb a thought-provoking author. Taleb regards himself as both a trader and philosopher. He is a household name in the investing world and was propelled into fame with his two books Black Swan (2007) and Fooled by Randomness (2001). In Fooled by Randomness he challenged our entrenched views of volatility as an appropriate measure of risk, instead advocating the idea of the surviving sample. He described how many of the successes (and failures) we see in the world such as Facebook or the young hedge fund manager who is up 80% in a given year, don't necessarily reflect foresight, knowledge, skill or intelligence but are more often than not blind luck. Black Swan exposed that large, consequential but improbable 6 sigma events occur more frequently than recognized by Joe public. In it he presciently predicted the collapse of the US financial system.<br /><br />Taleb sees randomness everywhere. In Antifragile he takes his philosophy a step further. In his introduction he explains how Black Swan can be read best as an appendix to Antifragile. The crux is living by rules in order to benefit from Black Swan events and randomness.<br /><br />The book's core idea can be summed up by Nietschze's \\"Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger\\". Everything gains or losses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty. Antifragility are those phenomena that grow stronger when exposed to shocks. Want to build muscle? Do short bursts of 100 kilogram lunges rather than a 90 minute leisurely jog. Need to shed weight? Starve oneself in a fast for a few days and then feast on steaks and red wine on off days. Vaccines make us stronger by giving us a little of the infectious agent. Exposure to stressful events and our subsequent adaptation lie at the very heart of Darwinian evolution, making for stronger species. The book is littered with (no pun intended) such random examples.<br /><br />Taleb advocates a Barbell strategy, a term often associated with the bond markets when traders invest in both long and short duration bonds but no intermediate term durations. Taleb's much broader interpretation implies playing it safe in some areas to protect against Black Swans and taking a lot of small risks in others, through a portfolio of 90% cash and 10% in high impact out of the money antifragile options. Bad events contain useful information and it's a big mistake to avoid shocks. The mistakes of failed entrepreneurs guide the next generation of start-ups to avoid the same errors and thereby build more sustainable businesses. The reason we have aviation safety today is due the crashes of the past, each crash yielding information that makes the next flight safer. In the macro economy avoiding shocks through intervention by for instance cutting rates (fragilista Greenspan) may sow the seeds of the next crisis. Often the best approach of doing nothing; \\"via negative\\" leads to issues resolving themselves spontaneously or a new superior status quo.<br /><br />This is a self-help book filled with anecdotes and musings. Direct investment applications are sparse. The book is divided into 7 books and 25 chapters. Book 1 introduces the core principles of antifragility; if all you require is the gist, read this. The other books discuss antifragility in the context of political systems, health, evolution, ethics and technology. Book 5 is mostly technical and can be skipped. It is unstructured and could have done with more editing. Having said that, references are wide and many and it's hard to come away not having learnt something, though many readers will find his grandiose style a little off-putting.<br /><br />After finishing the book I tried to develop an increased awareness of places where antifragility might appear. The issue is that like Taleb I'm prone to confirmation bias and end up seeing antifragility everywhere. Antifragile deserves its place firmly in the middle of the Barbell, slightly to the right perhaps but not at either end...<br /><br />This is a review by investingbythebooks.com

B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great show, this being in standard def is really quite ok.  The menu is easy to operate and the show loads up quickly.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|Every movie comes with a bonus disc of special features! I actually hadn't expected that. Each movie played perfectly and the casing was very nice.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|So Season 2 had a lot of dull spots in it (just plain boring at times), but that's no fault of Amazon.  The video streaming was just fine.
0061478784|5.0|For those of you that have seen Howl's Moving Castle before reading the book, like me, are in for a pleasant surprise. I loved this book and it is now on my list of favorites! I won't tell you any more for fear of revealing something. So, read it yourself and find out!

0385349947|5.0|I am reading this book as I finish my last semester of law school, and I am finding it to be a daily source of motivation to achieve the goals I've set for both my career and my personal life. I recommend this book for everyone, not just women!

0321784421|5.0|I've recently bought several HTML5 books and have gone through few of them. This one is by far the best introductory book - especially as far as semantics is concerned. However, it requires a fair, or better, previous knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript - it is by no means a book to learn HTML. It is intended to guide from previous HTML versions to version 5, and it accomplishes that in an excellent manner.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love this game. its fun and challenging.  charging the collections can be hard but it always gives you some goal to work toward.
B000FA675C|5.0|I was convinced to read this one by a Librarian friend -- both from the aspect of being a Catholic and someone who loves a good mystery. Read it cover to cover in one sitting and now reading another of Dan Brown's books.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|I found most of this book cantered around an explanation for an undercover situation rather than involving the reader it in....it was a little predictable and I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend.  However maybe for a quick airplane read?
B00C1TOTK0|1.0|The actual SHANE we know and love was shot at the classical 1:33 ratio. This version cuts off the tops<br />and bottoms of the frames of this meticulously composed<br />masterpiece to make it a spurious widescreen movie. True<br />lovers of SHANE would want black bars at the sides to preserve<br />the beautiful original framing of director George Stevens and cinematographer<br />Loyal Griggs. SHANE is the best Western ever made, but stick<br />with your old DVD copy if you care about this great film.
B00AU15HPC|3.0|Being a Moody Blues fan for many years, I look forward to ANYTHING new by the Moodies, or Justin solo.  I have to admit I did not care for this cd the first time I played it...I had to play it several times to start enjoying it.  I liked the Justin Hayward/Kenny Loggins song very much.  &#34;Cold Outside of Your Heart&#34; and &#34;Broken Dream&#34; are Justin Classics and, IMHO, should not have been 'tweaked' for this cd.  For this reason, and not liking the 'country' treatments in general, I gave it (3) stars, where I would usually give anything Justin does (5) stars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book really kept my attention.  It kept me wondering what could possibly happen next.  The only thing I didn't like was the ending.  I won't say anymore so I don't give it away.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good read.  I  am glad it is a love story.  I would recommend this book to others.  Very enjoyable
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Overall, it's a good movie. It keeps you entertained, it doesn't lose too much important stuff from the book, and it's just not bad.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Saw this movie at the theatre when it first came out and per ordered it so I can have my own copy at home.  Love the story and how it even makes you think about what is at your own core, something we often forget to reflect upon as we get busy in our lives.  Highly recommend this movie!
B005LAIHYU|3.0|I know where the makers of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter were coming from.  They wanted a goofy, over the top action movie with a title that would instantly catch a person's attention: something that would surely get folk on the internet talking...Where did I hear this marketing gimmick before?  Oh right: Snakes on a Plane.<br /><br />You think that producers would have realized after Snakes on a Plane that just because you have a goofy, over the top premise with a silly title that catches the attention of the internet does not mean you have a successful movie on your hands.  Just like Snakes on a Plane, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter will be referenced in movie-related jokes for years to come, but that's about it.  It exists in pop culture as a title; not a movie.  If everyone who referenced, or joked about Snakes on a Plane had actually seen it the film would have been a megahit.  The same holds true for Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.<br /><br />People will undoubtedly say \\"But it's supposed to be funny!\\"  No.  The only thing you can call an intentional joke is \\"Abraham Lincoln fighting vampires.\\"  That's it!  You see it in the title, the trailer, you laugh at those, and then the joke wears off.  After you get past the trailer there is no legitimate joke in this movie.<br /><br />What had me laughing out loud during this movie was how serious it took itself and how cartoonish the action sequences became.  This movie does not play itself for laughs.  These action scenes are played straight (or at least as straight as Matrix inspired action scenes can be played), and then halfway through the movie they decide Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is an appropriate film to give a lecture on why slavery is bad.  At least Snakes on a Plane never made any attempts to lecture an audience on the matter of racism.<br /><br />One action sequence in particular I would like to highlight as arguably the most sloppily choreographed, outlandish action sequence of 2012:  A young Abraham Lincoln pursues a vampire and through a series of events gets caught in a horse stampede.  All the horses are computer generated (and 90% of the scene so are Abe and the vampire) and both the characters are jumping onto horses, getting dragged, knocked around, and at one point the vampire spins a horse like Super Mario before hurling it at Lincoln.  That sounds fun, right?  On paper it does, but on screen I had no idea what was going on!  Everything was CGI: the horses, the actors, and they had warped into the blue screen backgrounds of 300.  Then when it ends the characters randomly fall back into a real set.  This scene is just a mess on every technical level imaginable.<br /><br />I laughed at scenes like this because of how sloppily they were handled, and how incomprehensible the jumble of special effects on screen was.  Not because the actions depicted were goofy (and they certainly were).  I ended up laughing at the film; not with it.<br /><br />The movie should have ended with young Lincoln before he went into politics.  Just call it a day on \\"And that was the secret young days of Abraham Lincoln.\\"  But it doesn't.  No, instead the movie decides to insultingly dumb down American history while playing it completely straight.  Playing a joke straight is something that usually gets a laugh out of me, but when you simplify the Civil War \\"Vampires run the South and want slaves to help feed them\\" without ever winking at the camera I find myself frustrated rather than amused.<br /><br />When this movie tries tying actual history into its campy story it just feels wrong, and out of place.  Having Abraham Lincoln's youngest son be killed by a vampire just made me feel unclean.  If the movie was going to be a campy action story featuring Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter they should have gone all the way into the realm of camp, but instead they try making it tie into real life tragedies, and issues relating to slavery.  I don't know, you could easily enjoy this, but it just rubbed me the wrong way.  It needed to go all the way into the realm of camp or not bother making the film at all.<br /><br />I did watch it with friends and we had a blast riffing the film, and honestly, if you're just looking for a goofy film to watch with some friends Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter isn't too bad a pick.  I can't imagine you enjoying this movie much without some friends chuckling along and adding commentary.  Just know there are better, goofier movies out there that don't have any pretenses to attempt lecturing you on racism and history.ut it just rubbed me the wrong way.

B005FITIDC|4.0|The title is actually not reflective of the actual movie script, but from a larger perspective this is tale of what happens when good intentions are taken over by pride and ego.  This might have been a real story, but it is what rreally happens when ego takes over, and the character acting is not that bad.  If you haven't been to a third world country, this movie does give a fairly accurate account of the value of human life in third world countries.  This is worth your time to watch.
0425263908|5.0|The books is very good I cant wait for the next one to be released in June, I highly recommend these books
1439102813|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost a loved one to Alzheimer's or is still &#34;losing&#34; them.  It  helps to know we are not alone; brought back many memories but made me love my dad more than ever in realizing again the sacrifices he made and the love he showed our mother...so much so that he died before our mother.  Marriages like my parents' are hard to find these days.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. Reminds me of Mario alot. Except for the acorn shooting (AWESOME). I'm 14 years, and I still love the very old games back in the day, and whoever made this made memories flash back in mind. GET THIS GAME. IT INCLUDES UPDATES AND STUFF. YOU ARE AWESOME IF YOU GET THIS :D

B005C4ERHQ|5.0|Loved finding out the strengths I didn't know I had.  Its a great gift for anyone who is looking to expand or change careers.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Really enjoy this for relaxing.  Keep up the good work!  Like the city building feature.  Colorful and fascinating artwork in the scenes.
0670026603|5.0|Although I cried at the end of this book, I found it very enjoyable, both for the story and for some of the issues it presented.  How we define ourselves, what may have happened in our lives to determine that definition, and the ability to see beyond our definition are all addressed in this book, as well as the right to die issue.  Love in its many forms and permutations is also part of the charm of this novel.  All in all, worth the time to read and enjoy.
