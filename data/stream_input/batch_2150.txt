B009MCRHH6|5.0|Picked this one up when it was a free app of the day.<br /><br />I love this damned game!<br /><br />It is addicting and frustrating and amusing and frustrating and entertaining and frustrating.<br /><br />When you get  horribly stuck (and you almost certainly will be eventually), you'll be glad to see how someone else solved it and oh so kindly posted it to the internet.<br /><br />If you don't get stuck, shoot for the OCD rewards... Good luck with that.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I got this with some trepidation, since some people said these were too small for their kindle, but it's just perfect for my paperwhite.  I like to read mine without a cover, so this is perfect for protecting it during transport.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Not normally a big zombie fan but this is pretty damned good for a television version of the Zombie Apocalypse.  Sometimes the characters do stupidly annoying things (many of them counter-survival) but you still can't help but be sympathetic when they get killed off... Except maybe for Lori.<br /><br />We discovered the show during the season 3 mid-season break.  Watched the first 2 1/2 seasons before season 3 episode 9 aired and got spoiled.  Now we have to watch them as they come out and the cliffhangers are crazy-making!<br /><br />It is just about worth the 2 bucks in order to watch the episodes commercial-free.<br /><br />If you have to watch a television show, this one is well worth it... as long as your gore tolerance is fairly high.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I wish I knew this movie was about alcohol and drug abuse. I didn't understand the small clip concerning porn (why)and at the start of the movie a nude scene what was the purpose you've proved that this guy was a drunk and drug abuser throughout the entire movie. I would not share this movie with my family becuase of that. This movie was a waste of five bucks very disapointed. Too bad the directors added the trash it could have been a very good movie.
0062014102|5.0|Start with an open mind and see where this takes you. If you have ever asked how, why or just questioned the order in the universe this will give you some food for thought.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|I bought this as soon as it was announced and glad I did.<br /><br />I became a fan of RTF with their last live album Returns which I bought after hearing rave reviews of them but never hearing any of their music.<br /><br />Love the different line up and what it brings to the band.  On a 5 star scale, I give it 7!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Cool app and it was free so what is not to like about it.  I prefer Seasons and Space to this one, but it's still good.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was tightly written, well plotted, amd exciting. The author managed to weave several sub-plots into the story, all of which helped flesh out the chatacters. It also offers a great glimpse into Stalinist Russia. Highly recomended!
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|Worth a shot, but overall I got bored with playing it after a few levels. Some of the puzzle concepts get overused to the point where they are a chore to finish rather than a challenge.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|Forever was a beautifully written conclusion to the Wolves of Mercy Falls series.  This has become one of my favorite series now - there's something so poetic and charming about Stievater's storytelling.<br /><br />Like Shiver and Linger, Forever is very much a character-driven novel.  Although, since this is the last book in the trilogy, there is a small amount of action, towards the end at least.  But what I love best about Forever is the journey that the characters take.  I love Grace, she's a character that I've identified with throughout the entire series.  Sam is so sweet and tenderhearted and I've grown to love his character.  But I think Cole and Isabel might be my favorite characters.  They're both so vulnerable and strong at the same time, and I love reading about them.<br /><br />Out of the whole series, I thought Forever has the strongest plot.  Sure, it's not action-packed, but there's so much more at stake as the wolves fight to stay alive and find a new home.  And of course Maggie Stiefvater's writing is as good as ever.  She's so talented at making the story flow smoothly, and her writing shines through in Forever.  The characters' emotions are real and vivid.  The descriptions are full of just enough imagery and detail.  And the ending, while leaving some things open, still wraps up the story perfectly.<br /><br />As I wasn't totally crazy about Shiver, I didn't expect to fall in love with this series, but it's definitely a favorite now.  I can't wait to read more books by this talented author!

1594744769|3.0|I'm going to take the unpopular route on this one.  It started off with a bang and I was deeply absorbed, and then about a third of the way in the book just sort of fizzled out for me.<br /><br />Jacob has been haunted by nightmares and other strange instances since the death of his grandfather, who was quite strange himself.  One could even say, peculiar.  On the advice of his shrink, he and his father go off to an island in Europe where his grandfather stayed in an orphanage growing up until the war came to that area.  There he hopes to find the mysterious Miss Peregrine, the headmistress of the orphanage who might still be alive all this time later.  But what he finds is much more, a time loop, where peculiar children still dwell.<br /><br />Jacob is about the only character I can really relate to in this entire book.  He's your average teenager, dealing with grief and a little more.  And it's easy why he would want to make a journey to see what happened in his grandfather's past.  Although I do think he accepts what he discovers a little too easily.  Miss Peregrine actually struck me as the bad guy in this one, even though she isn't supposed to be.  Just her way of running the school doesn't sit with me well.  There's a lack of freedom.  And the kids, well they are all peculiar but none of them have standout personalities.  They're kind of flat with minimal description aside from their strangeness.<br /><br />The plot did not go how I wanted to.  Sure it sets itself up for a decent series that intrigued me enough to read it.  But with the creepy photos in the book (the best part of the book, absolutely marvelous) and the headmistress keeping kids safe in a time loop for all time,  I expected it to be a scary narration that it actually wasn't.  Something eerie and haunting that gives you dreams at night like the picture on the cover does.  Instead it was more of a fantasy with some adventure thrown in at the end.  But the cover promised creepy, and I sorely was disappointed at the lack of it.  The pace moved rather fast too and while I'm impressed the author was able to make a story out of random found pictures, I'm just not sure I like how he carried it out in the second half of the book.<br /><br />I'll still be reading the rest of the books.  It was enough to intrigue me but I think so many other things could have been done with this book and the wonderful pictures it contains.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children<br />Copyright 2011<br />351 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B00B2YH7BS|5.0|This movie made me so happy my eyes welled up! The love everyone felt for this hole in the wall is abundantly clear. If you can, see it in the theater, otherwise make sure you have a premium home sound system that you can crank up loud. I plan on purchasing the Bluray and Cd as soon as they are released.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing how many Oscars this wins next year!
B002BBJ52U|5.0|Good to have Many different stories in one movie.  It shows different types of relationships and their specific issues. Loved It!
1933952806|4.0|Anyone looking to find out more than the basics on their Nikon D7000 will love this book.  It's laid out well and very easy to follow.  Things are explained very clear and in detail.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone who has a D7000.

B00296A4F4|5.0|I had heard a lot of comments about Glee, but never watched it.  I watched all of season I and found it quite entertaining.  I liked the music and how sometimes the singing would morph into a &#34;music video&#34;. The casting is good.

B00B3EVNEE|5.0|I have to say it's nice to have Trower back to his power blues self.  Not that I didn't enjoy \\"Seven Moons\\" or \\"What Lies Beneath\\" but Trower is at his best for me when he's able to stick to the straight blues.  I believe this is where he's most comfortable.  I love all these classic tunes and to hear Robin's modern take on them is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />This albums production reminds me of a couple of my favorite blues albums of the last few years, as the sound is crisp, clean, but yet maintains that \\"tube\\" like quality that accents blues music so well.  I can tell that a ton of effort went into making this album sound the way it does.  Simple, articulated, warm and dang right old Stratocaster love.<br /><br />As I stated above, I'm also glad that the POWER BLUES is back.  This type of power blues really runs the gamut for me.  As at its best the heavy drums and thick guitar makes me pount the table with a rock hard fist...but at it's worst (SRV wannabees) I just shake my head.  Fortunately Trower has always had his own sound, and he kills it here.  A couple of my faves:<br /><br />\\"When I heard your name,\\" Killer.  Love the call and response type singing and guitar riffs along with the slight vocal accompaniment.  It's also one of the more upbeat songs on the album and the rhythm section brings it deep and heavy.<br /><br />\\"That's Alright Mama,\\"  A blues shuffle with smokey harmonica and great smooth singing.  His guitar solo is great in this one as he kisses the strings with his pick and really gits it on this one.<br /><br />\\"Little Red Rooster,\\"  A sermon with Trower bringing the guitar and vocals to your face in this classic.  The hammer down style really fits and I'm glad he chose to a version of this here.  Six minutes of joy.<br /><br />If you're into what Cyril Lance did a few years back, Greg Allman's Low Country Blues, or any of James Mathus' recent blues albums then you'll dig this.  A killer modern blues classic with Trower bringin' it hard and good!and good!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I enjoyed the personality and the humor in the character of &#34;Mark.&#34; The daily effort of surviving is huge and the knowledge of how to do it was interesting. It was just a bit over-technical for me but the story still keeps my interest and has the reader cheering for him. The constant use of effing was not needed. The ending was especially distasteful where he uses the word in answer to an innocent child's question. Still, for the price, it was a good book.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|I've always loved Nick Cave's style that sits between a Frank Zappa musical mayhem and Tom Waits melancholy musicality.  He's his own entity though and any new Nick Cave music is good music in my book, although I'll admit I've always liked his softer, sweeter side like \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow\\" or \\"Do you Love me.\\"  \\"Henry Lee\\" is another example of the type of Nick Cave you're getting here, yeah that guy.  So I was pretty stoked to hear that this album would be more along those lines.<br /><br />This album for me is impeccably produced.  When listening through headphones or on a good sound system you'll quickly notice how specific the imaging and reverb is.  The instrumentation sits between slightly electronic and organic plugged in instruments.  The quality of the recording is truly natural though, with a haunting sparse quality about the whole album that I just love.  Super cohesive stuff here.<br /><br />My favorites are when Nick Cave is slower, melodic and soft:<br /><br />\\"We No Who `U `R,\\" Great pace, Nick sings this one with backing vocalists and the song sets the pace and tone for the whole album.  One of my favorite tracks that he's done through the years and it's all topped out by a sexy flute solo at the end.<br /><br />\\"Wide Lovely Eyes,\\" Second song on the album.  When listening to the album the first time I thought if he continued with these types of songs that this would be my favorite album of his.  But the rest is more varied for me.  The melodies and background singing in counterpoint and harmony didn't continue all the way through.  Non-the-less, wide lovely eyes is beautiful, layered, and a hauntingly beautiful track.  It's a sad song about lost connection, great lyrics here.<br /><br />\\"Push the Sky Away,\\" Very cinematic, which is something I don't always think with Cave.  Slower paced and yes, haunting again.  The synth, bass and Drums dominate here, and they really let Nick's poetic nature hold strong throughout.  Background vocals hit the spot.<br /><br />Overall a solid great effort.  If this is where Cave is headed then I'm a happy dude.  This is some of his most organic, simple, yet layered work yet.  Buy this album, get that record player spinning, and meditate to the awesomeness that is Mr. Nick Cave.spot.<br /><br />Overall a solid great effort.

1603420398|4.0|This is a nice little book that with some imagination will help you to add variety to your crochet.  There are no projects but the crochet motifs that are shown will substitute well into any project you use grannie squares or circles for including but not limited to afghans and scarves.  Some of them would be nice in slippers or clothing as well.  I liked the little triangle shaped ones though there is less variety in that category.  Its a fun book and should inspire you.

B002GJT4XM|3.0|Everything in the DVD set is amazing, except one small, kinda not so small detail. It says it comes with a Digital Copy, which it does, BUT IT IS EXPIRED!!!! It was only valid through December 8, 2010 which was over 2 years ago now. Also the disc set is actually the Philosopher's Stone and not the Sorcerer's Stone, Just a heads up. Doesn't make a real difference except I know it is the UK version...which is kinda awesome.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|I purchased this exclusively for my iPod nano 6th generation (the square one). It works great and I am finally wires free, but it drains my battery in an hour. The battery drain has been an issue across the board, I knew that when I bought it and expected it, if you purchase one for your iPod nano expect it to last between 1-2 hrs. As for the other problems reviewers have stated I have not experienced them. I am happy with the range I wear my ipod on my wrist and have not had any sound quality issues. I also can leave it on my desk and walk anywhere in my 30x30 room without any issues. If you are looking for a way to break free from wires in a small and I mean small device this is your product. The battery drain only seems to be an issue on the iPod nano, I tried it on an iPod classic and it lasted 4 and a half hours.

B001NT0V92|5.0|The 2008 CDs remixed by Justin Hayward are the definitive collection.  I've owned five versions of On the Threshold of a Dream starting with 8-tracks.  What bugs me about so many reissues of old material is the attempt to gloss up the mix with studio wizardry.  Threshold is dark and mysterious and that feel is captured very well with the 2008 releases.  Over compressed?... I don't think so rather enough to flesh out the level to maximum headroom.  In comparison the SACDs peak at about -6dB and have more slightly more high frequencies but the extra top is not necessarily a good thing making the SACD sound slightly thin in comparison.  The 2008 CDs are wonderful and amazing how well 16-bit, 44kHz digital can sound when done with forethought.  Bravo Justin Hayward!
B009MO5G90|1.0|Concept was great, execution was dismal.  I kept hoping they would get better.  This one was especially horrible.  It seemed so forced and the acting was horrible.  There was only one fight scene which I would qualify as good.  They rest were basically everyone standing in the open shooting automatic weapons at each other and missing.  I would not even recommend renting this if there was nothing else to do.  Playing tic-tac-toe would be a better use of your time.

B004CV3SKC|4.0|I definitely fangirled when I opened this. They don't tell you in the description, but this is pressed in hot-pink colored vinyl. The hole for the spindle was a little tight and had some leftover vinyl debris in it, but it fit just fine on my turntable.<br /><br />Some tracks are clipped, but it could be my low-end turntable and preamp. Other tracks sound amazing. It's not censored, so you get the full parental-guidance-recommended experience of Nicki.
0857680986|5.0|great book. highly would recommend for anyone interested in art. just what i needed for my class. condition great too!
B0085I0UHW|4.0|This vinyl album came in the mail today. I ordered on a Sunday evening, and it showed up in the early afternoon on Monday (which was also a national holiday). I was instantly thrilled. However, there are some things I was disappointed by.<br /><br />Some tracks are mastered in EXCELLENT quality. Deep bass, crisp highs, perfect mids. Other tracks, on the other hand, are extremely poor quality. Clipped highs, muddy mids and lows, and just not impressive. It's like the sound tech that mastered this record downloaded half the songs from YouTube.<br /><br />The other thing I was disappointed by was the mixed censorship. As anyone familiar with the works of Ms. Minaj knows, Nicki has a potty-mouth. It's great! But on this record, you'll find that she belts out the C-word on side-B, but the B-word is &#34;bleeped&#34; on side-D.<br /><br />Overall, a great buy and a great conversation piece.

B00129XQ2W|5.0|Although the mono sound is a bit annoying in this day and age, having this recording from the live feed is quite interesting.  The EMI 'live' version is good too; this is just a tad better.
B00004RFFS|4.0|This film has been out for quite a while and I really had no interest in seeing it - not being very much of a Cruise/Pitt fan, However, after seeing parts of it (editted and censored) on several cable channels I decided to buy it and check out the whole thing. The bits of dark humor injected in by Cruise made it rather enjoyable at times. Brad Pitt did a good job as the vampire with a bit of his human-ness causing him to lament (whine about) his fate throughout. His acting is stellar in the final sequences.Kirsten Dunst's character, 10-year old Claudia, as an unreachable love/soul mate for Louis (Pitt) was the essential ingredient that makes it all work. She did a great job. Its worth watching - and pretty cheap besides. Forget about ancient Dracula and juvenile Twilight - Check this one out!

When they finish the lead singers from all over the world come in and sing together in their respective languages.  It is incredably moving.

0743537009|3.0|I don't want to come off as being a King know-it-all because there are lots of other fans that eat and breath King, but I have read a fair number of his books and this is one case where the movie was much better. If you are not familiar with the story, here is a brief description.<br /><br />Jack Torrance has a drinking problem and although he has given up the drink, he still struggles daily with being dry. He is married to Wendy and they have a six-year-old son, Danny. Danny is a special boy. He possesses the ability to see into the future but when his father accepts a position as a caretaker of an isolated Colorado hotel in the dead of winter, Danny's visions become more sinister in nature and the idea of them living there all winter and all by themselves is almost too much for Danny and Wendy to imagine. However, Jack is working on a play, and the quiet isolation is what he needs to finish it, so they pack up and head out. What they don't know, is that something terrible happened there years ago. Something that will come back to haunt them.<br /><br />Scared yet?<br /><br />The premise itself is scary as hell. Taking care of a gigantic hotel in the middle of winter without anyone around you is a bit intimidating. The audio version of the book doesn't play up this aspect too well. The narration is good but the content itself is not all that dramatic and there are long periods of nothing in between the somethings. That's hard enough in print but on audio, I found myself having to go back because I cruised through several chapters without really knowing what was going on. This was a bit frustrating. I listened to it as part of the #shineon read-along and it seemed as if I was always behind the others since I had to go back and forth so much.<br /><br />For the audio book version to have worked for me, I would have needed the following:<br /><br /> *A creepier Danny.<br /> *A meaner, nastier Jack Torrance.<br /> *A Wendy with a bit more oomph. She reminded me of white bread. Boring.<br /> *More isolation. There were too many visits to the store and too many phone calls.<br /> *Less hedge action, which is different than the hedge action seen in the movie.<br /> *More of the freakin' hotel! It lives and breathes in the movie.<br /> *More cold. More music to set the tone.<br /><br />I thought at first that my love of the movie, tainted my opinion of the book but I don't think so. Others that have not seen the movie have said the same thing. It's a snoozefest. That said, I now appreciate the movie version even more and can't wait to see it again.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep, King's sequel to The Shining comes out this September 20th. Will I read it? You bet.e bread. Boring.<br /> *More isolation. There were too many visits to the store and too many phone calls.<br /> *Less hedge action, which is different than the hedge action seen in the movie.<br /> *More of the freakin' hotel!

B0067R0APK|5.0|I bought the upgrade and like it very well. I used to have another competing program that was free. this one is very similar and easy to use.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|This is a book of stories about people and how / why they developed their habits. It's not a step by step guide to helping you overcome your own pesky habits, though there is a brief explanation by the author on how he overcame a mid afternoon cookie habit.  If you're looking for more of a self help manual, this may not be for you, though his cookie rehab may be enough to help you overcome your own issues.
0792839749|5.0|I totally loved chitty chitty bang bang growing up. I was so thrilled that it came in a timely fashion for the holidays and it is definetly an upgrade from the VHS.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I don't know what I expected from this show, but I got much more than I bargained for.  Stuff like this has never been done before, and it is positively spell-binding!  This is by far my favorite season.  The amber episode was so unbelievably fascinating that I find myself going back to play Season One over and over again!  In one word - awesome!
B0000696I1|5.0|My daughter loves ninja turtles and she loves this dvd as well. The shipment was speedy and I had no issues with the seller or the quality of the dvd.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I am not a big science fiction fan, but this show is more like science and fiction.  The character studies of the main characters was done so beautifully, and the strange story line was unlike anything I have ever seen.  This show will appeal to people with great imaginations.  My mind went where it had never gone before - and it was a great journey!
B008S8PPPG|5.0|A friend recently told me about Jessie Ware and I'm glad he did!  I really love her style!  The CD is great and can definitely be listened to from beginning to end.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Interesting with a surprise ending.  Well worth seeing for this 20 plus year air traffic controller.  It show how stress can tear up your life.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Excellent conclusion to the best trilogy since Star Wars. Amazon Prime has some issues with Dolby Digital 5.1 not withstanding but that doesn't affect my rating of the movie itself.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good follow-up to first book. Flows well. Characters continue to be believable. Good read. I am looking forward to the 3rd book in the series.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I loved it and can't wait to start the others!  I enjoyed it all the way through. It had a fast easy reading plot ( hope that makes sense) Exactly the type of story I like...... I couldn't put it down
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Plainly written, even the technicals.  Funny.  Intense at times.  Hilarious.  Feel good ending.  Hell, feel good all the time.  Watney is a character of epic proportion and an ingenious comedian throughout.  Rib tickling, even the life-threatening explosions.  Watney, the king of Mars, space pirate, and laugh-til-you-cry hero.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was a page turner. The images and ideas in the book are just different enough from the average sci-fi story to help keep it feeling fresh and interesting!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  the only thing wrong with it is that I cant get past level 10 on 8x8 hahahahahaha!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is sultry, funny and sexy!  When I finish this book, I will make time to read the other books in this series.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|It's a bit like \\"Little Alchemy\\" but it has more interesting combinations. Many more main elements and better game play.
1442339527|5.0|This book is one of the best self help book I have ever bought. I wish there were more people that would read this.
B004GYY714|5.0|I bought the kindle fire hd 8.9 from amazon and it has Bluetooth  and I downloaded this free app and it sounds great thru my Bluetooth sterio it's like having satellite radio 😄😃😄😃😄⭐⭐⭐
B0072NWJRK|3.0|Not sure why but I couldn't get into it. I would read two pages and then find myself on Facebook :/
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|The game has entertained my two boys on long journeys. They have had fun at the battles and the building things. It a good game for my two as they work together on problems.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|This was a good book, but the ending made me upset. That's all I'll say. Not a five star book with an ending like that.
6302610702|4.0|I purchased these over 10 years ago when having a VHS was not yet too nostalgic . . . but i still love them today.<br /><br />I like videos.  They are durable, they don't scratch or get finger prints on them.<br /><br />For something timeless like the Godfather trilogy, I think a VHS set makes sense if you still have a VHS cassette player.  You can leave them out to get dusty, throw them around your basement (or find that your toddler has) and they will still play a 100 more times.<br /><br />When you're in the mood to hole-up in the basement for a full day and watch a mafia classic -- these are your ticket (VHS or DVD, I just like VHS for the nostalgia sometimes.)
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett faced a huge challenge continuing his 20th Century Trilogy, and he did quite well. In both books, he really brought to life the histories that too many Americans have no prior exposure to. Follett continues with a superb view of politics in Great Britain that he did so well in Book 1. In this volume, he uses fiction to show the horrors of living under the Nazi regime both before and during World War II, and the struggles of the allies to survive and prevail. As in all his books, he shows how world events are influenced by ordinary people coping with the challenges of staying alive.<br /><br />I miss the World War I generation, however. The characters were so well developed, their dilemnas and relationships so suspenseful, that I was reluctant to see their stories fall away as their sons and daughters took center stage. I admit that the stories of the second generation kept me turning pages until too late at night; I just wish Follett had chosen to make this a ten-volume series instead of a trilogy. The jump to 1933 denied us more continuity that staying in th 1920's could have afforded, both historically and with the characters we had grown so attached to.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I always watch this movie when it comes on t.v., so I decided to buy it for myself to watch whenever I want. It is one of my favorite movies.  Love Jan Austin stories.
B0079Q68LI|5.0|Loved this book. Lots of twists and turns, and just when you think you solved the &#34;whodoneit&#34;; another twist! Enjoy.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|As a rule, I don't care much for British aristocrat movies/shows, especially period pieces. However, this show has been wonderfully written and casted. Excellent drama with tons of plot twists, some expected, many not.
142092561X|5.0|This book is a good read. Keeps you on your &#34;p's & q's&#34; and in suspense. Just when you thought you solved the mystery; think again!
B003MC5N28|3.0|\\"The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.\\"<br /><br />The author gives a view into a differnt world and how a young boy feels once he knows the truth.<br /><br />There are some interesting ideas presented in this book. I found many to be thought provoking and I had to imagine what it would be like if my world were to be so,radically different.<br /><br />The young boy is very likeable. His bravery is inspirational. But I wasn't interested enough to continue the series.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Below are the Pros and Cons of this cooler.I didn't tested with other cooler's.I am comparing with my stock cooler which came with FX 8350.<br />The site says it fits AM3+, but the box didn't say it. It works with AM3+.You need a mid or full tower since it is really big.<br /><br />Pros :<br />1. Quiet, I don't hear a thing unless the fan speed is more than 50% which is 1000 RPM. After that you hear the noise which is bearable considering the stock cooler.<br />2. Keep my AMD FX 8350 under 12 whereas the stock cooler shoots up to 25-27 for the same list of programs<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Installation is very difficult and it is a tow mans job.<br />2. The thermal compound which came with this is very less and you cant spread it to the whole area of the processor.
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|We absolutely LOVE this movie!  Loved this movie when it first came out, and loved to share it with our daughters too! Great music in this film as well!
B004GYY714|4.0|Missing some KC cumulus broadcasting stations in KC other than that 5 stars. I can listen to all my Kansas City FM favorites
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopler writes interesting lyrics. He composes music that is soothing sometimes and energetic others. Well rounded CD. I will definely buy other Mark Knopler music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me wanting more. Even before I got through the third chapter I was thankful that there were two more books to read. It grabbed me, it held me and it kept me till the end.<br /><br />Thank you Suzanne Collins
0670827592|5.0|i only read this book once and found it to be a very cute story. the price was good and the shipping was quick thank you very much
B008XK69S6|5.0|This player is filled with options that aren't even available on the amazon player. In top of that its simple.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Got this for a great price, but the person I bought it for already had this DVD.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Characters in the novel which previously did not make an impression on me or grab my attention are now some of the most interesting and exciting people in the book. At the end of each character chapter I found myself wanting to continue reading about this particular person.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|You already know the movie...it made a wonderful gift for Christmas and the price was unbeatable! Thank you very much!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|LOVE DIS GAME IT IS FUN DA da ich mich auch schon wieder ein wenig fjdj<br />Sorry needed more words.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|1st, it was suppose to be free, yet we we were charged $5.99 for it. 2nd, only 23 min downloaded, leaving 2 hours of the movie unwatchable. What a rip off of a new PRIME customer!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Puts the whole series to a perfect rest. Would recommend this to anyone! I can't wait to see how they put it in the movie
B002YCVX5S|5.0|my second favorite movie of all time. so clever. witty. yet dark, and emotional. PERFECTION. Plus, all the male actors are so very handsome.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|started out enjoying it thewn it reminded me off all the b horror movies i saw as a kid. lots of bizarre twists watched the last season just to see what was gonna happen next. my wife enjoyed it though.
B000HL09MG|5.0|I love the quasi-religious ceremony scene in this movie. Soo creepy, and secretive. This whole movie had a really secretive feel to it..like a mystery. Left many questions unanswered.
B008AYA7WE|4.0|I have always liked this game and I'll never tried of it as long as they have on it in the apps.
0517543052|5.0|Gave this book away as a gift, so i never really got to far into it. What i did read however was excellent. I love books with a message and this book had a message pure and clear as day.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I borrowed Season 1 from a friend and got hooked so I purchased Season 2.  I am now watching Season 3 on PBS.  This is an excellent series.
0307950654|5.0|If you love Pride and Prejudice and you love mysteries, this is a great combination! Well thought out and well written.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is great,it helps me develope great hand eye coordination.keeps me out of the refridgerator, gives me something to do  besides eat.
B008QOH1NG|5.0|Stryper puts on a great show on all their DVD's and this one is great also. The band sounds better today than in their early days.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book may start slow and be a bit depressing, but the end makes up for it. It is so touching, I couldn't put it down.
0739352989|5.0|it was a great gift  just what was wanted  quality is great along with a very good speaking voice  will buy more
B000YHG72E|5.0|Our family loved this silly movie.  Will Ferrell delivers a great performance kids will laugh out loud at.  This was a great tension buster for the crazy holiday times.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|4 books,endless plots, endless \\"wars\\", ENDLESS CHARACTERS, plot development ZERO. I have lost track of whatever type of tale being told, get over yourself and finish some storyline ANY of the storylines you started, already.  The TV series is so much better because it fixes all of  the gaping problems with this storyline. DISAPPOINTED!<br /><br />sheila
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The premise was interesting and the acting good.  I don't like any violence and was told this didn't have any.  That is not correct; it has plenty.  Skip it if death and dying aren't your thing.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|He always goes one step further- not only Harry Bosch but Michael Connelly to make a great page-turner for justice. More please!
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Before this book was suggested to me at random by an acquaintance, I had had a vision of pyramids and an old man that was larger than life.  What a great omen this book was that opened my eyes wide to the possibility of life providing exactly what you need when you listen to your heart.  I can only say thank you.
B007QUUJMG|4.0|about many teenage issues, perspectives, troubles and what appears on the surface may just not be so...<br />The mention of many favourite wordsmiths wets the appetite to find those books once again and read on...
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Can't confirm making this work with my audio recorder or my computer. Plugging it in does cut off the built in mics, but no recording is possible with the unit itself, tried with the battery it shipped with and a known good one.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is exactly what I expected... Thanx for making this available. it is greatly appreciated. I realty like that is very easy to see.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|The author clearly did her homework.  It was so convincing and  real that I had the feeling that it was non-fiction at times.  A very worthy title to encourage readers to understand the devastation resulting from early onset Alzheimer's disease. The emotions of the woman as she experiences memory loss includes disbelief and fear which was gripping for this reader.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderfully descriptive and entertaining. From District 12 to the Capitol to the Arena, I can see everything so clearly. Nice plot twist in the end as well.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really loved the twist at end that ties the whole thing together. I can't wait for more June can' t come soon enough.
0399160450|5.0|After you read this book you will find today's current events unnerving. The book reads well and holds attention all the way through.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever!in this game u can train a horse just like its your own. I know that u will like this game.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I've read almost all of his books and really appreciate the suspense and reality of the characters. His irreverence is delicious and is one of the things that makes his stories unique!
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I always start with my own issues before deciding how to rate an album - for example, I wasn't really looking forward to (or expecting) another Aerosmith album after JUST PUSH PLAY (which I loved, incidentally).  I figured that was the swan song and they'd just release a new song on each Greatest Hits album that they released - which is one every three months these days.  And honestly, I'd kinda prefer it if they had.  But no, here's a new album of material.  Okay.<br /><br />So I heard the first single LEGENDARY CHILD.  That's when I decided Aerosmith was dead.  The chorus was was almost exactly like Get A Grip and the main guitar riff was ripped off from Led Zeppelin's Wanton Song.  Hated it.<br /><br />BUT I'd heard that they finally used the riff from an old PUMP song called Guilty Kilt and turned it into a song called Out Go The Lights, so I listened to the album.  I loved Out Go The Lights EXCEPT that they use the Legendary Child riff as a bridge.  WHY DO ARTISTS USE THE SAME RIFF IN MULTIPLE SONGS!??  Not only that, but in songs that are BACK TO BACK ON THE ALBUM.  Ok, perhaps this only annoys me, but boy it didn't help change my \\"Aerosmith is dead\\" theory.<br /><br />To be fair, some of these tracks are really good.  Street Jesus, Lover Alot, Oh Yeah (a modern Beatles track), and Love XXX are all really good.  As ballads go, I liked Closer, but it also sounded like every other Aerosmith ballad, um, ever.  The other ballads left me cold.<br /><br />And let's be clear: Steven Tyler should be the only member of Aerosmith to sing lead.  Ever.  Freedom Fighter is a great riff ruined by weak vocals.  I feel exactly the same way (more so) with Something.  Had these been sung by Tyler, I'd be a fan.  The \\"bonus\\" tracks are sad excuses of what would have been on solo albums by Whitford and Hamilton if anyone had been stupid enough to produce solo albums by either of them - which is why they have to append some weak songs that don't fit onto an Aerosmith album.  But hey, these guys are multi-bajillionaires so they can pretty much do whatever they want now.<br /><br />Fortunately, Shakey Ground is such a classic that screwing it up would have been difficult, but the guys did an appropriately funky and modern version of a classic.<br /><br />So yeah, that's two songs that I REALLY liked, four that were fine and ten that either left me cold or I outright hate (not including the worthless bonus tracks).<br /><br />Aerosmith may not be dead, but they're zombies with only occasional bursts of energy.ey, these guys are multi-bajillionaires so they can pretty much do whatever they want now.<br /><br />Fortunately, Shakey Ground is such a classic that screwing it up would have been difficult, but the guys did an appropriately funky and modern version of a classic.<br /><br />So yeah, that's two songs that I REALLY liked, four that were fine and ten that either left me cold or I outright hate (not including the worthless bonus tracks).<br /><br />Aerosmith may not be dead, but they're zombies with only occasional bursts of energy.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This was a super funny movie.  Really enjoyed the extras.  It is rated (unrated) for a reason.  It is a very raunchy show.
B000001ES4|5.0|Can't beat these artists when it comes to soothing, without being effereal &#34;spacey&#34;.  They have made an album that is worth buying.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Not so impressed with this book.  It was warped and twisted on both the main characters' parts.  Both were liars and manipulators.  I can't see why it has been so popular.  We read it for our book club, but I was really disappointed with it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun and entertaining I love to play this game!!!!! its makes me want a real horse. but since I cant get one I play this
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|So glad this child....woman survived this horrible experience.  I liked reading her story from her own heart.  I just wonder how she will be in a few years.  This sort of an experience can certainly stick with you, I'm sure.  She is a strong woman.  I wish her well.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This movie was so good that I felt the need to write a review about it!.  I was not expecting much given the lame Judge Dredd movie that came out in the late 90's (sorry, Sly).  This version is more like the source material, has a story that makes sense, good actors, and some of the best action that I have seen in quite a while.  I rented this movie on Amazon instant video and I watched the movie three times in 24 hours!  Yes, it was that good.  If you like action movies that are well done, with a good script, and well acted then rent or buy this movie, you will not be disappointed.  I plan on buying this movie on Blu-ray for my collection.  Well done!!!
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Austin Danger Powers is here to save the world from the diabolical Dr. Evil. This BluRay collection is fantastic. The picture is crystal clear and the sound is amazing. The cast is full of famous actors and Mike Myers does his best characters in these films. If you love Austin Powers or Mike Myers this is a must own collection.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Just short timing though but we will see. Like the colorful graphics and speed.  Might be changing this at a later date. No lag as of yet
B004VS4KLW|5.0|Thank you! This is a great movie! I'm glad to have it... Robert de Niro and Jean Reno are awesome!!!!!
0385344333|5.0|I have read 10 of the Jack Reacher Novels and this ranks up with the best of them.  Very interesting.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|We purchased Crossroads to replace our VHS version. The film quality is very good. Especially noteworthy is the soundtrack. The acting is not the highlight of this movie, but makes it an &#34;easy read.&#34;  However, the storyline and soundtrack are excellent, for Blues fans.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book. I would recommend this book because it is very well written and very enjoyable. Red it today :)
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.It is different from most books,but a very good read.The ending is suspenseful.I highly recommend this book.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|very cool app only one problem I cant see my level or level up so I don't know what's up with that but otherwise a great app
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is really cool and fun ant the running settings and background is cool but when trying to turn on the broken road is much more difficult

I stayed up all night on a Friday nigh reading it.  The book had such a profound impact that when I woke up I was a changed man.  I did away with my 50 ounces of skim milk a day, took myself off my statin, drastically increased my saturated fat, lowered my carbs to well under 100/day on average etc.  The bottom line is that I rarely have intense hunger.  My cholesterol ratios have dramatically improved after going off the statin, and I've found it very easy to keep my lost weight off.  Thank You Gary Taubes
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the way it lets you send invites to friends but since there is so many people playing all the user names already in use. Every thing is amazing so far.

B0098460O4|5.0|JOnathan's voice is powerful, yet soothing to listen to.  Charlotte's voice compliments Jonathan's voice. Well done, for their first cut.  I would recommend this.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I just finished this book, the second in the series and I am taking a break to read something lighter before I go on to the third.  I have not seen the HBO series and some friends have told me to watch them before I continue.  Although Book 1 and 2 are very well written sometimes the details seem to get in the way of the story.  I discussed this with others that have read the books and they agree.  Some have even given up.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This is a &#34;must have&#34; DVD.&#34; The sound quality is excellent, and, of course, Diana Krall has it all! My friend asked for this for Christmas after hearing it in my home. This is one of my most played DVDs.
1476712042|5.0|The story pulled me in and I couldn't put it down, I finished reading it in one sitting.  Eagerly waiting for the next book Walking Disaster :)
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This was money well spent. It was hours of pure sensational entertainment with great actors and opulent scenery, and so real. Great for enjoying &#34;movie night&#34; with your significant other. I will watch this over and over again for years to come. Well worth the money!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have it on my iphone and love it, so I decided to put it on my kindle fire.  Fun and easy.
1401937268|5.0|I'm still learning how to read cards.  This is the third deck I've bought for myself and I absolutely love these cards!  Just did my reading with them.  Sure enough, the same cards I've been getting from my other decks, turned up in this spread. Because I'm still learning, I love the fact that the messages are written on the card as well as further detailed in the book that comes with it.  Doreen Virtue is quickly becoming my new BFF, even if she doesn't know it ;)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved every minute of this book and couldn't wait to start on the next book. I literally had to make myself put the book down to get other things done. I read the whole trilogy in less than 3 weeks, which is fast for me being a stay at home mom of twins.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|It was an ok game but seemed a bit simplistic and just was not fun to me. Others might like it but I wouldn't recommend this one.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Quick and Easy Read! Couldn't put it down! I started the series 2 weeks ago and am already on the third book Beautiful Chaos!
B00902UH5M|5.0|A great read with positive ideas and motivating stories. It is a testament toward the successful drive of humanity. Two thumbs up!
B00BESLT6G|4.0|This movie start of very quickly and is freaky and exciting for almost the whole movie. Your sitting there wait for the next scary part reminds me alot of the video game
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|it is so worth more than 5 stars !!!! i have read this book twice & the second time I still got chills on the good parts. I love love love this book. I am on pins and neddles waiting for the second book to come out this April. Travis & Abby's story will continue I hope with all the others. Did I tell you that I love this book, becasue I really Really love this book !!!!!
B008TMA1LY|2.0|Cute game but to really get anywhere, you have to purchase credit to be able to build your cafe. I don't like having a game that consistently requires more money.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Didn't know what we were getting into, and I was a little surprised that these magically gifted, good looking kids are nothing but aliens from another planet. (Not a spoiler, you find that out very early.). So, then, it's nothing but ugly looking bad guys from another planet chasing down the gifted young ones from another planet.  A bit of a yawn for these adults. Pre-teens will like it much better. According to my son, the movie falls way short of the book. He said it lacked the tension.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is a great time killer for a variety of ages.  My 3 year old likes trying to do it even though she isn't very successful.  I love love love that you can sync it between devices. Awesome game!
B000VK99Z6|3.0|Not bad for a rental. 12 year old boys would probably enjoy it more than a 50 year old mom. A little slow and be prepared to embrace the British humor.
B0095P3ULC|1.0|continuity was not there, story line was unknown. so unrealistic, non continuous, special effect show that even that was no  good.
B009ZE27US|5.0|I love playing with my grandkids with this.  This is for entertainment purposes only...meaning you are not really scanning your finger

1892005034|5.0|Nonviolent Communication is a practice of life that can transform our world. Rosenberg presents Nonviolent Communication in a way that is easy to understand. One can already begin practicing Nonviolent Communication while reading the book. This sort of communication, based on true empathy, and caring for others and ourselves, is critical for the earth's human community at this time, as we strive to form a global, connected humanity. If we don't learn this way of communication, we are in big trouble.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app! It's totally amazing and much better than the original Temple Run. They even fixed the problem with the glitching! YAY!!! The graphics are very cool and unique. YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS!!!
B007EW9ISM|2.0|I had read and heard great things about the cosmonaut, and while I had a stylus that fit my needs, the [[ASIN:B000QYD5MU BoxWave EverTouch Capacitive stylus]], part of that fibermesh has begun to wear off, because I use my stylus every day for note taking on my iPad mini with GoodNotes. I wanted to see if the more robust, marker style of the cosmonaut would be better. Alas, I received it and was sorely disappointed. It requires much more effort to write, and therefore slows the writing process down. It also is very heavy, and while it feels good in the hand, the aluminum point inside the rubber tip seems very strong, to the point of if you put enough pressure (which is needed to write) on the glass, it feels like it could shatter. The rubber that coats the grip also seems to rub off onto my finger tips, and I have black smudges on my fingers.<br /><br /> I suppose this are my personal preferences, as nothing seems wrong about the stylus, but I was very disappointed that I did not end up liking it more. It had so many great reviews, but it just isn't for me. Sending it back to amazon and taking the shipping deduction from my refund, bummer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!! ITS SO COOL AND AMAZING WITH ITS CHALLENGES, MISSIONS, NEW UPDATES, CHARACTERS, BOARDS, AND EVEN MORE!!
B000UPGQQW|5.0|I got this for my mom because she was talking about how great of a movie it is. Definitely an 80's movie and a little cheesy but she loves it so its okay by me lol :)
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Love these games they keep you interested and makes you want to know what's going to happen next, you get the free version play it and when you come to the end of that version you want to buy it because you want to find what's next!!
B00008YLV2|5.0|I got this for my dad because he likes war movies and all that. He recently got the book and decided the movie would go nicely with it, so I got him this. He seemed very happy with it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just as much fun as the original, with more locations and powerups! The graphics are stunning and the game (usually) runs smooth. My one complaint is that there isn't a &quot;help&quot; or &quot;to play&quot; section for explanations on the new stuff.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|In a world where all kinds of great fantasy books have been written, Mr. Sanderson opens up a completely different and unique fantasy.  Loved this book can't wait for more!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is an excellent ap can check at anytime how much battery left for reading gaming or whatever I would definitely recommend it
B00992CF6W|3.0|people i know tell its so cool and i should get it but i dont know really y i would it seems kinda dumb someone please reply and tell me about the game because the description doesnt tell me what i can do. such a help thanks
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Kindle fire game is great!  Similar to the alligator game but more levels and its free!  I would absolutely positively recommend.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is a really great story; riveting and fast paced. Would be better with less foul language, but the sarcasm of the main character is great!
B006H5120E|4.0|Titanic (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / Digital Copy) Much better quality than my old VHS Tape and the 3D was Great too.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Best movie maybe of 2012 this took Glee to the next level. The movie takes the competition of group singing to the next level. Pitch Perfect is a more realistic version of Glee of problems a singing group would face. Fat Amy was as funny also as advertised.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I got exactly what was promised and then some. The item was in perfect condition and worked great. Thank you so much.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|By far the best Bond movie yet. With a complex plot that is though easy to follow with many twists and turns. Plus how can you go wrong with Adele singing your theme song.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is not a very difficult game but I enjoyed the distraction from a busy day.  It get progressively harder as you progress. I enjoyed the story also.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Not a clear cut story - the mouse uses her wiles to trick adversaries - a nice story about how the pen is mightier than the sword sometimes. Good for little people to understand this.<br /><br />The animation and voice over are lovely too. Hearing the word moose still cracks me up.
1849905452|3.0|The Stone Rose<br /><br />Although I very, very much enjoyed this book, I think it could have been so much more.  The first half and most of the middle were very slow, verging on boring almost, and, as the first Doctor Who book I'd read, I was quite disappointed by this.  Of course, the books won't be as good as the show, and they can't capture the expressions and movements of the characters like a video could, but still, I wish I had been able to enjoy this book a bit more.<br /><br />As said, although the first/middle bit of the book was, for the most part, slow, it really picked up after a while and I started to enjoy it more.  The Doctor/Rose banter was good, though I found one or two parts to seem a tad forced or not at all what I would think they would say.  But otherwise, I loved it.  The dialog, for the most part, was (though not always interesting for some of the characters) at least informative and kept the story moving, slow or fast.<br /><br />I love Doctor Who and don't like to insult it, but I really found that plot/plot twist was much, MUCH too easy to predict.  (SPOILER) I mean really?  The Doctor was the one who carved it?...duh.  A little too simple for my tastes. (SPOILER)  That, however, is about my biggest complaint, so it's not that bad.<br /><br />My only other big one is about the bad guy.  (SPOILER) Mr. Turn-People-To-Stone-Cause-I'm-\\"Mean.\\"(SPOILER) He was too generic for my enjoyment and I couldn't believe NO ONE noticed what he was doing.  I know it's Ancient Rome but (SPOILER) if everyone he's made statues of goes missing, why doesn't anyone notice?  Or at least say \\"it's really, really freaky how life like these are\\" / \\"where are the models you made these from now?\\" etc. etc.  But then, maybe that was just the life of a celebrity sculptor back then.  (SPOILER)<br /><br />I've since read a few more of the Tenth Doctor's books and found myself enjoying them much more then I did this one.  Thankfully, this is short and an easy read though, sadly, quite forgettable.<br /><br />So, on that note, defiantly read this if you're a Doctor Who fan (just cause it's there) but don't expect to be wowed by it.  Or, if you are, then never mind.  It's a good read if you don't expect much of it, but there you go.sadly, quite forgettable.<br /><br />So, on that note, defiantly read this if you're a Doctor Who fan (just cause it's there) but don't expect to be wowed by it.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Nice change from the pap that is on Prime. Good role for Lucy Lui away from the usual pin up girl she plays.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun and addicting game!I love how you can compare your scores with your friends on Facebook. I recommend this game to everyone out there who love fun games!!:)
B0091VTISO|3.0|It's not going to make you run out and demand that your friends see this movie, but it was a surprisingly decent reboot of the old film series. No particular weaknesses, perhaps a bit of a dated, now-less-interesting story, but fun nonetheless.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have read every one of her books...I have loved most of them, but the Scarpetta ones are my favorite.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot like the temple run game, easy to play, and it is a lot of fun.
1616550414|4.0|Well, it's the only book of Zelda History; but it's still excellent. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was that the first chunk of the book is dedicated to Skyward Sword. But then it goes into the history of the Zelda games, how they fit in order, and even discusses how they branch out into separate theoretical time lines. Even better, the last section of the book includes part of a manga (comic book) based on Zelda. Over all, this was a great book though the shipping was a little rough since the corner of my book was bent up a bit. But, over all; totally worth it!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I guess this game would be fun for a little kid but it is too easy for an adult to play.
1611761174|3.0|The content is all right and interesting -  Don't know why we need explicit sex.  It takes away from the purpose of the story
B009OYTAL8|5.0|OMG if your a lover of the HOT hero type, this is the show for you. But I'm a sucker for a man with a BOW.
B0094RCD14|5.0|Remastered and on vinyl; a seminal album that wouldn't go astray in anyone's collection, even if you've got the album already.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This game is great fun.  I believe that I've played this before on my computer and it's just as enjoyable the second time around. A great way to pass the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have to say this is the best app. lots of Color and characters.  if you want something interesting get this app c:
1476712042|5.0|Ok, here's the thing.  I know that I am a grown woman and I should be disgusted by this hero.  I mean, he is obsessed with the girl, he beats up anyone who looks at her, he is slightly on the stalker side, he has a temper, he is frequently drunk.  Even with all these flaws, I couldn't help but love the book.  I'm I little ashamed to admit it, but I couldn't put the book down.  Now in real life, if I had a friend who was dating someone like Travis, I would tell them to run away as fast as their feet could carry them.  But for a fictional read, this book was truely addictive.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|good game when you feel up to play a puzzle game. rainbow Colorado and fun to the game to play with friends
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Top of the line entertainment. It was so interesting to watch this film and then see how they filmed it.  Ive never seen people work so hard, and have fun doing it!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|well,  temple run 2 was good to play once but not over again. I like the new stuff but it dose seem really hard and some people just wanna play the normal game. but my rating on this will have to ne three stars :I
B00425S1H8|5.0|I needed it to work and it did just that. Hooked up to my computer no issues noted and it saved me.
159413586X|4.0|Provided some closure for the mockingjay story but was a rather idyllic way fo end the story. Didn't appear to have much hope or joy for their future.
B003UESJJC|5.0|Ok, I was just told about this movie (had no idea it existed) but was told by a co-worker about it. So I decided to go out and get the blue ray version. Lets just say, that I was overly impressed. Especially with my surround sound, its rediculous. Made me feel like I was deployed again...<br />The extra features about the movie were pretty educational and if you like this kind of film, its a must for any fan.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio<br /><br />I love the different levels, the scenery, the targets, and the differnet types of birds.  So much fun to play.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|A friend/neighbor friend of mine whom does photography as a hobby, introduced me to this product. I have a Nikon D7000 and I really didnt know what I was missing. The flash is amazing, the feastures are really good.... and although a tad expensive, it was somthing if I had to make the decsion again, I would do without a doubt knowing what I know now.
0802473156|5.0|Whether one is in a happy or bumpy relationship - this book will only improve the situation. If one truely looks at one's self and answers the questions put forth in this book and then shares them with their partner - good things will happen.  Truthful communications is the key to any relationship and this book explores how to accomplish same.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on my PC workstation, laptop, Android phone, iPod Touch and Kindle Fire.  It is without doubt the most useful organizational tool I have ever found.  Cross-platform synchronization lets me record those flashes of 'aha' moments, whether by text, voice, photo, etc.<br />Yes, I'm a fan.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|-Read the book and you will understand my title name!<br /><br />I thought this book was amazing. It was funny, but also a dark story that brings two lost people back together. There's so much I could say but I don't want to give anything away.<br />I enjoyed the light hearted tender moments and relished in the bantering between Sky and Holder. This book had so many twists and turns that I was constantly wondering what would happen next.<br /><br />Colleen did an amazing job with the way she wrote this book. It isn't just another story of young love. It's a story of a bond that two people shared at a young age, who lose each other only to be reunited again by accident. It's a story of strength and courage, hope and forgiveness.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a great read. You won't be disappointed.<br />I
B004Y042N8|4.0|This is a fun game for the kindle and it was free.  It passes time in the cars and is fun to draw the images.
B009X01ELC|5.0|Sturdy product that I feel protects my Kindle.  The hand strap greatly enhances the stability of the screen when holding the Kindle in one hand.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I and my husband have been a fan of Supernatural from episode one, but the show lost alot of it's grit in seasons six and seven. It became painful to watch the required ten minutes of them talking about their feelings, and it seemed like one of them was always crying. I am happy to report that season eight seems to be a return to the old days, feeling much like season four. There's alot of slow build-up, plenty of off-canon episodes, and best of all there's like no crying. We also are hearing the seventies and eighties songs again, which was always one of my favorite things. The show is being headed by a new person now, and it is obvious and much better. The bottom line is if you liked this show several years ago but gave up on it, now's the time to pick it back up.
B003XQM2YU|3.0|The story did not &#34;invite&#34; me in. I did not feel that it was as good as some Robin Hood movies which I have seen before. Maybe he should just &#34;take a rest&#34; the movie felt contrived and not exciting.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game<br />Isn't like any city building game I've played before<br />Has wonderful graphics and missions to play and keep up with
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Very well done, flight scenes (even though a bit unbelievable,) to the portrayal of the drug/alcohol addicted pilot plaed by Denzel Washington. Washington did an outstanding job, the script came to a surprising end, but very well played.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I wish that they would have kept the series going, I loved this movie and the TV episodes!!<br /><br />Can't leave a small review so I guess I will write some more.. there...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|In as much as this great American has been defined by sheer quantitative analysis, I think it is his work and sacrifice performed at home after seeing the dark side, that truly define his service. Thank you sir and God bless you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great Movie. I was hooked from start to end. Always egar to see the next episode. Would recommend to all.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|then this is also a MUST HAVE app.  Incredible variety, of music, good prices, and Amazon quality.  Have a new smart phone or tablet?  I would say this is a MUST HAVE standard app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you are a kid that is bored with nothing to do you should try it.it's a great game parents I recommend to your children it's a goods game for kids one of my friends got me addicted to it so that's the only thing I play any more
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I have a new tablet and this is a great app to use to obtain more apps.  A must have!!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Excellent book. It does ramble in places, but all in all I truly enjoyed it. I have a bookmark with 50 books to read before you die on it, this is one of those books and I can see why.  The classics are always the best.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|I read this book because of the movie.  I went to Mr.Child's web site and saw he had a rather extensive series based on the Jack Reacher character.  I decided to start with this one as it was listed as the first book in the series.  I was tempted to put it down early but kept with it until the end.  It did get better as the book went on but at the start the plot was weak and then certain facts changed about Reacher's background for no apparent reason.  I may try the next book in the series, Die Trying, I think, to see if there is any more improvement.
B009KY0TE4|5.0|best ever wood hiely reg a ment it to all my frend to by the cd like the one i puchased
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|One of the best albums. Period. The sort of music from the 90's that defined and shaped my teenage years.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I think it would've been better if you added pictures to demonstrate different words!!!! You didn‘t give the part of speech!!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is an awesome game I love doing hidden object games I can not wait to see the sequel is like.  Rating this game I would say that it is great.
1936850028|5.0|I'm not a skier, but being from NW Wisconsin myself and a big fan of Walter Rhein's other work \\"The Bone Sword\\" (also available on Amazon) I had to give \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" a try! From the very beginning I was hooked as Rhein described life growing up in small town Wisconsin where in late autumn the snow begins to fly and folks strap on their cross country skis in preparation for the largest cross country ski marathon in North America-the American Birkebeiner.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm not a skier, but in the past I have trained for various races (running). I found myself smiling many times throughout this book as I related to many of the trials and tribulations described that occur from doing any distance training. Rhein also paints a picture of life in small town Wisconsin to a tee and brings the feel of race day to the reader in stunning detail.<br /><br />In short, this book is a great read for anyone who appreciates the outdoors, distance training, and is a MUST read for cross country skiers!
B0091UGEVY|4.0|...and probably the second time as well. At that point I was rather taken with the characters and wanted to watch it again...in time. If you like elegant sets, great supporting cast (Nathan Lane can steal almost any show) and a charming, if not predictable tale, get the fuzzy slippers out, light the fire place and...well, this &#34;cute&#34; movie kit does not supply the person you cuddle with...because not every cuddly companion will be as caught  up in the visuals as you...so this movie is perfect for after a great meal....
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was very interesting and fun to read. I really really really really really really really really  liked it.  I recommend that you read it
6305128952|5.0|This has got to be one of my families all time favorite movies. We watch it about once a year and it is always entertaining.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|The movie starts with a young Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) spending good times and learning life lessons under the tutelage of his beloved uncle (Albert Finney) at the uncle's chateau and vineyard in France. Fast forward to Max as a grown, ruthless business man who's only passions are money and being first in the market, let the chips fall where they may. Then, news of his uncle's death forces Max back to France to handle the chore of disposing of the estate he's inherited. A comedic chance encounter with a local French beauty (Marion Cotillard) starts to complicate things, and we begin to share in flashbacks of Max's memories of his youth and good times spent with his uncle at the chateau. Everything is changing for Max ... or will it? See for yourself in this delightful, romantic comedy.<br /><br />This role is a bit of a change of pace for Russell Crowe, and it's a good one. The movie is rounded out nicely with supporting cast members in the roles of Max's business assistant, the caretaker of the vineyard and his wife, a surprise visit by a here-to-fore unknown American cousin and others. Enjoy the lovely scenes of the French countryside and beautiful vineyard, as well as the delightful music that serves as a thread throughout the movie. Lots to feel good about with this movie.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I liked what little storyline this book has but honestly I skipped through all the sex scenes, kind of boring when the same words are used again and again and again.... and AGAIN!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Temple run 2 is a good app but it will not open on my Kindle. fire :(  I don't know why it wont open because It used to just hope the problem can be fixed .........
B004SBS8LA|5.0|gags hahaha hahhaha hahahja hahah hays hagaga gagha Haggai vagabond hats hhaah bagatelle gagaga vagabond hahaha hahaha vagabond hahaha hahahha hahaha
B004ZISVWC|5.0|This movie is excellent. It is subtitled yet that makes no difference in the impact. It is a good, old fashioned monster movie with excellent cienematography and writing. It beats the heck out of most American-made monster movies.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows and I just couldn't wait for Season 2 to come out on Netflix.  I'm thrilled with the DVD.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|What a great movie!  I grew up an Avengers fan, they were my favorite!  It's like an all-star team or a greatest hits package in every story.  I would suggest that if you are not familiar with the characters, watching the other Marvel movies that lead up to this as well.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Entertaining read. It keeps you engaged and makes great reference to all of the modern technologies that are changing the publishing world.
1419705849|5.0|Great book and awesome price compared to the local stores! My 8 yr old LOVED IT, he has all the collection now and this one in particular is one of his favorite! And as always the shipping was great!
B007JMW46U|5.0|Great shipping and love the product.  Getting right away was great, went right to reading.  Wish the series was back on tv.
1401207529|5.0|Frank Miller's is awesome. Another excellent gift for my Batman fanatic to add to his ever growing comic collection. This is a must read for any Batman fan.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great series and the special effects is to die for. I recommend this series if you enjoy blood, guts and friendship at the worst of times.
1401223176|5.0|I'm not a fan of how Hush resolves itself but the individual pieces are brilliant. This is one of the few Batman stories to give some notable page space to explore the Batman/Catwoman relationship with some depth (I COULDN&#34;T GET ENOUGH!), which makes this comic a must read all it's own for any Batman, Catwoman, or DC fan. Jim Lee's art is amazing.
B005LAII8A|4.0|It's a very good movie, at times......better the second time I watched it; I don't consider myself to be a prude, but it seems to me that a lot of Good Movies are ruined, not by anything specific, except the overdone foul language. With a lot less profanity, and better script writing this could have been a Monster Hit. I was always told that people who constantly used profanity, lack intelligence......
B006LSZECO|1.0|After reading the reviews, I thought this would be a worthwhile book.  Nope, not at all. Don't waste your money.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|My friend told me I would love this book. She was right. Loved this love story. Cannot wait for \\"Walking Disaster.\\"
0062082353|5.0|I really liked this book a lot. What a great book about an amazing American hero. Chris Kyle will be missed by friends and family and I'm glad he took the opportunity to write his story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Well written, tender, and heartbreaking. You get very into the story, anyone will like this book.  Its an easy and quick read!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Age and weakness have made manual puzzle-making (a favorite pastime) a chore.  Now, puzzles are fun and easy again!  Love the variety available.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was by far, my favorite book of 2012. Colleen Hoover is amazing.<br />She wrote a perfect story. So many beautiful words.
0321885112|2.0|I purchased this book with the idea that I might learn some creative ways to link images to ideas, or at the very least, see lots of good examples from people who do this well.<br /><br />This book is extremely repetitious, restating the obvious over and over until I put it down in frustration. I got to the end of the book and learned almost nothing new, and it's not because I have a  background in art. I have no artistic training whatsoever, but I found this book to be ridiculously simple. It should be much shorter and much less expensive!
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Beautiful, haunting and addictive. I had heard this on mp3 many times over but the vinyl is pretty awesome to thine ears.<br />Highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is thrilling and fun. I would recomend it to a lot of people. If you had a choice of playing a game on the x box, or playing subway surfer, I would pick subway suffer.
B000YXMMAO|5.0|If you are a Radiohead fan and you want to know what the inside of a rainbow sounds like, please by all means, go buy yourself a record player along with this album. Bring it home, hook it up, spin that record and enjoy. Then feel free to leave a comment on this review to thank me after you experience great audible joy. I welcome you in advance.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|best social media ever<br />glad they have this<br />and glad i can be apart of it<br />i  just love it
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am very happy with this app for my kindle fire.<br />I was unaware that there was an app and was using the full site on my kindle with much frustration.<br />So glad to have found this highly functional, user friendly app!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|way too much trouble with this game,<br />although i do love the online version.<br />but the version i have on my kindle fire does not work properly
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is the 10th Doctors sonic screwdriver, purchased for my 12 year old son who is a great fan of the tv show. Recommend for all doctor who fans.
B0018M6J90|5.0|I have seen this so many times and enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it. I used to live in a neighboring town from Frances McDormand so it is even more precious.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best horse games I have ever played in my entire life. I hope that the company that made this game can make more except for dogs or cats.
0765325950|5.0|I wanted to read this long before it ever got published because I love the series. I will be re-reading the whole series again.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|really love this game! its fun to play when you have nothing else to do really hoping they come out with a second one!
B0000025JT|5.0|I heard this many years ago and loved it. When I saw it again, I was so pleased and listen to it often.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Some levels are fairly easy, and some are pretty challenging. But, it's a great game for everyone.
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|One of the first things that I noticed about Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds was their penchant for releasing and album of roaring fire, followed by one of calming water.  What was evident to me with \\"Murder Ballads\\" then \\"The Boatman's Call\\"; is now again [evident] in \\"Push the Sky Away\\" following \\"Dig, Lazurus Dig!!!\\".  One album brings to you the brimstone and wrath of a man who wants to tear down Hell after swimming laps in a lake of fire.  The other has a man solemny reading a eulogy of love outside of a quaint chapel in the woods.  \\"Push the Sky Away\\" is certainly an example of the calming waters.  Though his styles may vary, you will still find a symmetry weaving through his work.  It is all in his words rather than delivery.  Reverand Cave's lyrics are important, authoritative, and backed with masterful literary skill.<br />I have a feeling that this album may take some time to grow roots into some listeners' gray matter, and sink into the cerebellum. The reason for that thought escapes me, as my brain was promptly receptive to the inter-tangled growths of the music.  The low end bass is felt throughout, creating an atmosphere of precipitaion ranging from fog-like mist to steady rain beads beating asphault. Eerie projections can be heard coming through the loopy guitar, which by my estimation, was strung in the netherworld & tuned by a ghost.  These constant sonic threads give a comfortably \\"blue to purple\\" feel with a nice spot of grey in the distance; as much as they are responsible for flourishes of pure light when the violins peak or when the female singers gain volume in the background.<br />Wonderful album.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love Angry Birds. It's a fun game with just the right amount of challenging and easy levels. Great for kids.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great seek &amp; find game to play with my 7 year old son. Challenging enough to make us work a bit, but not enough to force us into too many &quot; skips&quot; or hints. Would definitely recommend!
1451695195|5.0|This book has prompted me to write my very FIRST Amazon review.  There's absolutely nothing I can add to the hundreds of glowing reviews, so I'll just say, Bravo, Dr. Alexander for a beautiful book that is obviously inspiring many!  Thank you for sharing your beautiful journey!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This is definetly a game for kids.  I thought I would try it as an adult but it was boring.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I gifted this to my brother-in-law. He was thrilled to receive it. If you are a Batman fan or know of one you will want to buy this.
0316067598|5.0|The hardback book is of good quality and has an attractive cover. Well written and is a great story that is easy to follow.
1591841992|5.0|The author presents a fresh and effective means for all of us to clearly present our ideas and assist others in showing their approaches to problem solving through visual literacy. A real breakthrough in communications.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It is very simple yet fun. It eloquently channels the hardships of the Irish immigrant like Mario did for the Irish. simply beautiful it made me cry.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great look into a life of someone who sacrifices more than most. A quick read, but worth the time.
B0041O40EI|5.0|I finished my education in 1977 and worked in 1886 in London for a year; I've visted the towne several times since then.  I have a soft spot for Londondary Towne.<br />  This is a '...GREAT...' item for my London, England, UK collection.
B000BFH2S2|2.0|VERY Disappointed! the songs on the cd, that was the reason for ordering it,  are NOT on the CD, but on the DVD that won't play, as it is from the wrong region. That's not to say that the songs he sings on the CD are not good, but there are only 8. Guess I'll put this one in the yard sale and order another!
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|I want a refund.  This game stinks!!  I THOUGHT IT WOULD CONTAIN THE GAME MILLIPEDE, AND SPACE INVADERS WHEN i BOUGHT, BUT IT ONLY CONTAINS A TERRIBLY BORING GAME.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  The worst part of the matter is that I tried to get a refund and they won't give it to me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this version of Solitaire.  Usually works good but sometimes it sticks and I go past a card instead of sending it to the spot I wanted it to go.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Just like previous albums a solid album that you can listen to start to finish and not hear a bad song.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I picked up this book hoping to finish it before the movie comes out because I always like to compare the two,  It was one of those novel's that once you picked up you couldn't put it down and it was a pretty simple read.  I loved the story line and can't wait to see the movie tomorrow night!
0316044938|5.0|This is one of my 7th grade students' favorite book.  They fight over who gets to read it next, and it's hard to check out at the school library.  A must have for a middle school LA teacher, or a parent who wants to get their kid hooked on books.  Appropriate for both boys and girls.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|This book really touched home the relationship that Dawson and Amanda share is amazing.  The obsticles that they face through out life only brings them closer together and the bond they have tighter.  True to Sparks way of writing you'll need kleenex's its not really a Nicholas Sparks book until your in tears.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The Life of Pi is an exciting, suspenseful adventure story about an East Indian boy alone on a raft with several zoo animals after the ship he was on sank not far from India.  We learn about the nature of the animals and the courage of a teen-age boy whose father was the former zoo keeper.  The book by Yann Martel was detailed and knowledgeful.  The reader is part of the sea journey under days and nights of danger of weather and dangerous animals.  I hope Martel will write another story soon.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I just finished reading this for the second time and I love it!! Very graphic but the story is great the relationship between Christian and Ana is so sweet and everything they overcome and go through keeps you glued to page they are up there with the great couples from books and movies true love!! Very highly recommended read love it!! Now on to book three for the second time! :)
B00133KFGW|5.0|This was a great movie. I recommand buying it. It is one the whole family can watch. It was strange seeing Robin Williams in a different role. SUper movie
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Enjoy reading . But quite erotic. Good to read when you have a lot of free time. Will read the next one soon
B00BESJYAY|3.0|This is, in my opinion, just another surf movie. I sort of wished I would have waited until it came out on regular tv. Nothing special here, wish there was.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Arrived in time for Christmas.  One of our favorite bands.  Really enjoyed the DVD and the CD is a plus.

B00005JKES|5.0|I enjoyed this very quirkly, dark, drama/comedy, but I have to say I did not like the ending at all.  I won't give away and spoilers but I had hoped for a better ending.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you are a Family Guy fan then this is a must see. Not reccommended for children; this is not a child's movie. Adult humor from Seth at it's best!
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Fabulous movie, incredible actors, unbelievably great movie.  A must to have in your collection.  You won't be sorry, trust me.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I never saw or heard anything about this movie until I saw it at a redbox. I read the details and thought this might be something alright to watch but I decided to get something else because it was \\"unknown\\" to me. So about a week later I actually rented it. Boy oh boy, it was more then good, this movie was Great!! I liked it so much because I could relate to some of the parts. Don't think twice about this movie, if you do you'll miss out (like I did). I'm looking forward to buying the dvd.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I downloaded the sample for Kindle and had to purchase it immediately once I reached the end. My favorite thing about this book is that the first chapter led me to believe all sorts of things about Holder and where the story was going, but then the author completely turned things around once the actual story was told. Holder wasn't the typical YA edgy male- he was a genuine sweetheart, and I loved everything about him. I would recommend this book to ANYONE who loves romance- you don't have to love YA to love this book. Very well written too.
B003XNTTYY|5.0|Fantastic follow up to The Final Empire. Fast paced, well written with great characters and a few good twists and turns
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is one of the greatest stories I have read in a long time. I was hooked on every word of this book wondering what would happen next. Wool is simply amazing.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book.  No, it's not an artistic masterpiece by any means, but it was really very enjoyable to read.  A lot of the character's reactions to his situation were 100% believable, even if some of the plot was stretching it a bit (for me anyway).  Lots of little technical details were great and didn't go so far as to bore me.  I only wish it was a little bit longer in the end as I would have liked to have had more detail about the last part (sorry to be vague, don't want to spoil anything).  I would highly recommend this as an easy but entertaining read.<br /><br />EDIT TO ADD: I don't mean to imply in my title that the book is short, because it's a decent length and took me a couple days to read.  I was so engrossed in his adventure I just wanted more detail about the end of it. :-)
B006LSZECO|4.0|4 Stars for good writing, but I didn't like the story. Diary Amy was nice, but she was supposed to be. Everyone else just grated on my nerves. And \\"Go\\" as a nickname for Margo?  Seriously???  The first half of the story was certainly intriguing but the latter was exhausting. Every chapter ended with a \\"dun-da-dun!\\".  And I was anxious to be done with it all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read.<br />Loved every minute. Could not put the book down once I started. Highly recommend. Can't wait to read the next book.

B00A3XWAU2|4.0|I can't top Tony Conley's review- won't even try. I just want to re-enforce it.<br /><br />I can't imagine ANY fan of this type of music not loving this Album!<br />Shades of Bad Company and early Whitesnake for sure. This is old-school British polished-rock.<br /><br />Basically, if you have albums that you love with any of these players on them, you're gonna love this album too. 4 1/2 stars!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I really loved this book and was sad when I finished it. I actually first listened to it as an audiobook and howled with laughter every day in my car. I felt like I missed a lot (her British accent is strong) so I bought the book also to read. Loved it again. She is raw and honest, and some of the subject matter may offend some people (masturbation, abortions, etc.) but I loved this book because of it's honesty. I could relate to so much of it, as I'm sure most women can. I look forward to reading her other books.

B00013RC66|4.0|I first saw this stylish, neo-noir thriller in a theater in 1986, and I really liked it. Bob Rafelson, who directed FIVE EASY PIECES (one of my all-time fave films), had a real change of pace with this Hitchcockian story. A mousy federal investigator (Debra Winger) gets on the trail of a glamorous, stunningly beautiful serial killer of rich men (Theresa Russell), and soon the two very different women are pitted against each other in a fight to the...death? A whole lot of swanky houses in several photogenic locations--including the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii--give us a lot to look at, and Rafelson gets stylized, old-fashioned \\"movie star\\" performances from his two wonderful leading ladies. It's a real pleasure to watch Winger and Russell go at it with such obvious enjoyment, and the cast of male victims is really impressive, too (Dennis Hopper, Nicol Williamson, Sami Frey, etc.). The Fox DVD is crisp and vivid, with excellent Surround sound. There are no extras, which would have been nice. Still, this is a welcome addition to my library. Recommended.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This made a wonderful gift for my parents.  We all love Downton Abbey and its great to re-watch episodes whenever you want!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of 007, and I always have been, ever since I saw YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE in a theater (I was 13 then). When I first saw SKYFALL in a theater a couple of months ago, I wasn't as crazy about it as the critics and all my friends were. But then an interesting thing happened: I got the DVD (to add to my collection of all the Bond films), and watching it a second time was a different experience. Maybe it was the noisy, crowded theater that kept me from really enjoying it, but in the privacy of my home I now see an entirely different film. This is actually one of the better Bonds, maybe the best (so far) from Daniel Craig. And the DVD is gorgeous, with a terrific commentary track from the director, Sam Mendes. If you saw it in a theater and thought you didn't like it, try it again on DVD or Blu-ray. You might change your mind about it. I know I did. Highly recommended.

B004UID2LC|2.0|Based on all of the problems this app seems to have, and how complicated it is to fix, why would you want this? There is another app out there called TubeMate, (Also free) and has a better layout than this. I would recommend getting Tubemate if you've read the reviews of this.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The graphics were being excellent and it was as if you were in the game itself. The story line was packed with mystery, adrenaline, slightly nightmarish and yet intriguing. Another job well done for Big Fish Games!
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|She should be at the apex of her career, but really, THE HURT LOCKER was a disappointment, and a sham. She's been great at lyrical action in the past, no doubt. The preposterous narrative of POINT BREAK was one of the great image-driven pieces of abstract-expressionist action filmmaking of it's era, but it's the only great film she's done. everything else is desperate treading of murky B-movie water, with traces of technocratic cinematic elan. NEAR DARK is POINT BREAK'S clan-based genotype. But so often, (like, with every movie she directed in the period 2000-2010) she  has a bombastic approach to her own naïve pretentiousness, resulting in films probably more ludicrous than she intends. This one gets NOTHING right; a messy brew of fictionalized history and pointless violence with no ability to distinguish it's politics from a hole in the ground. The restrained, artsy air to the proceedings will confuse a lot of people. The point is the film is pretty and mindless and it's restrained realism makes for just a downright technically accomplished, awful film. This union born in hell between screenwriter Boal and Bigelow netted an Oscar, daresay I produced a love child, and derailed Bigelow's already stagnating career. Boy, the tomboy is s gullible one. Also, maybe it's her bad dialogue, but the lead actor is an annoying mess of feminist clichés. Oh, and BTW, about the torture scenes, bring puke bag. Most disappointing movie in years!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I am not a comic book fan in the least and usually avoid superhero movies as they aren't my thing in the least, but I found myself really enjoying this film. I really like films that push the envelope for what is acceptable and tolerable by the audience and this one definitely delivers in the violence department.<br /><br />The acting was well done and it seems that the cast did the best possible job for such a flat storyline. I'm not sure what else they could have done as I don't know much about the Dredd universe but a little more character development would have been welcomed.<br /><br /> As I watched the movie I kept having the feeling that the director was a Gasper Nior fan as you weren't just along for the ride as the violence happened but also the result of the violence which can make some people...like myself...squirm in their seat a little. I wouldn't have bat an eyelash if this film had come over from France or another European country with more progressive cinema but the fact that this is an American action/hero film that doesn't try to make itself a 'family event' and placate the masses should be commended.

B001DUJNGS|1.0|As a long-time Enigma fan, I figured I'd try to purchase some of the later CD's I hadn't yet heard.<br /><br />While &#34;Voyageur&#34; was a bit different from what I might have been expecting, it was still mostly enjoyable.<br /><br />&#34;Seven Lives Many Faces&#34; is wretched.  I mean, absolutely, agonizing-to-witness HORRIBLE.  The &#34;spiritualesque&#34; style of previous Enigma albums, with chanting priests or tribal incantations set to soothing, rhythmic music has been replaced with what I can only describe as a the results of a three-legged Pit Bull on meth with unrestricted access to GarageBand and a distributor.<br /><br />Not recommended if you really enjoy the previous Enigma music and aren't looking for something &#34;different just to be different.&#34;

B00A655N8I|3.0|Even modern Russia seems unable to live without czars, and as absolute ruler of music in St. Petersburg, Valery Gergiev modernized the venerable Mariinsky Theater, brought its artistic forces up to a high standard, and built a new concert hall for the orchestra.  The Mariinsksy's Ring cycles have been historic events, and thanks to Gergiev's international standing, they have traveled to London and New York, with casts that draw from Russian opera stars for the most part.<br /><br />This new Walkure, however, spreads its net to include singers more likely to be found at the Met and Bayreuth, with the major draw being Jonas Kaufmann, whose triumphs as Siegmund, Lohengrin, and Parsifal are uncontested by any current rival.  Irreplaceable as he is, nearly so are Nina Stemme's Brunnhilde and Rene Pape's Wotan. In the modern era, only the recorded versions of Walkure from Karajan (DG) and Leinsdorf (Decca) offer such consistency, even though two other famous sets, under Solti and Bohm, include their own unforgettable singers (my chief resistance being to their Wotans, the aged Hans Hotter for Solti and gravelly-voiced Theo Adam for Bohm).<br /><br />With three eminent lead singers, the superb Mariinksy Orch., and good recorded sound, a success would seem to be automatic. The hitch, if there is one, derives from the weight of the past.  Is Gergiev capable of matching his great predecessors, particularly Furtwangler, Karajan, Keilberth, and Solti?  Are the principals capable of creating memorable characters who rise to the level of Nilsson, Vickers, Hotter, and company?  Held to those standards - if they are fair - Gergiev conducts with only middling intensity, and  even the passionate Kaufmann, who sizzles in the Met's Walkure, seems to tamp his ardor down in keeping with the conducting.<br /><br />Why this happened mystifies me. Gergiev is never less than dynamic outside Wagner, but maybe that should be \\"Wagner and Verdi,\\" because as a Verdian he has also been too cautious. Nothing here is done with abandon, not even the sure-fire Ride of the Valkyries.  The opening bars of Act I give ample warning that Solti's fierceness and Furtwangler's total emotional commitment are not at hand.  This Walkure suffers from the unforgivable sin of being uninteresting, even though every other aspect is first-rate - even the Valkyries are better singers and blend more smoothly than Karajan's and Solti's troupe. But what does it matter when Brunnhilde enters sounding not at all terrified or desperate, or when Wotan doesn't seem especially outraged?<br /><br />The whole point of Wagner's saga is that the gods lose the world through their ungoverned greed, jealousy, and hostility - being in control is the last thing one would say about them.  Against this primal scene comes love as a redeeming force; the human world deserves to supplant the gods because of love.  But in Gergiev's hands, the drama is too tame by half, and for all his musicianship, he has entirely missed the spirit of the music. The tragedy of the gods has become a household spat in the suburbs.<br /><br />P.S. - In the interests of fair reporting, I see that a NY Times reviewer praises this Walkure with basically no reservations.s.

B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|This is a great app!  You get your own little wazer figure and can see other wazers on the road.  It will tell you if there is a traffic slowdown on your route, police, accident, whatever.  You can even set up your own group to see how far away your friends are if you're meeting somewhere.  It's just a really fun app.<br />The only drawback is that it is not voice activated as yet, so entering a traffic report as you're driving usually isn't an option.
B00846REIS|2.0|One of my friends recommended this to me after I read &#34;Fifty Shades of Gray.&#34;  It is absolutely much better-written than 50 Shades, and the dialogue won't make you cringe.  However-- while 50 Shades of Gray is erotica, this book is pornography.  I don't have anything against pornography, I just don't personally like to read it.  I actually didn't finish this book because I got a little grossed out.  But if you want some soft-core porn that has a good plot and is well-written, this is a good choice.

B007REV4YI|4.0|After the abortion that was Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is the only Bond to retain the same actor after a four year long gap, and is the representation of the 50th anniversary of MGM's flagship franchise. Does Skyfall deliver, or does Adele let it crumble? It has a LOT (and I mean a helluva lot) to make up for, and I feel that critics fawned over it a bit too much, probably just ecstatic that it wasn't Quantum of Soulless. I enjoyed some of Skyfall, but overall I felt deflated and occasionally a bit bored. There's more subtext here than usual, but the plot is full of holes and it weighs down the action too much.<br /><br />After a list of undercover agents is stolen (it is never explained how as the movie jumps in after the story has already started) Bond goes off in pursuit of the culprit and is accidentally gunned down by his colleague during a scrap aboard a train moving over a massive viaduct. M believes him dead and is due to be hauled over the coals for analogue incompetence in a digital age. But Bond knows he lives twice and guesses he'll die another day. He's broken and beaten-down, though he insists he's good enough for another shot at catching the baddie.<br /><br />And so enters Javier Bardem as Silva, a charismatic ex-agent (it's never made clear if he was a double-oh) who lives for revenge. He IS a great villain and is wonderful to watch, bringing an unusual amount of sadness and empathy to the role. He wants to get back at M for selling him out some years previous, and as Bond does everything in his power to protect her they come across as siblings fighting for mother's attention and approval. It gives the film an emotional heart that Bond doesn't usually have.<br /><br />I feel that this is undone by such ludicrous development and bad scripting as Silva goes about executing a years-in-development plan that relies on way too much contrivance. Where on Earth does Silva get his endless supply of goons? Does he put an ad in the paper? Wanted: Henchman for revenge plot. Must be willing to dress the part (no uniform provided) and die for me. Meets national minimum wage. You can have a gun if you want.<br /><br />And, for that matter, where does he get his supplies, equipment, helicopters? For a man living as a ghost he sure is connected. Yes, I know I am pedantically picking apart an action movie plot, but Skyfall promotes itself as more serious and a return to form. The aforementioned complaints feel like leftover elements from the Bronson era, and I do feel like it is high time to fire Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. With this fresh start they should have brought in stronger writers, or perhaps just employ a single writer for consistency.<br /><br />B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe and Naomi Harris pop in as the Bond girls but neither are really given anything to do, the former having about 10 lines of dialogue. And with the franchise adapting to modern sensibilities it feels a bit corny having Bond jump into bed (or in this case shower) with a girl he met five minutes earlier. He's a bit too detached from them for their presence to have any impact on the plot.<br /><br />There are many attempts to give this entry a better continuity with previous movies, and while I really like this, it feels a little (just a little) fanboy-ish. Am I the only one who thinks that the Aston Martin (in all of it's lovely gray-ishness) is an ugly-as-sin automobile? Or that the Walther PPK is a wimpy-as-hell gun? I've seen potato guns that look more intimidating. Also, the film explores Bond's roots and history more so then ever before, but the big revelation about M's past that has been teased in the pre-release hype is thoroughly non-existent. Judi Dench does get a lot more to do this time around and really does become the emotional core of the Oedipal fracas between Bond and Silva.<br /><br />Roger Deakin shoots the entire film in Redcode RAW and it looks L-O-V-E-L-Y. Every scene has its own unique aesthetic and atmospheric production design. Really, really good work there. All done digitally, obviously, and while it's gorgeous for this 50th anniversary adventure, I hope it doesn't become standard practice. 35mm may be the past, but I hope it sticks around for the future.<br /><br />David Arnold is gone. In his place is Thomas Newman, who unfortunately scores the film with no decent melodies and rarely even uses the Bond theme or even the melody from the title song. How I miss John Barry. There is a fare amount of globe-trotting, including Turkey, China, Macau, and the Scottish highlands. However, too much of this cuts back to mundane London. Stuart Baird (having seemingly abandoned his career as a director) cuts it altogether expertly, but he can't add excitement to scenes that have been written so flatly.<br /><br />I've always felt that Bond movies are defined by the second unit and stunt co-ordination. With the action reserved for short bursts in Skyfall it allows Sam Mendes a chance to put his own stamp on the film. This is both good and bad. Turning a Bond in a character study is a bold chance to take, but they should have turned up the action more. I like gritty, realistic stunts and choreography, but Bond isn't really the franchise for it. There is a sweet spot in-between invisible cars and fist-fighting and I am not sure that Skyfall has found it.<br /><br />It's not the darkest or angriest Bond adventure (that honor goes to Licence to Kill), but it sure is most atmospheric and downbeat. Let's hope that next time around they deliver more spectacle and excitement.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks and sounds flawless in 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and loads of extras.really good work there. All done digitally, obviously, and while it's gorgeous for this 50th anniversary adventure, I hope it doesn't become standard practice. 35mm may be the past, but I hope it sticks around for the future.<br /><br />David Arnold is gone. In his place is Thomas Newman, who unfortunately scores the film with no decent melodies and rarely even uses the Bond theme or even the melody from the title song. How I miss John Barry. There is a fare amount of globe-trotting, including Turkey, China, Macau, and the Scottish highlands. However, too much of this cuts back to mundane London. Stuart Baird (having seemingly abandoned his career as a director) cuts it altogether expertly, but he can't add excitement to scenes that have been written so flatly.<br /><br />I've always felt that Bond movies are defined by the second unit and stunt co-ordination. With the action reserved for short bursts in Skyfall it allows Sam Mendes a chance to put his own stamp on the film. This is both good and bad. Turning a Bond in a character study is a bold chance to take, but they should have turned up the action more. I like gritty, realistic stunts and choreography, but Bond isn't really the franchise for it. There is a sweet spot in-between invisible cars and fist-fighting and I am not sure that Skyfall has found it.<br /><br />It's not the darkest or angriest Bond adventure (that honor goes to Licence to Kill), but it sure is most atmospheric and downbeat. Let's hope that next time around they deliver more spectacle and excitement.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks and sounds flawless in 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and loads of extras.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Good storyline and enjoyable even for non baseball fans. The ending seemed a little formulaic, but still this movie is entertaining.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|The story is very interesting. The style varies from a slow meditatve pace to a rapid sequence of events. It would have been nice to have the small pictures that were included in the original version and in pdf form for free somewhere else. The merit is the popularity of this book which gives some insight into the 19th century ways of life, which in some aspects is quite modern!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have difficulty reading a lot of Stephen King books because he writes about the bizzare. BUT, this story is not like his &#34;creepy&#34; stories. I thouroughly enjoyed this book. Even when things got violent. It is well written and well thought out. The story follows a predictable path in parts and gives a few unexpected turns in others. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a mystery, a love story, a tour through history, and anyone interested in the JFK assasination.
B005VPRGB0|4.0|my nine year old had a bit of trouble figuring out where he went wrong and the instructions were a little confusing to follow, but all in all, at least with my help, we figured it out and had a lot of fun.

B006LSZECO|2.0|i had a hard time enjoying this book once i realized everyone was a jerk & i didn't care what happened to any of them.  it was well-paced & i was enjoying it up until the TWIST, but then it was all downhill from there.  & i stopped caring what happened.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Wonderful movie clean and sweet, All without the disgust of foul language or inappropriate situations that exist in most movies of today.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|i was a little disappointed w/this book.  i was hoping for more interaction between darcy & elizabeth or the bennett sisters.  instead, elizabeth played such a minor role, & she came across a lot more smug than i remembered her.  a lot of the dynamic from pride & prejudice was lost.  also, i felt the plot kind of dragged after a while, & i thought the ending was a little disappointing.  i guess there was potential for more drama, & i wanted the drama to be there, but in the end it just kind of fizzled.
B000FC1AGG|2.0|Sometimes I wonder if people are just afraid to go against the tide while giving a review.  Why all the rave reviews for this story? Am I missing something? This is Confessions of a  Shopahilic with a new title and different names.  Let's review...<br />-Wealthy male boss who is initially  mistaken for stranger never to be seen again (check)<br />- bumbling young female with big life lesson to learn (check)<br />- quirky jusgemental friends with misguided loyalty (check)<br />- a betrayal of trust passed off as a misunderstanding or a silly lack of communication (check)<br />- a fully fleshed out herione falling for a guy that we never really get to know (check)<br />Yep... It's all there! So, if you loved Confessions and you want to read the same story again then you are in luck! For $7.99 you can download it on your kindle and have it today (AGAIN).
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|my grandson's wanted this game. the instructions go by so fast you can barely read them. it's not like they are very specific. I have no idea how this works,  so I'm no help. it's just ok.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I love the series and the last book did not disappoint! This one is especially nice, since it jumps right in where the 2nd book left off...rather than the first two books that have a very slow start.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter and I enjoy this game!!!!  Easy and the graphics are fantastic!!  Perfect to entertain your self in a long trip!!!!  My daughter is a horse lover and enjoys feeding the horse, cleaning and giving treats.  Competition is easy as well.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Looking at this album cover and hearing the hard rock sounds, I see why my parents were worried.  No harm done, however.  This is still a great recording.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Some of the concepts were not exactly correct such as: cabin pressure in current space launches has been less than atmospheric, humans can live comfortably in less absolute pressure.  However, the minor mistakes is science fact did not deter from the great story line.
1567184855|4.0|I do believe in an &#34;after&#34; life and I believe in reincarnation.  I really liked and understood the first half of this book, but the last half kinda lost me.  Perhaps I need to read it again to fully understand.
1612130283|1.0|Wish I had read these reviews before my purchase.  This is one of the worst books I've read in years.  I too found myself wondering the age of the author, given the immature tone and voice of the main character.  I doubt I'll finish the book, certainly will not purchase any others and wish I could get my money back!

B005ZO6NRA|1.0|This movie is GARBAGE. The Conan here is not not true to the original Conan created in Robert E. Howard's stories. It's not true to the Arnold Schwarzenegger version from the 80s movies. Even if you toss out the entire Conan premise and take it as a generic fantasy action film, it still sucks. Why?<br /><br />- the plot is extremely generic, yet still rife with implausibilities (why didn't they just shatter the bone fragments into smaller fragments... and then smaller fragments... and then into dust?) and holes (in Conan's homeland, dominated by proud barbarian tribes, who were those animal guys supposed to be, where did they come from, and what was the point of their wandering around shirtless on a frozen mountaintop right next to a village of dangerous barbarian warriors?)<br /><br />- the music is bombastic and generic.<br /><br />- the violence, which should be the FOCUS of this film, is disappointing. There are a couple grisly moments, but they're gross-out, not visceral combat. You see some severed heads and a bloody face-hole AFTER the fighting is done, but the combat is all 'swing sword, don't really show it cutting,dismembering or impaling, then show a huge splash of cartoon blood'. It's gratuitous without being gratifying. It's like they took a PG movie's battle scenes, then added some CG blood splashes to get that R rating.<br /><br />- Conan doesn't look tough. He has big muscles in the way that the barbie-doll dudes do at the gym. They work out daily and have muscles, but they also pluck their eyebrows, shave their legs, and style their hair. What's so manly about that? Arnold's Conan looked as though he could (and would) rip you in half. Momoa's Conan looks as though he's worried if his tanning bed appointment will interfere with his hairdresser appointment.<br /><br />- The movie just doesn't pack a punch. It's generic. It's boring. It's forgettable -- it's throwaway, it's GARBAGE.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or time. See something else worth watching.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|No problem, fit fine. Would like a strap to go with it. Wish they sold it with it. Good Product.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless by Eric Blehm is a heart-wrenching story of one amazing man's life and the legacy he left behind.  Adam Brown was truly fearless.  And it cost him his life.  Adam was a Navy Seal Team SIX member, but there's way more to his life than just his military status and how he became a Seal.  Through numerous interviews with Adam's friends and family members Eric Blehm paints a wonderful picture of the life that Adam lived; his struggles and achievements and how God redeemed them for His glory.<br /><br />Growing up, Adam was fearless.  He was competitive and when he set his sights on something, he didn't stop until he achieved it.  However, after graduation, and when his friends moved away to college, Adam struggled to find his purpose in life.  He started hanging around the wrong crowd and became heavily involved in drugs.  After numerous run-ins with the law and, after a tough love decision by his parents, he found himself sitting in a jail cell with the weight of his reality sitting on his shoulders. It was in that jail cell where he surrendered his heart and life to Jesus.  His struggles with his addiction were far from gone at that point, however his decision to join the Navy started him on the right path once again.  Through dedication and determination and various injuries, Adam found himself on the Navy Seals Team SIX, where he was highly respected by everyone who knew him.<br /><br />Adam Brown lived a courageous life and left an incredible legacy behind.  I am very thankful for this book because without it, I would probably never have had the opportunity to learn who this man from Hot Springs, Arkansas was and about the life that he lived.  It certainly has made me reevaluate my life and what sort of legacy I will leave behind.<br /><br />*I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for this honest review.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|It's so full of action and plays on the idea of a totalitarian society as what the world has to look forward to. This is all done with good humor. A simple movie with good effects. Seller was there with the product quickly
B008Y76A5A|4.0|The plot is not original and was part of a bunch of movies that came out with the same plot.<br /><br />However, this is original in one aspect, the stars have chemistry and talent.  And great writing, the dialog is perfect.<br /><br />I never thought I would watch a Justin Timberlake movie.. seriously, but my daughter made me do it, and I am glad she did.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Another great book about the Navy Seals and how they fought for our freedom!!<br />This is a must read and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did...
B00846REIS|3.0|I bought this book after reading the 50 shades series. Had a difficult time focusing with the story line. Still didnt finish reading it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best of the three because it was a happier ending than the first two were leading me to believe.  Hard to believe though that someone could change that much from such deviant behavior.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book!!!! I felt this was the best book of all 3.  I'm not one to read novels but I'm waiting for book 4!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I would recommend all three books, but make sure to read all three.  This book is very dark and it's hard to believe that there are really people like this who get enjoyment from pain, but I guess there are.  I liked the storyline.  I became an avid reader so I could find out what happened next.
030758836X|4.0|If you like psycholgical suspense thrillers, this book is for you. It is nearly as good as [[ASIN:1475937148 Lady Lawbreaker]], a highly suspenseful book itself.<br /><br />Okay, Let's begin. In this story:<br /><br />1. Amy is Married to Nick.<br />2. It is a special time in their lives because it's their 5th Anniversary.<br />3. It appears like a happy marriage . . .<br />4. BUT . . . just when you think everything is going well . . .<br />5. AMY DISAPPEARS!<br />6. What happened? The house is a total wreck . . .<br />7. It looks like there was a violent struggle . . . makes you wonder . . .<br />8. Does Nick know something? Surely he must . . . if you believe the evidence . . . in fact . . .<br />9. DID NICK KILL AMY?<br />10. The town folk think he did.<br />11. His sister even thinks he did . . .<br />12  WAIT . . . it's too early to tell . . . but it's got you thinking, wondering . . . FEARING<br />13. Nick says he's inocent . . . BUT . . .<br />14. HE LIED TO THE POLICE.<br />15. Doesn't mean he did it, but it still makes you pause . . .<br />16. Days pass . . . WEEKS pass . . . but Amy's still gone.<br />17. Is she dead? Is she playing a sick joke? Or did Nick kill her?<br />18. You'll just have to read and find out, if you care to know.<br /><br />If you liked this book, or books like this, then you'll love [[ASIN:1475937148 Lady Lawbreaker]]. There's more suspense, action, and intrigue in that book.<br /><br />Still, this is worth it's weight if you're a big psyche thriller fan.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kids have a blast with this game. Its full of action and never dull.We had a hard time getting it to install and run,but once we got it to run,it is lots of fun. It doesn't appear to use a lot of battery life and definitely an action game.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this easy to read interesting but strange novel. I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to see the movie!
B009ME47H2|5.0|Works perfectly for what I need it for.  Ppl who say it's too quiet aren't using their mouths properly. Ppl who say it doesn't work aren't using their thumbs properly.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|First of all, the movie looks great streaming to my TV (rented the standard def version).  Originally, I didn't think I'd have much to lose, except my valuable time, if the other reviewers who panned the movie were right.  I liked Aliens I and II (III horrible, AvP eh), and so convinced myself I should watch this.<br /><br />Yes, the characters are pretty flat and not at all interesting to follow.  Mostly standard hollywood portrayals.  The robot is the only interesting character to watch.<br /><br />The plot is okay, and what I found most fascinating was how they made the Engineers to be very humanoid.  I braced myself for a lot of stupidity from the crew based on the previous reviewers comments.  Yeah, they were dumb in many respects, but the movie ended up not being as bad as I thought it would.  With such blase and stereotypical characters, it was hard to expect them to deviate from their expected roles.<br /><br />Maybe think of it as more an action scifi film, and suspend a healthy amount of disbelief --> then you'll be good to go.  Otherwise, you're probably better off just spending the time doing some household chores.<br /><br />Did anyone else the spaceship had a lot of similar characteristics to Firefly's Serenity?
1616550414|5.0|The book came in excellent condition. It has a great deal of color and detail. Every page is worth the price of the book and more so. If you are a fan of the Legend of Zelda series, don't miss out on this amazing art book, detailed explanation of the series, concept designs and more.
0425252868|5.0|A compelling story of two enemy pilots during WWII.  When I finished the book I felt that I knew each man personally, wish I had an opportunity to meet them.  Besides being a great  read, I personally found it very informative.  On page 316, in a little aside to the main story, we were introduced to Col. Trautloft who told the pilots that he had heard stories of the \\"camps\\" and wanted to investigate.  When visiting Buchenwald he was approached by an inmate who identified himself as one of 168 Allied airman inmates.  The Gestapo and SS had labeled them as \\"terror fliers\\", the equivalent of spies, and sent them to Buchenwald instead of an Air Force run POW camp.  Col. Trautloft was able to rescue them, seven days before their scheduled execution by the SS, and arrange their transfer to a POW camp.  My father was one of the 168.  I have heard and read about the Luftwaffe officer who save the 168, now I know his name. Thanks Col Trautloft and thanks Adam.  Another good read is [[ASIN:0805057536 In the Shadows of War: An American Pilot's Odyssey Through Occupied France and the Camps of Nazi Germany]]\\" by Thomas Childers, the story of Roy Allen, an American bomber pilot.  Roy was one of the 168 at Buchenwald, and a good friend of my father.

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban is my favorite singer.  I own every CD he has ever made.  His song choices allowed me into a musical world I didn't know existed.  I was never a fan of classical music until Josh came on the scene.  He's the best in that I have never been disappointed or regretted spending money on adding Josh's CD's to my collection.  I always find at least two of Josh's CD's in my CD changer in my car.  I enjoy his music so much especially when I am on the road.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was great until the last few chapters. It seems like either the author got sick of the story, or the publisher rushed the deadline or something. I got no closure at all from the ending of this trilogy. Kind of disappointed.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Great songstress. Excellent song choices. Loved eveything about the CD with no exceptions.  This CD will become one of my favorite CD to play in my CD player in my car.
B00000258J|5.0|Nothing can be said to equally appreciate music of Muddy Waters. This is something different, it was very new when it emerged, aggressive, revolutionary and influential on generations of future Blues and rock artists. It is the music when saying \\"Muddy Waters\\" is enough to understand we are dealing with something extraordinary. Muddy Waters is not a Blues legend only, it became a brand name for this kind of Blues.<br /><br />During seventees Muddy was at the height of fame recording six Grammy winning albums including Hard Again. The album consists of nine songs, mainly of 60s material but remade to a more modern sound (Johnny Winter's contribution to this is invaluable. Album is also produced by Winter). Classics like \\"Mannish Boy\\" and \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\" are as solid as lesser known \\"Deep Down In Florida\\" and \\"Crooseyed Cat\\" where Muddy seems to be in attempts of discovering new ways and directions, achieving success to an affordable extent. Classic of Blues recording.<br /><br />It would be extremely unfair to say nothing about the band. Muddy's long-time collaborators and friends are at a stand. Each of them contributes a lot to the highest quality of the recording. Two members of the band, James Cotton and Pinetop Perkins, received their Grammy awards later while all members except Charles Calmese are recording artists on their own.<br /><br />Personnel: Muddy Waters (vocals, guitar); Johnny Winter (guitar); James Cotton (harmonica); Charles Calmese (bass instrument); Bob Margolin (guitar); Pinetop Perkins (piano); Willie \\"Big Eyes\\" Smith (drums).<br /><br />pastblues.com

B005DESVPO|3.0|Proclaimed savior of Blues, Gary Clark, Jr. who is raised under the wing of Austin music scene luminaries like Jimmie Vaughan and promoter Clifford Antone, puts efforts on 2011 album to present listener the modern Blues.<br /><br />Consisting of just four songs The Bright Lights EP represents two rock infused Blues tunes (\\"Bright Lights\\", \\"Don't Owe You A Thing\\") and two solo acoustic songs, gentle R&B number \\"Things Are Changin'\\" and probably the culmination of the work, \\"When My Train Pulls In\\", falsetto voiced guitar equilibristic of highest class, prolonged and trenching with repeated riffs where catching of Blues essence is really hard but possible.

0786715103|5.0|It has been many years since I read this book but I will never forget it.  It is a difficult book to read.  It should be recommended reading for mature teens.  We all know that youth is the engine of the world and only the young can help change the future.  Knowing that this happened within my lifetime is yet another reminder that given the right driver a mob mentality can be stoked with the most horrendous of results.  Eternal vigilence is required.<br />Thank you General Dallaire for your courage.
B0074EIQUG|4.0|New Orleans' own Dr. John is best known for his swampy style New Orleans R&B being recipient of Grammy award among other accolades.<br /><br />Locked Down, his 2012 release is an experimental work which distanced from what was core of his music, rooted deeply in New Orleans. This voodoo funky, Afrobeat album produced by Black Keys Dan Auerbach make you explore new Dr. John. Horn section, backing vocals and, of course, trademark piano all is here delivered in a new, retro-modern style.<br /><br />Dr. John was courageous enough to undertake experiments at age 71 and he did it. Great stuff.<br /><br />pastblues.com

B00000JTB2|5.0|One of the finest jams in Blues history took place on December the 12th of 1983 in Hamilton, Ontario, when great Albert King crossed axe with still young Stevie Ray Vaughan. Result was fantastic: music that would never die. Nobody could imagine such an inspired album by two idiosyncratic bluesmen.<br /><br />Album consists of seven tracks and four short conversations with admonitions by Albert King, recollection of late Blues artists like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin as well as B.B. King etc., but the main thing is music here. They play the Blues from the heart, from the bones and blood, they play like they do it last time.<br /><br />One guitar solo follows another and it goes on and does not stop and artists get enormous pleasure (better notable on DVD) and try to share with listener what they get. Albert King follows young Stevie in his burning deal (which did not characterize great Albert) and does with his guitar things he's never done before and the alumni, on his own, delivers fiery Blues he was so accustomed with. Although album is credited to Albert King mostly, Stevie Ray has a lion's share in its success as well.<br /><br />Every touch of the strings on this album is magic. Nothing to compare with.<br /><br />Personnel: Albert King, Stevie Ray Vaughan (vocals, guitar); Tony Llorens (piano, organ); Gus Thornton (bass); Michael Llorens (drums).<br /><br />pastblues.com

B001EOOQF6|5.0|Mob Rules came out a year after the magnificent Heaven And Hell in October 1981. Simply one of the best moments in the whole Sabbath output, the album creates an aura, a mood which is just monumental. It just doesn't get better than this for Sabbath or nearly any band really. Mob Rules is up there with the very best stuff they've come up with.<br /><br />Got the Rhino reissue, had the Castle one. Both are great but I must say the sound on the Rhino release might be stronger with more punch. That said, whichever version you pick will blow you away... over and over and over... again!!!
1616550414|5.0|Best thing I bought that is a book or literature type.<br />It does answer some of the most asked questions. i.e. Chronological order of the Zelda's and how they are connected.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|excellent..I have watched it four times and it was shipped promptly and without problems.  Nothing more I can say about this
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I would have never thought a free app would work so well! Keeping an eye on the battery life on my kindle fire hd has never been so easy. I'm very happy with this app!
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Kindle Fire: I've tried many to-do apps before and I've never really found one I liked (apart from teux-deux). But I've found great use for this app, especially due to its ability to create multiple themes to-do lists, make subtasks and all the extra functionality it includes, without being hard or clunky to use. That's really quite a feat.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book has a unique honesty. It reminded me a lot of being young and felling infinite. If you are a child of the 80s or early 90s this will strike a deep chord within you. Worth the read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved it. The storyline was very different which was a refreshing change. I found when reading the second half I just couldn't put it down. I had never heard of the author but seeing as there was such great reviews I thought I would read it. Thanks for a great read Colleen.
0385536828|4.0|What a great read Ian McEwan's latest novel is, spies and love set in a time of political turmoil in the early seventies. A period I was able to empathise well with as I was working myself during the three day week. From the first page you know the outcome of the story, but there is still a secret to be discovered,  McEwan is uses his characters brilliantly in this novel to tell us just how MI5 prompted the cultural cold war.<br /><br />'Sweet Tooth' is narrated by the female heroine of the novel  Serena Frome, the daughter of an Anglican bishop, who during her final year at Cambridge studying for a maths degree, has an affair with an older man.  Not such an unusual occurrence but she later discovers that thanks to her lover she was being groomed for a career in the intelligence services, her intelligence and beauty making her the perfect spy!  The world is divided by 'The Cold War' and the government of the time wants to give financial but secret aid to promising young writers that will boost the anti - communist propaganda.<br />Serena as an avid reader is seen as the perfect choice to be sent on a secret mission, code named 'Sweet Tooth' to infiltrate herself into the literary circle of a promising young writer, Tom Haley. Her task is to gauge his suitability for such financial aid. Serena discovers that at first she loves Tom's writing and of course approves him, however she had not reckoned on falling in love with him.  What will she do, whom can she trust and will she be able to keep her secret life from the man she has fallen for?<br /><br />Once again another brilliant novel from Ian McEwan, a clever and ingenious story with plenty of intrigue, that will satisfy his fans  and maybe attract new ones. Do give it a try.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a breath-taking, thriller that will keep you reading till you're done! Mystery and suspense will make sure you don't put the book down till it is completely over!
B004ODLUF8|5.0|I ordered this for my classroom and the students are always amazed at the footage included.  It makes them all want to be astronauts!
B0079XNWQA|2.0|It only had one decent song on it. Waste of money.  He has talent but he sings really dumb songs
B003ODIZL6|2.0|Good book but dislike having to flip or scroll over so many pages might as well us the internet where you can search.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I can't wait on the fourth book House of Hades.  I like how the author continues to build up the suspense.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book deserves a million stars, but that's not an option on this device. ;)<br /><br />But in all seriousness, this book made me laugh and cry and is just pure perfection. John Green has captured my heart yet again with his amazing writing. He created perfect characters with such unique personalities and perspectives on life that you don't see much anymore. It was refreshing. No one knows how much I hate John Green for just ripping my heart and then backing over it with a heavy truck. (Joking! Obviously!)<br /><br />This book is worth all of your money and I'm not going to spoil it. All I can say is that it is pure perfection. It's an awesome book with ideas and views on cancer that not a lot of authors have captured. Definitely a must read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Yes, everything is post apocalyptic these days, but Wool is far more subtle and insidious than most. Reminiscent of the best moments in The Passage combined with the creepiness of Kubrick's The Shining, it's a great read
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Far too much gratuitous Anglo Saxon cursing.  Words were the F and S, completely unnecessary.  I doubt Astronauts actually use them, at least routinely especially when being recorded.  The last sequence of such usage was ridiculous.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I never thought I would like this show, then one day I couldn't find anything else to watch... and *WHAM!*  Worse than any drug, I'm just that addicted.  Love the characters, the suspense, and the way the writers keep us baited - well, that last part is &#34;love/hate&#34; - I mean, come on!  Reveal something already!  :)  When something is revealed - or you think it is - then the twists and turns that sometimes follow are what keep me coming back for more.  Haven't read the books, so I don't know how closely the tv series follows their plots, but can't get enough of PLL!
B0067R0APK|5.0|loved the app. one of the few that I've willingly paid for after using it for awhile. it has come in handy quite a few times during terrible weather. recommended!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Will this movie win an Oscar or other critically acclaimed prize?  Probably not-so-much - but it won me over within the first few minutes.  It has moments where it is quite charming (love the cup scene), entertaining (singing and comedic talent abound), and every time I watch it (yes, I have watched it multiple times) I find a new one-liner I missed during a previous viewing (Acca-what?!?  Acca-believe it!).  A little risque here and there, but far from raunchy, not a lot of bad language or hot-and-heavy sex-capades, so you won't be embarrassed to watch it with a parent or teenager.  Love that it has those subtle moments - and one of these days I'm going to watch it with the captions so I can tell what the heck that one girl is saying because I can only hear a couple of her lines.  :)
B00AP6XJVQ|5.0|Rumer is a wonderful singer and she approaches these songs with great sensitivity. A must have for anyone with ears!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This is an interesting theory, and well-told, but I think the flaw in the book was that by the end it seemed the author was trying to convince you to join him in his theory--a &#34;persuasive essay,&#34; I think my third-grade teacher used to call this technique--and, well, unless you've had your own near-death experience, I think it is pretty hard for people living in the here and now to really reach a conclusion for themselves on this topic one way or the other. Dr. Alexander should have just left this as his story and let people draw their own conclusions from it--which he does well up until right about the end of the book--rather than trying to use his book as a &#34;proof,&#34; which by its very nature is a way of solving a problem and then explaining the theory behind that solution to others. I'm not sure the afterlife should be posed as a problem to be solved and then explained to the 'unenlightened masses' who have not had their own near-death experience, and even if you do try and explain it, I don't think that people have the ability to grasp the enormity of contact with something so far outside their everyday lived experience unless they themselves are already out of their comfort zone and open to new experiences.

B007REV4T8|2.0|... DINGY, DRUMMING, DESPERATE DEPARTURE FROM WHAT WAS DELICIOUS BEFORE . . . Just to be Different from James Bond's funny, sexy, thrilling action through - what? - all the various 'Bond, James Bond's? Remember the scenes, characterizations, lines, brightnesses you smirked at through those prior Bond years? The ones you mimicked to friends, droll-ing audacious one-liners (Shocking), suggestive character names (Pussy Galore, where'd you go!) and reveling in evil caricatures of over-the-top villian's who made blood and mayhem such fun. Believability was never an issue.<br /><br />Are today's jaded/cynical movie audiences moving to The Darkside? We should've seen this coming. The gradual steps; Daniel Craig  got pounded bloody regularly. Connery never even got bruised; Broslin was never mussed. Moore even less. (By the way, Craig as Bond is real, really great.<br /><br />But'way over-the-edge vicious torture, mutilated tuxedos,<br />trashed, cremated Aston Martins? Too much gory fun.<br /><br />Heard of media desensitizing audiences? Graphic butchering,<br />blood baths? What next? Whole families being vivisected?<br /><br />A thought: Maybe in future Bond films M's gone, replaced by two gadget<br />queens, 'S&M'?. Sadie and Lota Mutilation? A possibility: Hanna Lector!<br /><br />Oh: One bright spot: I sure like the opening graphics, with all the past<br />Bond's shooting into some baddie's gun's bloody bore. Look for it.<br />(Without that I'd only toss in one star)
B002LANLDK|5.0|I love all the people that play in this movie. Another one of those movies i would watch over and over again. I hope the next ones are great. hopefully they want make a bad one. But this movie is a really good movie.

B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Dave Grohl is first and foremost a musician. Oh, he can direct, produce, and maybe even act, but at the core of his being is a man who loves and respects the making & recording of rock and roll. When you put your life's passion into your work, the result is always going to be worthwhile. Just see it: get all misty eyed about Ratt & Dio, and a little breathless when a well preserved Rick Springfield shows up and BRINGS IT in the studio with the Foos. And that's just a little peek--I don't want to give all the awesomeness away. Best $6.99 I ever spent.

B00756GKBA|5.0|I think MDNA is one of Madonna's greatest albums, well at least its one of my favorites. The dance songs have really edgy sound to them. Let me review each song from my own point of view.<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild: Great dance song, it just literally puts you in a trance and almost forces you to dance along. Though I don't get why people are only judging MDNA by this song only, there are plenty of better tracks.<br /><br />Gang Bang: Its a pretty cool song, it sort of tells a story, which we haven't heard songs now-a-days do in a long time. The song is rather controversial though, however I still like it.<br /><br />Im Addicted: Terrific Dance song, definitely one of my favorite songs on the album, the whole song just sounds amazing.<br /><br />Turn Up the Radio: Pretty good song, has somewhat of an 80s pop vibe, just talks about becoming free and letting the music sweep you off your feet.<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin': I do honestly like this song, its catchy, and has a nice sound to it. What gets me mad is people are only judging MDNA by this song also, when there are plenty of other tracks worth listening to.<br /><br />Some Girls: One of my favorite songs from her in general, I love the sound, the lyrics, and simply everything about it. I just get some sort of connection with the song.<br /><br />Superstar: Not my favorite song on the album, but its okay. Its not a song I listen to, but the song was written to her daughter (Who also sings backup on this track). Another song she wrote towards her daughter was Little Star from the album Ray of Light. Not really fond of that song either, but both have a really nice calm feeling to them.<br /><br />I Don't Give A: Honestly I love this song. It has a really nice, hardcore \\"I dont give a f***\\" feeling to it. What I really like is that Nicki Minaj is also in the track. I got MDNA and Roman Reloaded the same day, so when I heard Nicki's verse on the song I was shocked and happy I got an extra bit of her when it comes to music.<br /><br />I'm A Sinner: Its a great dance track, but its not for me. As much as I love Madonna, I am not entirely fond of when she puts controversy in music. I listened to the entire song, and I mean it sounds good, but the lyrics just make me want to stay away from it. Thats just me however lol.<br /><br />Love Spent: Pretty good song, but nothing to special about it. I do think its a pretty good dance track though.<br /><br />Masterpiece: This is one of the songs people needed to hear, before they judged the entire MDNA album. The song is really poetic, clean, original, which is probably why Madonna won a Golden Globe for this song.<br /><br />Falling Free: Definitely one of my new all time favorites from her. The song is so smooth, so relaxing, and extremely poetic. This song should have really been released as a single, then people wouldn't had said some of the bad things about MDNA like they have.<br /><br />Beautiful Killer: Great pop song, should have been released as a single instead of Gimme All your Luvin' or Girl Gone Wild instead in my opinion. The song is kind of a throw back, sounds more like a song she would have done in the early 2000's, which is why I love that song, she goes back to some of her roots.<br /><br />I F****d Up: When I saw the track name I thought the song was really just going to be pointless, and I didn't like the song at all till I heard all of it. The song is really poetic, its just talking about messing up in a relationship, and how we just all regret things.<br /><br />B-Day song: I don't get why people are judging this song so much. This is just one of those Madonna songs that she just had fun with, its not a song that's suppose to have a meaning to it. Kinda like Cry Baby on her album I'm Breathless, that's just a silly song she was playing with, which is why I like both songs. They show small bits of Madonnas Sense of Humor.<br /><br />Best Friend: Amazing song, almost depresses me, considering me and one of my best friends aren't so close anymore. The song is great though.<br /><br />Overall I think MDNA is great, its just Madonna didn't really release that many good songs as singles. Sort of like American Life, that was a great album, but the singles were not that great. MDNA is a great album, if you actually take a chance and listen to some of the songs that aren't only singles. What also gets me mad is people are saying Madonna is not the Queen of Pop anymore because this album was a flop. First of all, this album broke an iTunes record of most #1 pre-ordered album, and also, does it even matter if this album was a flop? A lot of good music is underrated, and does not get the attention it should. To me MDNA is an underrated album like American Life, and I think its great. It doesn't matter how many copies she sold, music is music, its not a competition. I still love Madonna and cant wait for her to drop another album.
B004N44SOI|5.0|i wish i did not have to fill this part out it work and it worked good w t f
B00008S2VG|4.0|I honestly think this album is great. The thing I don't get is why critics tore up the entire album to shreds. Madonna released Die Another Day, American Life, Hollywood, and Love Profusion as singles. People, and radio stations instantly fell in love with Die Another Day, I mean who wouldn't right? But things went down hill after American Life and Hollywood were released. Though I like both of those songs, I have to admit they are really controversial, so I don't blame people for not really liking the tracks. Madonna did release Love Profusion, which is a simply an amazing ballad, but Radios didn't want to take a chance on playing it, thinking it was also Controversial.<br />What gets me mad is Critics saying the ENTIRE album is bad. I admit, the singles may not have been that great, but at least take a deeper look into the album instead of judging the singles. People said Madonna lost her touch and creativity, and saying she couldn't write good songs anymore. I strongly disagree. If people really even listened to songs like Love Profusion, Nobody Knows Me, Nothing Fails, Intervention, and X-Static Process, they would have seen how lyrical she can actually be. Honestly there are some lyrics in the songs that really get to me, let me quote a few.<br /><br />\\"You can take all this, take it away, but I'd still have it all, cause I climbed the Tree of Life, and that is why, I'm no longer scared if I fall\\"-Nothing Fails<br /><br />\\"I always wished that I could find, someone as beautiful as you, but in the process I forgot, that I was special too. I always wished that I could find, someone as talented as you, but in the process I forgot, that I was just as good as you\\"-X-Static Process<br /><br />\\"And I know, that love, will change us forever, and I know, that love, will keep us together\\"-Intervention (A song written about her son)<br /><br />I honestly think this is Madonnas most Lyrical and poetic album aside from Ray Of Light of Course. Though I admit, the whole entire album is very controversial, so if you dislike Madonna because of her controversy, but are interested in getting one of her albums, I really suggest getting Ray of Light instead. Though the controversy is in a much deeper level. She does make a few references about Jesus, but she is using it as an example to show how when you get older everything changes. Which is basically what the whole album is about.<br /><br />What I don't really understand is how Madonna went from Ray of Light, then in a couple of years she made American Life. Ray of Light was all about finding your freedom, letting go of your hate, setting yourself free, and becoming who you really are. American Life is somewhat the opposite, talking about how hard your life can be and how everything is not peachy keen. Don't get me wrong I love both albums, its just its just kind of a drastic change between the 2 albums. Overall I do think this album is great, you just have to dig in deep to view what she is talking about, which is what I like, the album has different interpretations of the lyrics.
034580404X|5.0|Great series so far....pleasantly surprised that there was an actual story line and that it was actually good.  Would recommend.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|My sister would sometimes listen to Kylie Minogue when I was little, so I kinda grew a fondness for Kylie Minogue. This is my first Kylie Album, and I think its really amazing. The whole album is dance tracks, though each song is really well spread out. Though I wish the songs were longer length, the album is great. The thing I love about this album is even though the whole album is dance songs, they have a really nice feeling of joy and solitude when you hear them. The songs really sound like remastered 1980's pop songs, because the 1980's was simply all about happiness and getting on the dance floor when it came to pop music. That's why I like this album so much, she reinvented that feeling of joy when it comes to pop.<br />Also, I recommend Confessions On a Dance Floor by Madonna (My favorite album from her). That's also a really nice dance album, it almost sounds like Aphrodite, but Madonna was really trying to reinvent Disco with that album, so they aren't exactly alike. I suggest both albums to whoever really loves dance music. :)
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is probably a classic now... Excellent story, excellent characters, excellent acting - excellent message. If you haven't seen it, do.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I remember owning this book as a kid and starting to read it more than once but never finishing it. After seeing it free for kindle, downloading it, and letting it sit in my collection for a month or so I finally got around to reading. I am so glad I have done so. I loved every page of this novel from start to finish and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a thrilling tale of piracy, discovery, and treasure. Treasure island goes down as one of my all time favorite books

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this series of books! This one didn't seem as 'together' as the other two, but it was still a good read.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book has some powerful content but it is hard to get through.  It is long.  It is hard to understand and requires a dictionary.  Knowing a little of the French language helps.  So is some knowledge of the French revolution.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book but it's not my favorite though. It was a really good read I can't wait to read Mockingjay!!!!
B000063DW9|3.0|as well. I expect better cover and sleeve quality when I buy a new piece of vinyl. Not that I am planning to sell it, but I do not see this piece of vinyl gaining any future value due to these imperfections.

B00846F1YW|5.0|Love the game. Different levels of difficulty make it challenging. Fun very addictive. Can't wait to get more from this company.

0385342063|4.0|If you really like her other books, you'll like this one, especially if you like shopaholic. But it's not as good as shopaholic, because there's no Luke, no funny family, and no shopping. It's still a really cute book though that's worth reading.
0385341008|5.0|The title of this book probably never would have prompted me to grab it to read.  It was recommended to me, and I am so glad.  It was thoroughly engaging, and makes me long for the days of letter writing!
B000JLQSW4|4.0|Product came quickly with no damage. Not bad for being a used product. I would shop with this provider again.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Excelente para el iphone, las patas pueden extenderse aunque no mucho, sin embargo el soporte de iphone puede quitarse y montarse en otro tripie mas alto.
B004OR199G|5.0|Awesome, wonderful and very informative book. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to feel better about themselves and their diet.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great character development, great special effects, and fantastic writing.  No one character is cut and dry good or bad.  It really makes you think about how you would handle the situations that they are thrown into.  This show has basically consumed my whole train of thought..thanks a lot AMC.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Returned it as soon as I took it out of the box it was made so cheaply.  This company should be embarresed to sell this for the price.  I would never recommend this product to anyone.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Wanted this DVD for my collection - intend to buy each season as they become available - peak interest on this show.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This Movie is absolutely great holiday fun but it is even better in 3D at home. We recently purchased a 3D TV and I was very suspect about home 3D but movies like this have nade a believer out of me. Great fun for everyone and the effects are awesone.
0060254920|5.0|The artwork is a delight as is the story itself.  If you are old and have forgotten the joys of childhood, share this story with a kid.
B005VR92LU|5.0|Love it OMG, ok first 1/2 of side was just alright. the rest of the record was smokin. jazz blues does it get any better?
B004HZYHGM|5.0|I've never actually read the story before. I have seen various versions of it on TV. One with Mr. Mcgoo. But I'm glad I finally read it. Many stories are written so that the reader knows the outcome half way through the book. But this story isn't one of those. There are so many twists and turns in the story, you don't know what's going to happen to Long John Silver until the end. Jim Hawkins is an amazing hero, and one of the big reasons this book is so special. If you like adventure stories, you'll love this one.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|While it is nice that the app can locate the Kindle location, I was really disappointed that I could not access more maps from the app.  The basic weather information is nice, but  I like accessing the &#34;Current Weather&#34; map to get an idea of what may actually be coming my way.  If it would offer more choices I'd be more impressed.  There are some options in the settings, but I can't say I was really impressed with the selection.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Smallville is awesome. I love the take on Superman. I still wish that they had just called him Superman...the Red Blue Blur was kind of a dumb name.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|This is beautiful in Blu Ray! What a wonderful season, as usual Matt Smith is brilliant and hilarious.<br />This season really is one to watch over and over again.<br />Smith is my favorite doctor , but that is because he makes me laugh and has so much personality. Also helps that he is so cute.
0938045768|3.0|I like the info in this book.  It focuses on the 6 body weight moves, pushups, pullups, bridges, squats, handstand pushups, and leg rasies.  I'm starting the program now, I will give feedback after a few months.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|What a wonderful series. Of course, season 3 has more to offer than ever!<br />Shirley Mcclaine is wonderful as the annoying American mother who puts down the British at every point. The tension between her and Maggie Smith is hilarious.<br />As usual, Maggie is clever and makes the best comments.<br />This season is quite tragic, so prepare yourself. I don't think I've cried more in a series than I have on this one. I know why, because we have come to love the family and Downton Abbey itself.
B00A3K2PZA|5.0|This is one great movie.  Great director (William Friedkin), Top notch acting, and a hilarious story line.  Not for children, but most adults will love it.
B00ADS98FC|3.0|A little too much singing for me. It is a decent movie, but it got really annoying after a while with all the singing. If you like musicals, this is the movie for you.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a very great book. It reminds me of the book out of my mind. Overall, this book was truly amazing
B008HK3XU4|5.0|love the color very vibrant love how it protects my kindle fire. I like the way it doesnt have magnets but has a rubber band to hold it closed
B007IX383I|5.0|i've just came across this band and began to listen to their music, including some of the older doomier metal releases, which i like, but have to listen to in doses.  this album however is more accessible to me and very beautiful in it's structure.  i'm listening to it now and it doesn't even seem like the same band, not that it's a bad thing, just different.  from what i've read about this band their style seems to change from album to album, and from the little bit of listening that i've done that seems to be accurate.  but this album is mesmerizing to say the least.  so far i really like the track untouchable pt. 2 and well, all the others that i've heard too.  can't really say anything bad about this release.  recently i've came across a few band that i'm really enjoying like pineapple thief and the irish band the frames. if you get the chance to listen to pineapple thief's all the wars album do so as well. i'm glad to welcome anathema into my listening rotation and look forward to future releases.  as to how to sell someone on buying this album, i can't really put that to words, especially when the music alone speaks for itself, that and i'm not the die hard fan that most of these reviewers are.  at least now i can count myself a fan of this wonderful band.  the female vocals are very beautiful, almost angelic.  again, can't say anything bad, and if i could i wouldn't have bothered writing this little segment.  best thing i can say to perhaps persuade someone to buy this album would be that if you are looking for something touching, atmospheric and soaring, you can't go wrong here.  this is one great album.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|There is a plethora of good, old-school country stations on TuneIn.  It is disappointing to see that your favorite radio station has the same playlist as every other station in the same genre due to the network.  Kind of like Clear Channel Radio.
0439023513|5.0|The series sucks you in and keeps you wanting more until the very end! Each book is an awesome read.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I use this app waaaaaay too much, you can ask my wife if you don't believe me.  God bless America.
0345803485|5.0|Loved it! The whole series was read in about two weeks. It is definitely worth buying all three in the series!
B0072440OE|5.0|I received the album in a short period of time. It did have a one corner of the album kinked in but other than that it was one of my favorite albums.
0439023491|5.0|The series sucks you in and keeps you wanting more until the very end! Each book is an awesome read.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is my second Colleen Hoover book (first was Hopeless).  A different story but still written with much emotion and passion with love, loss, strength, and courage.  I do feel a little awkward with the setting of the story between a teacher and a student. I wished it was a college student and professor. Although their ages were close and she was of age, I wasn't comfortable with. Overall the read was beautiful and the poetry was stimulating. I rate a 4.5.
0439023521|5.0|The series sucks you in and keeps you wanting more until the very end! Each book is an awesome read.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was an amazing  read had me crying at some points and so worried about what the end of the book would bring<br /> Great read, recommended to those people who love sweet, amazing love stories.
B007SGM084|5.0|David didn't read these books. I did, his wife, Misty. I loved every minute and hope E L has much more to come. 5 stars from me.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Couldn't put if down after I started. America lost a great warrior, on and off the battlefield. May Chris' children grow up knowing just how much a hero their father was. A great tribute to a great SEAL.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|There are endless good praises about this book, by  I am going to keep it short and sweet. AMAZINGLY CRAFTED, GENIUS, THRILLING, KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES sort of book. WELL DONE!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This was by far my favorite movie of 2012, which is saying a lot when there were so many other greats (check out Dark Knight Rises, Lawless, The Avengers, Ted). I've NEVER paid to see a movie twice in theaters, yet I did for this one. Movies are different, so I won't say it's the best movie of 2012, but it was definitely the most entertaining. Nearly 3 hours long and there's not one boring moment through the entire thing, which is a remarkable feat in my opinion. Most movies that long have to have slow parts to develop the story or characters, which isn't bad. Yet 'Django Unchained' was able to do that effortlessly without skipping a beat. It's FULL of action, adventure, & comedy- even with the true base story on romance.<br /><br />I initially heard some complaints of the use of the 'N' word, but that's just something I found more surprising about this movie. That the massive use of the word didn't bother me (it usually does). The movie just takes you back into the time and place & desensitizes you to the word, like it's just any other normal curse word. It probably also helped that Jamie Fox & Samuel Jackson used the word just as much as anyone else. As well, the violence & gore is almost comical at times. It's a MOVIE. A GREAT ONE.<br /><br />I'm not even a big Tarantino fan, but this is his best since Pulp Fiction in my opinion. I can't say I was surprised it was going to be good either. I was already excited for it, and knew it'd be good with great actors like Jamie Foxx & Leonardo DiCaprio in it... I just didn't realize how good :)
1423140605|5.0|Annabeth is always the leader of the quests. Fearless, strong, unnerved, and always ready for battle. But when her mother, Athena, appears to her on a bus with a demand, she feels like her world and her sanity is collapsing around her. Her mother gives her a small coin and a prophecy known to kill: \\"Follow the Mark of Athena. Avenge me.\\"<br /><br />Annabeth is terrified and scared for Percy. All she wants is to have her life come back to normal. Well, as normal as a demigod's life can be...but she is nervous that Percy might have changed. What if he has changed to the Roman ways? Does he want to come back to Camp Half-blood? Does he even care? Her life is difficult enough, but to be rejected by Seaweed Brain would be the worst..<br /><br />Frank and Hazel, the two newest demigods in the series, are hauled aboard the Argo II after a terrible mishap, and set off with the five Greeks in a hazardous journey across the seas to Rome where Annabeth must face every child of Athena's worst fear...along the way the meet new gods and creatures and of course, fighting Gaea every step of the way.<br /><br />Riorden has done an amazing job again. I had been waiting for the moment for the Romans to meet the Greeks. That was definitely my favorite part. His talents in writing made the book come alive, and it's almost as if I am in this alternative reality with the demigods. I love his sense of humor and knowledge of Greek myths. And, like the books before it, this one ends in a literal cliffhanger...<br /><br />I can't recommend this book and the series enough.
0316069434|3.0|I have been reading Harry Bosch books for a long time, and this was just not one of the better ones.  It started off great - held my interest, good plot set-up.... all the hallmarks of a good Connelly book.  Mid-way, it just started dragging; seemed like a rote plot from another book.  Get this one from the library or buy on the Kindle, but it's not worth hardback price.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|Everyone should know who this guy is!  He is awesome and if you don't have the first album, I suggest you get it too!!!  Can't wait to see him live!!!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is a fun and easy to use puzzle that becomes more challenging as you progress through the stages.  Nice graphics and you can play against a timer or take the easy no stress route.<br />I have this loaded on my Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and play this when outside for my lunch break.  My co-workers love the game and we all gather around to take turns playing on my tablet.  Fun.<br /><br />Ok for all ages and the colors and graphics are terrific.  Thanks Amazon for a free App!
B000002HO3|5.0|Simply Red is one of the timeless classic groups that consistently provides hits that you always wonder why you stopped listening to them.  I bought this CD a long time ago, but just listened to it again and wondered just that - it's absolutely outstanding, especially on a cold and blustery night when you're kicking back with your loved one reading books and drinking hot tea.  I remember I bought this for the song 'Holding Back the Years', but every song is outstanding!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|real fun bingo game with a twist.  for me its blitz cause of all the mini games that come with it like slotz
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I have to admit - when I went to see Django Unchained I was one of those people who thought it was going to be 'Roots'-like because of all of the critics' reviews.  When I saw Spike Lee trashing it when he hadn't even seen it thought - I had to go see it just to see what in the world all the fuss was about.  Even though I've seen and loved all of Tarantino's movies - even the movie 'Curdled' which is an ultra-gory Tarantino-produced film - I wasn't expecting Django to be anything like his other movies.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained during the almost three-hour movie.  There was never a dull moment, and while I agree with some other critics that the female presence was practically nil, you have to put into perspective that he was making a classic Spaghetti Western in the style of the original 'Django', and they often didn't have a strong female presence.<br /><br />The story was lively and engaging - kudos to Tarantino for the excellent writing - and the cinematography was crisp and well-detailed.  Tarantino didn't overdo it with goriness or action sequences in my opinion, and because the acting was top-notch across the board, it was so easy for the audience to get into the movie and stay there through the end.<br /><br />As to Spike's criticism - see the film before you open your big yap - it is not insulting to our ancestors - it is a piece of entertainment set in the time of slavery, that appropriately uses period costumes, sociology of the time and yes - language including the 'N' word to set the scenes.<br /><br />This is a film that gives me hope that one day we can distance ourselves as people of color from the stigmas and negative connotations of our histories.  Since we people of color can't seem to make movies that get us out of that 'slave mentality', I suppose we're at the mercy of others to do that for us - thankfully Tarantino has taken us a step in that direction.
B005LAJ212|5.0|The seller got the item out VERY quickly. It was packaged just as described and I thouroughly enjoyed watching the show. I couldn't get anything else done! Addicting at it's worst, genius plotting at it's best... I would recommend this product for it's viewing pleasure and would recomment the seller for their pricing and speedy service!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|We saw this in the theater in I-Max 3-D and decided to buy the movie when it came out. It's kept nephews and grandchildren mesmerized for hours. Good 3-D effects, good quality and a fun movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it! I also love the uptdate with the clouds and armour! This is a Great app for kids!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a mahjong style game, in that you match shapes in pairs while trying to beat the clock. It's a fast-paced game and a lot of fun, although the stars are maddening!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I love the movie. Sequels to original movies are usually bad but it is not the case with this one. Robert Downey Jr. was once again great as Sherlock Holmes and Jule Law was wonderful in the role of Watson. The plot was believable and it was filled with great action scenes.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my nephew. He is a talented young musician with a special interest in the classic rock genre. One of his favorite artists is Pink Floyd, and he had never seen &#34;The Wall&#34;. I got to be his favorite aunt by making this purchase, though I myself am not a fan.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I like it as much, if not more than Dexter, which I never thought possible.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!  The characters are dimensional and there is just the right amount of conflict and angst.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This was a heart book I would give this book to older kids because it's hard and bad words in it
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Other than the super sappy scene depicted on the cover of the DVD, the film is beautiful. All things death related are taboo in Japan, so it's wonderful to see a film depict the beauty in preparing bodies for viewing and cremation.The storyline was pretty predictable so it is the individual moments and dark humor that make this film worth seeing.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I laughed,I cried. It was heartfelt,honest and a great read about real life. I LOVED IT! Everyone wants there very own silver lining.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is quite addicting. I enjoy playing on my Kindle while my son is playing it on his Kindle. There's a little competition going on over here. ;-)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I totally enjoyed all three books. Now I want my husband to read them. My daughter told me about the first one and I had to see what all the fuss was about. She really knows how to tell what a woman thinks.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Need a reason to get up tomorrow morning and face the challenges of the day? Looking for inspiration to chase that dream you lost site of years ago? No, this movie is not life changing, but true stories of people overcoming daily obstacles that life throws at them, dealing with love and loss, and persevering till the end, should motivate us at least a bit shouldnt it? Jay Moriarity exceeded the &#34;bit&#34;, and this movie is a joy to watch.
0802473156|5.0|I love this book. I sped through it the first time, then reread it for a deeper understanding. And then again for personal application.<br />The way it's written is easy to understand and attention grabbing.<br />Highly recommended!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|that you love this show, deep down, if you grew up in the 80's it brings back those Sunday nights watching with you parents.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I was surprised this game was free.  It's a lot of fun and a good way to kill some time.
B001BPQT8A|5.0|Love this movie, and hard to believe anyone that says that they don't. Great package and booklet that comes with, definitely worth what I paid and more...
B0060MYM7O|5.0|this is mainly a post for the digital Copy info...or lack thereof.<br /><br />Besides the bluray disks & the double sided DVD's you get ONE code that works with itunes AND either Amazon Instant, Vudu, or Flixster (Ultraviolet).<br /><br />Note: sign up/in at Flixster/UV and then LINK your VUDU account.  This allows you to get the 1080p copy onto your PS3 and still keep it stored in the cloud that is UV/Flixster.<br /><br />I do not keep anything in Amazon's cloud (yet) but the option is there for you.<br /><br />summary: Season2 is on my apple tv [iCloud](1080p/720p), and its also in the Vudu cloud (1080p) so I can watch it on my PS3.<br /><br />sadly, the box does not state this nice 2 way digital copy code, but its all in there, which is nice that HBO realizes that people might want to watch it on a computer, iOS device, or PS3 AND gives you this flexibility.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I love pacmac but it is very difficult to play on my kindle.  I guess I am too old to teach new tricks because I was very good when I had a joysti k but cannot get it right without one.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I must admit, I had very low expectations for this book. I thought it was going to be boring. The guy is stranded for months on a lifeboat! How exciting can that be. I was wrong. This book was exciting and horrifying and I could not put it down!
0061906220|5.0|The poetry is fabulous. It doesn't matter if you sing with the (included) tune or sing out of tune, kids love it! Perfect way to learn language, colors, letters. It's been in the rotation from 2-5 years-old. A real winner.
B008M7JODC|3.0|The show is about super natural events with a scientific explanation.  Walter, the main scientific is also the one who knows everything and I mean everything, he is specialist in biology, physics, astrophysics, quanta mechanics, neurology and more.  There is nobody who knows that much, that is the most non-real of the show.  There are some non-logical scenes that very good shows fix instead.  The show is entertaining and it could be better taking care of details.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great graphics and interesting enough to keep me playing. lots of fun and fairly realistic plus the horses are really cute
B003QSMC18|5.0|I love watching movies on amazon instant video! The quality is awesome and this movie is adorable haha If you haven't seen it yet, you seriously should.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A good unique magic ability and likable character's, most chapters were short enough that I was able to read a chapter during my short lunch breaks.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|I love watching movies on amazon instant video! The quality is awesome and this movie is classic haha If you haven't seen it yet, you seriously should.
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|Samsara is definitely a masterful work of art. Don't get me wrong. I think Baraka is superior in almost every way. Samsara seems almost so closely related to Baraka that Baraka overshadows it. If Samsara is Frank Stallone, Baraka is Sylvester.  I think the team is better off editing to music instead of editing from visuals and having composers score to the picture. The process for both the editor, and the composers is counter to how they work best. They would have been much better off had the composers worked just on musical tracks, absorbed in the music, and then edited in. A lot of the time the music seemed anticipatory & anxious almost as if the composers were distracted instead of helped along by the film's visuals & cuts.  It's definitely worth a purchase, and a viewing. If you're only going to watch one of these films, watch Baraka instead.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I REALLY ENJOY THIS EVERYDAY . I HOPE THIS COMES WITH ALL THE CD. WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE THIS WAS.
B004CURZFC|4.0|This is a very cute movie, mainly for kids.  I did like it and recommend it if you have children.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was ok but I saw the movie first so that sort of spoiled the book for me.  I gave it three stars.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was the best book that I have read in a long time· I would recommend this book to all women.
0817439390|5.0|I am fairly new to photography and this book has answered all of the questions that other books have failed to do.  It has beautiful examples of photographs and does a great job of taking you through the photographic process. The book not only tells you the benifits of shooting in Manual Mode, but takes you through the process of shooting in a way that takes the fear out of shooting in this mode.<br /><br />I will definetely look for more books by Bryan Peterson in the future.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|If you haven't seen this yet, you should! It was on the long side but I think if they were to cut it down, some of the substance would be missed. The characters were well played and the suspense was kept til the credits.
0375869026|4.0|Great book, a different subject for youngsters.  I liked the short chapters.  The only detraction for me was the ending.  It was just too pat--what is going to happen during the summer and following school years.  Maybe that's for the next book.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|seriously it's shawn of the dead! Yeah thats right it is amazing... and the darn review required me to type in more words...
B004U52VPS|5.0|Fue buena la compra, satisfizo mis expectaciones,<br />Creo que llego de buena manera el producto a mis manos.<br />Nada mas que se ve&iacute;a mas grande en las fotos
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet, it's nice to have a game that encourages the player to use their mind. If you like strategy games then this is a must have game. It's like playing a chess match and the opponent is the WORLD!
B0036EH3U2|4.0|GREAT FRAKKIN SET. THE WHOLE SERIES WAS INTACT AND WELL PACKAGED MUCH MUCH BETTER THEN THE DVD SET. SO SAY WE ALL.
034580404X|5.0|Don't like the fact that you have to type 20 or more words to be able to submit a rating.
0307279189|4.0|Well, I couldn't put this book down! I was given this book as a Christmas gift several years ago from my sister and her boyfriend. He (and now she) loves to run!! I run... but it is more of a \\"when I have the time\\" or \\"feel like it\\" sort of hobby. After reading this book, I wanted to run and run and run. I love the stories and tales shared in this book. The writing is so good that I felt I was a part of the adventure. Often I get bored with books that have a lot of detail or talk in depth about the surroundings of the scene. In this book, the pictures painted and stories illustrated through words had me captivated and wanting to read more. I FLEW through this book! I actually wish there was more and was sad when it was over. And of course... as I am sure it happened with many others... after reading it I hit to my first half marathon. I loved, loved, loved this book! Maybe I should read it again so that I have the desire to run another long distance race. Another great part of this book- the beginning when he goes from doctor to doctor until he hears the response that he wants... I believe that the body knows best. Deep down we can heal and help ourselves. We need to listen to our own intuition and I loved how the author shared that part of his story! Great, great read!!
0140120416|5.0|This book was a great starting point for learning Russian. Within a couple weeks I was already communicating with my Russian friends. Even pronunciation was adequate to an extent. The book is well laid out, and each lesson builds on the previous lessons. Overall I enjoyed the book, and what it has taught me.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|After loving the first two televised series' of A Game of Thrones, I decided to get stuck into the novels so I could continue the story. They're very well written and hard to put down. Even though the first book was identically replicated by the television series, it's still a definite read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great great great great great great greatggreat great great great greatest great great great group has had a great day and night and day
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Complete and total rubbish. Lame humor depending on crudeness and nothing else. Not clever, just plain dumbed down foolishness. For those of you who like your dialogue inane, your plot silly, and your acting like cardboard cutouts, this should please you immensely. It's actually kind of insulting how bad this is, but the whole premise kind of guarantees one predictable, stupid gag after another. A complete waste of time and money. Enjoy!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is very useful with precise information about usage,battery time remaining and time to become fully charged among several other useful metrics. Others have reported increased battery drains using this app. I seem not to have that symptom.
0385344333|2.0|He is literally describing the sound of a phone everytime someone receives a call. Hollow, shrill, etc. etc. EVERY TIME!!
B004259BMM|4.0|I don't listen to country music very much, but I recently saw Keith Urban on &#34;Ellen&#34;, and I thought he seemed like a really normal guy, plus I loved the song he sang on the show.  So, I came to Amazon and just picked one of his CDs to buy.<br /><br />I really enjoy all the songs on the CD, and I've actually ordered another one!  So, I guess I'm a fan now.  There's just one thing that I find a little odd about him...when he speaks, he has an Australian accent, but when he sings he sounds like he's from Texas...so, I don't know what that's about, but I still enjoy the CD.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It has so many things in it which are entertaining. I hate books and I love this book. Prof Feynmans life was amazing and worth the read if nothing else.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Great way to filter out noise.  I use it at work sometimes when in the office and need to drown out noise around me as well as at home to read by or just meditate and relax.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Suspenseful, emotional, an all around great follow up to Beautiful Creatures! I can't wait to start the next book, but I'm going to go see the movie 1st.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|I dont normally go for kids films and I hate most modern animation but this won me over! Go ahead and try not to like it. Age doesnt matter, nor does anything else.
B008G12ERC|3.0|This album has a few great songs, a few mediocre songs, and a couple horrible ones.<br /><br />This is definitely their cheesiest album.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a terrific book. It pulled me along to the very end. I hate to admit how many nights I stayed up too late reading.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|This feels a little &#34;cheap&#34; but it works great. I filmed several hunts with it this year and it helped hold the camera still and provide some unique angles for filming.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|Wallander is the most human of all detectives. This story takes us further into his life and again his personal life and his official life intertwine. I don't consciously seek out stories about people of my age group, This is escapist literature for me to a certain extent, yet Mankell lets you care about Wallander.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching it a few weeks ago and watched every episode in just two weeks. It's really well written, the acting is top notch and despite the subject matter it is actually not that gory. Love it.
B00821OX98|4.0|If you like sci-fi shows with action this will be a good show to watch. Its a little predictable at times but other than that it is well written and you will get to feel like you know the characters even though you know almost nothing about them.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I've been watching this series since it first aired. It's a really fun interesting show, great mythology, great characters, interesting story line.
B005LAII08|5.0|We had not seen this movie before purchasing it but we couldn't be happier! Brave is an awesome movie! So empowering for young women! You don't need to have a prince to be beautiful, happy, and strong! Family is the strongest bond! This movie is incredible plus couldn't beat the deal with Amazon. We are Disney movie club members and trust me Amazon offers great deals on new movies! So happy! Would most definitely recommend to anyone with a sweetie in their lives who loves Disney Pixar movies!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love this game. It is challenging. Make you think. The 1st two level passed them with a breezed. Stuck on level 3. Reminds me, I always had a hard time with combination locks.lol<br />Still it does channels my stress and frustration on the game.<br />I guess, I will be stuck on level 3 for a while.<br />This game looks great and it does work on Pipo S-1 tablet.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|My daughter is a huge fan! She has a karaoke machine and loves to listen to music! The album was one from her list of records she adores and on Amazon it was wonderfully priced. She hasn't stopped playing it!

0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes is one of the best comic strips ever, and this collected hardcover set is probably the best way to experience Bill Watterson's tales of a boy and his imaginary tiger.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Haha! We bought this album for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She sings along with it every chance she get and we enjoy the entertainment! We per-ordered it and it was beautifully priced!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It is fun... but... doesn't want to load after about the 6 or 7th time you play it. If you reload it you have to start all over. Dissapointing to say the least.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great weather app. I love the interface and ease of use. It is very accurate and helps me plan my day by listing hourly expected weather.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing in any way shape or form. It works great on my kindle fire. It's just like maintaining a real horse

B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome game if your not sure not to get it please get it best game ever!!!!! I play it a lot its very addictive!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Mahjong with a twist. Match the cubes twist turn match another cube. Kept my attention for a while. Great for passing time.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|I used to live in England, so I was interested to see this series.  Many of the situations are so true to life, and seem so ridiculous to Americans.  Yes, being a butler is a silly job for a grown man.  Servants are expected to remember their station.  Many things happen behind the scenes that make life interesting.  It is a soap for the upper class.  but I DO wish they would leave out the passionate homosexual kissing.  It ruins an otherwise pleasant soap.

1451695195|3.0|“Proof of Heaven:  A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Afterlife”: by Eben Alexander, M.D. Simon & Schuster Paperbacks, NY, 2012. ISBN-978-1-4516-9, PB 196/171 Pgs. in 8 5/8” x 5 ½” format that includes 12 Pg. Table of Contents and an 8 Pg. Index. Inveiglements include an 8-page reading-list & 4 pages of acknowledgements.  No photographs.<br />  This 35 chapter narrative of this physicians’ meningitis hospitalization is interspersed with a more-or-less complete autobiography of himself, written by a 59-year old academic neurosurgeon born in 1953 with 25 years of practice, having gained an MD degree at Duke University in 1980 & spending time at Harvard Medical School and relocating to Lynchburg, VA in 2006.  He sought to contact his birthparents, having been adopted at age 4 months but was unsuccessful and also described some years of alcoholism he ascribes to heavy drinking as a medical student (something he says is usual or common) and initial practice in neurosurgery, and which, not unexpectedly, slumped & curbed his career in academic neurosurgery that led to marital difficulties, and sadness he attributed to not knowing his birth parents, eventually requiring abstinence from alcohol and courses in couples counseling (arranged by his wife), akin to a lost weekend lasting circa 7 years.<br />  Interspersed with his detailed autobiography is vivid description of his illness with severe E. coli meningitis and coma for 7 days, but he made a full recovery and upon awakening described his surreal journey to heaven wherein he encountered a beautiful girl on the wings of a butterfly (Angelic), a vast spacious area that was pitch black but also brimming over with light (cosmic womb) and saw Om (God); a situation something akin to a fetus in a womb.  We are repeatedly told this E. coli was a rare mutant and had turned his spinal fluid to pus and that his functional cerebral cortex was completely inactived, - he required a respirator to breath.<br />  He ascribed his recovery largely to his family and friends who held his hands, prayed during his 7 days in coma, & this reaffirmed his belief in God as he saw God, Angels, and tripped to Heaven & back.<br />  Upon recovery he felt duty-bound as a scientist and doctor to communicate his stunningly important NDE (near-death -experience) visit to Heaven by lectures, TV appearances (Winfrey Show), publishing Proof of Heaven and establishing ETERNA, a nonprofit charity to advance research, education, explore physics of consciousness and act as repository for NDE.<br />  The authors’ prose is well-presented, easy to read, in the flavor of TCMITS (The Common Man in the Street), but is overly loaded with pompous & ostentatious revelations about himself and presents unfathomable conclusions which stretches one’s imagination:  overall, it completely misses the mark in being scientific Proof of Heaven. In essence, the book is more about his personal life’s ups and downs (alcoholism, search for his true birth parents, & “miracle” of surviving).  If I was his editor I would have omitted the section on alcoholism and not conjure impression that heavy drinking is what medical students do/did (I went to Harvard Medical School and nothing could be further from the truth).  Nonetheless, it is an interesting read, priced right, and has been on the NY Times Best-Selling list for over several months.<br /><br />finishis recovery largely to his family and friends who held his hands, prayed during his 7 days in coma, & this reaffirmed his belief in God as he saw God, Angels, and tripped to Heaven & back.<br />  Upon recovery he felt duty-bound as a scientist and doctor to communicate his stunningly important NDE (near-death -experience) visit to Heaven by lectures, TV appearances (Winfrey Show), publishing Proof of Heaven and establishing ETERNA, a nonprofit charity to advance research, education, explore physics of consciousness and act as repository for NDE.<br />  The authors’ prose is well-presented, easy to read, in the flavor of TCMITS (The Common Man in the Street), but is overly loaded with pompous & ostentatious revelations about himself and presents unfathomable conclusions which stretches one’s imagination:  overall, it completely misses the mark in being scientific Proof of Heaven.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was so amazing and touching! There WERE some very graphic sexual scenes, but i loved this book so much!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A slightly more scientific approach to &#34;Martian life/survival&#34; than expected. Reasonably well written with some &#34;innovative&#34; ideas, though glossed over at times to keep the story running. I liked it, but not enthralled.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was browsing the Kindle books looking for something new at a reasonable price.  I saw this book and was intrigued by the description.  The reviews were mostly good, and the price was very good considerng that it contained 5 books of the series, so I purchased it.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to think after reading the short story that begins the series, but was curious enough to continue.  Each book became harder and harder to put down before finishing.  By the time I started book 5, I was back on Amazon looking for any other books on the series, and purchased books 6 thru 8.<br /><br />Given how many reviews have been written, there's little need for me to summarize the plot.  However, if you enjoy science fiction, or just enjoy an original and well-written story line no matter what the genre, give this book a try.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />A note to the author:  PLEASE consider adding more books to this series.  The end of book 5 left open a lot of subjects to explore, and based on the reviews, it seems clear that I'm only one of many who would love to read more about these wonderful characters you have created.

0547564651|4.0|I purchased How Children Succeed based on a recommendation by a friend who is an educator.  Now, I recommend it for my family and friends.  On a half-day international flight I made a big dent in this book and fought off jetlag to finish it the next day.  The text is conversational and I enjoyed the breadth of vignettes the author uses to bring his theory about the importance of character to life.  As an adult, the book brought me to periods of deep introspection about my childhood and education.  Read it, there's plenty of food for thought that can be shared with your children, family, friends, or even around the office.

B0042J6VUS|3.0|First off I want to say that this was inexpensive and it worked fine for what I bought it for.  I bought this for my iPod Touch.  The description says it is for iPhone and other Cellphones.  Yes it does hold my iPod, but just barely.  I imagine that it will break fairly quickly with the mechanism being stretched to it's extreme limits everytime I put my iPod in it.  The tripod also was not extremely stable.  If the iPod was held horizontal and straight up it was fine.  If you tried to go vertical or tilt it very much it would tip over.<br /><br />But like I said, it worked fine for what I originally bought it for and it was cheap.  I just probably won't be taking it on any roadtrips to shoot videos or still photos in the near future.

B00A6D5GBE|4.0|An engaging game that seems to try to use both sides of your brain. There is the creative problems that arise quickly and have to be solved before disaster occurs.

B003VANOFY|1.0|Had this headset for 9 months, bought new from Amazon.com. When it works, it works great. Problem is, it doesn't work all the time. The surround sound is awesome, but if I turn it off, one side is much louder than the other. Not sure why, but now I just keep it on all the time. I've checked all my settings and can't figure out why the sound would be uneven. They're comfy, I can wear them all day, but the cutting out is a deal breaker. It will randomly stop working. Just dies for a couple seconds. I hear a beep, and that's it, no sound coming in or out. It only last a few seconds, but it's pretty annoying. Especially when you're trying to Skype or... pretty much doing anything that requires sound. Not sure what triggers it, but plugging it in to power/charge doesn't help, and there's still no update that has fixed this yet. Obviously I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't like expensive headset shaped paperweights.

This collection definitely provides the hits I enjoy most from the band, which ends up being the hits earlier in their career, while the wife enjoys those in addition to their newer hits. She dances while cooking, driving, etc, etc....happy wife - happy life. Any chance the group will do house-performances after reading reviews would be sweet!!! Hey, just saying. Thanks either way Bon Jovi!

B00475AYJQ|4.0|I read a review of this book when I was only a third into it.  The review said it was a bit of a spoiler but I couldn't help myself.  The author was harsh and I was disappointed thinking I wasn't going to read this massive book if it sucks.  So I set my Kvothe aside for a few weeks or so...But I couldn't really stay away I had to know how it all played out so i continued on.  I wasn't one bit disappointed in his adventures.  I love the narration and how deep I found myself wondering about this marvellous world I was pondering through.  Even when I wasn't reading but doing other things I was trying to figure out the days of the week to match them to ours.  I always judge a book by how well I can see what I am reading.  If I find myself in the room watching the story rather than trudging through pages of rambling words.  No this addition to Kvothe's tale is so engrossing.  I titled this Growth because that is what Day Two is, the growth of who he was and is.  What happened to make who he is and what others think he is.  I love it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great fun in this entertaining game. G5 products are well planned out, and the graphics are colorful and contain a lot of interesting  effects.  recommend this game for everyone.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie is excellent! I recommend this to everyone. The characters are great, well worth watching. A good one to add to your collection.
B00005LK94|5.0|This is a great movie and it was a gift so I actually shipped it right to the person and they were thrilled.
0143038419|2.0|Kinda like &#34;been there, done that&#34; so this type of fluff is rather boring.  Sort of like a hippe-wannabe 'cept the author actually got paid a pretty penny for letting the reader witness her mindless meandering. The reader ends up being her shrink, and pity, has got to pay for the honor. Very self serving. Don't have enough emotion invested in this to &#34;hate it&#34; so the product ends up getting two stars instead of one. Really - yawn - not recommended. Waste if time and money.

B00ANW33CM|1.0|Not what I expected at all, not really Mahjong. Very disappointing. No explanation on how to play because it's not the traditional game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love history and DA puts you right there from the day after the Titanic sank, into the roaring twenties. The dialogue, settings, wardrobe, etc. are dead-on. The ensemble cast is straight from Robert Altman and the mutliple story lines developing simutaneously are believable and engaging. It all works. Take a littel effort to catch the early episodes for better understanding of the plot lines and who's who. I watched the entire first season one day streaming from Amazon Prime.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is an awesome game, especially on the kindle. Like the original Angry Birds, but with some fun twists with different gravity in various levels. Takes the physics to a whole new level
B001NOQI3U|4.0|Engaging from both a historical and social standpoint, it seems to be a good representation of the time and place. Musically, just average. Amy Irving is truly beautiful.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|When I first started playing I thought it would get boring really quickly. You run/fly through a factory collecting coins and avoiding flaming bars. However, there are some great twists once you get into it, and it is actually really fun! For example, hitting a certain box in the game will randomly put you in a vehicle - each vehicle has a different ability and weakness which keeps things interesting. Also, they keep you addicted by giving out missions to complete, so you're not jut collecting coins, you are trying to get to X meters, or have X close calls. And those coins you are collecting can also be used to buy new equipment, gadgets, clothes, upgrade your vehicles, etc. I also like the slot machine, where you catch a coin in game and get a chance at winning a boost or extra coins. Definitely a keeper.
B002ZG9940|3.0|The two ladies in it are great looking I like about anything George is in Good Ky boy enjoy watching him
B00AAX68HG|4.0|First of all, my 3 - year- old LOVES this game! It is simple enough of a concept that she figured it out and made it through the first 10 or so levels on her own. Basically you fling puddings around to stick them together, being careful not to fling them off the side of the page. I think what she loved the most is that when you stick them together they become a squishy jiggly monster that makes funny noises.<br /><br />I also enjoyed playing it, and found it a fun puzzle game, but I wish there were more levels and more challenges! In less than 3 days I had already gone through all the levels and earned all the stars, after which there is not much left to do. I would love to see a sequel!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is one of our favorite BBC productions.  A guaranteed ticket to laughter.  Arrived promptly and allowed us to replace the much larger VHS collection we had, saving inches in storage.

B00AFEY354|5.0|If you sailed through high school, being mr/miss popular?  You wont understand this movie.  If everything in life has been handed to you and you are happy with it that way, you wont like this movie.  If you ever entered a room full of strangers and chose to sit at the empty table, you will LOVE this movie!  Have you ever been in a love triangle where everyone in the group is in love (lust) with someone else in the group - and not you?  Have you known people who always chose the wrong guy/girl and wondered why when they are so much better than the target of their affection?  If any of these questions rings true with you, you will love joining the characters in this film as they chart their course through high school.  This is a truly original tale - a coming of age film for the new century.  I had not read the book nor had I read reviews so I was surprised by the 'twist' at the end of the story. I commend these young actors for making a serious movie and not just popcorn fluff.  See it and see yourself or your friends in these characters...

Mark Harmon is like the big mean guy who is really papa bear protecting his kids (his team)  love to stories within the stories of DiNozzo and Ziva, who cannot love Abby.  Ducky is the unsung hero of the team who is like the Grandpa you go to for advice and is always there.  Best show on tv, no doubt, I watch it every week even on all the syndication networks.
B006T5C5PS|3.0|Companion to Max Gerson:Healing the Hopeless.  This therapy has some good guidelines, especially when beginning juicing for improved health.  The coffee enemas were questionable as to their true efficacy and true healing effects as touted in the book.  also, the Gerson Clinic is now run in Mexico, out of the guidelines  and overseeing of the AMA, which brought a red flag up in my mind.  Could not substantiate all of the claims as to the Gerson Therapy cancer US cure, finding no research on the matter in the NIH PubMed site, which archives all research done in the US and abroad.

B00AF6B22E|1.0|Flight is a good story. It's just not a good movie. The nudity and language in the film is excessive, but in not in a good way. In a very sad, reflective way. Like most of the movie. When you first watch it it is very interesting, but when it's all over you won't want to relive it over again. Not even once. It's just one of those movies. Sorry flight, you won the battle but will lose the war.

B009X01ELC|4.0|I ordered a case from Marware when I bought for my first Kindle Fire.  My first case was green and I love it!  I had no hesitation in ordering this new case when I bought a Kindle Fire HD.  I ordered purple because green was not an option.  When I received the new case Holy Crow!, the stench was unbearable.  I had to return it as defective as I was almost certain the stench may be due to the dye process.  Sadly, I ordered the charcoal because I didn't want to take the chance of that happening again. I still think Marware makes the best cases for Kindles, but give this four stars because I don't love this color as much as I did the Purple.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is mahjong to the third power (cubed, geddit? Sorry, never mind). l was SO ready for this game. It works very well on both Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and on the Google Nexus 7. I loved the comment from the gentleman who said he played it to keep his mind sharp. It's also great for ageing folk like me whose vision is not so sharp as it once was. Hohng, this is well worth upgrading. The option to save  a game in progress would be great, and it would be wonderful to be able to switch to new cube sets. I'm sure many enthusiastic game-players/graphic artists would love to create new themed cube sets to send. They do not necessarily have to follow the mahjong convention of numbered series, do they? In any case, I would happily pay another 99&cent; for additional cube-sets.<br /><br />the game plays just fine with wifi turned off. This is  a keeper. The knly difficulty is deciding which app I can delete to make room for it!
0316044695|5.0|I usually don't write reviews for things I buy or read, which isn't fair because I use them fairly often if I am stuck on whether to buy this one or the other one. With all that said, I didn't need a review to convince me to read this book. I'm a former Army guy and have read many Army related books along with SF and Ranger books. I've always enjoyed reading military history and how other people did things and why.<br /><br />I don't have much background on the Navy, especially when it comes to their uniforms, enlisted rank/rate, and their overall organization and the way they do things. I was flirting with going into the Navy after I graduated high school, however, something, to this day I still don't know what, prevented/sidetracked me. Basically, my biggest history with the Navy is Richard Marcinko and his early book on the SEALS, the name of which escapes me right now, and Clive Cussler's adventure books of fiction that involve the slight fringe of the Navy every once in a while. But that has no bearing on why I read this book in three days. This is non-fiction, and as real as it gets.<br /><br />I started the book with a general, very general, knowledge of what it is about. Basically some cocky SEALS go out and the whole unit gets annihilated except for one 'Lone Survivor'. OK, sounds cool, let's get at it and see what's in it. I truly love reading, especially if it keeps my attention, which this book had complete control of. I was brutally wrong. And in the process of reading this book, somehow, mysteriously, it not only acquired and maintained control of my mind and attention, it proceeded to silently take complete control of my emotions as well. I enjoy reading a good book and laughing out loud, and not the lol kind, but an actual human laugh, sometimes a full belly laugh, or feeling your body (unconsciously) tensing up waiting for the character to unfold the plot-line. And after reading many many types of action-adventure, Tom Clancy, and mystery/investigation types of books, I was totally unprepared for my emotions to have been taken from me, and their control now dictated by the next page. I am a professional firefighter/paramedic (retired) and have taken pride in controlling my emotions while others around me can't say the same thing, or they will just lie and say they do too...whatever...<br /><br />The book opened as a foreshadow, while going across America telling his friends' loved ones the terrible news, a mission he refused to ignore or back down from. It moves through SEAL, rather Bud/S, training in Coronado, California. Explaining the training was done superbly. And then, on deployment, his mission to Afghanistan. To them, just another mission, we can do it, we've done it before and will keep doing it. Nothing out of the ordinary except their target, a very high ranking Taliban officer/recruiter with a large committed force with him.<br /><br />The mission starts off fairly insignificantly, moving to their rally points to get to their objective, an overwatch position, to get eyes on the target and send the intelligence they've gathered and report back. However, anybody that's ever been in the military or fire service knows that 'Murphy' shows up unannounced, unwelcome, and usually breaks or loses things and always wears out his welcome. In this case, 'Murphy' did show up when the group got into position. Incidentally, the commander of this unit was named Murphy too, and THIS Murphy deserves more respect and adoration for the valor in which he served more so than the 'other' one could ever get for his mischievous nature.<br /><br />The book carries on with extremely precise details of the terrible battle, the losing of his team-mates, him getting ready to give up and is given sanctuary because of an old, but powerful, tribal law. Those tense pages you turn as fast as you can while trying to read even faster, just to find out what happened next. During this time period was when I lost control of my emotions.I'm embarrassed to admit I had as much water running down my face as he did with that stinking Pepsi bottle.<br /><br />I vowed I would never read another book for pleasure again. I didn't know how I could have lost the power to control my emotions while reading this book. I hope I can continue to read while trying to maintain some better control on them at a later time. But, for now, this is my last book...ever...very strong, compelling, you will experience joy and laughter, a lot of love, evil and horror, along with peace and friendship, maybe even a bond tighter than with his team-mates.<br /><br />You get your money's worth from this book. It's not a feel-good hooah hookah Go Navy recruiting book, it is real life about real people in a more than real situation. May God continue to Bless all of the killed and their families, along with Marcus and the scars, physical and emotional, that he will have to live with every single day. I'm glad you story was able to be told.
1594200106|5.0|I initially picked this book up for my Spanish Literature project (review and present a Spanish author), and even though I wasn't very interested in the project, as soon as I picked this book up, I was unable to put it down. It is a wonderfully crafted and formulated story that will keep you wanting more as you turn the pages. Highly recommend this book.

B004H1V5RU|4.0|This is a very entertaining and time taking product. It help improve eye coordination and mental focus. Although it is almost impossible, I am very satisfied with my product. The plastic ball covering is very strong and durable but get dirty easily, making it harder to see in the inside.
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|Harold and Maude is a sleeper.  I never saw the movie or heard of it when it was released back in the 70,s.  I first viewed it about three years age and have now viewed it 3 times.  Ruth Gordon is great and she doesn't overplay her part.  She also was superb in Inside Daisy Clover but the critics hardly mention her.  Watch both of these movies and then go back to The Actress starring a young Jean Simmons and a wily Spencer Tracy.
B000001EL7|5.0|Great cd from the 1970's. I have the original album, and it is about time I get this cd. I love it!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show, it never ceases to make me at least chuckle if not guffaw.  The actors are fabulous and the characters and situations hilarious.  I'm finding Season 6 just as good as previous seasons, for me this show has held its level of quality humor very consistently, which is tough to do.  Bravo, Big Bang Theory, and may you have a few more seasons left in you (at least).
B000B8QF14|4.0|Amazing show. Only 4 stars because the cd is short and not having the whole live show on the cd or dvd. Other then that, it is great!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Anyone who thinks this show is teaching us yanks anything realistic about British culture is fooling themselves, this is pure fiction but it's very entertaining.  A high-brow soap is how I think of it, characters are not always consistent and no one can be happy for more than 15 minutes in an episode before some new tragedy happens unexpectedly or a sudden catastrophe rains down on their heads (often predicated by one of the actors wanting out - these Brits are much quicker to bail on a TV series that is in the height of its popularity, maybe the cautionary tale of David Caruso didn't make as much of an impact overseas as it did here).  But I really enjoyed it nonetheless.  It's no Austen or Dickens (&#34;Bleak House&#34; is maybe my favorite British period piece ever made, and I've seen a lot of them), but it'll get your blood pumping and make you laugh and cry, shake your head and chuckle or shake your fist and mutter &#34;what a rotter&#34; under your breath in a fake British accent).
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Never knew anything about love languages before this book! It has definitely opened my eyes to how different people express and receive love!! Easy read!!
B00004R99F|5.0|Great deal and great buy. The owners got the products to me in a timely fashion and I will continue to do business with them.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I think people are watching this picture expecting a brutal action-adventure, which it's not, and so they are disappointed. yes, a plane crashes and there are wolves. But this is a remarkable (and thrilling, if you listen to the dialogue) existential meditation on who we are in the face of death. The wolves are not wolves. they are your end. they are merciless nature. they are the fact of your mortality, and as the masks fall awayand the characters die one by one, we come closer and closer to a fundamental truth about mortality: we die alone. so who are we when we die? the truth of us all lies in that moment. this is a rare picture, friends -- an exciting adventure story of survival that is entertaining and deeply philisophical, if you have eyes to see and ears to hear. not to mention the entire cast is superb, as is the writing. sometimes it's fun to turn on a movie and escape. sometimes it's good to be poked in the heart and think, and feel things on a spiritual plane. this movie will take you there.

B008KE3960|5.0|The only thing about this game is that it doesn't really show a person &#34;flight&#34; rather it's a game that allows to &#34;stage&#34; a flight path for your various aircraft(all with unique capabilities) and take tanks and vehicles of varying strength or defense. It's a bit like Centipede. I like it too!
0679805273|5.0|great for a graduation, the book reads well and leaves a long lasting impression and it is fun to give as a gift.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Once again, John Williams blows me away. This recording with the Chicago Symphony shows why they are the pre-eminent American (if not the world) Orchestra. Probably one of the finest recordings I've ever listened to.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It's just an amazing backpack. I have had it for years, I've used it for heavy duty activities and trips... It's never disappointed me, still stands the weight and holds in one piece. Amazing materials, perfect size, of course, and the Amazon service with this item was spectacular, since the product got lost and then they resent another one again.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Let me say first that the formatting was terrible: I had to constantly change the font size and line spacing because it kept changing from one chapter to another. It was truly, very annoying. Shame on Amazon or whoever is responsible for this.<br /><br />Now, on to the books per se.<br /><br />THG trilogy takes place in a dystopian future (if that's not your genre, then don't even try because this is as dystopian as it gets). It is well written and descriptions are so vivid you can easily picture the places, the people and the overall glum, despair and hopelessness of it all.<br /><br />Katniss, although a little annoying due to her lack of feelings, ability to show them, or both, sounds like the obvious result of the place and times in which she's living and the things she's had to endure. Still, as a main character I don't really like her. Peeta, on the other hand is probably the real hero of the story. He is a bascally good, generous human being, an optimist and easier to relate to. He reminds me of Samwise Gamgee (The Lord of the Rings) in that even when things are at their darkest he can always find the silver lining beyond. All characters, in general, are well defined and believable.<br /><br />All in all the books make for a good, easy read and are quite entertaining. However, IMHO, they start at the highest point with THG, which was great. Catching Fire was ok but is already faltering here and there. By the time you get to Mockingjay you get the feeling the writer is under a lot of pressure to finish the book and more focused on trying not to leave any loose ends, giving it this incomplete feeling to it. But, since you've already invested some time reading the first two books and become attached to the characters, you can't just stop without knowing what happens in the end, and that's Mockingjay's one virtue: it brings closure to the whole adventure. And I'm not complaining about the ending per se, because in all honesty, I don't hink it could've ended any ther way. My disappointment is about the way in which things were handled and written.<br /><br />I'd tell people to buy only THG, but it's impossible to leave it at that, so just be aware that if you buy the trilogy, you're getting one good book and a half and a mediocre book and a half.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I was very up set with the update. I lost over 50 B's and over 1,000 coins. We should not have had to delete the app. T get the update. That really stinks an  we should be reimbursed for those.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Highly recommened.<br /><br />For SiFi fan who enjoy a plot line that is less fantacy and something that could potentially happen in the future.<br /><br />The wife, who is not a SiFi fan has also gotten hooked on the Wool series now.

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|It's a story so crazy it has to be true: when the American Embassy in Tehran was overtaken in 1979, six Americans managed to escape.  They holed up in the Canadian ambassador's house, while the Canadian government and the CIA thought about how best to get them out.  Enter Tony Mendez, a CIA op who's specialty is extracting people.  Tony has a crazy idea, the \\"best bad idea\\" of the whole bunch: why not fake a Canadian film crew, scouting locations for a STAR WARS rip-off?<br /><br />Ben Affleck has so far limited his directing career to intimate projects: GONE BABY GONE and THE TOWN, crime thrillers set in his hometown of Boston.  What made both films so brilliant was how personal they were to the writer/director.  Surprisingly, Affleck manages to bring this personal touch to ARGO: it's still an intimate film, centered around the people who made this grand scheme happen.  And what a cast of characters we have: Affleck's Mendez, a solid performance, if not quite enough to anchor the film.  (As evidenced by the film's second act, where the weight of the film is thrust onto Affleck's shoulders, and the movie flounders for a moment.)  The supporting cast far outshines the star: Alan Arkin as a film producer willing to back the whole thing; John Goodman as a makeup artist with CIA ties; and especially Bryan Cranston, chewing his way through his role as Mendez's superior.  There's also a whole host of cameos, in the great Hollywood tradition: Michael Parks, Bob Gunton, Richard Kind, Adrienne Barbeau, and others make blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearances.<br /><br />This comes off not as a novelty, but as an act of love.  Because ARGO isn't just a spy story; in a way, it's an affection note to Hollywood history.  Screenwriter Chris Terrio gives us a multi-layered script full of all things movie lovers enjoy: action; humor; heart; allusions; intrigue.  Basically all that's missing is the romance, but that's okay--this film is romantic enough, in the old tradition of great spy films, to suit anyone's needs.  ARGO may not be a masterpiece; perhaps it's not even Affleck's best directorial effort (that's a matter of taste).  But it's one of the best movies of 2012, a year filled with good titles, and it's sure to become a favorite for many film buffs.films, to suit anyone's needs.

1400067820|5.0|I respect Taleb more than most. His life's work, as a writer, has been to help people better navigate the hidden complexities and risks of living right now. It's an incredibly noble project, and not sexy on paper, but Taleb's also an artist, and so this book—which sums up and bolsters his prior work—feels like a fun excursus with your favorite no-bullshit brain around Central Park.<br /><br />Veering in and out of the history of medicine, philosophy, science, and myth, Taleb takes the most applicable/concrete/all-walk-no-talk info and guides you through its central connection—that modernity has built very fragile, very harmful structures by which we live, and that to live freely and without regularly ingesting time bombs, we're best to ritualize and use omission to our advantage, recognize optionality in all domains, and appreciate the things in life which get better with age.<br /><br />Before a major surgery early last year, I told my wife that the book I most wanted to live to read was ANTIFRAGILE. I'm so glad I made it through. Taleb's a fun, brilliant, erudite, and charming mind.<br /><br />Don't be a turkey. Read this for your own good.
0307887448|5.0|A fun read. Sci-fi, cyberpunk story with heavy dose of 80's pop culture throughout. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who spent a lot of their childhood in the 80's

0316077054|5.0|I'm horrible about writing reviews without putting a ton of spoilers and telling half of the story so I'm gonna keep this one short, sweet, and to the point :) This was an amazing series that I simply couldn't put down. Ethan and Lena's story is an awesome, sad, happy, funny, bittersweet, heartbreaking, and uplifting story all at once. This series makes you laugh, cry, and fall in love with it more and more with every turning page. Definitely will be revisting Gatlin and re-reading Ethan and Lena's story again in the future &lt;3

B0063GORYU|5.0|I like that this is exactly like the full version that comes with most computer systems. Definitely got my money's worth.
0316017922|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It explains why those individuals who excel to star status in several fields are able to do so. These are Bill Gates, Beatles level discussions, not that of your exceptional preteen grand kids who amaze the scholars at Harvard with their brilliance.  We think we know why people succeed, but we are usually far from the real reasons.<br />This book is a great, easy, compelling read. It needs to be read by every teacher, parent and employer.

B0055MBQOM|5.0|Very easy to use and set up. Just one small glitch in the software, though. Has both my monitors dead on.

B001F0WXY0|5.0|I read Dune when only a teenager and was entirely enamoured with the adventure as an escape.

B008GJV19Q|5.0|Juliette Binoche is fabulous!<br />Alfred Molina, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Carrie Ann Moss... With a cast like this, how could you go wrong? The movie is magical, mystical and yet full of very real life lessons and experiences. A pleasure to watch again after all these years!
B000002KK2|5.0|This was one of the great CDs of my youth, and I lost it to thieves. It sounds mastered, the CD is clean (with a little crack from storage probably) and it was delivered within a week.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|This is a nice transition movie into what the Fast movies have become with number five and the upcoming number six: Heist movies on wheels. This one is a catalyst that drives the next two (or three?) movies. I really enjoy this one.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|What can you say about this CD?  It comes through with everything us &#34;Grobanites&#34; look for in Josh's music.  All the songs are so special in a way that only Josh could sing them.  I recommend this CD highly.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I've been in IT and security for about 15 years now and it's rare that I find a book that radically changes my direction as a manager and business owner.  I used to find them often:  when I first read Goldratt's &#34;The Goal&#34;, I found myself a bit gobsmacked and looked for ways to apply it to IT.  I felt the same as I made my first forays in to Six Sigma, Deming and Lean Methodologies.  And I'd often felt like I had done a good job applying those ideas to my own companies, projects and teams.<br /><br />And then I read The Phoenix Project and realized that I have kind of sucked at it all the way along.  Gene's book made me realize that there is a world of efficiency and effectiveness that our team has barely even touched yet, and that we should be getting so much more done than we are.<br /><br />This is the first book that I've ever been half-way through and stopped to send a copy to every technical direct report I have (as well as one of my other partners who manages technology).  It's THAT good.<br /><br />It helps that it's actually fun to read.  It's not some boring IT management book.  Much like The Goal, it's a business textbook designed as a story.<br /><br />if you're involved in technology management at all - project manager, program manager, or any manager all the way up to CEO, you need to read this book and really think about all that it implies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It a great addicting game once you start you will never try to stop you should get this game get this game
B0071MQBX0|5.0|As a Phantom of the Opera fan it's always great to revisit this show.  This is the same program that aired on PBS awhile back celebrating the 25th anniversary of POTO at the Royal Albert Hall in London.  The staging is excellent and the production is well paced.<br /><br />The cast is a knock out - Sierra Boggess as Christine and Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom are both first rate. Their scenes together are riveting.  Ramin's &#34;Music of the Night&#34; and Sierra's &#34;Wishing You Were Somehow Here&#34; are outstanding. They have real chemistry between them.<br /><br />Also first rate is Hadley Fraser as Raoul.  His Raoul has personality and strength.  Often this character comes off as placid and weak but Hadley Fraser gives him some backbone. His singing is excellent and paired with Sierra Boggess for &#34;All I Ask of You&#34;  together they make this song a stand out.<br /><br />Wendy Fitzgerald as Carlotta is also excellent and makes the middle aged diva much more believable than Minnie Driver's over the top performance in the film version.  The ensemble works beautifully together.  This is especially evident in the &#34;Prima Donna&#34; scene and the scenes where various characters receive letters of questionable origin.<br /><br />If you love POTO, you will definitely love this production!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|A B and D novel with a lame ending. I have no idea what all the fuss was about this book. Don't buy it. If you must, borrow it from the library. SPOILER (if you want to call it that) She goes through a beating and has her butt tanned, then beaten again with a whip (flogger - whatever) and what makes her leave is 6 spanks?!?!? REALLY? I don't care how rich or beautiful a guy is, if he's disturbed enough to have an entire room filled with B and D stuff, that would be end of that. And that virgin should have been running for the hills as soon as she'd seen it.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|all i have to say is....... buy it  its a fantastic game and is so much fun to.play. its got mines and waterfalls and a great thx to the creators because they did a great job disigning this...BUY IT!
1936608898|5.0|Read this book if you would like to understand why there are so many overweight people around and how to change your living style not to become one, how to cure ongoing inflamation and give a boost to your immune system. All the statements are backed up by a lot of scientific proof.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was really good. Perfect amount of drama, comedy, and lust. The only thing that I personally had an issue with was how sad it got in the end. Honestly the story is amazing but I enjoy more sex and less depression in my books lol. Otherwise  I thought it was well written, and I loved the characters an  dialogue between all of them. Just too damn sad!!!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|it was okay the free trail had me going so thought the purchase was golng to be outstanding.  games was easy not hard at all.  don't like when free trails are better the the game itself.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I don't usually fantasy but picked this up once I heard about the TV show. It's is a great read and very hard to put down. You'll end up reading all 5 books and waste way too much time on them, but you will enjoy it every step of the way. Just read it.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|You will like it (assuming you are human).  Trust us.  If you don't like then you can blame me.  Thanks.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I loved the books and have read all of them. I won't get into the differences between the book and the show because there are a few. Some of them don't make much sense to me, but the show is great nevertheless.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Many times alone, I would burst out laughing and that is something I just dont do. The descriptive nature in which the stories are played back to you make for an in person sense of the comedy unfolding.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|In general I'm not into zombies, so I was hesitant to watch this show. Once I got into it I could not stop. It has great characters and the story is actually pretty compelling once you get over how ludricous the whole thing really is. Highly recommend this show.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|I was looking for a good moba to play on a tablet and found this. In short, i spend about 20 mins in a queue and more often then not when i find a match the game crashes or disconects and logs me out. I would like to say something nice about the gameplay but so far i have slent more time waiting to play then actually playing.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I have the first Sex and the City movie so naturally I had to have the second movie too.  I think this one is my favorite of the two. You'll love this movie!
B0077EBWVI|3.0|I know it is not the original but I expected it to be a little better.  Wish directors wouldn't change the story line of movies when they do a re-make.
B0062P3392|2.0|I thought this would be a great action movie, but it put me to sleep.  The plot was too convoluted and boring.
B00AYB20KI|5.0|Enjoyed the twist at the end! Basic thriller with tense moments had me at the edge of my seat! Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful as well.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A great and fast read. Very mysterious and suspenseful. Romantic too. Funny at times. Recommend this book. Another great novel.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Though I am 62-years old (the age of several in the epilogue), I don't recall having read anything about him since I was in high school.  I thoroughly enjoyed the depth of the research and attention to detail given by Ms. Goodwin.<br /><br />Excellent!
141659521X|3.0|I have enjoyed Vince's books before.  However, this one had trouble keeping my interest.  While the plot is good, the book seems to be wrapped up too much in dialogue between the characters and less action.  I really don't want to waste time reading silly details about the characters whom we already know enough about.  And, I really think he is going overboard with the use of profanity. He could learn a lot from John Grisham in this regard.  I won't waste any more of your time.
B000U9X1UM|4.0|I never saw a film in a 'Grindhouse.' But I did see a lot of B movies on channels 5, 9 & 11 in NJ as a kid in the 70's. Trashy biker films, zombies, blacksploitation etc. Death Proof is a tribute to those B movies. It's also yet another example from Tarantino how a singular character can drive a movie forward. In this case, the character is 'Stuntman Mike.' Not that the other characters are bad, but Mike stands out.<br /><br />The film is deliberately aged giving it a worn out look. There are jumps and bad edits and parts where the sound is faulty. All of which is in keeping with old, degraded B-films.<br /><br />I also like that there was very little CGI used. The stunts where all done with real cars and stuntmen/women.<br /><br />Deathproof is, in my opinion, the last of the dialogue-character-driven Tarantino films. Pity Tarantino thinks it's his worst film. I would give that distinction to Inglorious Basterds.<br /><br />I'd love to see 'Stuntman Bob,' in a future Tarantino film.<br /><br />All in all, very entertaining.<br /><br />By David Feeney, Author [[...]
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A very good book, I could not put it down, all the different people any stories about each level. It's about family and workers to keep their silo going and one nasty fellow, and a young lady that gets people to listen to the truth. Anyone who loves science fiction will love this book. I would tell anyone and everyone to read Wool. It's sad and happy at the same time.
071815780X|5.0|I love the concept of 15 min meals and I got hooked on this idea when I caught the accompanying videos from England. The speed from start to finish is true
B000001F6N|5.0|This is a gem. I can't stop listening to it. Peter Green's tasteful playing remains unsurpassed, and kudos to Mayall for finding young musicians like Green and Taylor.
B00881VLCE|4.0|magic puzzles is a good app. for the price.(free)  I didn't. have any problems using the app with the exception that it was slightly less responsive when first picking up some pieces but nothing that would detract me from playing.  I did like how easy it was to connect and manipulate the pieces.  This app was better than some of my computer puzzle games.  The main area it fell short in and why I would not purchase it if it was not free is because of the lack of good puzzle pictures.  Not all of us want to put together Anne Geddess baby picture puzzles and other pictures seemed like ad picturesnof women.  Even in a Christmas pack there were some odd women pics.  Others had pics of people that made.me feel as if I was looking at a stranger's photo album .  The pay pictures were so uninspiring that I just stuck with the free ones although I would definitely pay for better ones.  Otherwise the only other minor complaint was the need for maybe a little explanation on how to use the app for first timers but it wasn't. too hard to figure out by trial and error.  Overall goodnapp just needsnbetter pic content to make it great.
1401937519|4.0|But once you got past chapter 4 it was difficult to put down till done, the intial chapters were a bit slow and tidious that it could not keep your attention and excitement to continue. Get past that and you want to finish before putting it down. Overall great reading in the end!
B000N2HBSO|4.0|This was a great read. Tons of relevant information about Lincoln and his &#34;rivals&#34; that I have seen on no other books.  I appreciated how the author took separate aspects of the &#34;rivals&#34; lives and and compares them side by side in the early part of the book and helped to understand their differences as how their shared values.  One word of caution, this book is dense and long.  It is not a weekend read.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I love taking pictures and this app lets me edit them just the way I want to. I love all the different choices
1616550414|5.0|I only have one word for this book AMAZING! any zelda fan should have this book and that is that.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I have read some reviews that really put this movie down because of its adult content. Seriously if you go to the store and buy fish...its going to taste like fish not taste like chicken. In short this movie was intentionally focused on adult humor and I dont believe that was at all hidden in the trailer. All of that out of the way..for me this was hilarious and non stop laughter. It was great all the way through. I think hhe story and humor was creative and well done. This was one of the best comedies I have watched this year.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Good weather and forcasts, but the radar stinks. There have to be better weather apps for the kindle f-hd. We have much better wrather apps for our Xoom.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it's so fun and it is not too hard but not too easy it is worth your time to download it's really fun
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is horrible! It works sporadically. More often than not it fails to load and I'll end up getting a network error message.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|The game is an addictive game that you do not want to put down. If you like action like games I recommend this one.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|This was a good continuation for the Firefly saga. Unfortunately, looks like this may turn out to be the last episode...
B003WUYRGI|5.0|What I liked about the book is that u can find what ever u need<br />What I didn't like about the book was that u had to keep scrolling through the book.<br />This book is kinda kool
B001ECQ4AS|1.0|This series is awesome. If you are a horror fan, this is like a weekly mini movie. The Blu-Ray transfer is horrible though. The dialogue is off....way off to the point that it's not watchable. I own all the other seasons as well and they all play fine. My advice is to watch immediately and judge the audio, not wait months like I did.
0765324857|5.0|I played both of the Bioshock games and found them to be far more than a regular first person video game.  The storyline was very engaging and became more important to me than the actual game play.  Bioshock Rapture would be a very good book on its own (for people who know nothing of the video games) however, for those who have played the video game I would strongly recommend the book as it provides a great back story for the games.  For those who have not played the games, IMHO, I would recommend playing the games, listen to all of the recordings and then read the book as the book will provide details that are more intriguing to learn during the game (at least in my opinion).  I am hoping that there will be a second book to bring us up to the point where the first Bioshock game starts.
B002IR3PSC|5.0|This product was shipped quickly. No damage and was well packed. My father loved this as a gift, having seen Tull multiple times.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Great show. There are still some commercials on the DVD but they are only before or after the episode. I suppose they need to pay for the show some how.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Great DVD with amazing commentary. This product was shipped quickly. No damage and was well packed.
1742200206|5.0|I truly like this guide book - much smaller than the last one I took to NYC.  This guide has a full size \\"pull-out\\" map, along with sectional maps of the city.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is fun. It has great graphics plus its pretty easy to understand. I like it, i give it a four because  its not that fun.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|This movie is not yet released...has not been sent, i have not seen it...so i could not possibly say if I love it or hate it!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Sharp, fast moving, John's as witty as ever, and the plot moves along.  Good to see new and old friends, like Paul Brenner.  John's mouth and thoughts get in the way but the action is great and the story is up to date and real!
B00013RC8O|4.0|A friend recommended this movie, so I got it and watched it, enjoyed it and then sent it to him and he is enjoying it now.
B007ZESPME|1.0|Overpriced and not worth what I paid for it. I really wanted this cd and I could not find it anywhere.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|This movie was very little about FLIGHT, AND more about  addiction...not what I expected. Some parts were interesting, but I would have liked MORE about the skill of the pilot and less about his struggle with addiction!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of those game were you can play it over and over when and never get bird of it. I have had this game for two years and still play on it now.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Good movie, lots of action which of course I expected with a 007 movie! Six more words just for you!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|It is honestly one of the best, devilishly charming, heavenly books i've ever read. I recommend this book to everyone, and anyone that asks me for a good book. Read it for yourself!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|It was a whole lot better then the TV show. It kept me reading and was hard to put down.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was better than the last one. The book is more thrilling and had more sexual acts than the last one. I am excited to read the next book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! Best book I've read in a while! So touching and inspiring. Thanks for writing  this!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The weather is great and the maps are fairly accurate.  It takes time for the maps animate and is somewhat slow to respond.

B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I loved this series so much and I can't wait to read the next and final book in this amaysing/breathtaking series. When I finish this series I'm going to be a little sad because of how good it was... I wish it would never stop so I could read and read and read. Before I read the first book Eragon I didn't really like most books like it but Christopher Paolini changed my thoughts on these kinds of mbooks. He may have not really showed it to me in real life but in a way he made me start liking books like this. So I say that this is one of the best I have ever read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a cool game going to new places like Rio new. Stuff coming I wish people buy more things like this
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I always wanted a horse. I am so glad that I get to take care of a horse. I just wish it doesn't to long to load. don't get me wrong I love this game.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|thought this game was really interesting.  like the graghics and the story line. the only thing that I could find wrong was that some of the object where to dark to find. therefore I had to use the hint button, which I try not to do. otherwise a nice game.
B000007NYS|4.0|I am touched by the songs and delivery style by which Ms Williams chooses to deliver her music. In this album &#34;Like A Rose&#34; is the stand out for me. This performers style is intentionally NOT big slick musical renditions but simple good music delivered simply but superbly. She leaves the focus on the song not the super star delivery and back up. I like all the songs on this album and her &#34;Sweet Old World&#34; album
B002M9WW30|5.0|the thrill the villians the fighting everithing its good in this my favourite serie that ive purchased this time ok
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It was a good game. Good story line and it was longer than most. I am always looking for a good long game that don't cost much.
B000FCKRDI|4.0|It seems odd that a woman raised by a game club owner and ruthless relatives would be so naive, helpless, and forgiving. Although an interesting plot, it is still a hard to swallow story. Also, can a rake reform so completely in such a short period of time? Still, I did enjoy the book.
B00005LC4B|5.0|I bought this gift for a co-worker who said he always watches this movie when it come on! He loves it! I don't know if his wife feels the same way???
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Tells the amazing courage of a woman who manages to get away from a horrible abusive marriage and finds true love.
B006O6FK2W|5.0|great toy many hours of enjoyment to be had for kids the only thing missing is that it JUST NEEDS AN ARTICULATED BATMAN
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the way this game plays is not as quick as the first game.  hopefully they fix this because it makes the game much less fun.
B007JNR518|5.0|Redford & company are terrific.  Continue to enjoy and would recommend to all adults and Redford fans...especially those who love horses, the outdoors, and superb acting.  Scenery almost as good as that in the movie, Legends of the Fall.
0547848412|1.0|A lot of people aren't aware that Yann Martel stole the main idea for this book from Brazilian author Moacir Scliar, who back in 1981 wrote a fictional account of a Jewish boy escaping Nazi Germany in a ship with circus animals who ends up in a a raft with a jaguar. the book is called \\"Max e os Felinos\\" (Max and the Felines) and Scliar was too much of a gentleman to ever accept the insistent offers from countless lawyers who wanted to sue Martel over this. When confronted, Martel has admitted he used Scliar's oeuvre as inspiration, but like the good storyteller he is, came up with a rationale for why he doesn't think he plagiarized the Brazilian. As good as the book may be, you should ask yourself if you want to support this kind of unethical shenanigans before you buy it.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Max-Cats-Moacyr-Scliar/dp/0452284538/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361327178&sr=8-1&keywords=max+and+the+cats
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is Harry Potter what else can you say? The product in and of its self was in great condition.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I love the story line because it shows that even heros age too! More often than not, stories have a way of making heros timeless and people who stay frozen in a moment never aging, never dying.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Had to have the last installment of the saga. Now we will wait for seven part two<br />I'll guess this woman made millions!!.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Christian gives a great performance and his partner turned nemesis does equally well. For me, it was the matrix style but nice action none the less.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is an excellent game.  Lots of levels and easy to understand. Hours of fun.<br />I highly recommend  it to anyone who enjoys mahjonng
B00BESNKB8|4.0|The story line is very interesting. The martial arts scenes are very well executed. I love the adaptation of the action world with the new emerging cinema technologies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Playing this game is just like owning a real live horse! the tasks are fun and are<br />very realistic! I love playing it esspecially because it doesn't get boring.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I truly enjoy perfect time killer, can play for hours. I also truly enjoy the auto shuffer  feature truly amazing.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|This attractive zip sleeve was cushioned and made a good carrying case. It was not quite as sturdy as I would have liked, but it DID work.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Absolutely fantastic entertainment. Each episode crafted to leave you satisfied but then astonished when the next begins! Saw this in the Canary Islands and bought my set to share with friends.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|the game was  to easy. it took me less than a minus to get tlevel 30. But its pretty entertaining when your board.
B008J34466|5.0|I think this was one of Pink's best!! It's amazing how she's matured and this album really shows off her range and her extensive talent.  Love it!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great read you'll not want to put it down. Beautiful story of friendship, family and love. Would recommend to read.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Is Led Zeppelin coming back on tour??? This is a must in any collection, these guys totally rock and the setlist is just amazing... Sound is powerful and Plant has a great voice, very pleased with this collection...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I liked this book, but not as much as the first book (which I couldn't put down). Still, it was worth buying.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Metallica at his best... High definition is one of the highest point in this blu ray video, sound incredible and the setlist spectacular... For any real Metallica Fan...
0061537969|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books! I cannot tell you too much about it for that would spoil your esperience of it - and reading it IS an experience!  All I will say is that you will love this book if you: 1) like dogs, 2) like Buddhism and 3) like car racing. Though know that you do NOT have to like the latter to still love this book. And it's appropriate for teens to geriatrics!
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Way to complicated to understand. This would be great for someone who has the time to learn all the jargon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|No words to describe this book but amazing! Since reading Slammed I gave been a big fan of Colleen Hoover's writing. Must read!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This was such great season of Downton Abbey and Amazon prime made it so easy to watch. Highly recommend both!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The book explains slot more than the show. I would recommend this book to girly teens looking for a little suspense.
B008EKOO46|5.0|This book is more personally anecdotal than other Jared Diamond's books I have read.  He tells about how &#34;primitive&#34; societies meet social challenges such as rearing children and dealing with the aged.  It is up to the reader to analyze the ideas and see if they are personally useful in dealing with very complex human situations and challenges.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|As a fighter pilot who provided close air support during both Afghanistan and Iraq, I appreciate the story.  Motivated me to continue to strive to be the best my craft.  I really enjoyed the inside look into BUD/S training.  Great read for anyone wishing to join the elite ranks of any service.  Nice work Marcus.
1932100660|5.0|I've been 'grazing' the book - reading here and there - advice pf a friend to buy it - she doesn't even know what her health plan is and never goes to doctors...good example..
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I read Ultramarathon Man and really liked it, but let's face it, Dean K cannot hold a candle to what Scott Jurek has accomplished.  I recommend reading Born to Run first, then this.  Motivated me to run my first ultra.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|A great flick for any outdoor enthusiast or adrenaline junkie. One may think a story of a man trapped in a canyon would become stale quick, but director Danny Boyle does a terrific job keeping the audience thrilled and entertained.
0307352153|5.0|Although I have been an avid reader for many years, this is the first review I've written. Cain's writing is compelling and I am motivated to write a review, because I gained a lot of insight about myself as well as others. It has been over a month since I finished reading Quiet and something happens almost daily that I better understand after reading Cain's book.  The title caught my eye when I saw someone else reading Quiet and found it to provide new and valuable information.  Although I am retired, and was not looking for a self help book, Quiet is a book I will long be thinking about!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great book!  I enjoyed how Nick unraveled and how he thought he had the upper hand. Amy is certainly a psychopath.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We bought this movie thinking it was like Horton hears a who but it is not. However we still enjoy this movie and our son likes it too.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This book has taught me so much.<br />I am angry.  I am wiser. Such a book<br />as this can help bring us back to operate<br />from an informed rather than an<br />ignorant position.  Lucy
B001F12J0C|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my husband who had never seen the movies and boy did he love them. I was already a fan of the movies so glad he love them as much as I do. The arrived without any problems.
B0058ZPMYG|5.0|Love Joseph Gordon Levitt, but I really loved the story, the acting and the direction. This is a severely underrated movie.
B0061S073A|5.0|This is exactly what we wanted. It makes everything else on my husband tablet safe! That is a great feeling and this app is so easy to use. A must have in our book.
B002ZG980A|5.0|I really didn't hear a whole lot about this movie and rented it one day on a whim. Totally impressed me. Well written, well acted, well directed.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I know I'm probably one of the last on the planet to discover this series. I stumbled across an episode at a friends house (dvr) and was instantly HOOKED! To my surprise it was no longer on tv so I ordered seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4. And cant WAIT until 5 is here! I've already pre-ordered. Definitely worth the wait but, the sooner the better of course!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I used to absolutely love this game! But after the last Rio update, it seems extremely slow, jumpy and is quite fuzzy. It makes it a lot harder and I wish it would go back to the way it was.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|this is a great movie action packed. well worth having it. Got the second one along with it. Can't wait to see if they make a 3rd.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great story by an amazing writer!!!! I just hope the movie does it justice.  I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good love story
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie alot. My husband is into all the documentary movie me not as much but a love it when a saw it
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I love this book! Full of inspiring experiences that many ca relate into their own lives and not necessarily running... It's also very humbling and almost an epic story :)
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Bought this for my husband as he was very interested in the movie when it came out and he really enjoyed it. Great that it was in spanish aswell
B004OT6NTK|5.0|Great service and the product arrived ahead of schedule.<br />Star Wars Legos have a great reputation and all the kids have a great time with it.
B007NU54H4|5.0|Recommend this movie to anyone that like tinkerbell movies. I have every single tinkerbell movie now :) Nice collection of movies
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|awesome<br /> it was a great read. very funny and witty it is easy to love and hate tom sawyer throughout the book.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|You have to be a Katy Perry fan to enjoy it and it was a great price.  She has a unique signing style.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Me gusta la claridad en las explicaciones, me ha sido muy &uacute;til.<br />Creo que le faltan detalles que se encuentran en la p&aacute;gina de KDP que son necesarios.<br />Es una buena gu&iacute;a r&aacute;pida.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read several books on near death experiences and quantum physics. I was never sure about the white light and the peace that comes with it. But after reading proof of heaven and the short stories at the end of the book if has really turned me around. There are just too many stories from all over the world stating the same facts. I am now a believer. I would strongly recommend this book to all who have doubt.
1616550414|5.0|If you are a LoZ fan then you ought to buy this product. Ships fast and the book is filled with so many interesting information.<br />Warning: if you have not played every title of the game this is a huge spoiler, however if you don't mind the spoiler alert then you're okay.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I'm going to school to be a criminal profiler because of this show! And I love all the characters. I don't get to watch it on tv so getting it this way makes life easier.
B004JC16LC|5.0|The Furtwaengler Legacy 107 CD set that I purchased from snoozegirls is the very best CD purchase I have ever made.  Furtwaengler, who has for many years been my favorite conductor, died in 1954.  But his influence in the classical music world is felt to this day through recordings, many of which were made of live radio broadcasts. Indeed, Furtawnegler societies exist that have sought to preserve this great conductor's very insightful and emotionally charged interpretations of such composers as Beethoven, Brahms, Bach, Schubert, Bruckner, and Wagner.    I have been listning to all of the Furtwaengler performances of the Brahms symphonies, concerti, and orchestral variations for the past few weeks.  The conductor's interpretations of these works just draws you in from beginning to end.  For example, the Brahms violon concerto in D, with Menuhin as soloist, will have you on the edge of your seat throughout.  Menuhin's initial entrance in the first movement is especially poignant against Furtwaengler's lush and spontaneous handling of the orchestra.  The performance continues in a like manner throughout the concerto.  Certainly a great collaboration on this famous work.    There is such a plethora of music performed here (from Bach and Handel to the 19th century German masters to Richard Strauss and some of Furtwaengler's own compositions) that it is really impossible to even begin to describe it all.  But I will assert that one could be content to listen to ONLY these 107 CDs for some years and never once feel at a loss for outstanding interpretations of great music.    Just a word about the sellers.  The Beethoven 4th paino concerto was defective in my set.  I informed the seller (snoozegirls) about this and a replacement was immediately sent to me from Germany.  thank you, snoozegirls, for the excellent service AND the excellent price!

0446579939|5.0|Nicholas Sparks IS my favorite Arthur. The books are always better than the movies, although in this Movie, I think they did an awesome job with the casting of Zac Efron and Taylor Shilling. Their chemistry will make this movie a close runner up to the Notebook in my opinion.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|pretty fun but fairly easy, good for beginners or someone looking for a relaxing game without a lot of brain work. Still worth it for the length of game play.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Package came in perfect this time. No damage to the discs or the paperback cover. I've made all my DVD purchases at Amazon & I never have a problem with the disc. Except with the plastic DVD covers tend to ship to me damaged but the discs were perfect condition.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|These songs are masterfully constructed, I can't believe my ears.  I felt like these songs were made for my ears.  This album sounds is way too good to be a debut.  Seriously, this woman and band are gems.  Each song is completely magical.  So incredibly creative and talented.  I'd argue they are underrated.  Instead of listing all my favorites, which is most of them I'll point at two that I'm not crazy about:  Kiss with a Fist and Girl with One Eye (sorry, just like the tune of the others more).

B0055QYKQO|5.0|Haven't ran any power consumption test or anything that useful but the board seems to be runnin great.  Haven't had any issues after a solid month of use in my new rig.  Easy install, driver disc loaded everything major without a hitch.  I made a small mistake of hooking the power switch in the wrong place, thought the colors on the plugs from the case would match the mobo but they don't.  No worries now though.  Solid board with room to grow for a few years.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is an expertly crafted novel that explores the intricacies of knowing one's partner and examines the lengths one will go to in order to love and also protect oneself from them. On the day of his 5th wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne comes home to find his house in disarray and his wife, Amy, missing. With all evidence pointing to Nick and information about their troubled marriage coming to light, what happened to Amy? Is Nick innocent like he claims or is he responsible for Amy's disappearance? With chapters alternating between Nick's account of present day and Amy's diary of the past few years, it's difficult to figure out what you think happened to Amy.    It's incredibly hard to write about this book and all that I love about it without giving you spoilers; in fact, I'm surprised I was able to avoid all of the spoilers myself prior to reading. Of course, there's no way I would ruin such a great book for you, therefore my review can't do this book justice.    Part love story, part mystery, part thriller, Gone Girl will surely keep you on your toes. I admit that I didn't really get into the story until about the third time I picked the book up to read. If the first quarter of the book doesn't grab you, have faith and keep reading. I assure you that you will come to the point where you will not be able to put the book down because of all the twists and turns. I often compare great books to tapestries where stories, emotions and characters are expertly woven together. I hate to repeat the comparison, but Gone Girl is the most tightly woven and expertly crafted story I've read in a very long time. Just when you think you have figured everything out, Flynn will weave the story in another direction. Not only is Flynn's storyline intriguing, but the language she uses is vivid, bold, and beautiful. Everything about this book is solid.    While I loved the book overall and really appreciated the story, I didn't feel completely satisfied by the ending which is why I'm knocking off half a star in my rating. I won't spoil it, but if you've read the book I'd love to hear what you thought! Please try not to put any spoilers in your comments though. ;) I don't necessarily think this book will change your life or inspire you to change, but it's a great piece of thrilling entertainment.    Bottom Line: If you like thrilling reads, entertaining reads, or just plain great stories, I highly recommend this book! And if you're like me and need to read bestsellers before they hit the big screen, read it now! Reese Witherspoon has picked up the rights to produce this as a movie and it's bound to be great! 4.5/5 Stars    [...]
B006PKV2QU|5.0|This book is really cute.  Even if you are not a child it will still make you smile.  Seems all children loved Dr. Seuss books, and this book also rhymes -- but on a much different level than Dr. Seuss.  I like this kind better.  Children everywhere are sure to love it.

B0097NGUJG|5.0|I won't write some fluffy review about music like I think I know what I'm talking about. But I will say that this album is creative, catchy and a joy to listen to. I find some of the songs floating and bouncing around in my head for hours after a listen. I took a chance buying the whole album and it has not disappointed. Good stuff.
B0000AFX64|5.0|The mastery of how the attack on the human race was carried out  was awful in the overall result be brilliant in it`s conception and execution. This show was awesome  without  question one of my favorite episodes referring to Battle Star Galactica.

1401235417|5.0|This book is an excellent story involving Batman.  The new 52 has revamped the characters a little and this is the first storyline (in the Batman comic) using the new updated characters.  For those reading Batman over the last few years, it is not a big change.  Because this is the new 52, back-stories of characters will be different and authors can make use of that to enhance their story-lines.  In the end it is the same character and not a large change (like Batman: Earth One).<br /><br />In this book, Batman learns about the Court of Owls and their enforcer The Talon.  The story begins at Arkham and progresses on with some cameo appearances by Nightwing, but it is 99% all Batman and Bruce Wayne.  The story is from Batman's point of view and he gives his thoughts as the story proceeds.  I won't give away any of the story, just trust it was well written.  About the only thing I did not like was I think Batman's tech has gotten way too advanced.  He always had good tech, but the new 52 seems to have really opened up the use.<br /><br />The artwork was pretty good, though there were some issues in the drafting decisions used by the artist.  In one frame, Dick comes up to Bruce's chin, Tim up to Dick's chin and Damian up to Tim's chin.  If you calculate heights based on Bruce being 6'2\\" and artists usually using about 8 1/2 heads for a hero, you can calculate heights of 5'5\\"+ for Dick, 4'9\\"+ for Tim and Damian around 4'2\\"+ (lots of rounding).  Way off.  In later panels, Dick appears to be about 1/2 head shorter than Bruce which makes more sense (around 5'9\\" or 5'10#), but still a little off from expected heights.  Of course heights may have changed in the new 52.  My point is the artist was not consistent panel to panel and he should be.<br /><br />This book collects Batman 1-7 and ends with a cliff hanger.  You need to pick up the next volume to finish the story.  Some extras include copies of a few sketchbook pages as the artist works out drawing some villains and acouple of pages of script that you can match to the final drawn pages.  There are also copies of the covers and variants.  Nice to have, nothing great.<br /><br />Overall excellent book that will require the purchase of vol2.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Never under estimate the power of the ocean or man's inner drive to challenge! I should hope this movie honored all the past and present great surfers!
B000SEGUDE|2.0|This book was a terrible read.  Expect to be frustrated and annoyed as your reach each semi decent story until you get the the last one.  The last story was so miserably written I couldn't read it.  I scrolled though the story hoping it would get easier to read but it didn't.  The only redeeming part of the book was the story with Sonmi-451.  I agree with some reviewers that stringing together 7 poor stories in this fashion doesn't change ok stories into a book that's profound.
0061992860|5.0|Packed with info about getting by with nothing. My husband has been a hunter, fisherman and loves the outdoors and even he found a lot of interesting gems.  One thiing to keep in mind also, is the size.  Just right to pack in a survival kit.

B00AP6XJVQ|5.0|Rumer has a beautiful voice; but this collection is more than just a standard set of covers done well. It is very much greater than the sum of it's parts - reinterpreting and breathing new life and a woman's perspective into several generally lesser known songs written by male artists who did most of their work in the 1970s. Rumer bares her soul unreservedly here, and uncovers truths about love, loss, and loneliness for us all to hear and appreciate. I bought this album when it was first released in the UK a few months ago and still listen regularly to find new aspects to the songs. A must listen!
0800141660|5.0|I love this type of movie because of it's lack of nudity, violence, and moral story. The English stories of old are some of my favorites.

B0090X4HES|5.0|Good Kid: M.A.A.D City is the debut of Kendrick Lamar, an up-and-coming West Coast rap artist.  His aim is broad and he hits his marks.  I do detect some influence, in certain key parts, from some early Eminem (esp., the talking to his self using his conscience and/or using odd vocals, which he does admirably at various points in certain songs).  Kendrick Lamar is a fairly decent rapper and the lyrics are conveyed with enough street cred to convince me of the hardships.<br /><br />I first got turned on to his music through SNL.  He performed Swimming Pools (Drank) and Poetic Justice, exceptionally I might add, in that appearance.  I don't pay much attention to rap and haven't liked anything much since Gang Starr and early Eminem.  When the performance began, I recognized something, though, immediately.  I got up off the sofa and approached the television, swaying to the music.  I, in fact, was smitten immediately.<br /><br />I purchased the clean version from iTunes the next day.  The studio versions were not as good as the live versions of the two songs from the SNL appearance, but that isn't surprising as I've found that the first time I hear a song, it becomes the one I compare any other versions to, usually finding that the different versions do not sound \\"as good\\".<br /><br />As I listened through the songs on my iPod a couple of times, the SNL versions became a distant, lovable memory; and, the album as a whole started to take root.  The opening song, Master Splinter's Daughter, eerily detail getting some tail, but Mr. Lamar goes into some childhood details (\\"her mom died of a crack overdose\\") and being broke and trying to finesse the situation with a fifth of JD in the trunk (\\"hoping to loosen her up\\"), but, in the middle of the song, Mr. Lamar put a phone message left by his mom about picking her up and \\"where are you...get my car back to me\\".  It is a touching moment that ends the song.  We know he's been \\"raised right,\\" but a \\"sinner\\" has to sin.  This is how he opens the second song.  In fact, the opening and closing of this CD is a testament to his mother's faith.  Male voices are heard confessing there devotion to Christ for the forgiveness of sins.<br /><br />It's like the whole album is a bit of a confession of sorts of Mr. Lamar to his mom and her faith against his conscience.  Having said that, this isn't an album that preaches!  It celebrates the need to do those things young men and woman do.  His third song is titled \\"Backstreet Freestylin'\\"  He sings an ode to his Johnson hoping it will get \\"as big as the Eifel Tower, so I can F the world for 24 hours\\".  On October 26, 2012 \\"Pitchfork\\" gave this single its \\"Best New Track\\" nod saying:<br /><br />\\"Though Kendrick Lamar starts \\"Backseat Freestyle\\" by comparing himself to Martin Luther King, Jr., this new single from good kid, m.A.A.d. city is less voice-of-a-generation than it is a challenge to other rappers-- specifically, try and keep up. The song, which features jabbering production from Hit-Boy, is the kind of technical showcase that launched Kendrick to the top of everyone's list last year. The way he structures this track is particularly clever; there's a hook, but because the beat is consistent throughout, it's less of an energy amplifier than a place for the listener to catch their breath, since oxygen is something Kendrick never seems to need. When he reaches the third verse, he starts growling, larynx contracting in an aural reflection of the dominance on display.\\"<br /><br />Peer Pressure and Moody Trees round out the first half of the album.  Poetic Justice is the middle song of 12.  I'm watching the SNL appearances.  First, Poetic Justice (which he closes with).  Second, Swimming Pools.  This song, on the album, is an example of some Eminem influence.  He doesn't change his voice as much live as in the studio (this often happens, I'm sure you know).  On the studio version his voice is much higher, very distinctively different in these \\"conscience\\" parts.  Listen to it and then some Slim Shady LP.  Mr. Lamar pays credit very subtly.  I don't mean to paint a picture that implies Mr. Lamar does a Slim Shady show.  It is a nod, that's about it.  But, it is there just the same.<br /><br />Btw, Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst is my favorite song.  He sings the chorus in a distinct \\"nerd\\" voice, one might say it echoes somewhat \\"mechanically\\".  It works.  Then, after listening to the tale he tells (a \\"story\\" as he calls it), he asks us, in the chorus, for us to do something for him.  It soars.  The song is 12:03 in length.  But, you don't know that.  At about 6:25, this young boys voice comes in with the chorus, changed by the change in voice.  More voice overs from the streets.  And at 7:17, this female vocal comes in that gives chills up the spine, if you know what I mean.  \\"I'm Dying of Thirst\\" kicks in.  It is magical.  The vocals he lays down surrounded by this angelic female \\"ooooooo\\"  is too much for the brain.  The heart enters, submerged by pain.  Feeling the depths of Mr. Lamar.  I'm dying of thirst.  Dying of thirst.  Dying of thirst.  Taking this life for granted.  \\"God forgive me for my sins.\\"  I'm tired of running, tired of tumblin'.  Pray that it works.  It ends with what may be the voice of his mom asking why these young men are so angry.  Her faith is expressed and the young men confess to her and God.<br /><br />I suggest you pick up your own copy today.e\\" parts.  Listen to it and then some Slim Shady LP.

B00AKO93JK|5.0|I use this every day. I have the first 13 exercises customized for use on my balance board and the last 7 for use with bungee cords strapped to a door. This gives a cardio, strength, and balance workout.Then I run a 5 minute customized ab program, the last few minutes of which I use to time 30 second stretches. I use this app every day. I think the people who aren't giving it 5 stars have not taken the time to customize the perfect workout for themselves.

B0060MYM7O|1.0|I pre-ordered the item from amazon (who as far as I can tell did a wonderful job), and selected the fastest shipping so that I would receive the product on the release date 2/19.  I opened the new sealed disc set, and disc 3 of the blu-ray was not there!  This has never happened to me before.  The packing leaflets were also bent, and the DVD's were visibly dirty.  I have no idea what happened.  HBO or whoever takes care of their packaging their box sets completely messed this one up.<br /><br />As for the show, I haven't seen it yet, but I have read the books, and loved them.  I won't watch the show until I get the complete box set that I paid for.

B00B2QA646|1.0|Others have commented here that Keira Knightley is the best part of this film and I couldn't agree more.  She's like Nijinsky trying to negotiate through a Pearl Jam mosh pit.  (Only Nijinsky would have given up; Knightley keeps up the effort and comes out looking like a pro).<br /><br />Those who like this will cite the eye candy pirouettes and clever* way the film mixes stage theater and film.  Everything is visually so over-the-top that it actually insults the audience much the same way Saving Private Ryan insulted the American patriot.  A few scenes work out interestingly (particularly Vronsky's horse, Frou Frou, racing and suffering with a broken back), but ultimately they fail Tolstoy's story.<br /><br />The film mumbles through Tolstoy's thesis on Christianity, one of the best arguments in favor of religion ever printed, and Levin's depth of character.<br /><br />I think of this film as someone taking a perfect meal prepared by one of the world's best chefs and spreading colorful frosting from Safeway over the top of it, then sticking sparklers in it and hoping you'll think that makes it better.  It may very well be the worst film to have come out in 2012.<br /><br />*And by clever I mean it tries something novel, not that it succeeds.

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Ben Affleck is masterful as the director of this historic drama and also does quite well playing the lead character, CIA operative, Tony Mendez. While I have always thought Affleck had excellent talent behind the camera, I have new respect for his acting talent after watching this. This is the dramatization of the CIA rescue mission to free six American embassy employees, who had escaped from their embassy during the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979; and were given protection in the home of the Canadian ambassador. Unlike the botched rescue mission to free the hostages being held by the Iranians, this one was successful. The cover story Mendez chooses for the rescue involves the Canadian production of a movie set in Iran...with the embassy employees playing the roles of the production team. The name of the bogus movie is &#34;Argo&#34;, thus the title of the film...and the code name for the operation. Mendez is assisted by a Hollywood makeup artist and producer; both played superbly by John Goodman and Allan Arkin. While based on actual historical events, the story has been embellished for dramatic effect...the Allan Arkin character, for example is totally fictional; the last minute cancellation of the mission by the Carter administration did not take place; and the story of the rise and fall of the Shah of Iran is not accurately told. But in the main, this is an accurate portrayal of the rescue attempt; and a powerful telling by Affleck...my highest recommendation.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|As is usual with Grisham's style, this book kept my interest, and I didn't want to put it down.  He is one of my favorite authors.
B005TBWN0K|2.0|Okay app, you can not do too much with it. You can really only draw on it with select colors.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was interesting to hear what he had to say since he is a doctor and it would appear that it was based on actual facts.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Decent app and easy to use. Funny for a little bit and then it gets old. Can only do so much.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I cannot believe I read these 3 books so quickly.  I felt a part of the lives of these characters.
0545265355|5.0|Started reading this by borrowing a friends first and second book of the series. Couldn't wait to have her finish reading the third book so I bought the series knowing I would buy them for my own eventually.
B005IGDW24|5.0|Enjoyed the movie and the DVD looked good. I would recommed this movie to my friends. I would recommend this buyer too.

B004P4KMSC|5.0|When you see the Bruder Land Rovers you will think that the moving and small parts will not last long in the hands of a child.  However, these things are built tough and have held up to everything our toddler has thrown their way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is epic! its just like the pc, well most of it is, anyway. it's not expensive either, it should be $20 or so. I LOVE the multiplayer, the only downside, though, is you require a router, so i can't play online at my friend's house, other than that, its fun. the controls are simple, and run smoothly. and just a tip, when playing multiplayer, put EVERYTHING in a chest before you leave the server, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ITEMS!!!
B004JK61K0|2.0|No Contacts imported and general page layout is REALLY bad. I know it's free but it not even worth the effort to download it.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|A classic movie from when I was young. The condition is great and both of the discs work great, and play all the way through fine.
B00BESM14U|5.0|You dont have to be a genius to appreciate the understated beauty of this movie. The young actors are amazing.  I especially.loved Emma Watson.  This movie conveys a wide variety of emotions. It was real, honest and open. It shows you that even though life is far from perfect it can still be amazing. It might renew your faith in the human spirit. I would compare it loosely to the breakfast club, sixteen candles and say anything. Its a more modern realistic journey. At the end I had that moment of Yah! I hadn't had since the breakfast club.
0553801503|5.0|This book was in better condition than described, always a plus. there is no better feeling than recieving a product in better condition than described, Thank you.
0812993292|4.0|Beautiful book about bitterness, forgiveness,and redemption. This book has it all: British wit, heart-piercing poignancy and a good plot revelation. If you like the outdoors, England, and walking, this one is for you. I don't know why a retired male makes such a good main character, but he does.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars, but it had a bit much rough language for me.
0553108034|5.0|This book was in better condition than described, always a plus. there is no better feeling than recieving a product in better condition than described, Thank you.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone, but the kid loved this gift and he may use this for a little while longer than usual.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put the book down...no other way to explain how good the story was.  Fully recommend reading the series
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The story plot is intriguing.  The acting is superb.  And the setting is wonderfully beautiful.  Can't wait for season four to start if there will be a season four.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is great in keeping my Bluetooth headset charged all the time and it makes it harder to lose! I'm glad I have it.
B008XBASVY|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a very quick read. I am a fan of Chris Colfer and his wide spread talent.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|The book is an easy read. The voice of the narrator is uncommon especially for his stark honesty. I cannot compare the narrator's experience with anyone else's on the Autism spectrum because I just don't know. However, the novel offers an interesting story from a fresh and superbly unique perspective.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|My love of the 80s, gaming and sci fi turned me on to this. If you love either of those things you'll love this book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Awesome book!  I hope they make this into a movie!  Great from beginning to end.  I love Mr. Weir's style of writing.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It is really cool. tower defense is the best. I highly recommend it for a pesky older brother or sister who likes popping little siblings balloons.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Not the greatedst piece of literary prose, but it certainly kept my interest.  A good mystery and surprising twist to the story.  I enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Fun read that keeps you interested start to finish! I highly recommend this book and can't wait to see how they do the movie
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I like the series.  It's as good as I was told.  Love the English version, glad I decided to buy both seasons
B001TH8UUA|4.0|The cable works and looks and feels well made....my only gripe is the labeling which announces to your guests where you bought it from (and they will inevitably find out how much you paid, or didn't pay for the cable)
B009FZFONO|5.0|If you have not seen walking dead, you need to start :) I started watching this season. My favorite character is Darryl :)

B0084AXZK0|5.0|In the mid 70s I watched a two part mini series based on this book. The book is far better because Mr. Wilde is able to whisk you away to Victorian England and give you a sense what that time and place was like.
B00003CX9W|3.0|I thought there would be an updated version,and I sent this to my grandchildren.Of course the old version was not of any interest to my grandchildren
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Jeff Kinney has done an amazing job adding in his lovely humor in the seventh book of this series. I love these books and especially Greg Heffley, who is I think the most hilarious, conceited, imaginative, airhead I've ever met. In a way I feel that Kinney has wrapped up the Series in a fantastic way by leaving us with the great characteristics tying together in a great way. Who knows, maybe this isn't the end, but I have to say it has been the absolute best!
B006JPS1OM|3.0|This was a pretty good game but you need to really like Hidden Object scenes, because it has a ton of those.  The graphics were good and it was pretty easy to find the objects.  It had a few puzzles but nothing very challenging.  It was a nice long game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This allowed for an insider's view to a covert world and for the hunt for a mad man. This is a must read!
B007BGQFTQ|3.0|This author is very clever at creating amusing situations,  describing derring-do, and presenting us with a detailed world in the steampunk style. I want to emphasize the strength of her world description because I'm going to spend a fair bit of time criticizing a different aspect of her writing that is weak.<br /><br />It is through comparison to another adventure series in the steampunk sub-genre (Buroker's [[ASIN:B0093QFKPM The Emperor's Edge]] series) that I have been able to pin-point that which has been bothering me about this series. In essence, I think her characters lack depth. Too much effort is spent painting a picture of the steampunk world (she really does a great job of that) and not enough making the characters and their relationships 3-D/believable. The characters are not themselves, they are merely a \\"type\\": the intelligent-and-plucky heroine, the gruff and dangerous hero, the hopeless eccentric friend, the debonair gentleman's second. in contrast, Lindsay Buroker's characters are more real to me and I think that's why I'm finding Carriger's stories less satisfying. I have no trouble imagining what Buroker's characters do, what they're thinking about, or how they're feeling when they are \\"off stage\\". Characters of Carriger's Parisol Protectorate are not so confidently imagined.<br /><br />I have just spent a paragraph pinpointing the problem with the series which is quite unfair. It IS a good series: entertaining, fun, clever. I do not regret buying the set. Lots of fun books have stereotypical characters. I'm just a little sad that I don't love the books and the characters more, cos I think so much of the writer's creation is cleverly and finely wrought (er, did I say that already?). These are probably a good set of books for when you want some entertainment that doesn't force you to stay up too late; when you need a book you will enjoy but which you CAN put down because you find that you CAN wait to find out how things turn out for the main characters. I am really on the fence about how to score it.<br />High end of a three star, low end of a four-star. I'm vacillating.ters.

B000QCSA54|4.0|As with all of Godin's books, this one is concise and practical and loaded with useful examples.  The Dip is truly a Big Idea — relevant, simple and counterintuitive — and that makes this book one of his best.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This did not solve my Kindle charging problem.  Kindle still will not charge unless I wrap cord just the right way
1455527475|2.0|After reading this book, you come away learning 3 things about the author:<br /><br />1)  He is Jewish.  I don't really care that he is, but he yammers about this incessantly to the point of irritation.<br />2)  He is a food hound and luxury whore, the way he constantly name drops Michelin-starred restaurants and hotels.  It's obnoxious.<br />3)  His opinions about Goldman Sachs don't matter in the slightest.<br /><br />Let's put this in perspective: Greg Smith was a mid-level derivative salesman who loved some fantasized version of Goldman Sachs that didn't exist, and couldn't come to grips that the company was being run in a different way.  And being one of literally 5,000 vice presidents in the firm, he couldn't effect change, so he left.<br /><br />Let's not confuse him with anyone prestigious.  He started on the execution desk -- which is a glorified Charles Schwab broker.  Then he became a salesman, whose job is to call a bunch of firms to solicit their business by hawking the mountain of research that the firm creates.  This guy is no Master of the Universe.<br /><br />The story would have been much more explosive or interesting if he had been a partner or someone who actually mattered in the firm.  Instead, we get these incredibly inane tidbits about deciding to take off Rosh Hashanah during a \\"crisis\\", as if somehow him being at work would have single-handedly saved Goldman from financial ruin.  Or how he was such a hero for being the last one out of the office the day the power went out in New York.  It's all so petty and trivial and insignificant it's practically painful to read.  He sounds like an 8 year old who thinks the world is his oyster because he colored inside the lines on every page of his coloring book.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks this book is some type of scandalous expose of Goldman or Wall Street either has never worked in sales and trading and/or truly has no idea how the financial world operates.  All you learn is that GS's London officeis full of unlikeable jerks, and that a for-profit financial institution is trying to *gasp* maximize profits -- just like EVERY other for-profit public company out there.<br /><br />It's really not clear what the goal of this book was.  He's out of a very lucrative job, he certainly didn't effect any change in Goldman's culture, and his book is lousy enough so that he's not going to be making millions of dollars as an author.  So whatever his objective, the author has failed.  It's time to move on from this flame-out.
0316069884|5.0|I am so glad that I stumbled upon this book.  It changed my eating habit and my life.  I have been a vegetarian (I have stopped eating all meats and most dairy products.  I will stop eat egg white and cheese soon) for the last four months with the full intention transition into a vegan in the next few months.  I am doing this slowly so it can be a sustainable lifestyle change for me.<br /><br />Most of us sort of already aware about these compelling issues (animal suffering, personal health and environmental concerns) why we should not eat meat. Like most Americans, I did not wish to face it.  I was in DENIAL.<br /><br />This book made me take a much closer look of myself and helped me to discover my inner compassion for the animals. It brought tears in my eyes and made me mad as hell!  It changed me from being part of the problem and empowered me to be part of \\"solution\\" by \\"opt out\\" of mainstream, big corporate food systems.  If you have an ounce of compassion for the animals we eat; an interest about your personal and your family health; and a slight concern about saving our environment, read this book and then your heart will direct you to do the \\"right thing\\"!
B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|Just so that we don't forget the immediacy of the moment and what lies beyond, around us, ahead of us, Lifesigns springs forth and opens the gateway! Thank you John Young! Thanks Nick Beggs & Frosty Beetle, and all who contributed to this project! It is a wonderful piece of work. Strange the connection with the telephone booth in the cover artwork, reminding me of the incredible &#34;Milliontown&#34; by Frost as well as the phonebooth used by Peter Gabriel on his &#34;Secret World&#34; tour back in 94 during the song &#34;Come Talk To Me&#34;. Great moments in music!<br />The CD opens with &#34;Lighthouse&#34;, an excellent tune that is all about the search and the journey. A great exploritory vision! Excellence begins the journey! My personal favorite &#34;Telephone&#34; is the second track and has wonderful lyrics and great melodic content. John Young's lyrics &#34;But your ears are open and your heart beats wide, cos there's something else and it's deep inside, and you're all alone and you don't know why, as you try and hide the love denied.&#34; are just a sample of some of the very best lyrics I've heard in some time. The entire song is masterful! Me being a long-time Genesis fan, I find great solace in this track. The third track &#34;Fridge Full Of Stars&#34; is another track that explores the cosmos connection with the human race. Can't help hear a slightly different twist on the old YES tune &#34;Yours Is No Disgrace&#34; in this track, but they make it completely enjoyable and current in Lifesigns style. More excellence! &#34;At The End Of The World&#34; is probably my least favorite track if I must have one. I like it very much, but feel at this time that it will have to grow on me a little more. Still an amazing track with excellent lyrics and harmonies. The CD ends with &#34;Carousel&#34; which is more modern prog at it's best. A great track that has more leanings towards ELP. What these guys have accomplished here is greatly significant! Also great to hear Steve Hackett (Genesis), Robin Boult (Fish), Jakko Jakszyk (King Crimson), & Thijs van Leer (Focus) all joining in on this! Also I must say that just about any project Mr. Nick Beggs gets involved with these days is usually of great significance! Not only has he been involved in Steve Hackett's band, but he has been a consistent member of Steven Wilson's solo work and touring band. Anyone who loves all the great prog of old and recent times will most likely find this a must for the collection! Makes it wonderful to be alive!!!hear Steve Hackett (Genesis), Robin Boult (Fish), Jakko Jakszyk (King Crimson), & Thijs van Leer (Focus) all joining in on this!
