The extra DVD's were great as well.

0786838655|5.0|That's right, if you're experiencing severe symptoms of Harry Potter Withdrawal (HPW) like yours truly, then you've found the right book. The book starts with a few similarities to Harry Potter. For instance, a young man finds out his true identity in his pre-pubescent years and finds himself shipped off to a outlandish school for training. He has an insecure male sidekick and an extremely bright female companion. The three set off on an adventure bigger than themselves. The hero has a secret destiny that only time will reveal.    Fortunately, the story line creatively uses something else besides magic. I found myself enjoying the idea of understanding mythological characters through the application of human traits. Any readers, at any age, will enjoy themselves as they follow Percy along his journey of discovery. Of course, he overcomes nearly impossible odds, but that's why we read it to begin with. Trust me when I say, the pacing is perfect and you'll want to pick up book #2 as soon as you put this one down. And look out because this story hits the movie theaters in a short time. In no time at all, your old friend Harry Potter will fade from your mind as you follow your new buddy, Percy Jackson.    PATRICK RALEY is the author of the mystery, detective novel entitled \\"[[ASIN:0977203468 Precedent of Justice]]\\". Find out why Publisher's Weekly calls him \\"the next John Grisham.\\" You can also find his short story \\"[[ASIN:B001268D1Y A Killer Diary]]\\" on Amazon.

B00288KNLS|5.0|Tim Burton has outdone himself in this creepy clay animated movie from Neil Gaiman's book Coraline. Not only had he stuck mostly to the story but for once it's not a musical! I recommend this for all ages but make sure the younger ones have an adult cause it gets super creepy!!

B00204AA0O|4.0|Regina's new CD has a playlist full of music that is...aesthetically pleasing. For those of you who are fans of classic Regina's, appreciative of original's such as Samson, December, The Flowers, and so on, you will be dissapointed. Her 5th album is much more produced and mixed. It is less about how she is singing, and more about what she is singing. That being said, you will enjoy the music for the fact that it still is good music. Just not the Regina Spektor music it used to be.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|Love is in the air at Hogwarts, as Harry finds himself attracted to Ginny while Hermoine is attracted to the new quiddich sensation Ron who is attracted to someone else and so on.  While this may be harmless, there are forces at work that are anything but.  The death eaters are growing in strength and becoming more vicious, killing several muggles in a terrorist attack.  Diagon Alley is all but deserted, only Fred and George Weasley's joke shop is thriving.  Hogwarts has increased security, incoming students are being searched and the entire school is surrounded by a magic force field.  Harry is recruited by Dumbledore to convince former Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as the new potions teacher.  The task proves simple.  Slughorn is eager to return to Hogwarts, particularly with Harry Potter as a potential student.  Harry will later be required to do things not so simple.  Dumbledore believes Slughorn has valuable information that could be used against Voldermort and hopes Harry can find it out.  Slughorn has taken a definite liking to Harry, who has become one of his better students.  Of course, Harry has some help.  He is using an old potion book with very accurate notes courtesy of \\"the half-blood prince\\" (whoever he is).  Unfortunately, there is danger.  Despite the security precautions, Dumbledore is the target of assassination attempts.  Harry suspects Draco may be up to something, he has already been seen with wanted criminals.  Later on, death eaters attack and burn the Weasley house to the ground.  Eventually, Harry gets Slughorn to give Dumbledore a memory that confirms Dumbledore's worst fears about Voldermort, and a way to destroy him!  Will Harry and Dumbledore be able to use Voldermort's own strength against him?  Will they uncover the truth about the assassination attempts?  Will they be able to survive a Trojan-horse style invasion of Hogwarts?<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince reminds me of the start of A Tale of Two Cities - \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst times.\\"  In some ways this is one of the best Harry Potter films made.  In others, though, it lags.  The storyline involving Ron Weasley and quiddich could have easily been done away with, the teenage romance could have been reduced to a couple of minutes.  Fortunately, the movie resolves its teen angst portion in time to get back to the main plot.  That is why Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has been a success.  On the one (forget it!)  to five (excellent!) star scale, I rate this four.
B0001DMPVI|4.0|Eric Burdon and the Animals were one of the most successful psychedelic groups of 1960s, having four top forty psychedelic hits in the USA during a period of about a year, a success that is only topped by Donovan and the Beatles.  Two of those Animals hits are on this album: \\"Monterey and Sky Pilot\\". These singles are the best material on Twain Shall Meet, and many collectors may wish to buy them separately.  However, I bought this album for one of the deep cuts, \\"Orange and Red Beams\\", which is sometimes mentioned as a good example of late psychedelia, a song that has haunted me since I first heard it in 1968.  To my ear it has the distinction of sounding very much like the awe mixed with sadness that accompanies certain visionary states of mind. The song doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it does capture a mood. Other cuts of the album on the album range from fairly good to terribly pretentious.  Some of it may sound dated; I liked the album better as a whole back in the day than I do now.  But I'm glad to be reunited with \\"Orange and Red Beams\\", and have added it and \\"Monterey\\" to my Psychedelic Masterworks collection.

1934030198|5.0|I could not put the book down when I first received it and started reading it.  And I learned a lot in the first 50 or so pages.  However, to really get the most out of this book, one will need to do some time-intensive testing and planning.  Friel recommends laying out a whole year's training plan - which is awesome of course - and it is to be done step by step, however this has proven to be a really daunting task; one I have not been up for yet.  You can still get lots of valuable info from the book by searching for what you want.  But, the book really focuses around creating a year plan, looking at yourself and your weaknesses and strengths, doing some testing, and then making the plan.  If you have the time and the will, I feel you will really absorb the purpose of this book.

B002BSHXJA|3.0|This is the box to buy, the mono LPs were the Beatles' own choices artistically, Martin often changed important things on the stereo mixes, particularly on \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" and \\"Revolver\\", their best work. The three stars are for the over-pricing, limiting the edition, and not providing \\"Abbey\\" and two singles in stereo in the box, if it is indeed true they don't exist in mono. More below. The instrumentals of \\"Yellow\\" and the original Spectorized \\"Let It Be\\", who cares.     I would be interested to know if the \\"Magical\\" mix is the US LP mix, as I believe the UK EP sounded different - and the best mix I ever heard was actually the German Horzu full LP issue, still in print in the 80s (in those days each country did its own mix, I believe that ended with the \\"White Album\\" for the Beatles). The mono box was manufactured in Japan with typical clear inner sleeves and outer sleeve for each LP, they used the Capitol label on \\"Magical\\" as well. A clue for us all.     First of all, the Beatles did not work in stereo until very late if then, they left the studio after the mono masters were finished and George Martin made artistic changes that he wasn't authorized to do - the only good one being \\"I've got blisters on my fingers\\", which the mono buyers will be surprised to find is not there at the end of \\"Helter Skelter\\". The mono sound is cleaner and sharper, and details like Paul chuckling on \\"Maxwell\\" come out. Yes \\"Maxwell\\" because there is a mono \\"Abbey Road\\", it was issued in South America on vinyl and I've transferred and cleaned a CD copy myself for my personal use and it's real mono and though closer to the stereo than any other competing mix of their other albums, it's better. So to begin with it should be in the set. Why is the mono set more expensive when the stereo has more discs and a DVD? The sound is what it should have been years ago, but EMI has made millions - billions? - on the Beatles, so the gouging price is ugly. Marring what is a celebration otherwise. There are mono \\"Let It Be\\" takes too. What I'd love is if Paul and Ringo would mix stereo versions that have the original mono artistic choices, because the differences are often substantial, particularly on \\"Revolver\\", \\"Pepper\\" and \\"White\\" - the heart of their output. \\"Abbey\\" is right in stereo, but I believe that is because they - or at least Paul - didn't leave Martin to his own devices by that point.     If there was no real \\"Abbey\\" mono lp, why are there studio takes in mono with mono matrix numbers? It was not a 'fold-down'; if it was, as the booklet states, then the fold-down technique works because the mono \\"Abbey\\" is slightly superior on LP. And where is the mono \\"Ballad of John and Yoko\\" and \\"Old Brown Shoe?\\"? These exist too. Don't get me wrong, I love what was issued, despite the price, but who is it that makes these decisions in the face of the obvious? Perhaps in another forty years the errors will be corrected. Furthermore : there is a mono LP issue of McCartney's \\"Ram\\" and IT'S better, so this didn't end with \\"Abbey Road\\". George Martin was a brilliant producer (and trusted by The Boys because he produced The Goons) but he took his title of Fifth Beatle way too far, and now you can hear it.     Compare the end of \\"Within You\\", the most egregious change - the mono has a braying laugh that George Harrison chose to ridicule anyone who would laugh at his serious message; George Martin inserted instead the light laughter of a handful of people which in effect gently mocks Harrison, exactly the opposite of his intention. It was reported Harrison was shocked when he heard the stereo, long after it was issued.    This would also have been an excellent occasion for Sir Paul to release \\"Carnival of Lights\\", the experimental one-off that remains the major unreleased recording. I'm hoping it's a hidden bonus track buried somewhere. Of course he tried to before, so perhaps we should blame Yoko again.

B00005QW5X|5.0|This movie was recommended by Netflix based on my previous selections and ratings. I had seen a movie trailer in theaters some years ago and was not interested. I am glad I gave this film a chance. It changed my life. I think it is the best movie I've ever watched. The acting is superb, the songs are fantastic, the storyline is brilliant, the casting cannot be better. Since I bought it I must have watched it 20 times. Several times I invited friends and neighbors and everyone loved it. It is a true 21st century masterpiece, and like every masterpiece everytime you watch it (or look or listen) you discover deeper meaning, brilliant details, and overall genius. The movie is a portrait of an artist, and nothing else should be said before watching it. After watching it, I've decided to read Plato's Symposium and Isherwood's The Berlin Novels, two books that are related to the movie. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this film.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Don't believe all the five star reviews this release has received, many of those are for the film itself and were entered in before the blu ray was even released.As others have said, the picture on this blu ray is pathetic, DNR and EE everywhere, I'm no A/V fanatic but even I can tell when a blu ray looks like crap, especially this one. If you love the movie just buy the DVD version and watch it up-scaled on your blu ray player, it'll save you some serious money and frustration.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|I will start by saying that I enjoyed this movie. But Abrams did not tailor it to fans, those who would have seen it many more times than those who don't like Star Trek. The Creators of this movie were given a lot of creative freedom in production. The \\"alternate universe\\" is, however cool it may look, going to get old. Fans are going to clamor to see another film hoping to see good actors and a well written and played story. Simon Pegg and Karl Urban did about as close to the original actors did in this movie. Both were fantastic and well done Montgomery  Scotty and McCoy  But Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine did a terrible job trying to portray their characters. This movie was a action movie with a watery story. And many have compared many things in this movie to Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan. But ST:II was a story driven movie with great action scenes. If/when the next movie comes out I hope that it will return to the formula that has been tried and true for the previous 10 movies and 6 series.

1400082773|5.0|I would have found this book utterly fascinating even if the author did not happen to be the President of the United States. Obama's quest to understand his rather complicated multicultural background and deal with the baggage that came along with it is vividly portrayed here in prose that are of a caliber one would expect of an acclaimed memoirist. The book is invaluable reading for [[ASIN:1857885252 Third Culture Kids]] and [[ASIN:0968676030 Global Nomads]]. It is also valuable for community organizers such as those who read Paul Loeb's [[ASIN:0312204353 Soul of a Citizen]]. The book raises many deep questions regarding cultural and personal identity. It also provides a glimmering of the invincible aspect to Obama's personality that enabled him to rise up out of all the confusion and instability of his upbringing to become a world leader and a source of inspiration for millions.

0756404746|5.0|The Name of the Wind is an absolute treat to read.  It is written with such eloquence you can practically taste the words in your mouth.  There were times while reading this when I actually had tears in my eyes, of joy and sorrow; which I can say is a definite first for me with literature.  Using only words on a page, Patrick Rothfuss is able to invoke a range of emotion that is quite astonishing to me.    This is far and away my all time favorite book.  Every page is a marvel of storytelling.  I really can't say enough good things about this, and overdoing it would only take away from the simple beauty it possesses.    Basically, if you haven't yet experienced Kvothe the Bloodless in all his splendor, do so immediately :-)    Patrick Rothfuss, thank you for an experience I will always remember.  At the risk of touching exaggeration, I believe your story has changed and inspired me.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is heaven for any Beatles fan who wants to experience their sounds in remastered stereo heaven! The sounds are so clear, beautiful and bright they are dazzling--and I would swear I was sitting right there next to them as they were originally recording this timeless music. The single CDs all come in their own fold-out containers with beautiful artwork and photos; the double discs come in their own style of packaging which was constructed so that the two CDs could fit inside them without becoming easily scratched when you remove them. Even the artwork on the CDs themselves very well done! There are great liner notes and photos to admire, too.<br /><br />But it's the core product I'm focused on--these marvelous CDs in stereo and the sound that blows me away when I listen to them. Believe me, I've never heard The Beatles sound so good. Sure, some of their albums earlier on weren't released in stereo; but that makes it all the more exciting to hear the stereo versions--you can practically hear each member of the band's movements as The Beatles performed every song to perfection--and beyond! It's tough to list which songs I enjoyed the most--there are so many of them! Just listening to \\"Love Me Do;\\" \\"I Saw Her Standing There;\\" the beautiful \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and more stun me with the high quality control sound--the clarity is magnificent! \\"Revolver;\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and other albums come off sounding terrific, too. Talk about unblemished music!<br /><br />In addition to the albums and the CD entitled \\"Past Masters,\\" we get a bonus DVD of mini documentaries about the band, their music and George Martin so we can have even more understanding of why this music remains so hot after all these years--great!<br /><br />If you were concerned about some of The Beatles' albums being altered unfavorably by this stereo box set release, you can heave a huge sigh of relief. The music on each and every track is nothing short of excellent with crisp, clear vocals and instruments that sound like they're being played right next to you all coming together to produce some of the greatest music of all time. Beatles fans would do well to add this to their collections; you won't be disappointed!r vocals and instruments that sound like they're being played right next to you all coming together to produce some of the greatest music of all time.

B002IJKR0E|5.0|(As of this date I'm waiting to receive the Cd, but I've purchased the MP3s from the band's official website).    In my opinion this is Europe's best album EVER.  Yes, better than \\"The Final Countdown\\" (by far) and without question the best album since their comeback in 2004.  \\"Start from the dark\\" (2004) and \\"Secret society\\" (2006) were both solid albums, but \\"Last Look At Eden\\" is trully the album most fans have been longing for, as it contains all the elements loved by this band.  Heavy.  Bluesy.  Majestic.  Full of big hooks and melodies that will grow on you and stick with you forever.    This album has a stronger focus on melody than the last two albums.  Songs like \\"last look at eden\\" and \\"no stone unturned\\" have a strong majestic vibe that we haven't seen since the \\"Out of this World\\" era.  In fact, \\"last look at eden\\" could be considered the modern day equivalent of \\"superstitious\\".  Songs like \\"gonna get ready\\", \\"the beast\\" and \\"mojito girl\\" are fun rockers that will have you hooked immediately and will not let go of you!  They will go down great LIVE!!  There's also some really good bluesy stuff, like \\"in my time\\" and \\"catch that plane\\".  Then there's the brilliant ballad \\"new love in town\\".  A great sentimental tune.    I get the feeling that touring in 2008 with Deep Purple and Whitesnake rubbed off on Europe a bit.  \\"Last Look At Eden\\" is a masterful fusion of classic 70's rock and modern rock.  Brilliantly crafted songs from start to finish.  There's no filler on this album.  Europe are proving to be a force to be reckoned with in the 21st century and shattering that \\"80's hair band\\" image.  This album deserves much attention and even the hardest critic has to give the band it's due.  Not only is this the best album Europe ever made, it's one of the very best albums of this decade, from any rock band!  If you're skeptical of that claim, get this album and be enlightened and entertained.  You won't be disappointed!
B0026J8LHM|1.0|wow, what a disapointment.  not only does the music lack all that is dream theater, the lyrics are just plain ole crap.  I don't think i've heard lyrics worse then this.  Mike Portnoy can't growl, so stop doing that.  We all know you can play your instruments, but instead of writing music around your solos, write music that flows.  After seeing progressive power nation 09, i don't think i'll ever see dream theater live again.  Worst set list i've ever heard......gone are the days of good dream theater.  If you want to keep headin down the path of heavy metal, i would advise a name change.....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This lovely piece of artistic fantasy is set in a world that may someday be more real than not.  It will grab you from page one to the final sentence.  It is the story of a country ripped apart by hunger, disease, war and class conflict.<br /><br />The nation is divided into Districts, with each one producing its own special commodity.  Beautiful and inventive Katniss from District 12 becomes part of an annual ritual that selects, through a lottery, children from each district who will fight each other to the death so as to please the upper class of the rich and privileged.<br /><br />It is at once a gripping thriller, and a gentle story of love unrequited.  It comes with fantasy critters, both benign and not so benign.  It is a story that will be hard to forget.  I can't wait until the sequel comes to Kindle.<br /><br />I highly recommend this magnificent ride into a future that may be closer than we think.

B000002LCK|5.0|Rising out of the ashes of Joy Division after Ian Curtis' suicide in 1980, New Order fashioned an amazing portfolio of music over the next few years culminating in this greatest hits retrospective in 1987.   By then, New Order was a leader of the early alternative movement and an established dance club band.    Substance chronicles their early releases of songs penned while the band was still Joy Division all the way to their more mainstream success with \\"State of the Nation\\", \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\", and \\"True Faith\\".  It is an unconventional greatest hits album, featuring dance/club mixes and probably a little more material than warranted for a retrospective of their first 7 years.  Still, a must have for any New Order collection and a nice complement to the later greatest hit releases - \\"Best of New Order\\" (1995), and \\"International\\" (2002), and \\"Singles\\" (2005).  I'm personally a huge fan of their earlier stuff (nothing since has touched Bizarre Love Triangle and True Faith), and as such, Substance is the essential collection of New Order music.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|When &#34;Revolver&#34; was finally given the Remaster it deserved as part of the 09/09/09 total BEATLES catalogue CD reissue campaign – Fab Four nutters the world over rejoiced. They got the UK 14-track variant of the album in glorious STEREO – and man did it sound good. But the glossy easy-to-smudge 3-way foldout card digipak lacked the aesthetic feel of the 1966 album artwork (short playing time too with no Mono mix which could easily have been included) and the 24-page booklet was big on colour photos but short on actual album history or place.<br /><br />Well far be it for the Japanese to let that get in the way. Once again they get the last word – because this 2014 reissue campaign of Mini LP Repros for THE BEATLES on their patented SHM-CD format (Super High Materials) is truly gorgeous stuff and ups this already sonic wonder a further notch. &#34;And Your Bird Can Sing&#34; is too damn right. Here are the loaded details...<br /><br />Released 17 December 2014 (reissued 15 April 2015) and using the 2009 Remaster done at Abbey Road Studios - this Japan-only SHM-CD of &#34;Revolver&#34; by THE BEATLES on Universal/Apple UICY-76972 (Barcode 4988005867490) is a straightforward transfer of the UK 14-Track STEREO album.

Tomorrow Never Knows<br />&#34;Revolver&#34; (their 7th British album) was originally released 5 August 1966 in the UK on both Parlophone PMC 7009 Mono and PCS 7009 Stereo. The American issue followed 3 days later on Capitol T-2576 Mono and ST-2576 Stereo. The UK variant had 14 tracks (as listed above) - the US issue had 11. The three missing from the American LP (same artwork) were &#34;And Your Bird Can Sing&#34;, &#34;I'm Only Sleeping&#34; and &#34;Doctor Robert&#34; which had appeared on the June 1966 US album &#34;Yesterday And Today&#34;.<br /><br />Using the 09/09/09 STEREO MIX of the album – this Japanese SHM-CD reissue also decides to keep it simple and loses the enhanced CD track called &#34;Revolver Mini Documentary&#34; that came with the 09/09/09 releases (two-and-a-half minutes of video footage - largely black & white in-studio shots featuring the voices of the Fabs and George Martin discussing songs and techniques on the album - it's directed by BOB SMEATON). The Super High Materials CD (SHM-CD) does not require special audio equipment – it will play on all devices and Toshiba claim that it offers a better form of disc with increased retrieval details. As someone who owns about 20 of them - I've found that claim to be true. The audio on this sucker through my Marantz CD/AMP combo (paired up with Tannoy Mercury V4 speakers) is just beautiful. The accumulative effect is to have even the most jaundiced ear sit up and take notice. Then there's the sexy artwork...<br /><br />The EMI 24-page colour booklet returns as a separate entity - but there's also the usual 20-white-page Japanese booklet too that features some unreadable Japanese liner notes followed by the lyrics in English and a back page that pictures all 16 titles in this SHM-CD Reissue series. The attention to detail on the actual 1966 album sleeve is delicious. You get a hard card repro of the UK STEREO LP artwork complete with its glossy front sleeve and matt rear and 'flip back' flaps on the back cover (how did they reproduce this!). The label reflects the black and yellow lettering of the original British LP on Parlophone Records as does the rear cover artwork that advertises the use of an &#34;Emitex&#34; record cleaning cloth. They've even repro'd that Emitex inner bag too. There's an OBI strip – mine is Blue in colour for the 'Encore' reissue series of 2015 (see list below).<br /><br />The Audio Quality on the 09/09/09 CD Remaster was and is magnificent. Both GUY MASSEY and STEVE ROOKE remastered the first generation stereo master tapes and to say they've done a good job is like saying the Great Wall of China is an ok building-project. Their work here is fabulous – monumental almost - it really is. The sound quality is glorious throughout - clear, warm, detailed - every single track a revelation.<br /><br />The SHM-CD amplifies the punch in the brassy &#34;Got To Get You Into My Life&#34; and the delicate &#34;Here, There & Everywhere&#34;. The hiss level is barely audible on any of the songs - but what you do hear are new instrument flourishes. The brilliant George Harrison guitar playing on the New York Drug Pusher song &#34;Doctor Robert&#34; is at last to the fore, the lone horn work of Alan Civil on &#34;For No One&#34; is suddenly so pretty, while Ringo's superlative drumming on &#34;Tomorrow Never Knows&#34; is now absolutely huge to a point where the clarity and sheer whack of the Remaster brought me to tears. The strings on “Eleanor Rigby” are beautifully full and shock your senses even now - some five decades after the event. If you love this record, you're in for a treat. I love the wallop and anger in &#34;Taxman&#34; – guitars filling my speakers with venom. Another winner is the huge sound from &#34;She Said She Said&#34; where John feels like he's going to kick your speakers in (kick something in anyway). Ringo has his ditty moment with the mad &#34;Yellow Submarine” with those strange engine noises half way through somehow now more bizarre and creative than I remembered. And the riffage of &#34;Doctor Robert&#34; is equal to the splendor of &#34;Paperback Writer&#34;.<br /><br />Between this series of 16 SHM-CDs, the American Capitol Records collection and the white Mono Box set - I'd have to say that these three are the pinnacle of Fab Fourness - and Beatles collectors will quite rightly lust after and covet all three.<br /><br />What a band and what a recorded legacy they left behind. Float downstream indeed...and if you do...do it with this SHM-CD as your raft...<br /><br />PS: For info purposes - there are 16 STEREO titles in THE BEATLES Japanese SHM-CD Reissue Series.

B001UE27X8|5.0|I have been a Bill Evans fan for years.  He was an amazing jazz pianist with a classical background that proved his skill over and over again.  I was unaware that he cut an album with Tony Bennett, another one of my favorites and I quickly ordered the CD.  After just listening to the first few cuts I was sold.  The cuts are fabulous and as I noted above, listeners should pay close attention to the wonderful background Bill Evans provides that is quite fabulous.    The only turnoff is that some of the additional cuts of the same tunes are not too much different than the chosen ones and thus are redundant.  I would have preferred that they include only the cuts that are markedly different so that I could discern the differences and appreciate them.  But, in the end, the CD is well worth the investment and one of the best I have heard in many years. I am glad I bought it.
1433502437|5.0|A well made Bible (the Black Calfskin Edition), and a fine tool for study of Scripture. The notes are well done and solid. The illustrations (Tabernacle, Temple, and others, are some of the best I have seen.) A good set of maps. Pound for pound, the best Study Bible going. I am very pleased with mine. PLUS, getting an online edition gives another fine tool, and gives you two Bibles for one. I am very pleased with my copy! Pax Est Bonum.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|It's been a long time since I've purchased an album/cd on the day of release, but the publicity avalanche surrounding the Beatles' remasterings suckered me into buying the one Beatles album I really loved as a kid: Magical Mystery Tour.   Every track on the original EP was a shining example of the band's melodic and sonic experimentation, with a palpable sense of whimsy and wonder. The supplementary tracks comprise some of the greatest-ever Beatle songs, including the joyous All You Need Is Love and the song signalling the Beatles' transition to pop immortality, Strawberry Fields Forever.    At the sunset of the cd age these releases attempt to be the definitive audio documents of the modern pop era. If you were impressed by the upgrade afforded the tracks on Love, you'll feel similarly here.  Every track on MMT sounds vibrantly immediate, with plenty more depth in the sound field and a complete absence of background noise and hiss. Simply, these remasters sound like everything intended to be heard is present and everything extraneous has been removed.  The digipacks are also a distinct improvement over jewel cases: they're more tactile and enjoyable to handle and read, and in MMT's case the 36-page booklet reproduces the entire original release (yes, including the comic) plus new contemporary pix and new historical and recording notes. If Apple had included a plastic sleeve to protect the cd in its cardboard pocket the entire package would be perfect.   The only real gimmick is the Quicktime video, a 4 minute promo throwaway that adds little to the experience. It does the job of contextualising the music, though, and if you were to buy the entire collection they'd probably be very enjoyable viewed in toto.  So after all the hype? Yes, this remaster - at least - is worth the money. I'm not enough of a fan to buy the complete set, but if you have a favourite Beatles album you're thinking of getting you won't be cheated by these releases.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|The good: Great-looking booklets and covers accompany each Beatles remastered title. The books look great, although the text is a bit skimpy. The sound also is great. It's the original mix of \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" so purisits will love that fact (I do) while others who love \\"Love\\" and think the Beatles' music should be remixed and reimagined might beg to differ. I think we should simply have crystal-clear versions of what The Beatles wanted us to hear in the first place, and that is what these remasters give. There's a bit of compression on the stereo versions, but it doesn't seem to be overwhelming or cause ear fatigue. Paul's bass sounds really fantastic on \\"Pepper\\" and \\"Abbey Road,\\" especially.    The only down side to this campaign is the fact that each CD is housed in the cardboard sleeve of the tri-fold cover. You better put the actual CDs in jewel cases once you buy them, or they're going to get scratched, no matter how careful one might be.  :)

B001EAWMGA|4.0|Vikings vs. Aliens. What's not to love?<br /><br />A few years back, I read a very favorable review on Aintitcool News of a movie called \\"Reign of Fire,\\" a tale of post-apocalyptic Brits vs. the dragons which had decimated the Earth, with some help by a motley platoon of bad-ass Yanks (led by an altogether unrecognizably buff Matthew McConaughey).<br /><br />I know; right?<br /><br />And yet, it muscled its way incongruously onto the short list of the most effective, tightly-crafted monster movies I'd seen in a long time. From the mostly quite deft pacing, A-list production values, and (at times simply jaw-dropping) visual effects, to the surprisingly well-executed character work, \\"Reign\\" did things with a pretty absurd premise which led me to markedly expand the parameters of what I was willing to buy as raw material for a well-told story.<br /><br />Which is why, when I read rather a glowing review of \\"Outlander\\" on AICN (here:[...]), I did not immediately click back to my newsfeed. This is not a choice I regret, having just watched it.<br /><br />Is it as good as \\"Reign of Fire?\\" Hell, no. Does it deliver the crap sandwich you'd expect from the headline (interstellar traveler crash lands in 8th century Norway, inadvertently delivering a terrifying extraterrestrial beastie into the territory of a Viking king, with whom he must join forces to vanquish the creature that had killed his family on a distant colony world)? Oddly, no.<br /><br />Part of the credit goes to the casting, with a gravelly John Hurt as the King Rothgar (no, not \\"Hrothgar\\" but the ref was not lost) delivering a much-needed gravitas to the fur-sporting Vikings (among whom there was a welcome absence of horned helms), to John Caviezel as the stranded star man, Kainan, and the ever-spunky and appealing Sophia Myles as the king's daughter, the cast plays it straight. This is a good thing, since with a story like this, even the slightest wink would take one dangerously into \\"SyFy\\" territory.<br /><br />Caviezel's Kainan is a haunted, traumatized warrior with a stain on his conscience, and a major score to settle, but he is fundamentally a good man, whose frustration with the barbarians among whom he has landed is balanced by the debt he owes for the calamity he has inadvertently brought down on their heads. The process by which he wends his way into their reluctant good graces unfolds with a surprisingly satisfying exhibition of quiet virtue and bluster-free valor. Some will find his performance flat and monotonous, but I found subtleties which quite compensate for the lack of scenery-chewing machismo (the Vikings shoulder that burden with a delightfully over-the-top mannish elan).<br /><br />Jack Huston plays Wulfric, the impetuous heir of Rothgar's kingdom with a nice blend of obnoxious testosterone and a promise of unpolished wisdom whose development through the course of the story is surprisingly effective, given how badly you want to brain him with a battle axe at the beginning of the story. His clumsy courtship of Myles' Freya and his bull-headed hostility toward Kainan form the concrete expressions of Rothgar's otherwise generic-sounding reservations about his readiness to claim the throne. We can actually see where he falls short in the role of a true leader, and we get to watch him confront those shortcomings, learn just the right amount of humility, and grow both as a character and as a king-in-waiting. It's a good turn for Huston, somewhat reminiscent of Karl Urban's Eomer in \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" He's one to watch, as he brings an appealing humanity to a role which was seemingly made for a cardboard cut-out treatment.<br /><br />And then there's the creature, a coal-black, vaguely reptilian monster known as a \\"Moorwen.\\" It's an all-CG creation which still manages to convey terrifyingly realistic presence and menace. The physics engine used in the rendering of the creature was expertly deployed; the beast never violated the rules of its motion and mass, moving with impressive speed and grace, but still conveying a daunting sense of weight and power. It phosphoresces with eerie beauty in the night, before striking with its long, whip-like tail, slicing through Vikings like a hot knife through butter. Best of all, as we learn more about its back-story, even the creature takes on a distinctly sympathetic dimensionality, without ever losing its brutality (and, again, the \\"Beowulf\\" reference is in evidence, as there are clear but non-slavish affinities with Grendel). The SFX team struck just the right balance between preserving the mystery of the thing's appearance, and refraining from annoyingly coy concealment.<br /><br />Yes, it drags a bit in the third act. Yes, some of the \\"comic relief\\" was a bit broad. No there was not nearly enough of the great Ron Perlman as a rival tribesman. Yes, Kainan's Honorary Viking Costume was laughably silly.<br /><br />But c'mon, it's Vikings vs. aliens. What're you expecting, King Lear?<br /><br />UPDATE: Here on AICN ([...]) are some neat making-of featurettes which do not appear on the US DVD, but are planned for inclusion on the upcoming UK Blu-Ray release (there is at this time no planned US Blu-Ray release for this film...and what's up with that?!). Some spoilers, but nothing too earth-shattering, and they do give a nice taste of the film (worth it just for Ron Perlman's brief, hilarious interview).

0156034026|4.0|I admire Mohsin Hamid for the masterful way he tells the complex life story of Changez through a seamless monologue in The Reluctant Fundamentalist.  I say complex, but in many ways Changez life contained the typical life hurdles faced by any young man:  the innocent pursuit and longing for a love relationship that is not to be; the confusion as the identity instilled in you through family and culture is challenged by new and sparkly things; and the challenges faced when we realize we relate to the view from the outside as we stand amidst the insiders.    Changez seemed to me an actor or fraud in almost all aspects of his life.  He seemed a person bent on denying who he was.  At college he hid his financial status by working jobs in a neighboring city; at work he hid his family circumstances and his upraising to all but his boss (who identified it for Changez); in his relationship with Erica he willing took the persona of her dead lover to have the opportunity to make love to her; and upon returning to his homeland denied the positives of what he had been given in America.  He could have been a powerful positive voice against what he saw as negatives in the Pakistan-United States relationship upon his return.  Instead he amplified the negatives.  A pity, but so it is.    Throughout the book I also kept thinking that this story could equally be written on a domestic level.  An anxious and nervous white man eyes his surroundings as he listens to the story of a kind black man in Harlem, or an anxious and nervous black man eyes his surroundings as he listens to the story by a kind Latino man in East Los Angeles, or an anxious and nervous Latino man eyes his surroundings as he listens to the story of a kind Italian man in Little Italy in any town, and so on.  Maybe that's the point, on a micro level we're all the same as on a macro level.    One point did seem a stretch to me in the book.  Changez has lived his life as a quiet, respectful man who seldom was the outspokenvoice in any situation.  Yet, the book is centered on a multi-hour monologue by Changez to a complete stranger.  This seemed a stretch to me.    Enjoy the book.  It's a great read that has multiple layers.
1416594892|2.0|The prose is brilliant and the characters well-developed.  Unfortunately, my appreciation for this novel ends right there.  Many of the characters' actions are silly and nonsensical, but the worst part is the novel's conclusion -- the most disappointing of any espionage thriller I have ever read.  Throughout the story the reader is lead to believe the plot is heading towards something big.  It is not.  The ending is small, gratuitous, unresolving, and doesn't even make sense, since the concluding event could have easily happened 100 pages earlier in the story and saved the reader so much utterly pointless plot development.    This novel ultimately amounts to little more than an anti-America cheapshot.  Give this one a pass.
B00005RDRO|5.0|In Neil Simon's classic mid-70s farce MURDER BY DEATH, five detectives (based on such fictional characters as Sam Spade and Hercule Poirot) and their sidekicks are invited to an atmospheric mansion for dinner and an opportunity to solve a murder that will occur at exactly midnight.

B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is my third time to purchase Lonesome Dove: first on VHS, then on full-screen DVD, now on wide screen DVD. I got a wide screen hi-def TV and couldn't stand watching my old DVD of Lonesome Dove, which had the same quality as a VHS, so I had to get an upgraded DVD and it was worth it. You also get a bonus feature of the making of Lonesome Dove which is very interesting.
1595141715|3.0|This book format was very interesting to me...very mysterious and almost creepy at times.  However, like other reviewers have noted, I didn't feel as sorry or concerned about Hannah as perhaps the author intended the reader to feel.  She was irresponsible and definitely wanted to feel like a victim without much concern about the victimization of others which she helped cause.  Yes, someone should have helped Hannah.  Yes, she deserved to be heard.  But she was not completely innocent herself, and I found myself relating to the main character, Clay, when he feels angry and irritated with her and her actions.      On to my question:  I read the ARC of this book...some 30 pages less than the official book.  Can anyone tell me (if they have read the ARC and printed book...) how they differ and if the differences are worth checking out the official printed copy to read?  I figure with 30 more pages, there must be a lot more information but...maybe there isn't much else added.  Or perhaps the font type was set differently in the original printed version which in turn made the page length longer...    Anyone know?

Cleverly written with not so flawless heros and surprises around every corner.  And of course a Happy Ending for everyone!    Loved it!
630469654X|4.0|I've been a lifetime lover of fantasy movies, and when a friend asked me if I'd seen Ladyhawke (to which I had to reply no), I immediately went out and rented it. After one viewing, I have bought it. It's that good! The characters, from the delightful but mischievous Mouse to the dark, hateful Bishop, are well developed and really draw you into their story. A bit of a Romeo and Juliet story with a twist, if you enjoy fantasy movies or romance, you will want to see this one!
B0025KVLTM|5.0|This is the first of the 2009 Beatles' remastered albums I've listened to, and it's amazing to me. The voices are fuller, clearer, more separated and more immediately personal to the listener than I've ever heard before. The instruments are richer, layered, with more depth and better definition than the previous available disc by far. There's sound here I've never been able to fully hear or appreciate before this remaster. I thought a lot about replacing all my Beatles CDs with the new ones--worth it or not? If the changes were only minimal the answer would be no. But I couldn't resist, and I'm glad I didn't. It's a case of the familiar favorite made almost brand new, sounding so fresh and \\"now\\". They were so young and so great then, and now their original sounds are made so glorious again today.

B000022TSW|5.0|this is a very well written and produced south park movie. the only south park movie i should add.  very funny, if you watch the comedy central TV show, give this one a try, you will love it, i have seen this movie many times and every time it still feels good and great. love every bit of it.    the story is good and original, keeps all characters to what they usually do, no extra weird stuff where the movie looses plot or character. a couple of new things but not too much to where it gets annoying or not intresting...    buy the movie, dont rent it, you will watch it many times and luagh out loud...    v/r  YJMT

B000JML90Y|5.0|This is a quick review of the book not a dissertation on Darwin or any other subject loosely related. At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" (see my review). I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.<br /><br />Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).<br /><br />If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)<br /><br />The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. Or the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.<br /><br />In the end it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0316109339 The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski]]

B0026BD2GK|4.0|Well CBS/Sony finally got all the Santana Woodstock performance together on a single CD. Every song but Evil Ways had been previously been released. So to us true fans we are in effect paying for 1 song.

It is very much like other Santana performances from the same period that can be heard on live tapes and bootleg CDs.<br /><br />Nice packaging with a fold out poster but why did they make the outer box bigger that a standard CD case?  It doesn't fit on my shelf next to all the other prized Santana CDs
1448648440|5.0|A thoroughly entertaining and powerful story.  While it is so simply and elegantly written, and easy to understand and appreciate, there are also deep issues beneath the surface. Not only a chronicle of the swift change in England in the early 20th century from a ridge class system to a open, (then) union dominated and semi-free society of a poor nation that lost its empire and identity, the book is much, much more.      For those of us in this era, the message of \\"Only Connect!\\" is something more important (and ironic that it is found in this book).  It could well be written for America today.    Better than the movie, (which was first rate), a book that TRULY needs to be read!      Enjoy this charming edition. I loved the cover!
B000NVADJY|5.0|This is a must read for anyone interested in near death experiences.  It was sincere and inspirational.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I ran across David Garrett on a television show, and HAD to get a CD.  This young man is an amazing artist, with an excellent sense of composition and what works for his instrument.  Who would think to convert Michael Jackson's 'Smooth Criminal' to a violin instrumental, not to mention the other artists that he so deftly transforms?  I play his music in my office, and it really smooths out the day.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|The fourth season follows in the foot steps of the previous Supernatural dvd boxes.    You get your awesome 22 episodes, the best gag reel ever (Why the gag reel is the star of every Supernatural dvd box: The Supernatural crew uses 3 different songs in a ten minutes gag reel. Amazing!!), extended and unaired scenes (love the extended Castiel Dean scene, the Uriel Castiel talk etc.), 3 commentaries (4.03 by Kripke and Carver, 4.21 by Singer and Gamble, 4.22 by Kripke) Luckily they returned from the way too short and not so entertaining closer look segments (season 3 box) to real episode commentaries. Some tv series have more commentaries but at least the 3 Supernatural ones are ALL entertaining but I wouldn't mind MORE on the next dvd box.    \\"The mythologies of Supernatural: From heaven to hell\\" didn't sound very exciting to me but it's actually pretty good and detailed. The have some new experts talking about archangels, miracles, demons etc. and several members of the Supernatural crew (Kripke, Carver, Gamble, Edlund, Sgriccia etc.).  There are 3 Ghostfacers easter eggs which are nice but nothing new cause I'm a regular visitor at the ghosfacers website. I appreciate that we get easter eggs at all but I wished they had done something new for the dvds.    All in all a great dvd box for an amazing fourth season!  The only thing which I really hated was the NEW PACKAGING! I HATE IT! I WANT THE OLD ONE BACK NOT THE PLASTIC STUFF!  PS: For everyone that doesn't know Supernatural and wants to give it a try \\"THE FOURTH SEASON IS CERTAINLY THE BEST SO FAR\\", so if you only want to buy one Supernatural season buy this one! It's awesome!!!
B001EO748M|4.0|Season two of \\"The Tudors\\" offers ten engaging, often emotional, episodes revolving around the issues and happenings in King Henry VIII's court during the period of his marriage to Anne Boleyn.  It's to the show's credit that we still feel great sympathy for Queen Anne and Henry's friend Sir Thomas More when they meet their ultimate fates, as the creative forces behind the stories weren't afraid to also let us see their unsavory and less than noble aspects prior to their well documented ends.<br /><br />That's a generally strong point of \\"The Tudors\\": the presentation of the players in all their positive and negative glory.  You may have favorites among the characters, but it won't be because the producers are stacking the deck by presenting them in a better light than history says they may warrant.  If there's one character, however, who is increasingly a challenge to like at all in these episodes, it's King Henry himself, who revels more and more in his power and lusts as the season progresses.  This doesn't make him any less interesting to watch, but he ultimately comes off not so much as a man of great complexity, just one of great appetites.<br /><br />Season two of \\"The Tudors\\" looks serviceably well on standard DVD, and the final disc contains a small handful of brief but interesting extra features.  One of the better featurettes shows actress Natalie Dormer, who plays Anne Boleyn in the program, visiting the final resting place of the real Queen Anne, as a local historian fills her in on the details on the Queen's last days.  The special features also include complete \\"sneak peek\\" episodes from two other Showtime series, \\"Californication\\" and \\"An American Life\\".
B001EO748M|4.0|All the same.  This is NOT History, its Hollywood.   If you know the difference it will mean more.  If not, you will still like it.  Just don't believe almost anything.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|Generally well done adaptation of the Robert B. Parker western novel about roving lawmen-for-hire Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch.  The movie preserves one of the book's main themes: balancing the attempt to be lawful and legal in a setting that often demands that savage violence be met with more of the same to put down chaos.  Some may find the movie a little slow and methodical, but if you enjoy good dialogue and well-drawn characterizations, you should enjoy the film well enough.  And if you do indeed like it, you can read more about Cole and Hitch not only in the original novel \\"Appaloosa\\", but in its sequels \\"Resolution\\" and \\"Brimstone\\".<br /><br />\\"Appaloosa\\" looks and sounds very good on standard DVD and features a handful of interesting extra features, most of the \\"behind the scenes of the film\\" variety.  I was disappointed, however, that- aside from the producers saying that the movie came from a book- there is no specific mention of author Robert B. Parker, let alone an interview with him, in the various featurettes.  Mr. Parker, creator of the \\"Spenser\\" and \\"Jesse Stone\\" mystery series, is an engaging and facinating figure, and it would have been interesting to hear him speak about why he starting writing a western series at this point in his career and what he thought about the movie it inspired.
0545123267|5.0|This book was different and really addicting - I could not put it down!  Great characters, great story!
B000P12LWY|3.0|Engrossing and spectacularly produced, to be enjoyed as entertainment, not history, as it contains many errors of fact. For instance, the writers throw in a couple of completely fabricated homosexual affairs, seemingly just for the hell of it. And a fabricated murder of a royal, married to the (historically) wrong princess. And some of the timelines are messed up. And the series starts with the murder of someone who wasn't murdered. And completely wrong on a suicide and someone going crazy.<br /><br />But, due to its contemporary feel, it succeeds in getting the viewer interested in this period of history, if nothing more than to check up on its accuracy.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|In my opinion, Coldplay music is so much better live.  The studio versions seem so one-dimensional and lack the depth and fullness of the live versions.  And they haven't made many of the live performances available on DVD so this is really a gem.  Although the live DVD performance isn't as dynamic as the newer (2006 Canadian concert or 2009 Viva la Vida) concerts, it is always great to be able to see them play their guitars and piano, belt out the lyrics and interact with the crowd.  Chris Martin seems to have really come into his own, becoming more comfortable commanding the stage and the audience as the years went by.  For the hardcore fan, the DVD was shot with multiple angles which is included on the DVD as a feature so that you can see Jonny on lead, Guy on bass, Will on drums and Chris all at the same time.    I feel I got far more than my money's worth at $18 for this set.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Probably the best uplifting entertaining movie I've seen in a long, long time.  Love the entire cast and the great music.  We need more movies like Mamma Mia!!!!!!!!!!
B001TODCII|4.0|The action in Taken was amazing. It was riveting. Who cares if Liam Neesom is like a cat with nine lives.
0307456625|4.0|I decided to read the book because being an avid reader, I am always looking for more to read.  This looked like a book that has gained popularity and is also a series book, so if I really enjoyed it, there's more to look forward to.  I found that Precious Ramotswe is a good person and someone I'd seek out as a friend after reading about her.  The book had an unexpected format, and I found myself drawn in to life in Botswana, of which I knew nothing.  The characters are quietly real, as opposed to colorful caricature, and I appreciate this.  The book reads from a woman's point of view, which only illustrates the author's talent.  The book has very different pacing from the average detective type fiction, yet it does nothing to take away from the plot.  I have subsequently read three more of the series and look forward to reading the rest of them.
1931382794|5.0|This is great book for an introduction to training with a power meter. Discusses specific power meters and the pros/cons of each. Then gives a good start to power and lot's of examples on how to use the power data and what it all means. I will be referring to this book often as I train.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|When I first saw this as a TV miniseries, I was so afraid the characters wouldn't match up to the ones in the book. However, they couldn't have done a better job.(Think \\"Gone with Wind\\", it was that perfect of a representation.) It has everything an excellent movie should have; action, comedy, love, sadness, and a genuine connection with the characters. The realism and interaction between the lives of people involved is what makes this so special. Don't pass this by because you think it's just a western. I'm not a huge western movie fan myself, so make an exception for this one. I would also recommend the book, if you like to read. This is a movie I watch when I'm home for a length of time, such as rainy days off, home sick,etc., because it is a long movie and it's hard to find a place to pause until another time. After watching it at least every other year or so, it still makes me cry. Now that's a great movie!
B0029LHW4A|5.0|Jet continue to impress with this new release. It is a slick, well written, perfectly executed and nicely produced effort from the Aussie lads. Their previous release, \\"Shine On\\" did not fare as well critically or in terms of actual album sales as their debut,\\"Get Born\\". As good as an album as it was, \\"Shine On\\" was a huge disappointment for the band. With \\"Shaka Rock\\" the band seems to have a chip on their shoulder about this fact and appear poised to reclaim the success they had with their debut. This new album is good enough to get them there. Hopefully the combination of nasty critics and a fickle American rock audience won't bury their chances. This is easily one of the better bands of the last decade and you owe it to yourself AND the genre of Rock 'N Roll itself to go and buy this album. You won't be disappointed.    The best tracks in my opinion are \\"K.I.A\\", \\"She's A Genius\\", \\"Seventeen\\", \\"La Di Da\\", \\"Goodbye Hollywood\\", \\"Start The Show\\", and \\"She Holds A Grudge\\".  The only tracks I could take or leave are \\"Black Hearts (on Fire)\\" and \\"Let Me Out\\".    I love this band. I have no idea why they aren't huge. Go buy this record.

It's still the favourite of my son Felipe...he loves this big white lion with no shades....<br /><br />Few days later, I finally have this on CD...and this is the first time that I can listen the bass sounds better than on my old LP....James Lomenzo is a great bass player....<br /><br />I'm so so happy..this is not my first Cd, but really one of my personal Billboard...<br /><br />Thanks Amazon...<br /><br />In Colombia I can't find this CD for several years....(when it was on the record store, i remember that it was so expensive)

B002KSPKRS|4.0|The X41 is a nice headset hands down. I too owned the X4 and glad that I did.  Gaming has never been better for me.  Well, I saw the X41 available and thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* I think the sounds quality is better than the X4. It seems more crisp.<br />* Now uses RF versus IR so true line of sight is no longer required.<br />* The headset is definitely lighter.<br />* The controls on the headset were better thought out and easier to use with one hand while wearing it.<br /><br />Minor Annoyances:<br />* Some may like the fact the microphone cable is no longer a puck connection to the controller.  So far, I do not like the volume control and mute being in-line with the cable. It is a little more inconvenient to easily mute quickly.  With the puck design, you did not have to take your hand off of the controller while playing to change volume or muting, but now you do.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The volume control on the headset seems to not be right. If I start as low as it will go, I have to go about three quarters of the way before I hear an sound and then it grows fast from there.<br />* The microphone works the same way as the headset volume.  Hard to get it just right.  You have to go at least half way to hear anything and once you do hear something, the slightest movement up is too loud.<br />* Battery life compared to the X4 is about 40% less.  Most likely due to the RF connectivity versus the IR.<br />* The RF is very poor through even one wall 10 feet away.  At least with the X4, you may have lost audio altogether when you went to another room, but at least you could still talk on the mic.  The headset starts making loud crackles and pops when I move into the other room and is hard on the ears, so I have to turn them off or take them off.<br /><br />Outright Bad:<br />Just one bad thing noticed so far.  The manual states that one way to tell your batteries are getting low is that you will start to hear crackling and pops.  Well let me tell you, at least for me, that is an outright lie.  I was playing on Live as usual.  I heard one quick crackle, played 5 more seconds, then the nastiest loudest screech and crackle and pooping came to my ears.  It honestly hurt until, as quickly as I could, took the headset off.  I do not play super loud, so if I did, then it would have been a huge problem.<br /><br />Overall a very nice headset.  I hope I got a bad device as I am exchanging this one for another to see if these issues will be better.  Either way, worth working through the problems, but definitely not a 5 star product yet.Live as usual.

0385342020|4.0|'Twenties Girl' starts off slow for the fist 200 pages, but then picks up and turns into a pretty good read. I liked the book over all, but it really isn't Kinsella's best work. The book had the potential to be great, but just kind up ended up okay/good. I feel sorry for these writers who are expected to push out a book a year. To me, quality is always better then quantity.  Don't pass this book up though. It is better then a lot of the stuff that is out there.

Grant you, a lot of people were complaing about why not release thes tracks as bonus tracks on the 12 digitally remastered CD's?  The track listing could have been like this as bonus tracks(My Version):<br />PLEASE PLEASE ME-Love Me Do(single)/From Me To You/Thank You Girl.<br />WITH THE BEATLES-She Loves You/I Want To Hold Your Hand and their B sides.<br />A HARD DAYS NIGHT- Long Tall Sally EP<br />BEATLES FOR SALE-I Feel Fine/She's A Woman<br />HELP!-Bad Boy/Yes It Is/I'm Down<br />RUBBER SOUL-Day Tripper/We Can Wor It Out<br />REVOLVER-Paparback Writer/Rain<br />WHITE ALBUM-Lady Madonna/Hey Jude and their B sides<br />ABBEY ROAD-Balled Of John & Yoko/Old Brown Shoe<br />LET IT BE-Let It Be/Get Back and their B sides.<br />'Across The Universe' I would have put that on LET IT BE because it does appear on there (Great Song). The Reason I picked Lady Madonna on the White Album is Because All the tracks on the CD's were released in 1968.

B002JYPV3G|3.0|Like the other reviews have mentioned....there are some important elements missing from this updated, \\"Ten Year Anniversary\\" version.  Frail Limb Nursery is missing!!! I bought this cd for the third time due to myself losing the original with Purity and F.L.N., on it.  Even though i looked at the back before purchasing and noticed that F.L.N. wasn't listed, i just figured that they attached it onto the Purity track  since they went into each other anyways. So, i have purity and all the other songs that are extra's, but where is F.L.N.? Like another reviewer mentioned, if this is the anniversary edition, wouldn't they want to include everything that they already released? Anyone happen to have Frail Limb Nursery and would be able to email it to me as an mp3? Also, it would of been nice to have the ending of scissors before it goes into the hidden track Eeyore on this as well. If you ask me the band should recall all these and re-do it the way it really is supposed to be...

B00269FOHM|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE.  THE STORY LINE IS GREAT AND THE ACTING IS AWESOME.
B0021L8US0|4.0|\\"District 9\\"', the new film from director Neil Blomkamp and producer Peter Jackson (\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy) is action packed, filled with great special effects and even has a bit of a message, all things we rarely, if ever, see in a summer blockbuster. But the film is a bit all over the place and this dilutes the power of such an original project. It's a lot of fun to watch, but it meanders a bit too much.<br /><br />A while back, a huge spaceship entered the atmosphere over Johannesburg, South Africa, basically coming to a stop over the sprawling city. Anxious to find out what was going on, the authorities send some people up to the spaceship and they cut into it, revealing a bunch of aliens who were sick and in need of attention. Their solution is to set them up in a segregated community called District 9. The place quickly becomes a slum and the authorities spend most of their time trying to keep the aliens inside the confines of the District and their crime to a minimum. We get all of this information through a documentary film crew who are giving us a recap. The government has decided to reclaim the district, because they have no more room and the aliens have to go. Wikus Van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), the poster boy for the MNU (Multi National United) is awarded the task of providing eviction notices to the 'prawns\\" as they are commonly referred to. He is extremely proud and sets off for District 9. Soon, they meet some resistance and Wikus is accidentally exposed to their biotechnology. He begins to sense strange things happening and his body starts to change, taking on some of the appearance of the 'prawns'. Now a fugitive, he eventually decides to hide out amongst the rest of his new people. When he learns some secrets about the MNU, he decides to help one of the alien's resistance leaders fight back against the oppression they have been facing.<br /><br />\\"Distrct 9\\" came about because Peter Jackson and Neil Blomkamp were going to make a film based on the video game \\"Halo\\". That was delayed, so they decided to work together to make this film which is based on a short film the director made a number of years earlier. It is an unusual, inventive film and shows great promise for this director. It is easy to see why Jackson was so keen to make this film with the director.<br /><br />The film is presented as a documentary and opens with a selection of newsreel footage bringing us up to speed. What we quickly learn is that an alien spaceship is sitting above Johannesburg, South Africa and all of the inhabitants have been segregated into a slum called District 9. Shortly after this happens, a piece of the spaceship falls to Earth and the authorities have never been able to find it. Now the government wants the land back and the aliens have to go. Wikus, a clueless government plebe is excited to receive the opportunity to be the face of the eviction effort. If successful, he knows that his career will really take off, this despite the fact his father-in-law is in charge of the MNU. He sets off, complete with a security force, and they make their way to the slum. They quickly run into resistance and Wikus gets separated from his team. He seeks refuge with a male prawn and his young son, but gets exposed to their DNA, causing him to begin to transform. Scared out of his mind, he tries to hide it, to keep away from people, but his secret quickly becomes known and the MNU starts to hunt for him, because he could hold the key to some very important questions they have been trying to answer.<br /><br />As the film progresses, we watch as Wikus tries to navigate through the various landscapes, both alien and human, adapting to his new life. During these moments, the film leaves the documentary format behind, returning to this narrative style throughout, flowing from one format of the narrative and back again seamlessly.<br /><br />Sharlto Copley, a native South African, plays Wikus and he does a very good job with the role. A virtual unknown, Blomkamp cast him for his short film and he plays the same character in both films. I was impressed by his work and how well he handles all of the different emotions and situations his character experiences. In the beginning, his hair slicked back, his white button down short sleeve shirt complete with a pen sticking out of the pocket; this guy could not be anything but a bureaucrat. He is filled with fresh-faced optimism at his new position and even excited about the new responsibility. As he goes through his day, and the situation deteriorates, his optimism remains throughout. He never willingly says a bad word about his employer, even when he discovers some shocking secrets about them.<br /><br />Only when the situation becomes dire, does he truly realize the gravity and danger he is now in. Only then, does he switch his alliance and start looking to new people for help and assistance.<br /><br />I like the fact it takes a long time for Wikus to change, to see the light. If he starts to doubt the MNU, the people he works for, that means he has to accept that his body has become infected. It also seems completely natural for his character to offer his help to the alien father in return for his help. He has a lifelong bias toward these creatures and that isn't going to change overnight.<br /><br />The CGI (Computer Generated Imagery or effects) work in the film is truly remarkable. From the moment we first see one of the aliens, they seem real; every movement is flawless, everything they do seems to work. In a way, I think it was a daring decision for Blomkamp and Jackson to create a film about aliens existing in our world. They have to make the creatures seem even more realistic, even more alive, because they are living in a real world, a world we recognize. It would have been a little easier for them to have the aliens living in their world, to make them seem real because they are in a fictional world. Because they would have to create the background for these creatures, they can hide some flaws and movements. In our world, they have to work extra hard to make everything fit, to make them seem real in a real world.<br /><br />It is also interesting to see the huge spaceship floating above the city in newsreel footage, more so because the footage is from different times and places, the quality changing greatly from one clip to the next. The spaceship appears all the more convincing because in some clips we don't even see all of it. It is that big. Then, when we finally get some close looks at it, it appears menacing and ominous and frightening. But then we remember a key fact. The ship appears to be broken down.<br /><br />The action is also great. Blomkamp has a real no-holds-barred style and really puts us in the thick of the action. One of the key plot points in the film is the aliens have all of this advanced weaponry with them, weaponry the MNU wants to learn about and get hold of. The corporation captures some weapons, but they only work when operated by the aliens, so they learn little and don't get the results they want. During some of the battles, Wikus gets his hands on some of these weapons and his evolving DNA allows him to use them. And they prove helpful to him, but also frighteningly deadly.<br /><br />But \\"District 9\\" is too unwieldy a film. It revisits locations, putting Wikus through the same situations a few times and this only makes the film seem repetitive. For instance, he journeys to MNU twice and has to fight his way out each time.<br /><br />There are also a few plot points that don't mesh as well as the others. As soon as we learn about the aliens who have been segregated to this slum, we learn about a band of Nigerian gangsters who have opened up a black market with the creatures. The Nigerians want the weapons these creatures have and considering the prawns are willing to trade the weapons for cans of cat food, everyone feels like they have made a deal. When the Nigerians learn of Wikus, and his special new skills, they want him as bad as the MNU and everyone else. So their paraplegic leader sends bands of his men after him.<br /><br />This storyline just seems extraneous. Quite frankly, the MNU is a more menacing villain, so the Nigerian gangsters seem like time filler.<br /><br />But \\"District 9\\" has a lot to offer and a lot of originality we don't often find or experience in a summer blockbuster.<br /><br />Regarding the cat food... The aliens find they have a taste for the feline staple and willingly trade for cans of the stuff. When everyone learns this, the cat food takes on a new currency in unscrupulous hands.<br /><br />\\"District 9\\" is definitely worth a look. It is worth your time and money. And see it now, so when \\"District 10\\" comes out, you aren't scrambling to rent the first film. Or waiting impatiently for Netflix to send it to you.<br /><br />And I am definitely interested to see what else Neil Blomkamp brings to the silver screen. I get the sense he is someone to watch.ments. In our world, they have to work extra hard to make everything fit, to make them seem real in a real world.

When everyone learns this, the cat food takes on a new currency in unscrupulous hands.    \\"District 9\\" is definitely worth a look. It is worth your time and money. And see it now, so when \\"District 10\\" comes out, you aren't scrambling to rent the first film. Or waiting impatiently for Netflix to send it to you.    And I am definitely interested to see what else Neil Blomkamp brings to the silver screen. I get the sense he is someone to watch.
0671646788|5.0|This was a very good read.  It re-enforced the need for positive thinking.  Since beginning to read it positive things have been happening to me.  I recommend for anybody struggling at work or home.
0439023491|5.0|This book is YA at its best. Rarely do I wait with this much anticipation for a sequel. After reading Hunger Games - the number one most circulated book in my school library -- I couldn't imagine that Suzanne Collins could duplicate that success with the second volume in the series. I was so wrong!  This book was fantastic, and before you read the rest of this, go ahead and place your order for the book!<br /><br />I really wasn't sure where the author would go with this second book in a planned trilogy. Where [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] left off, I thought we'd be back in District 12 planning a wedding or something. I didn't expect what transpired. So as to avoid spoilers, I can't say much more than that this novel is action packed, emotionally constructed, and brilliantly written. Suzanne Collins is a superb writer. The scenes are vividly described, the characters are the type that you want to take home, hug, and raise as family. I love Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and the entire cast and crew of this world of Panem.<br /><br />Hey out there -- this would make the best movie!  I was glued to the pages and raced to the end of this novel -- sad when it ended on a cliffhanger because I don't know if I can bear to wait for the next volume in this saga.<br /><br />I had preordered this novel for my high school library and bought copies for my nieces and nephews. Honestly -- this is futuristic fantasy at its best. Don't miss out...and yes, you must read the prior novel in the series before you read this one to get the full impact from it and the pleasure.<br /><br />BUY NOW.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|How great is it that all the Beatles albums are remastered?!?  Anyone with any type of musical inclination knows the groundbreaking and musical importance that the Beatles had on popular culture.  Like them or love them, there is no denying the beauty that is the Beatles!  I was lucky enough to pre-order this box set before it was sold out, and boy was I lucky!  This box set is beautiful, having all of the Beatles cds in one glorious box.  I've been a Beatles fan for a very long time, and while I wasn't around for the Beatlemania of the 60's, I still cherish and appreciate their music today.  Listening to these albums is like being reacquainted with an old friend, and it becomes all the more enjoyable hearing the crispness and beauty in remastered stereo sound.  Sure the set is a little pricey, but it's well worth it!  This box set is for the true music lover and is to be cherished for many years to come.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I picked up my copy this morning (Oceanic time) and I have spent the day goofing off work and listening to the remastered albums.    This set is basically a no brainer for anyone who likes the Beatles. Playing these discs alongside the old versions they replace is somewhat of a revelation. I had not realized quite how bad the 1987 CD releases were until today. Listening to this set is a continuous process of noticing things you hadn't heard before and experiencing moments where the additional clarity and presence of the remastered recording conveys the sheer intensity that the Beatles were capable of producing. In particular, Ringo's drums sound much better and McCartney's bass has much more presence and punch. The guitars sound much more natural than they do on the old versions. In general the effect of the remasters is to properly reveal the musicianship of the band, which the old versions did not do justice to.    The box is sturdy and the discs come in individual replica sleeves. The albums are all the British releases (Parlophone and Apple), plus Magical Mystery Tour (Capitol), which I believe was a US release first (I may be mistaken). There is also a set of short documentaries. One caveat is that the discs are slide out, which I don't like as it may mark the discs, but if you are careful it should present no problem. Overall it is a nice package with an appealing design that no-one should be ashamed at having on their shelf.    Due to limitations of the early recordings, these have instruments coming out of one speaker and vocals out of the other. Nothing can be done about this, and it sounds fine over normal speakers, but it may bother people who prefer to listen through headphones. If you are truly hardcore, purchasing the mono remasters will solve this problem, but at a steep additional cost. The stereo versions, IMHO, will suffice for most people.    When I heard that this set was coming out, I banned myself from listening to Beatles music until it was inmy possession. This turned out to be a good move, since I anticipate spending the next few weeks playing these discs over and over again.    To sum up, I am extremely happy with this set. It has made the Beatles new again for me.
0316789798|5.0|As a homeschool mom, I'm always looking for good quality educational books for my children.  I found this little art book at a yard sale and thought the children would enjoy it.  The only problem we've had is that they fight over who gets to use it next.  I actually enjoy sketching some of the little critters in the book myself from time to time and ALL my children - ages 6 to 13 - just love it.  Of course the drawings aren't higher level art class type material, but the author does teach the basic strokes and shows the reader how to take shapes such as triangles, circles, lines, squares, etc. and turn those shapes into the little animals you create.  It's fabulous.  ANYONE could draw with this book.  And quite honestly, I love these types of drawings - simple pen or pencil drawings without a lot of frill.  We usually use a black pen for the lines and then fill in with colored pencils.<br /><br />For homeschoolers in particular, this book would make a particularly nice addition to your art supplies.  Students can use the book with an adult during planned lessons or completely independently when they just want to sketch informally.  With the focus on basic shapes and concepts of drawing animals, homeschool parents could use this book as a semester or year's complete art curriculum for a preschool, kindergarten, or early elementary age child.<br /><br />In summary, this is a fabulous book and the little sketches are fun for young children and even for more advanced or older students!<br /><br />Sonya Haskins, author of [[ASIN:0764204432 Homeschooler's Book of Lists, The: More than 250 Lists, Charts, and Facts to Make Planning Easier and Faster]]
B001SO6KNS|1.0|i'm putting 1 star because of the price $60 is outrageous.! but the movie is awesome overall 5 STARS for that!
0307387178|5.0|This was an excellent book. Given the difficulty of writing about such a story, i thought Jon did an excellent job. I really felt a part of the story, as if i were a fly on the wall. Could not put it down.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|simply amazing sounding.  i am in love. box set is the way to go, significant savings over purchasing discs separately
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|First of all, let me say that I could never understand why the Beatles never came out with a higher quality cd, such as sacd. That being said, after listening to the new Abbey Road remaster, it may not be needed.  I have HDCD's, 20 bit remasters, 24 karat gold cds remasters, 16 bit remasters, 24 bit remasters, plus quite a few sacd's and dvd audio disks in my collection. This standard cd remaster of Abbey Road is much improved over the original master, and a relative bargain, I paid $12.99 for it. The sound is much cleaner and bigger. This cd sounds just as good as HDCD's that I have, and even some of the 24 karat remasters from original master disks, but I paid more for those. The Beatles, Apple, and Capital should all be congratulated for offering the millions of Beatle fans a fantastic and long overdue remaster collection at a bargain price.
B00013RC8O|4.0|This was a great movie that stayed in my mind for days! This was my  first time watching it. I can now see that this was the film from which all chase movies modeled themselves afterwards. Especially, the chase scenes in the Mad Max movies. No CGI like today.    However, my only complaint is that the story really felt like it was riding the exhaust of Easy Rider. Almost same themes and premise.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|My first Beatles acquisition, (on an extremely low def and low quality EMI cassette), was Abbey Road.  Grade Ten seems like a long time ago in Calcutta and quite honestly I did not know what to make out of it. Growing up in the eighties, slickness of its production attracted me more than anything else. Also I thought the cover was kind of interesting ...     It would not be another few years or so till I picked up two more Beatles recordings - this time recorded on both sides of a TDK D90 tape from a Vinyl source  ... Rubber Soul & Revolver, thanks to my friend Kalyan Roy, a collector of records and a musicologist, who knew more about The Beatles than anyone else in my close friend circle.      Listening to Revolver & Rubber Soul, my world changed.     I was already very much into Dylan, Stones, Grateful Dead, Floyd and Zeppelin & the likes, and I had dabbled with Folk-Rock, Jazz & Blues a bit; but this was something different .. like the Gods from heaven creating something so immortal for us the humans, something so eternal & timeless. The impeccable sense of melody, movements of rhythms across the bars, a sense of brevity that directs exactly when & how to stop, and the precise use of words, pronounced with such clarity that even clichéd expressions sounded dramatic, wrapped ever so gently around the effortless melody. Not to mention harmonized voices of morning doves, like rain falling on a hot summer day, or the comfort of a warm quilt in cold & dreadful winter.     Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, Eleanor Rigby and For No One amassed emotion in my young heart akin to reading a beautiful poem, like Wordsworth, or Tagore and our very own Sunil Ganguly. To this date I envy people who would explore Beatles and hopefully have the same feeling I did all those years ago for the first time. Slowly I started collecting the vinyl albums and picked up most of them second hand in Free School Street, just off Park Street in Calcutta, my hometown. Some I bought brand new, likethe White Album, which ranks among the best double albums ever made, with Blonde & Blonde, Tommy, Physical Graffiti & Exile on Main Street.       Thankfully, the circle of friends I grew up with liked western music, poetry, art in general - with no regard of political or geographical boundaries. It was a different time, a different place with different dreams & expectations. Mass consumer driven globalization had not invaded India - in a way we lived in a country very different from the India to today - with its Contact Centers & Shopping Malls; we appreciated art as it was available - in whatever shape & form; White Album wowed & fluttered (faulty manufacturing!), the wax on Let it Be was wavy, the stylus on my record player fought hard to be in groove with Blue Album. Sgt Pepper, thankfully, was in pristine order, in tune with the music; my friends around the globe has written millions of words explaining Pepper's beauty; world will survive alright without more of the same from yours truly here. One thing I did miss though - having Pepper in a Monaural format - and that has changed now; the wait has been worth its while.      Abbey Road remained a personal favorite; I did write a review a few years back on Amazon & have nothing more to add. I do not think Abbey Road could have been made more perfect - it is spotless the way it is - from a band at its very peak - maybe, just maybe, if they had gone on, their work would have suffered - a fall from an often unattainable (for most people that is) peak.     As we have heard from so many times before, music in its best form can change your life. A piece of wisdom I need to pass on to my daughter, barely three and half months old. I guess I may have to wait more than a few years for that conversation :) Hopefully the Beatles catalogue will be released on iTunes to pique her interest by then.     I left India in the early nineties - my Beatles collection on Vinyl, whatever is left of it, is gathering dust. I have not hadthe heart to throw them away; maybe someday I will bring them here.     I never bought one Beatles Compact disc in spite of their availability; I borrowed some from time to time from the local library when we lived in Calgary, Alberta (an exceptionally well funded library with a fascinating collection of music & books). I just did not like how they sounded on CDs - lifeless & flat at best. Without the oomph of the bass & jangle of the twelve strings they sounded pale in comparison with my old Vinyl records, even if they were always not in the best of condition. I did buy all the Anthologies, Live at the BBC, 1 & Love - them being new issues & not original studio releases I did not have a benchmark to compare; plus I felt such releases were of historic significance.      Love was a revelation of sort as to what can be done with the master tapes by tweaking things here & there; remixing as they call it  ... as long as they are in right hands (we attended the show at Mirage in Las Vegas which was a great experience)     Enough of the past and appreciate bearing my ramble, let's talk about what we have here.  Two impeccably mastered sets, one in stereo and one in mono, attractively packaged and bravely priced in spite of such recessionary times. Personally I would have preferred both the stereo & mono versions in one packaging as a double (not single) disc for each of the studio recordings and Revolver onwards as a triple disc set including a DTS version; also as a bonus: DVD of Let it Be, repackaged and re-mastered with all its historic glory (Paul, are you listening?!).     I will stay away from the price issue. It is expensive, no doubt about it, but we have also waited many years. I guess the price point is where the demand & supply curves have met. And yes, I find them expensive.          Sound is the crux of the matter here.      So here it goes: It is like a veil has been lifted; like you are looking at a Rembrandt or a Picasso that was covered in dust all thistime and someone ever so gently has wiped all the dust and the ashes of the past.  It is like finally, the fog that covered Blue Jay Way, has given way to bright sunlight.  The sound of the music is like never I have heard before.  Up, Front and Personal - there, I can see John sharing the microphone with his friends, and George playing the chords.  All in my head, all in my ears, and all in my mind - it is like listening to the Fab Four for the first time - all those years ago.  Only much clearer, a clean sound - perhaps like it was intended to be.  Clean, Crisp - I will say it again, a revolutionary improvement over the 1987 releases.       The Mono which were mastered by the Beatles themselves apparently with more care, devotion and caution (after all most people listened to The Beatles using Mono equipment in the sixties) sounds fantastic; I would suggest, if you can afford, buy both versions - it is an acquisition of sorts - something you can keep and enjoy for years to come.      If one is on a budget, buy up to Help in Mono, and in Stereo for the balance of the recordings.  I don't think I will ever listen to the first five records in stereo again - as far as these are concerned - Mono is King!     My sincere appreciation for all the hard work to the engineers at the Abbey Road studio for making these releases see the light of day - something both audiophiles and Beatle fans alike have waited for such a long time.      One request, if I could be so upfront, please release `Let it Be' on DVD - such a historic document of the modern art should not be confined to You Tube streaming only.      Jai Guru Deva Om!! Now we can safely say, nothing's gonna change my world ...
B001AIRUOU|5.0|While I've not watched the extras or the digital copy I have watched the movie with my kids probably 100+ times and love it every time. The remastering of this DVD also looks very good. (Note: I do watch it up-converted)

B002EWD08Q|5.0|In 2005/2006, the Arctic Monkeys were the British rock world's most-hyped new rock `n' roll sensation. Before they had ever released an album, the tornado of media opinion preceding them ensured they'd sell a vast number of their first release, and they did. This first offering was followed by diligent touring and a second album that was, by all critical accounts, possibly even better than the first.<br /><br />Musically, the Monkeys played a sort of nervous New Wave/classic rock blend on their first two offerings - derived, in equal measure, from Franz Ferdinand, the Clash, the Jam and - maybe - Oasis. They were a precise band that wrote decent songs and had a healthy postmodern disregard for even the most recent rock history: they were kids in the 90s, when rock was post-rock and popular music had already entered its permanently relativist state. Their music was likable, but perhaps no more so than, say, Ash or the Subways once you stripped Arctic Monkeys of their immense media profile.<br /><br />For me, their first two records lacked a certain grounding. Entertaining enough to listen to, clever in many ways, both Whatever People Say I am, That's What I'm Not and Favourite Worst Nightmare had great tracks but, in the end, left me a little cold. Maybe in the same way that Franz Ferdinand's weaker album tracks leave one cold.<br /><br />Enter Humbug in 2009. The Monkeys have retained the services of Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age Fame to produce their new album. While I'm not that closely familiar with Homme's output overall, his music in Queens wouldn't in any obvious way suggest that he'd be a good match for producing the nimble, light-footed, hardworking, nervy Monkeys. Queens of the Stone Age is all about lowdown, heavy grooves, growls and drones; music that has tons of bottom end.<br /><br />And yet, on Humbug, something magical has happened. Homme has helped Arctic Monkeys find an anchor of gravity, has tied their music down and bolted it into the floor. While other reviewers have pointed out that this record is so much more experimental than the first two, I think the main achievement here is actually the songwriting that's resulted from the new lower frequencies: there's a darkness, or rather many of the tracks are darkly funny in the same way that Nick Cave or recent Morrissey is.<br /><br />In fact, I was surprised by how sonically similar this CD is to Morrissey's You Are The Quarry, 2004's formidably rocking (and funny) comeback record.<br /><br />Humbug, then, is the Arctic Monkey's sonic coming-of-age record. It's immensely listenable and quite brilliant, although - I suspect - it hasn't gotten the right kind of media attention this time around because it doesn't comply with our preconceived notions about the band, and because change is not always welcomed. I, for one, am thoroughly enjoying the darker textures, weirder lyrics and harder orientation.inted out that this record is so much more experimental than the first two, I think the main achievement here is actually the songwriting that's resulted from the new lower frequencies: there's a darkness, or rather many of the tracks are darkly funny in the same way that Nick Cave or recent Morrissey is.

0316066524|4.0|David Foster Wallace's writing is notoriously challenging and often antagonizing.  'Infinite Jest' is both, only longer.  Like his other work, it can be annoyingly precocious and self-indulgent, and the author's humor occasionally juvenile.  He purposefully breaks the narrative flow with a deluge of detail, endnotes, and abbreviations within the text, and thus alternates between keeping the reader at arms length and reeled in.  Even so, Wallace was clearly a genius, and though I don't buy into the reasons behind the experimental fiction of 'Infinite Jest' - or its effectiveness - he certainly framed a compelling argument on a vast canvas that questions the conventions of the novel and simultaneously attempts to deconstruct the self in millennial America.    It's the American culture of addiction and obsession that Wallace is out to skewer in 'Infinite Jest' - the passive acceptance of a substance (or activity) that gratifies the mind's pleasure centers to the detriment of maturing.  Integral to this theme is the existence of a video so addictive in its presentation that people who have once watched it are willing to cut off body parts in exchange for another viewing, if that's what it takes.  Those with unlimited access to this 'entertainment' will sit and watch it repeatedly until they starve.  This video becomes the Unexposed Contents of the book, with several parties desperately in search of the master version and the few underground copies that occasionally surface - some to suppress it, and some to use as a terrorist tool to further their political ends.    That is the macro-framework of the novel.  Within that is the story of Hal Incandenza, the son of the auteur who made the 'entertainment', and resident of the Enfield Tennis Academy; and Don Gately, former Demerol addict and small time burglar who now is part of the live in staff at a recovery house just below that same academy.  Hal, an almost unbelievably intelligent 17 year old, ranked nationally in his sport, and definitely a prescriptionist grammarian, has so many qualities that I associate with David Foster Wallace that his storyline was almost embarrassing to read - as if I'd stumbled on DFW's private diary from high school.     But the story of Don Gately, still in early sobriety, is a stunning portrayal of recovery and 12 step programs.  This is not Hallmark stuff, nor is it nurture your inner child stuff.  This is gritty realism and fascinating attention to humanity.  If the slightly dystopian near-future DFW sets his novel in comes across as ineffective and silly political satire, and the chronicle of the Incandenza family too contrived to comfortably connect with, Don Gately and his fellow addicts are almost non-fictional in their pragmatic efforts to become whole again - to become 'someone'.      And yet Wallace hasn't just spent the last 1000+ pages trying to warn us of the moral torpor inherent in passively accepting entertainment simply to provide us with another venue.  As the narrative of 'Infinite Jest' hurtles through the lives of its characters; as government and terrorist forces are poised to swoop down among the lives we've spent an unusually long time learning about; as the promise of a startling denouement thunders across the horizon of each upturned page, Wallace simply comes to the end of another seemingly irrelevant flashback and then stops.     At the end of the 20th century, I think Wallace wanted to know what the novel had left to teach us.  I think he held up the disinterred skull of its form and conventions for consideration, and decided that the only wall left to demolish was not between author and reader, but the one enclosing text and reader - the solution then is to \\"uninvolve\\" the reader, to break his concentration with furious flipping from endnote to text, to disrupt the flow of the story with overwhelming quotidian detail and to slap the reader's face with an unsatisfying ending.  All of this so the reader will continually refocus his attention, and question anew what he is reading and why.  DFW demands not blubbering passive agreement but instead attempts to provoke the reader _physically_ with the rigors of attention required - as a mountain climber might sell his autobiography from the top of a large hill to further his point.      Or I could be completely wrong.  But I keep coming back to Wallace's writing, and how it doesn't seem transcribed as much as orchestrated, and how I have the feeling that Wallace had reasons for every word, every endnote, and every unanswered question.    I think I would have enjoyed 'Infinite Jest' more had I read it when it was published - now, it seems to have a slightly cloying youthful smugness.  I think I would also have been more open to DFW's style at that time, instead of it wearing thin by page 1100.  And the story of Hal Incandenza, the inordinately intelligent teenager who can't be true to his own self until he establishes its existence first might have been an effective dipstick to measure philosophical angst in my own soul as a younger man, but his adapted \\"To be or not to be\\" seems luxurious to me today.  But the faults of the book are outweighed by its strengths - the stellar writing, the insights, and the humor that does hit its target combined with the massive attempt to overhaul the conventional novel make 'Infinite Jest' one of a kind.  Recommended to those looking for a challenge, and for those who appreciate obscure and very long punch lines.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I have always hated vinyl for obvious reasons.  I framed the entire album cover and it hangs.  The CD reminds me of great and interesting time to be on the planet.

The UPC bars mar the beauty of the watercolor - but commercialism has not yet gone away.  Soon?

0380018179|5.0|Most people I ask have read this book, and it is no wonder.<br /><br />It is very well written and takes you into the minds and hearts of its many family members.<br /><br />The plot will not disappoint, nor will the characters.<br /><br />There's a lot of description which wouldn't work for a modern-day novel, but other than that it is a great read.
0385510454|1.0|I thought this book had some potential in the beginning but by the middle it was clear that none of the plot lines nor the characters were going to be developed in any meaningful way.  And the ending is just terrible, really terrible as if the author himself just got bored with the book and had to end it and get it out of his hair (and into some publishers hands).    On top of that, a lot of things are just really unrealistic and unnecessary.  Why, for instance, is there a need to have a president who loses all the electoral college votes but 3?  And whatever happens to him anyway, or most of the characters in the book since I´m thinking about it?  A CIA director who sounds like Dr. Strangelove, who also disappears before the book finishes.  Bad guys who are introduced to us and then dropped without another word about them.  Hell the main character doesn´t even get shot at once.    Well read it if you need to kill a few hours, but don´t say I didn´t warn you.

B000BB1MI2|5.0|Nearly everyone I talk to refers to this movie as that \\"horrible screwup\\" and \\"totally unnecessary, nearly ruined my memories of the original\\", etc.     And so apparently I'm the only person I know that actually loved this movie.     I've never been a fan of the original, \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\". I saw it when I was about eight, and unlike the other kids, was totally disenchanted. Willy Wonka was angry and somewhat intimidating. The songs were campy as hell and golden GEESE? GEESE? I understand the technology wasn't available to have digitally stimulated squirrels, but honestly, like the previous adaptations of Lord of the Rings, it could have waited.     Seriously, WHY the complaints? Yes, this movie had creepy and slightly morbid undertones. But so were Dahl's books. I think people seem the remember the cuter aspects of his books and forget that Dahl occasionally had some truly unsettling elements in his books - a boy turning into a mouse only to have his tail chopped off, abusive relatives, death, implied murder, etc. It wasn't all chocolate and kitty cats. And that's why I think Burton's movie captured the true spirit of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory much more than the camped-up original: Hilarious, bizarre, charming, and slightly creepy. Plus they had the SQUIRRELS.     For hilarity, refer to the awesome one-liners and recurring jokes between the children and Willy Wonka \\"You really shouldn't mumble, because I have no idea what you're talking about\\" or \\"I can't have a blueberry as a daughter. How is she supposed to compete?\\" \\"You could enter her in a county fair.\\"    Bizarre: This is a Tim Burton movie. Moving on.     Charming: I would be lying to say if Depp's freaky Wonka was charming, so we resort to Charlie, played by the ever-endearing Freddie Highmore, who imbues Charlie with the same quiet intelligence and dogged optimism that he showed in Finding Neverland (also with Depp). Better than the original.     Slightly creepy: Ok, Depp claims this tag. But I still liked his performance, just because it made so much more sense than Gene Wilder's. Willy Wonka isn't Santa Claus or any other kind of fatherly figure. Having been a recluse since he was a child, the film implies that he has about the same emotional maturity level as the kids (perhaps even less, having spend 20+ years in a candy factory) and a total lack of social skills. I do wish they would have made him less unnaturally pale (he was practically purple), but Depp conveys his childish humor well.    By the way, just LOVED the Willy Wonka background story. It enhanced the film, I think, because it added the individual touch that all good adaptations need, yet left the main storyline unmolested. And it's always a pleasure to see Christopher Lee. I think Dahl would have loved it.     Add in pitch-pefect performances by the children, a knockout whirlwind of colorful eye candy (literally), beautifully entertaining montages, and you got yourself what I consider a truly wonderful, re-watchable classic.  And this film actually has the squirrels. Did I mention that already?
1416955070|4.0|When Clary heads out to a local club with her BFF, little did she know that her whole life would be altered. She definitely wasn't expecting to witness a murder - much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and yielding bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. No body, no blood and it seems that no one in the club can see these kids other than her. This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters. Shadowhunters are warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons.<br /><br />One of them is Jace, a Shadowhunter, who thankfully is around to help Clary when her world is turned upside down within 24 hours of meeting him. Her mother has disappeared from her home (which is turned inside out) and Clary finds that she is under attack by a creature that she didn't believe in a few minutes ago... a demon. She can't go to the local law enforcement and has been turned away by her Uncle Luke. With nowhere to turn she finds refuge with the Shadowhunters. But that is just the beginning of her problems. For one, why would demons be interested in ordinary \\"mundanes\\" like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight - enabling her to see Shadowhunters in the first place... normal mundanes are blind to such happenings. So many questions are unanswered and it is up to Clary and Jace to uncover what is going on.<br /><br />If you've seen Star Wars - you might find a lot of similarities in this book. I'm not sure if it's meant to be seen as fan-fiction, but once I was a couple of chapters in I was having a lot of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu moments. Sure, it was in a different world and there were different scenarios, but in the end it felt like a very familiar plot.<br /><br />With that said, I still enjoyed this very much. I loved Clary as a protagonist - she was somewhat mousy but at the same time held quite a punch when needed. The dialogue was thoroughly entertaining and on more than one occasion brought a smile to my face. The world that they live in was very neat and I especially liked that it had a dark, gritty feel to it.<br /><br />Hold on tight to your seats with this one as you become immersed in a world where every mythical creature you thought was fictional is real. From vampires who drive flying motorcycles to werewolves who turn at the full moon.... not to mention an ending that will leave you in shock.<br /><br />There is romance, mystery, loads of suspense and drama, with a few surprises thrown in for good measure. It'll have you at the edge of your seat and ready to head out and get the next installment in the trilogy.as very neat and I especially liked that it had a dark, gritty feel to it.

B0028K3192|1.0|This cd is terrible. The only good song on the cd is \\"Pretty Wings\\", which can be heard several times a day on radio stations and/or music channels. If you must listen to Maxwell, try any of his older albums; all are much better than Black summers'night.
B00151QYU8|5.0|I loved it when it first came out and now I love watching it in the palm of my hand.
B001KZI2WW|5.0|As the title says, this is my first pair of Crocs. I have been looking for a shoe like this for a long time. I'm a pool cleaner in Austin, TX, and I haven't been able to find a shoe that is as comfortable as these. I'm on my feet almost all day, and my shoes are constantly getting wet and dirty. I refuse to wear sandals, as I tend to be on the clumbsy side and I'm pretty partial to my toes. With the removable insole and breathable canvas, these are easy to keep clean and don't get that funky smell after a few days. I used to wear Sperrys to work, as I don't like wearing socks, but these are so much more comfortable right out of the box. These do tend to run smaller than other shoes, so if you wear an 11 in men's, then you are going to want to get a 10. As far as I'm concerned this is the perfect shoe for any pool guy.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This is one of the most brilliant, simple, and scary horror films ever made.  All the stars were in alignment when John Carpenter, and Debra Hill set out to make this now classic horror film.  There have been many clones of this film, but this one is the one that started it all.  Amazing lighting & cinematography by Dean Cundey, wonderful performances from Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis, P.J. Soles, and Nick Castle.  Minimal onscreen graphic violence, no blood, no gore.  All story, scares, stalking, and horror.  The now classic musical score by director John Carpenter really makes this film come alive!  Don't watch this alone or in the dark!!  And watch Halloween II immediatly after this film, cause it's a continuation of the same night!!!  My favorite film of all time.<br /><br />Christopher Sorick<br />Omaha, Nebraska
031606792X|5.0|I decided vampire stories weren't something I'd be interested in and wrote off the Twilight series completely until I saw Twilight on video and decided to read the first book to see what the movie missed.  I couldn't put the book down and ended up devouring the entire series faster than any books I've ever read before.      The story is incredibly romantic and somewhat sensual.  It may give girls a false hope that there are morally chaste men out there who would be as virtuous as the main male character able to show such restraint to protect a girl's virtue when she's so eager to throw her virtue to the wind in the name of love.  I wouldn't recommend this series for very young readers but it may be a lifesaver for older men & women whose love life could use a spark.  The author's style improves with each successive volume so don't give up after the first book.  Breaking Dawn was beautiful wrap up to the series.
B000059XUO|5.0|Great movie, that really keeps true to the original story. Brandon Lee is amazing and its unfortunate that he died during the filming of the movie.
B000GFLEJA|5.0|The DVD arrived within a few days of purchasing online. The quality was and still is great! Terrific and speedy service!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|While I haven't yet heard other Beatles remasters for 2009, THE WHITE ALBUM is a revelation from first to last.      Virtually all of the songs possess a warmth, heightened dynamic range and definition missing from the original vinyl and first digital remasters. Personally, the cuts I love and listen to repeatedly here are the quietest - from \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" to \\"Julia.\\" In each, you enjoy greater detail in the voice, and with it, heightened emotion. The best rock pieces also have the crisp bottom sound they sorely needed in the originals. And of course, the opener, \\"Back in the U.S.S.R., launches the album with panache. Even jet stream sounds more powerful.    Capitol's packaging is just awful. The tight interior sleeves Capitol manufactured are way too small for the discs, so some light scratching is inevitable. Shifting sleeve positions for one disk from inner to outer position will help eliminate some eventual damage.    The booklet is illuminating but could have been more informative, and the repro of the original folder insert is authentic but throwaway. In my set, the insert was literally crammed into its sleeve -- covered with folds and creases when I first pulled it out.    But I, and so many others, bought this set for the music, so package-design is relatively unimportant. Buy the 2009 remaster of this landmark album and relish it. Music really was better then, and The White Album -- a few cuts aside (such as Revolution 9) is evidence of that.
B000P0J0AG|4.0|Crime dramas can be tricky to follow. With such depth in plots, I often find myself needing to devote my full attention to understand Law & Order That being said, as tricky as Heat was to follow, Micheal Mann directed a very good film, not excellent, but very good.<br /><br /> Being a cluster of AAA talents in one film, all played their roles fantastically. Although, in terms of acting, this is not Scarface meets Batman meets Godfather. None the less, DeNiro, Kilmer and Pachino deliver spot on preformances(although Pachino's fits of rage seemed a tad corny). Mann uses his trademark blue washs constantly, and delivers a deep parrallel on characters and, whether good or bad, humans all are equal.<br /><br /> Although it exceeds too far in length (3 hours), Heat is one of the best crime dramas I have seen. I would not say it is a must see, but for any movie lover, it can provide entertainment for you at face value, with a good dosage of analytical substance
0393327655|4.0|I used to be very tolerant/acceptant of other peoples' religious behavior as long as it didn't impact me personally. Over the last 5 years or so, I found myself becoming much less willing to accept it, even if it was just moderate. However, I wasn't able to explain to myself (or anyone else) satisfactorily why.<br /><br />Sam Harris has, I feel, done a great job of explaining why we can't affort to support even moderate religious behavior anymore.<br /><br />Of course, like any other such book, this book will be dismissed by anyone who does have a religious belief system as, by definition, such a belief system is impervious to logical arguments.

B00006J3WH|5.0|Before I saw the episode I thought \\"Hmmmmm.... this is either series suicide or a genius masterstroke\\"! Luckily, it was the latter and I laughed nearly all the way through. Whether it was the introduction Anya's bunny phobia or the general way everyone had no choice but to sing their true heartfelt thoughts and emotions, I know not. All I do know is that Amber Benson and Anthony Steward head brought a tear to my eye and it appeared to me a fantastic way to open the warehouse full of canned worms which would otherwise have dragged on.    Great writing and even better plot twists because of this episode - it was a real plot clincher and I loved it!
B000002BYA|5.0|What a beautiful birthday (\\"my best birthday ever...forever\\") : Mum and Dad listening to Stevie Ray and Jimmie Lee at the Temple of Music.On stage Dr John,the horn section of Roomful of Blues,the Double Trouble plus another drummer,Angela Strehli : what a great blues ensemble. Brief and sometimes unhappy the life of this great  guitarist and singer (because Stevie Ray was also a great singer),but his joy of playing is still here.  The peak of this great album is in my opinion \\"The things that I used to do\\" (Guitar Slim) : great solos,very different in structure and mood from Jimmy (\\"bad boy !\\" laughs Stevie Ray) to Stevie,the horns,the melancholy of the words.  Thank you for this gift,and so long Stevie.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|I come at this album from the perspective of being a musical child of the early 80s.  As my interest in pop and rock developed I revisited the music that my childhood, summertime babysitter used to play frequently and as a result I rediscovered the Beatles.  My review is based mainly on my own knowledge and love of music and my own impressions of this album.<br /><br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is an imaginative journey through moments of everyday life as well as other more bizarre and exotic places that may not be so far away.  Drug influenced, as I have read, I can see that this album has a more hallucingenic influence that the perhaps pot influenced \\"Revolver\\".<br /><br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - Great anthemic openning rocker with brass interlude; this song sets the stage for an album that will engage one's imagination as much as one's insights on being in the world with its meaning and meaninglessness.  The album cover helps to create the fantasy of this album's journey into another way of looking at the world.  The energy of this song coasts without loosing too much moment into the song which follows...<br /><br />With A Little Help From My Friends - Ringo (aka Billy Shears) sings appreciatively about the difficulties of life and how he copes with them; the chorus suggests (but could now, perhaps, be understood psychologically rather than \\"chemically\\") a naive attitude (casual appreciation) toward drugs:<br /><br />Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,<br />Mmm, I get high with a little help from my friends,<br />Mmm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.<br /><br />The simple relaxed pace of this song seems to mesh with the \\"steady on\\" message of the lyrics which in turn seems to me to be deep wisdom of the most unpretentious kind.<br /><br />Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - Psychedelic lyrical imagery reportedly derived in part from experimenation with psychidelics and an abrupt switch in time-signatures mix chaos with mystical beauty in this song.  From a flowering delicate sitar line to the great cosmic \\"Ah!\\" one can imagine gazing into the sky in mystical appreciation of the beauty of the world, this song is a marvelous trip!<br /><br />Getting Better - This song seems like a great \\"in recovery\\" anthem; like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" you get elegant pictures of various people who, in this case, are emerging from their anger issues.  Very open and honest words coming from people who you could learn to take back into your heart.<br /><br />Fixing a hole - Trippy hippy song with an introverted attitude.  Less \\"lazy\\" than \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" this song seems to be more about keeping the world's perpetual griping at bay, maintaining a positive mood by keeping the negative out.  The upbeat rhythm and piano and melacholy guitar reflect the sense of a balance of the work and discipline of maintaining a positive outlook in a potentially depressing world.<br /><br />She's Leaving Home - A poignant look at the mismatch of doting parents and their child who has grown and suddenly flown the coup.  Strings bring in sentimentality while the lyrics gradually paint a bitter picture of the parents who would keep their grown up daughter too long.<br /><br />Being For The Benefit of Mr Kite! - Set against Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds it seems that prior to psychedelics we had...the Circus!  This carnival ride of a song is as hypnotic and disturbing.  Not as surrealistic as Lucy in the Sky, I have to wonder whether \\"Lucy-in-the-sky\\" hasn't met Mr. Kite on one or two occasions!  I detected one or two vague meglomaniacal thoughts in the lyrics helping to secure a presence of insanity.  Perhaps, this is another drug-inspired song.<br /><br />Within You Without You - Like \\"Love you to\\" from Revolver, this song has an authentic sounding Indian style (I'm no expert on this) from instruments to vocals.  Deep mystical lyrics also provide either an exotic tone or inspiration depending on the listener's familiarity with mystical teachings.  Strings come in to help build the song over a full five minutes.  Great Indian style improvisation in the middle of the song as well.<br /><br />When I'm Sixty-Four - Humourous, fun song with woodwinds and piano that looks forward to the bliss of old age in love. Strong contrast with previous song in mood.<br /><br />Lovely Rita - Catchy melodies, sweet harmonies contrast with the veiled leudness of the lyrical content which is finally made explicit in the panting and moaning that darkly end this song.  One of many examples of the Beatles ability to layer psychological complexity concisely into a short song.<br /><br />Good Morning Good Morning - Slightly manic song about the emptiness of everyday busy-ness; its the Beatles prelude to Chicago's more serious \\"Does Anyone Really Know What Time It Is?\\" horns included.  Ends in a moment of zoo-like chaos.<br /><br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) - Brief but rockin' reprise of the openning song which creates a frame around the album.  The song acts as a frame in the sense of art as well making this album more recognizable as a work of art if not a well-developed concept album.<br /><br />A Day in the Life - This song feels like a microcosm of the whole album that precedes it.  Its lyrics reflect a profound distancing from the values of the world.  The song moves from the opening melody through a brief psychedelic transition to a new melodic passage and back again giving the song the feel of a miniature symphonic suite.  Three times the music approaches a cacophonous peak indicating either escape from the insanity of the world or the succombing to that same insanity.  Along with \\"Within You Without You\\" this song clocks in at over 5 minutes and because of this gives you a deeper experience of the Beatles great music.<br /><br />(4 stars) This album, framed as it is in its opening fanfare, defines a space that is filled with a wonderful variety of musical landscapes and psychological experiences.  This album is another world which reflects our own and the songs both in their lyrics and music make that connection effectively.  This is rock 'n' roll as art.  For progressive rock music fans I recommend the entire album.  The best songs for a progressive rock collection would IMO be \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"A Day in the Life\\".ive minutes.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|I am fans from Hong Kong.  I could remember all young people loved to watch the Music Video of \\"Beat It\\", nobody would get away when this MV was broadcasting on the T.V.  We in Hong Kong all loved this MV, most of people here would impersonate his dancing; wearing the pant with disclosing the white sock like him.  Everybody nomatter you listen his songs or not, you MIGHT know WHO Michael Jackson was.  Michaelmania was spread over the world at that time.    Needless to say, \\"Thriller\\" is the essential album you must buy, most of the songs in this album are great and popular.  Of course, I love the most is \\"Billie Jean\\", but others are also great, such as     \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\", \\"Human Nature\\" and etc.... I almost love all.    This album was a milestone of Michael to be the Superstar all over the world.  I do not need to talk too much, I think all people know this.  I think most of the people should have this CD at home.    Michael, LOVE YOU FOREVER, You are the greatest Artist in this earth.  Nobody can replace you.
B001UXJQHE|4.0|The DVD is what we come to expect from Andre Rieu. Marissa sang beautifully, but I'm partial to Carmen, Carla, and Suzanne.  I think Tuscany is his best!
B00005QGAX|5.0|I am fans from Hong Kong.  Honestly, \\"BAD\\" was really not as good as \\"Thriller\\"; I could say \\"BAD\\" even was not as good as \\"Dangerous\\" and \\"History Past, Present, Future Book 1\\".  However, songs in \\"BAD\\" are also great, such as:    Man In The Mirror  Leave Me Alone  Smooth Criminal  The Way You Make Me Feel  Bad    I love \\"Man In The Mirror\\" the most; but also there was one song, just a demonstrating one in this album, and I found it a very good song, called \\"Fly Away\\".  Pls try to listen this song, this is really a good song with soft rhythm.    I would say that you must not miss of any of Michael's albums.  He was the man whom did his songs with heart and message.  The young generation should listen his songs.  I hope his songs should long-lasting.  He is always KING OF POP.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is amazing - I love it.    Definitely The Beatles best album - they saved the best till last.    Very appropriate to reflect on this today considering it is 09/09/09.

B000RIHBIE|5.0|Sum41 came into the popular punk rock scene big with their All Killer, No Filler album with high energy, fast paced, raw rock songs like \\"Fat Lip\\", \\"Motivation\\" and \\"In Too Deep\\". Since then they have not had such big hits as the ones on that CD but their music has remained just as good. They have given up the young, high energy music for a more meaningful and higher quality of music. It's definitely different but it's something any punk lover would enjoy.
1400076943|3.0|I found the book to be a compelling but not lovable book. The father seems like two different people--the horribly strict and abusive parent/husband, on the one hand, and the brave advocate for democracy and press freedom on the other.  It's not clear why the father became the super strict parent he became.  Instead, his Catholicism is left to explain it all.  I would resent that sort of slight of hand if I were Catholic, and I regret it as the reader.  The fact that the author never attempts to reconcile the two sides of the father's personality is, in my opinion, a major weakness in what is otherwise a well written book.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Soon to be featured on the New Moon (a.k.a. Twilight 2) soundtrack, Death Cab for Cutie have made a name for themselves in the music industry.<br /><br />DCFC has been around for quite some time now, making numerous albums of enjoyable alternative rock music.  Plans, the 2005 release from the band, is probably the most fan-appreciated album in their catalog.  It has that rare beauty to it where almost every track is as good, if not better, than the one before it.  This is the quintessential Death Cab album, one you would supply a new listener with so they could obtain a good taste of the band.  Recently, they released the album Narrow Stairs, which met a lukewarm reception.  When DCFC posted a poll on their Myspace page asking fans to vote for Narrow Stairs for best album of the year, many fans said that they were going to vote for other albums, such as Okkervil River, stating that the new album, in so many words, couldn't shine Plans'  shoes.<br /><br />On Plans, frontman Ben Gibbard describes certain moments, memories and emotion with such specific details rarely seen in music of this genre.  Also, for such a seemingly dark name and album cover, (just going to prove that you can't judge by either), some songs on the album, such as \\"Soul Meets Body\\", are so light and catchy, you'll have them stuck in your head for days.  Other songs are dark, yes, but so melodic and alluring that you'll listen at full attention to what Gibbard has to say and might even realize you can relate to some of his material.<br /><br />Here, you can read a brief description, with numerical rating, of each track on the album.  Amazon's price of $14.99 is a bit steep for an album that came out four years ago, but that is only a testament as to how popular and truly enjoyable it continues to be among new listeners and steadfast fans.<br /><br />Track 1: Marching Bands of Manhattan--(8)--light organ music greets us as the opening track begins, where Gibbard is trying to open the mind and eyes of his love to the wonders all around and states that if she doesn't make a decision soon and keeps wallowing in her sorrow, the love will drown them both.<br /><br />Track 2: Soul Meets Body--(9)--a song of love with \\"Bada\\"'s that will get stuck in your head for sure, this is a beautiful tribute to dreaming while with the one you love.  Strong lyric from the chorus: \\"And I do believe it's true that there are roads left in both of our shoes, but if the silence takes you then I hope it takes me too.\\"<br /><br />Track 3: Summer Skin--(8)--a lament of summers past and reminiscing of the one you loved that could only last the one season.<br /><br />Track 4: Different Names for the Same Thing--(6)--a piano ballad that states that no matter where you go, it's all the same.  You don't need to reference the map in your pocket because the trees, the streets, it's all the same thing, just differently named.<br /><br />Track 5: I Will Follow You Into the Dark--(10)--an acoustic genius of a song that poetically paints the beauty of loving someone so much that, when the day comes that they have to die, you'll gladly be right there with them.  \\"If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks, then I will follow you into the dark.\\"<br /><br />Track 6: Your Heart is an Empty Room--(8)--a song about feeling lonely in the wake of lost love but if you just look out your window, there are numerous ways to not be alone anymore.  Sometimes you have to sink into depression first to understand that you can be saved, that everything is truly okay and hope exists if you just try.<br /><br />Track 7: Someday You Will Be Loved--(8)--Gibbard has left his lady love but he won't get down about it.  She'll be okay, someday she will be loved again.  Broken hearts eventually mend and all of the memories they had created together will blur into one bad dream and she'll be able to move on.<br /><br />Track 8: Crooked Teeth--(7)--\\"You can't find nothing at all if there was nothing there all along.\\"A song about trying to make something out of nothing, trying to live a lie that you fooled yourself into existence when in reality, it was doomed from the start.<br /><br />Track 9: What Sarah Said--(10)--anyone who has ever lost a loved one in a hospital can relate to this song.  While Gibbard is sitting in the waiting room, essentially waiting for his loved one to die in their hospital bed, he remembers the wise advise of Sarah who said, \\"love is watching someone die\\".<br /><br />Track 10: Brothers on a Hotel Bed--(7)--Gibbard is accepting the fact that he and his loved one are no longer as young as they used to be, how they wanted so bad to leave the city when they were younger and yet, here they still sit, strangers to each other now.<br /><br />Track 11: Stable Song--(6)--a peaceful song to bow out on, Gibbard has realized that he will repeat the same defeats in his future that he experienced in his past.  He knows that remembering some things, especially over a long period of time, just gets more and more painful with age, but he doesn't mind, he'll keep on.<br /><br />Overall album rating: 8A song about trying to make something out of nothing, trying to live a lie that you fooled yourself into existence when in reality, it was doomed from the start.<br /><br />Track 9: What Sarah Said--(10)--anyone who has ever lost a loved one in a hospital can relate to this song.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|The music itself requires little commentary. It's essential repertory for anyone interested in popular music.    Listening with a high-quality pair of headphones (Sennheiser HD590s) reveals a significant increase in clarity over the 1987 masterings. This is likely due to a combination of state-of-the-art analog-to-digital conversion technology (reportedly a Prism Dream at 24-bit 192kHz), and tasteful use of equalization.    A look at the waveforms in Sound Forge confirms that peak limiting has been applied to almost every track. Contrary to the doubletalk denials by Apple, the ONLY real purpose of peak limiting is to increase the average sound level on the disc in an attempt to make the music sound \\"louder\\". No matter how carefully it is applied, this process INEVITABLY squashes the musical dynamics, lessening the difference between soft and loud sounds.    A comparison between the 1987 disc of REVOLVER and the 2009 disc clearly shows the difference. In '87, the overall sound level was kept low enough so that the entire dynamic range of the master tape was faithfully preserved. But on the new REVOLVER, the overall sound level is substantially higher, with the musical peaks constantly flatlined less than a decibel below maximum. MUSICAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN LOST, and no amount of mumbling or hand-waving from Apple's PR department can change this.    Happily, the limiting applied here isn't nearly as aggressive as some other remasters I've heard recently (see: Moody Blues). \\"Julia\\" is still a noticeably quieter song than, say, \\"Birthday\\". The contrast between them isn't as great any more, but the musical intention is still obvious. Things could have been much, much worse. And in today's market, where all pop music is highly compressed to the same ear-fatiguing level, listeners might have been confused by the need to reach over and turn up their volume control a little. So much work and responsibility!    [Oddly, it is claimed that The Beatles in Mono boxed set does NOT use any limiting at all! Why the double standard?]    Digital noise reduction also appears to have been used very sparingly, if at all. Hooray! Tape hiss is audible where you'd expect to hear it, which means that the musical high frequencies are preserved as well.    Headphones reveal some interesting studio noises that were previously hard to hear. In \\"Taxman,\\" for instance, you can clearly hear fret sounds, floor scrapes and muttering in the right channel, before the guitar solo.    Don't expect any earth-shattering revelations here. These discs were made from exactly the same master tapes as the 1987 CDs (except for the first four albums, and some of the Past Masters tracks, which are now in true stereo). The sound is a little clearer and subjectively \\"louder\\", but it's still the same mix of the same music. If you already own the '87 CDs, you probably don't need these unless you're a completionist who simply must possess every object with a Beatle logo on it. You know who you are.    Conclusion: Not a purist remastering, but a clean, respectful and listenable version of some of the best pop music ever recorded.    The Beatles in Mono set looks very interesting. That's next on my list.
B001PK3M1S|5.0|If u don't have it i would get Both US VErsions as this album is great but your missing out on so much more but hey get it too, we want Taylor to do even better
B0025KVLV0|2.0|What goes up must come down.... It happened to Elvis, Michael Jackson, and the list goes on and on!<br />even the Beatles in 1969 came tumbling down! This CD proves it..  worn out mad Beatles. Please give credit to Paul and Ringo however for putting out \\"Let It Be\\" Naked ...which did save this period for The Beatles.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|I remember the first time I ever heard the Beatles, I was around 12 and we were riding in my older's sister 1965 Mustang convertible. a one speaker AM radio, and I thought it was just great. Travel forward 44 years and here I am listening to the same song coming from a remastered cd playing in my home system slightly better than a single speaker AM radio, its basically the same feeling i had when I saw my first color tv set back in the late 60's. Congrats to all those involved in this undertaking, from the musicians to the original sound recordists to the engineers who did the remastering. A true work of art, the detail, the nuances in the music. I only thought jazz records could sound this good. Well I was completely blown away. If you call yourself a Beatles fan, you MUST get this, at least on or two of them, sit back and soak it all in.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|We all know that Citizen Kane, The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, Gone with the Wind, Raging Bull, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Network, No Country for Old Men, and There Will Be Blood are considered some of the all-time greatest films ever made. These films have been referenced and parodied numerous times, and some of them have very faithful followers (like how I am with The Godfather films). The Grapes of Wrath, on the other hand, hasn't really reached the same legendary status as other classic films, but it's just as great. I haven't read the original Steinbeck novel just yet, but the film still amazes me even if I didn't read it. Both the film and novel focus on the Great Depression, and one family who tries to get away from all the poverty by traveling to California. This is a drama made in 1940 that relies heavily on dialogue, symbolism, and scenery (if it were to be remade today, I can't possibly imagine all the car chases and fast-motion editing). The Grapes of Wrath also features a stellar ensemble of brilliant actors. This has to be one of Henry Fonda's greatest performances. As Tom, he is completely believable and memorable. One who is even more memorable is Jane Darwell as Ma (she's a marvel whenever she's on screen). The rest of the cast do very well here; I can't describe it, really.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath may not be in the same league as Citizen Kane and The Godfather, but it's still something to be much appreciated. Let's hope it's never forgotten, especially in this era.
0316010669|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell continues to deliver good reading material which makes the reader think and - if you'll pardon the lame joke - blink in surprise more than once.  Gladwell's style is that of the pop intellectual or pop psychologist, but the anecdotes and academic studies he discusses are legitimate and not easily dismissed.    Much of the book centers on innate biases, hard-wired perceptive abilities, and the often-surprising strengths and weaknesses of the human ability to make split-second decisions.  For readers who are not familiar with heuristics, \\"priming\\" (the vulnerability of the human brain to the power of suggestion), and basic psychology, this book opens a fascinating realm of discovery and will leave the reader wanting more.  Even for readers with a fairly high level of knowledge on such topics, there is certain to be some unfamiliar territory in this book, making it fascinating and fun reading.  Just remember: it is a popular book and not an academic treatise.  I recommend, whatever the reader's level of familiarity with the topics Gladwell discusses, treating it not as an endpoint but as a launching pad for further investigation.    Overall, this is a great and fun read.
B00030590I|5.0|Make no mistake. This is a fine Martial Arts flick. While it does have some fantastic fight scenes (the choreography is definitely majestic; equal to \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"House of Flying Daggers\\"), it does have some beautiful scenery. You get to see deserts, forests, lakes, hills, and the palace of Qin all in just a hundred minutes. And the use of one color in particular sequences is what really makes this film more than it is, though I'm not sure what the colors really signify (I'm no film expert). Oh, and don't bother with the seemingly \\"unrealistic\\" things that go on in the film, like flying in the air and dodging arrows with nothing but your clothes, because it's art. It's not logic, but it's pure art. The only thing I didn't like about \\"Hero\\" was Zhang Ziyi. She is a great actress, but I found her doing a bit of overacting a few times. But with that said, everyone gives excellent performances. Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen, Chen Daoming, and Ziyi turn out to be a great team of actors. Let's hope we see more from these men and women again.<br /><br />So go see this film. You'll be mesmerized.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I was disappointed with the 1987 CDs, so I put my Mobile Fidelity albums (state of the art record albums back then, from the master tapes) onto CD around 1992 and have been listening to those since. I long since sold my 1987 CDs. Now I can get rid of those Mobile Fidelity CDs because the sound quality of these remastered CDs exceeds even them.<br /><br />For those 1987 CDs the first four albums were in mono. I can sort of understand that for the first two, with their distinct, wide 2-track separation. But the second two had four-track and sounded great in stereo. At any rate, I preferred all four in stereo. So went to extreme measures to get it, in quality. Now those are all here in glorious stereo in this set.<br /><br />I was afraid that they would narrow the separation on the first two albums. Fortunately they did not. If you want to listen to those two with headphones, you may be disappointed with the sound -- get the mono, but listening to them through speakers, several feet away, the stereo adds an outstanding dimension to the sound.<br /><br />Throughout this set, the bass is more evident, the drums are sharper - the quality just jumps out at you throughout -- a testament to the much more sophisticated  digitization techniques they have today than in 1987. A job well done!!
B001BJ690Y|4.0|Many things have been said about this movie in prior reviews already so I will base my review on the Bluray edition only.<br /><br />Kill Bill volume 1 arrives to high definition presented with an incredible English 5.1 uncompressed audio track which makes the soundtrack to sound better than ever, dialogues, effects and the music benefit directly from this audio track and offer an audio experience that highly improves from the prior DVD version. English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital are also included as well as subtitles in English and Spanish.<br /><br />The video transfer is just impeccable,  colors are stunning from beginning to end, the sequence where the bride arrives to Vernita Green's house riding on the 'Pussy Wagon' gives you a taste of what's to come in video quality for the rest of the movie. The anime sequence that tells the origin of Oren-Ishi even with the blurry effects common in anime looks simply breathtaking.<br /><br />All extras are presented in standard definition and they are basically the same from the DVD version (which explains the missing star on my review):<br /> * The Making of Kill Bill vol. 1<br /> * '5,6,7,8's' musical performances<br /> * Tarantino trailers (from 'Reservoir Dogs' to 'Kill Bill Vol. 2')<br /><br />No official announcements have been made on the 'Whole Bloody Affair', which is supposed to be the definitive version of Kill Bill by Quentin Tarantino. The fact that these two volumes in Bluray dropped in price and Tarantino is already talking about completing the anime section of the volume 1 may indicate these are coming soon. For what is worth, this edition is worth the price while we wait and see if the definitive version will ever be released.
1427206031|3.0|I've never managed to read all the way through one of Jeffrey Archer's books, so I thought I'd try listening to one on audiobook. He's not a terrible writer or anything -- that's not necessarily the problem -- but I just haven't really connected with any of his stories. Unfortunately, that was the case with PATHS OF GLORY as well. This probably wasn't the best book of his for me to try, as it's historical fiction and I've never been overly interested in historical fiction.    The story features a fictionalized telling of the exploits of real-life explorer George Mallory, the man probably best known for explaining the reason behind mountain climbing: \\"Because it's there.\\" Mallory disappeared while ascending Mount Everest in 1924. He was last sighted very near to the summit, thus prompting many to believe that it was actually he, and not Sir Edmund Hillary, who first climbed the famed peak.    Archer dramatizes Mallory's life in entertaining fashion, thus it will likely appeal to those more interested in the subject matter than I was. The narrator, award-winning British actor Roger Allam, does a fine job of reading the story, and is the main reason to recommend this audiobook.
B001ASIRZG|4.0|I love the music and the live concert is just fine (I don't agree with other reviews on the quality of the sound)!  However, the DVD does not work on my US system which is something I was really looking foward to seeing.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|A good collection for all the Friends fans. Nice box and wallets for the DVDs and includes a coffee table booklet.
0393324818|4.0|A well written book that shows how statistic is revolutionizing the age old game of baseball.  I enjoyed reading it, as it suggests other broader changes happening as more and more data becomes easily available.<br /><br />For baseball fans in particular, they will enjoy reading about this fascinating change in the way the game is strategically played. Less of a baseball fan than a geek about how statistics can be deceiving, I greatly enjoyed this book as well.<br /><br />What was also very interesting was the manner in which statistics, very hard to argue, was not well received.  The struggle for change was against the grain.  The same is true of so many things that statistics is changing.<br /><br />I would mention that if you are neither into statistics or baseball, you may not greatly enjoy this book.
1423101464|5.0|this whole series is awesome, I bought it for my 12 yr old son and he couldnt put it down and neither could I.
0060989157|4.0|I thought it was an interesting enough read.  There are parts of it where I was completely disgusted by the womanizing. Other parts, I was inspired.  Still other parts, I was filled with envy at how easily things came for the group and how easily they would throw it all away.  It is a good story and I would recommend it to be people that are interesting in understanding the weird world of that period.  I don't know that it was the most exciting though.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I love this production! Witty and surprising - hilarious and profound - I was singing tunes from this for weeks. Fair warning - it is a musical (I'm not usually a fan of these), but don't let that stop you. Nathan Fillion and NPH make this a must see. You'll love showing this to your friends.
031606792X|5.0|this is the final book in the series and all the loose ends are tied up, I was sad when I got done reading it because I wanted to stay with the characters longer because it is such a compelling story.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|While not of the range or caliber of her earlier works, I look to you is a perfect vehicle for Whitney's return.  The title cut, is in heavy rotation on both r& b and gospel stations. It's one of those songs you play that make you feel grateful for your life.<br /><br />By the end of the CD I was impressed.  I'd not expected perfection and I didn't get it, but I can honestly say that there was only one song on the CD I wasn't crazy about. The lyrics are very personal and you'll find yourself wondering if she's talking about Bobby in \\"this\\" song.<br /><br />Bottom line - Whitney has been missed and this CD reminds you of all she lost and is struggling to regain.  She's not perfect but she's looking up.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This is awesome.  Totally reminded my how much I loved Michael when I was younger and realized I missed out on a lot of other stuff of his the first time around.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|I have been listening to this album for about 2 weeks now between the internet and my store purchased copy.   I really like the album.  Whitney still sounds better than a lot of people out today who are considered great even with the decreased quality and vocal range of her voice.  So what is that really saying?.... After listening to the album I still feel it's not better than \\"Just Whitney\\".  That album had more songs that could've been hit singles than this one does.... In my opinion the songs on this album that have hit single potential are.. MILLION DOLLAR BILL, CALL YOU TONIGHT, WORTH IT AND I GOT YOU... I did not agree with I LOOK TO YOU being released as a single.  NOTHIN' BUT LOVE and the slow intro of A SONG FOR YOU are outstanding as well.  Even though as I said before, I really like the album but I think it will be promotion and hype over quality that will lead to this album outselling \\"Just Whitney\\".
0307454541|5.0|I had never heard of this book until I saw it at [...] and grabbed it on the basis of the plot synopsis. Boy, am I glad I did. This is the best mystery (series) since John Sanford's Prey series. Blomkvist is good, but Lisbeth is a unique literary creation (a disfuntional possibly Aussberger's heroine.) I may have to buy played with fire in hardbound since I am not sure I want to wait for paperback.<br />Larsson's death, of course, is a real downer since that means there will only be the three books in the series. Whoever translated from the Swedish was simply outstanding.  I can imagine him translating meters into feet and kilos into pounds. Ha.<br />I literaly could not put it down.
B002BSHXJA|4.0|Yes!  Finally,the straight forward,exciting sound of THE BEATLES in monophonic sound.  The way the group wanted us to hear what became some of the finest music ever recorded.<br /><br />This is probably as close as we'll ever get to hearing this music the way THE BEATLES heard it in the studio-through one speaker,at the dawn of the \\"British Invasion\\".  This music was recorded,in the beginning,on simple two-track equipment.  As Geoff Emerick,BEATLES engineer said,\\"Plus we had to work extra hard on getting balances correct in those days because we primarily mixed and monitored in mono,with everything coming out of one speaker\\".  This was the era when \\"stereo\\" was still fairly new,when many people didn't own stereo equipment.  The thinking was that this music would be heard through one speaker-no matter where-at home,in the car,or down at the local pub.<br /><br />In mono there's a simple,satisfying fullness,an almost overwhelming power in the sound of this music.  Listening to these albums you're struck by the uncluttered purity of THE BEATLES' sound.  It's exciting to think we can now hear what it must have been like,to sit in the studio,with THE BEATLES,and hear this music for the first time.<br /><br />No doubt there will be reviews pointing out (quite rightly) the differences between the mono/stereo tracks.  Is this important?  Yes.  But,hopefully,listeners (especially those new to mono)  won't lose sight of the importance of hearing this music close to its original sound.  Pointing out the importance of the mono mixes/sound,engineer Geoff Emerick:  \\"In contrast to the way they carefully oversaw the original mono mixes,the group had expressed no interest in even being present when we did the new ones; that's how little thought we all gave to stereo in those days.<br /><br />This is a sound that had its beginnings in a different era.  An era when four guys got together to play and record music they liked.  And they wanted it released in mono for all of us to hear.  Now,with this collection,we can travel back to the source,and enjoy this music the way it was originally intended to be heard.<br /><br />As you can tell,this isn't a review of THE BEATLES as a group or individually.  Nor is it a review of individual songs or different eras of their music.  This is more a reminder,especially for those to young to remember mono sound.  I can still remember exactly where I was when I first heard THE BEATLES,way back in the sixties.  Somehow THE BEATLES made a lasting impression on a boy barely into his teens.  I had a chance early on to write reviews of both sets,but chose mono.  This sound is like looking at something beautiful- it doesn't have to say or do anything to call attention to itself,the beauty  speaks for itself.  Its the same with good mono sound.  Nothing added/deleted on the right or left channel,nothing boosted or compressed,nothing to take away from the pure unadulterated sound of the music.  I wonder in the days to come,if these mono recordings will begin to come to the forefront,when people talk about THE BEATLES' music.  These recordings don't call attention to themselves with anything flashy,they are just what they are-beautiful music.travel back to the source,and enjoy this music the way it was originally intended to be heard.

B000TUXL2A|3.0|Mark Knopfler is about as reliable as they come. He's got a laid-back approach to singing and writing. His fans would probably insist this means he's consistent while his haters would attribute it to stubbornness. Wringing songs from his post-Dire Straits formula does not seem like a theory that would work over the course of many albums. But what Mark sacrifices in excitement he makes up for in plain quality. Not a quality that slaps you in the face, but a quality that assures you that you will know what a new Mark Knopfler solo album will sound like before you hear it.    That being said, \\"Kill to Get Crimson\\" is even more mellow than his previous albums. Since \\"Sultans of Swing\\" will not be making a return anytime soon you need to evaluate these songs on what they have going for them; the flute lead in \\"The Scaffolder's Wife,\\" the waltziness of \\"Secondary Waltz,\\" \\"In The Sky,\\" and \\"Heart Full of Holes,\\" the addition of accordion (or perhaps it's a bandoneón), the fact that \\"We Can Get Wild\\" never, ever gets wild.    Mark's last proper album, \\"Shangri-La,\\" had songs that grabbed me the moment I first heard them. \\"Boom, Like That,\\" \\"Song for Sonny Liston,\\" and \\"Donegan's Gone\\" all had bite, and that bite bit me and stayed with me. \\"Kill to Get Crimson\\" doesn't really have these moments. Even the two singles \\"True Love Will Never Fade\\" and \\"Punish the Monkey\\" will not relentlessly lodge themselves into your brain the first time you hear them. Nor the second, maybe.    This is a good album, just not a great one. Everyone's entitled to take a load off in their easy chairs from time to time. Mark, this can be your easy chair album.
0618918248|2.0|Dawkins simply replaces God with a book about himself, not much I didn't know or have thought, except of course that Dawkins is the new God.

B001F7MSFM|4.0|Special effects really carry the film. The attention to detail and a somewhat complex plot leave you wanting more. The only drawbacks are: 1)Prince Nuada's over-extended training and fight sequences... We get it. 2)The overexposure of Hellboy's weird yellow eyes, instead of mostly shadowed in the first film. I understand that action is key to keeping short attention spans focused, but it's an unfortunate trend that sacrifices character development and general depth in key plot elements. I bought this sequel to complete the set, because the first one made me want anything related.
0060849827|5.0|I've had this book for a few months and continue to enjoy thumbing through and rereading. As some have noted, it is a very small book, but that makes it perfect to throw in a backpack or glove compartment to take with you on camping trips. It is filled with tons of useful information for all aspects of outdoor survival, as well as many useful techniques for everyday life, such as knot tying, basic first aid, etc. Highly recommended and thoroughly enjoyed.
B000I2JKFG|5.0|This is a must see cult classic.Great script, good actors, really moving.Makes you want to fight for what's right! And it arrived on time, in mint condition.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|Just heard live previews of this over the weekend at pre-release party and I've got to say, on the right system these sound absolutely amazing. However, I'm not buying another copy of the White Album, no matter how good it sounds and I don't think normal folks are really gonna care that there's a difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind buying some of the songs missing from my collection electronically though. I think this is where EMI needs to get their act together. Right now people are sharing and stealing The Beatles' music all over the internet, just put it on sale and make the money already. I would gladly pay per song or even per album because that's what the band deserves.
B001041JLE|5.0|Even though I am an older adult, I have always enjoyed listening to Michael Jackson. In fact, when I first saw him when he was a young fellow, I always knew he would make it big.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|There are increasingly fewer ways to lift myself out of a deep depression but The Queen's Confessions Tour managed to do just that for two of the best hours I've had in ages. This superbly shot concert features video effects and editing that enhance rather than take away from the original London show.<br /><br />Spectacular holographic and projected visuals illuminate the enormously majestic playground traversed by truly talented, high-voltage dancers. Madonna herself looks stunning and clearly has a blast the whole way through. Her sense of humor while sprawled across the stage after an especially exhausting performance (\\"I think I'm gonna lay here for awhile\\") marks one of my favorite moments. 'Music Inferno' rates as the best overall number, which mashes up 'Music' with a hard-hitting 'Disco Inferno' beat. Madge and her onstage entourage even don Saturday Night Fever suits!<br /><br />I got up, danced and sang along to my two favorite songs off the Confessions album ('Sorry' and 'Like It Or Not') - which were fortunately performed back-to-back - while blaring the almighty DTS track so as to give my eardrums a workout. Confessions remains a joyous experience that made me feel \\"shiny and new\\" long after the credits rolled. I can't wait to revisit it.<br /><br />Thank you Your Madgesty!

B00008DDXL|5.0|Movie in great shape.  Great movie, as all Harry Potter movies are.  My daughter even loves this movie and is beginnig to become a Harry Potter fan like her mom!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I'm going to just get to the point. Think of buying this set as the \\"directors cut\\" of your absolute favorite movie, as this is what the Beatles wanted their songs to be heard. You will hear versions of songs on here that sound so much better than their 1987 CD mono and stereo counterparts. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and While My Guitar Gently Weeps are my two favorite mono mixes at the moment. I give the music and contents a 5 due to the fact that these mono recordings sound like your listening to the original album without the old vinyl cracks and pops, as well as the inclusion of the original 1965 stereo (remastered) versions of Help and Rubber Soul.      Remastering and issuing these mono recordings was a great idea. The packaging itself is simple. The CD's in this set do not have the expanded liner notes like their remastered stereo counterparts. Each CD is designed exactly the way they looked on vinyl, with Magical Mystery Tour being the only Capitol record label. Also, each cover has it's own proteted wrap. I would definetly give the packaging a 5 due to it's glossy hardcover box, mini replica vinyl cd's, album sleeves, and the protective sleeve for each CD.     All I can say is listen to the mixes the Beatles wanted their fans to hear. The only way to do that is to either buy the mono vinyls or this limited edition boxset. Which by the way, probably wont be available until the end of September.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Bonus disc- like others, i bought the target version(still on sale for second straight week btw) with the 30 minute bonus disc of Jared, Jensen and a few of the writers in a Q&A at the 2008 Comic Con.  It's short, but it's nicely edited and well-paced with no slow or awkward moments.  First 10 min is moderated, the other 20 being mainly fan questions, with a brief interruption from Supernatural's rival show- The Ghostfacers(that show sucks! just kidding).  This is a great bonus disc for me since i didn't get to go and can now watch some of that event at any time(and i think it's worth more than just one viewing).<br /><br />DVD package- The packaging is different than the first 3 seasons as others have mentioned.  Gone is the fold out, panoramic style, now it's in a hard-cover case that holds all 6 discs in a plastic spindle(folks, i admit, i don't know the terminology for these things).  At first i thought this was an extremely cheap plastic spine that could fall out, but i think they made it that way on purpose in case you ever need to take the spine, with all 6 discs, out of its box for whatever reason.  The bonus disc gets it's own placeholder inside the box.  If you're going to buy season 4(and you should), the target version is the way to go with the fun bonus disc.  However, i could've sworn the ad last week said it was 45 min, not 30.  Of course, the standard extras are there as well- gag reel, 3 commentaries, 3 featurettes, and deleted scenes.<br /><br />Me rambling- anyway, i tried season one when i thought it was a monster-of the-week show.  I found out it was more though thanks to the story arc or theme that runs through each season.  Since the first, i've been hooked and am now a fan/collector.  The best thing about the show has to be the chemistry of the characters, especially the Winchester brothers.  You could have a down show or two, or an episode whose 'monster' you don't like or care for, but it doesn't matter.  The real reason you tune in is to see the guys and how they deal with their ongoing situation together, and being a part of that journey.  So if you enjoy shows that have a horror theme, yet dramatic with its story arc, and infuse humor when needed, while centered around some lively characters, Supernatural is for you.how they deal with their ongoing situation together, and being a part of that journey.

B0024F08RO|5.0|Prison Break season four was the second best season out of all 4 for me personally. I would say season one was the best but season 4 was a close second. Follow by season 2 and season 3 even though that was a short season do to the writers strike. There were so many twist and turns i was on the edge of my seat all season. I couldn't wait to watch another episode. The great thing about watching a tv series on dvd. You don't have to wait a whole week to see what happens next. The writing and acting were top notch. If your a fan of 24 like myself then you will love Prison Break!

All I can say is that there will never be another Michael and how fortunate we all were to have him pass this way.  From the first song to the incredible ending, the energy and music just gets better and better.  If you don't have this one, order it now!

I saw it when I was a teenager and found it powerfully affecting at the time.  Returning to it as an adult, however, I found my enjoyment stymied since the plot is so far-fetched, the message heavy-handed, and the ending almost a deus ex machina.<br /><br />Still, this movie makes me wish she had helmed more films.

0446618306|4.0|Appropriate Now...9-09-09    How many men have not received a Dear John letter, usually from a woman who had at one time loved him but now has chosen someone else to marry. With this pair, there could be no other ending. John in this phase was composed of drone, robot, inhuman traits. He was not a normal man; in fact, he was not a man at all. He was a combination to look like three separate in age; the young ex-con was handsome and charming but as he told her at the end, he had been acting all of his life. When a real man received a goodbye letter, the only cost would be emotional. But this John (dd) had no real emotion but he could drink enough liquor and beer to get too drunk to return to his dog in a dark apartment in which he sleeps on the floor. He was full of secrets never using his real name but madeup aliases, no telling how many. He claimed to have a checkered past, but it is as if he had been created in a labatory like Frankensen. One of his three separate personalities was mean. She saw all of them but \\"loved\\" him just the same.     This is not Sparks' best book and I honestly hope they don't make a movie, as it is so surreal but actually happening in these times as an experiment of aliens, to see how many such drones like the Air Force has to fool the general public. He's a good writer, using phrases I know and have used at times. \\"It's kind of tough at first. Don't be surprised if you fall. but if you do just roll with it. It usually takes a few times to get it.\\" (p.47) It just felt right; two bruised warriors looking for support. Everybody needs somebody to talk to, and she had been alone for a long time. She felt that she was finally moving forward with life. I don't believe that men cry the way he expressed it, only women and children. It's possible to go on no matter how impossible it seems and in time grief lessens. Miracles are always possible, no matter how sick a person might be. Love should bring joy, not secrets, lies, and doubts, nor pain. What does true love really mean: you care for another person's happiness more than your own, no matter how painful the choices you face might be. Lost love carries bitter sweet memories of what might have been with an ordinary human, an incomplete life with Star. Pets cam be replaced eventually but Star was an exception. Sixteen years is more than some people live. Sparks is a master at this kind of man/woman relationship.  He amazes me.

B002CMLIJ6|3.0|Taylor Kitsch (Gambit), Will.i.am (John Wraith), Liev Schreiber (Sabretooth), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Tim Pocock (Cyclops), Ryan Reynolds (Wade Wilson), and Lynn Collins (Silverfox).<br />Hugh Jackman has certainly earned his claws. The fourth film to see Jackman behind the growl of Marvel's popular anti-hero Wolverine aptly spotlights both the charismatic actor and the no-nonsense character that made his career. And a superbly cast Liev Schreiber (as the vicious Sabretooth) helps offset the film's hodge-podge plot and barrage of obscure characters.<br /><br />The story focuses on the relationship between brothers Wolverine (aka Logan) and Sabretooth (aka Victor Creed), from their adolescence to wartime heroics to involvement in the controversial Weapon X program. After being sacrificed to a firing squad (an experience that \\"tickled,\\" Logan says), Wolverine and Sabretooth are approached by General William Stryker (Danny Huston). Stryker convinces the men to join a team of tough mutants that includes sharp-shooter Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), brawler Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand) and wisecracking mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), aka Deadpool.<br /><br />But Stryker's band is decidedly ruthless, and Wolverine resigns (much to the dismay of Sabretooth). Flash forward: Wolverine is living the mountaineer life in the woods of Canada, earning money as a lumberjack and enjoying a romance with school teacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). When former members of Stryker's squad start getting assassinated -- and Kayla is thrown in harm's way -- Wolverine agrees to undergo a procedure (at Stryker's request) that will lace his bones with adamantium, a nigh-indestructible metal.<br /><br />Never trust the government. It turns out Stryker has sinister intentions and Wolverine is fortunate to survive the adamantium infusion. As Wolverine endeavors to dismantle Stryker's nefarious program, he turns to fellow mutants for help, including Cajun-born card shark Remy Lebeau (Taylor Kitsch), aka Gambit, and teleporter John Wraith (musician Will.i.am). Meanwhile, Sabretooth is eager for a brotherly scrap with Wolverine and never seems far from the action.<br /><br />Jackman and Schreiber are so well-cast and are so sharp in their roles that extraneous missteps almost feel excusable. Sure, Jackman could sleepwalk through his part after perfectly portraying the feral hero in three previous films, but Schreiber was a question mark. And Schreiber nearly steals the show with his fanged snarls and wolf-ish movement. Kitsch is also terrific as Gambit, though his New Orleans accent seems to waver at times.<br /><br />But \\"Wolverine\\" is not without its problems. The filmmakers stray from the character's comic-book origin too much -- seemingly a result of character overload -- and the film lulls in the second act. There's also a sense of lost opportunity, from both storytelling and visual standpoints. In the comics, Wolverine and Deadpool have impressive-looking outfits that could translate well to the big screen in the hands of a gifted costume designer, but the filmmakers take the easy route. Movies such as \\"Spider-Man,\\" \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"Watchmen\\" have aptly adapted their title characters' costumes -- so why not \\"Wolverine\\"?<br /><br />Overall, the movie is not unlike the character himself: Rough around the edges but memorable nonetheless.teleporter John Wraith (musician Will.i.am).

0765356139|2.0|The Well of Ascension begins and ends with intense blood spattered action scenes, but the middle 400 pages are chock full of the most insecure angsty emo angst you've ever read.<br /><br />If you haven't read Mistborn (5 Stars), stop reading this review now.<br /><br />Story:<br />This book does an excellent job of recapping the events of Mistborn as you progress through the story.  Some of it may seem a bit extraneous, but it's better than having those moments where you think:  \\"Who's that guy again?  He's a what-now?  That's important why???\\"  This book takes place a year after the events in Mistborn.  The Lord Ruler is dead and Elend is an idealistic king who wants to create a fair government.  Just one year into his rule, the kingdom is threatened by the arrival of Lord Straff's army.  To make matters worse, the mists are behaving strangely as if the very fabric of nature has been corrupted.  It's up to the heroes to save the kingdom and solve the mystery of the Well of Ascension.<br /><br />Characters:<br />All of the characters are back and they're a lot less likeable.  It's like they all lost 8 points of Charisma and 5 points of Intelligence when they killed the Lord Ruler.  From page 65 to page 465, all of them become incredibly insecure to the point where it strains your suspension of disbelief.  These people killed a god in the last book!!!  If that doesn't inspire confidence in a person, I don't know what does!  In most stories, one character may become insecure or worried before a major challenge.  From Luke Skywalker, to Rocky, to Frodo, to Avatar the Last Airbender, to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, to Harry Potter, heroes can always gain support from their friends and mentors.  But in this book, nearly every character becomes insecure about every story arc at the same time!!!  Vin wonders if she's girly enough for Elend.  Elend wonders if he's smart enough to be king.  Spook things being a Tin-eye isn't cool enough to be a fantasy super hero.  The shapeshifting kandra feels disrespected...  The self pity and angst go on for 400 pages with no character development at all.  It would have been fine if Elend was worried about being king for 50 pages and his friends helped him through it.  The angst was so bad, I honestly thought there was some new kind of undiscovered allomancy that caused a cloud of insecurity over the kingdom.  Because of the angst, you lose interest in most of the characters. The climactic battle scenes at the end feel like mindless action.<br /><br />Action:<br />The action in this book is better than the action in Misborn.  The Allomancer battles are great and fun to read.  There are duels, sieges, battles, and skirmishes.<br /><br />Maturity:<br />There's violence with head exploding gore!<br /><br />Overall:<br />The book begins and ends strong, but the entire middle of the book will exhaust the patience of most readers.  I can honestly recommend skipping pages 100 - 430.  Because of the enormous amounts of introspection, the book doesn't feel epic.  It's one thing to be riding into the Temple of Doom, thinking, \\"I've got a bad feeling about this...\\"  But when most of your book features characters sitting around moping, it's never a good thing.<br /><br />If you loved the first book and you have a high tolerance for angst, then I can recommend this book.<br /><br />If you can't stand insecure characters, you either need to skip this book or skip pages 100 - 430.

This one is different all right!<br />Although it starts out with a horrible first chapter--in terms of shock value--it goes one from there at a very quiet pace. That helps get over the start.

B000MCIBE8|5.0|Right smack in the middle of the fabled \\"Summer Of Love\\"  came the L.A. band that   brought a whole new more edgier, realistic, yet slightly mystical side to all of   the wide-eyed \\"love-love-love\\" idealism that was sweeping the youth culture of   that time. THE DOORS, the band and the album, were a whole other animal from what   was standard pop/rock fare of the time.  Jim Morrison's cryptic poetry, rife with symbolism, fit perfectly with the   band's rough, rawkus and slightly odd hodge-podge of rock, jazz chords   and general weirdness! They were all made for each other and this album made   a huge impact right from the beginning.  To me, this self-titled album, \\"Strange Days\\", \\"L.A. Woman\\", \\"Waiting For The Sun\\",   \\"The Soft Parade\\" and \\"Morrison Hotel\\" are so unique that they all qualify as   mini classic rock operas which captured the grit, the pathos, the confusion,   the mercurialness and yes, the apathy of the late 60's / early 70's!   It was a revolutionary, scarey & magical time all at once,   and THE DOORS had their finger right on the pulse of the times!   This album has been an inspiration to so many aspiring artists, musicians, poets   and philosophers from every race, socio-economic background and corner of life!   The Lizard King was way out there and so far ahead of his time   (yet of his time!) that it's ridiculous!  But his poetry would've been nothing if not for being perfectly framed   by the astute musicianship of the band he fronted.  There is a reason that this paradigm-shifting album was voted on the list   of the top 200 most definitive albums on rock history!--So Buy It! (-:

B0025KVLTW|4.0|the beatles; magical mystery tour which was released in late 1967,continued the psychedelic ride the beatles started on revolver from 66 and magnified on sgt pepper,s in june of 67.shortly after the release of sgt pepper,s,the beatles decided to make their own movie about a coach tour through the english country side with psychedelic imagery and some new songs recorded after the sgt pepper sessions that were even more psychedelic than the songs on sgt pepper,s.the film [magical mystery tour] was kind of disjointed and ill concieved.however the best parts of the film were the beatles doing the new songs such as i am the walrus and blue jay way and flying.in the documentary on this disc, john lennon stated that this was one of his favorite albums. i think this was the most psychedelic album the beatles did.i like most of this album,except your mother should know and  fool on the hill,but that is my tastes.this album is a must for beatles fans especially if you like their psychedelic peroid!!

But then, in the early 90's, they came out of nowhere  with yet another magnum opus and one of the 90's most interesting albums...  ACHTUNG BABY!!---was perfection in every way, the same as JOSHUA TREE was!  Just put it on and vibe along to every track...there's no junk on this CD!  They topped this amazing album with one of the most spectacular live shows in  modern rock history....THE ZOO TV TOUR!!  They used the grandeuse theatrics of the 70's glam/glitter spectacles like Bowie,  Alice Cooper, KISS and others...but they added their own originality to it along  with the newer technology and brought it into the 90's!  The show was a sell-out everywhere it went!--I saw it in Montreal Olympic Stadium.  There were alter-egos (Satan as a charismatic lounge singer!) and of course  there were the serious issues that U2 has always dealt with in their music.  If you don't already have this one in your collection, get it there immediately!

0385473788|5.0|I have been half wanting to read this book since I, myself was a teenaged girl. It is, of course, a much-lauded book and yet I wasn't certain I could handle another personal account of the holocaust, especially given that this isn't even a survivor's tale.<br /><br />I was surprised to find the book to be a bitter-sweet read. Anne is a 14 year old girl and despite all that is happening to her, she maintains the sensibilites of a 14 year old girl. In some sense it was like reading any young girl's diary. She questions herself and her place in the world, she admonishes those around her, she develops a crush and wonders what love is, etc, etc. Anne seems like she was a very sensible, smart and creative young girl. I was impressed with her constant efforts for study and self-improvement. It's interesting to see the ways in which every generation is the same and the ways each generation is different.<br /><br />This book also gave a good sense about what it might be like to live under such duress and in such close quarters with a large group of other people. It didn't take long for everyone to stop getting along. Even despite all their stresses, they did try to make holidays and birthdays as special as they could. There were even some humorous moments.<br /><br />Overall this really is a sweet book which I would recommend, especially to teenagers. It's like being a fly on the wall during a moment in history. Though I wouldn't recommend this to those seeking to learn a great deal about WWII or the holocaust. Being in captivity, as they were, and also being the diary of a young girl, there isn't too much discussion of politics (though there is some and some of the things were news to me).<br /><br />Good book, I feel now like Anne is friend of mine. She seems like a charming girl who would have gone far with her life. It's a sick, sad shame she didn't get the chance.

0743289412|5.0|I'm a fairly new King fan but nevertheless I aim to read them all.  Lisey's Story was the 7th King novel that I've read and so far it's my favorite.  This is no \\"page turner.\\"  It takes awhile to get into the story, but at some point you really start to get attached to the characters (or at least I did).    I think all the negative reviews are because this one takes a little more thought than your typical King novel.  I found myself re-reading entire chapters in order to better grasp the story.  You can't just turn your brain off and flip the pages.  If that's what you're looking for, I would suggest checking out Cell (also a great read though).  Lisey's Story is a much deeper but more rewarding read.  By the conclusion, I was so attached to the characters, I was quite sad to see it end.      If you're looking for a dramatic read that requires thinking and connecting to the characters, I wholeheartedly recommend Lisey's Story.  If you favor the quick reads, I'd skip this one and check out some of his more popular works.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Those of us old enough to have experienced the Beatles first hand will never forget the excitement of hearing their latest release being played for the very first time. Each record as the band matured was invariably a step forward in creativity. And each release in those early days of FM and the continuing dominance of the AM format was invariably heard in Mono. Stereo was mixed differently in those days. In order to promote the new Stereo recording method as a distinct sonic experience from Mono, engineers created the widest possible soundstage with music heavily separated into the left and right speakers. If you really want to hear a typical difference in mixes listen to Cream's I Feel Free in both Mono and Stereo. The Stereo mix seems equally divided into each speaker with almost nothing coming from the center. As a result the music sounds diffuse and oddly unreal in the Stereo version with barely any bass at the bottom. The Mono mixdown, on the other hand, is sonically powerful and beautifully focused with Jack Bruce's 6-string bass and Clapton's amazing guitar solo now full-throated and much punchier. The Mono version is preferable even after all of these years of remasterings.<br /><br />The Beatles recordings were similarly constructed with their earliest Stereo albums attempting to showcase the new recording method by separating the music into the widest possible soundstage. This was meant to be more lifelike than Mono but to my ears it always seemed to dilute the music a bit. On the Stereo albums Paul's bass lost a bit of its punch and never really reproduced the 'fat bottom' that anchored those beautifully recorded Beatle records. The wide dispersion of the vocals had a similar effect. Those glorious John + George or Paul + George harmonies, often originally meant to be sung into a single microphone, never sounded as solid and rich in Stereo as they did in Mono.<br /><br />On this new Mono box set we can hear for perhaps the very first time (in a non-bootleg recording) the experience one had during those long ago days when these immortal records were first released. Here we can hear Paul's bass producing the same deep, flowing lines that revolutionized the way bass was presented in popular music. The vocals are now full and rich, with harmonies that flow like sonic honey ON TOP OF THE MUSIC instead of weakly dispersed at its periphery as in the Stereo versions. Ringo's tom-toms and bass drums are powerfully propulsive, causing my floor to bounce on several occasions.

Here we can hear Paul's bass producing the same deep, flowing lines that revolutionized the way bass was presented in popular music. The vocals are now full and rich, with harmonies that flow like sonic honey ON TOP OF THE MUSIC instead of weakly dispersed at its periphery as in the Stereo versions. Ringo's tom-toms and bass drums are powerfully propulsive, causing my floor to bounce on several occasions.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Okay I don't have the mono set (yet!) so I can't comment on that one. But this Beatles Stereo Box set is awesome and the CD's I have listened to so far sound superb. Some of the songs are in mono on the Past Masters CD but that's probably the only way they were released. This is a great way to have your Beatles albums in stereo fix, all 13 original albums (UK versions up 'til Sgt. Pepper,the ones released after Pepper were both the same in the US and UK) plus the 2-CD Past Masters set(which contain non LP singles and B-sides). These songs are timeless, sounding better than ever! I like the packaging which reminds me of old LP's, and you have to be careful when when removing the CD's so they won't get scratched. I recommend buying slim CD cases to store them. The box that houses the CD's is also really cool. I guess I'll have to start saving to get the mono set, because I wan't to get those mixes as well.  A+
B0025KVLTM|5.0|the beatles 'sgt pepper,s' was released on june 1st 1967,and was the beatles first masterpiece.sgt pepper took 6 months or so to record and no other record by any other band at the time had such an elaborate production. this album stayed in the top 100 charts for a year or more.the album cover for sgt pepper,s is one of the coolest in rock and set a trend some other bands at the time in 1967 and since have copied just check out the stones satanic majesties also released that year.many of the songs on sgt pepper,s have a psychedelic flavour to them which reflect the beatles experimentation with some illicit party goods!these new remastered versions not only improve the overall sound but have great new booklets and many cool vintage photos of the band!!i really like most of this album.soif you are a fan of the beatles get this now!!
B0026NWBY2|5.0|I have been a fan of George Harrison from the Beatles days, but listening to this album of his greatest hits, you realize what a wonderful song writer and musician he really was.  Every song is a gem.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This series is effin awesome. One of my favorites along side of weeds. I love vampires and this series is definetly one of the most unique. I have read all of the books that are currently avalible and am trying to wait patiently for the tenth one which unfortunatly wont be out until may 2010 . I suggest u read the books, they only get better. If u love vampires u will absolutly love sookie stackhouse. Most of the time people say the books are always better, and they are, but trueblood is pretty much just as good as the books which in my opinion says A LOT! love it love it love it!!!!!!!!!!
0545123267|2.0|I thought this book lacked something.  It is definetly for the young teenagers.  I wouldnt reccommend reading it if your over 17
B000JU7N7E|5.0|has never been more exciting. I thouroughly enjoyed this book. I would compare Gaiman & Pratchetts' writing style in this book to that of Douglas Adams (Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy). I especially liked the 4 \\"bikers\\" of the Apocalypse. If you have an open mind and can laugh easily this is the book for you!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Crazy fun! There are so many subtle things in this cleverly written series to watch for. It's almost like playing one of those \\"Alone in the Dark\\" video games. There are clues everywhere, so while enjoying the off beat characters, keep your eyes and ears open for the side comments,underlying currents and nuances.   Somewhere in another episode you'll find yourself saying,: Ah ha! That's what he/she meant...    Get lost in a brave new world...watch True Blood, the first season.
B00011KHTM|5.0|It is a great product. It does its job. It is a shame that it is not compatible with other laptop/computer products. I have no compliments of the product.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was a great product.   It promised, and deliverd.   It was easy to use and follow.   For those of us who want the benfit of an exercise routine, but have limited time allotment, this was a perfect choice!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Never mind the fact that this work out is \\"only\\" 20 minutes, because it is challenging! You will be ready for a break by the end of the DVD.    I am an avid power-walker, walking nearly 30 miles+ each week. I have a decent pace, but I was still not achieving my goal weight.  Enter the shred.  I LOVE this workout. It incorporates it all-you have your cardio, toning, and ab work.  Since I've incorporated the shred into my fitness plan, I have not only achieved my goal weight, but I am LESS than my goal weight now. My mommy-bulge is finally going away!    I can't say enough to encourage you try this workout.     It's tough, but worth sticking it out. You do see fast results if you're consistent.   It's worth every penny, and every drop of sweat!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was very pleased with my product, for the shipping was prompt and the item was in perfect condition. The movie itself is also a joy to watch, and I've watched it several times since my purchase. The English dub is great, which is rare in a Miyazaki movie, but the original voices are also superb. This movie is a must see.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is a wonderful film. Watch it with someone you care about and share the experience with someone else.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|I enjoyed this book but having read the davinci code 1st i was a little disappointed. But it was still a very good book.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Gran torino was great and i loved it. It was great movie making every scene was great.Every scene was cut great i got it the day it came out on dvd i love it
B001M5UDGS|5.0|When this first came out I saw it as various banner ads and had no interest in watching it. Then one night after spending the day with my friends I came home to see this ad again and decided to watch it for the hell of it. It was late but I found myself enjoying it. Then a few months later I decided to watch it again to see what I missed. I then started telling friends about it and convincing them to watch it too. I found myself loving it more the second time I watched it and noticing little things every time I would watch it. Eventually I decided to buy the DVD...the DVD is amazing. I have watched everything on it. Commentary the musical on it's own is amazing and it's great to hear the cast and crew sing random songs (and I am now addicted to ninja ropes because of it). The DVD allows you insight into one of the most unique things to come out in the past few years and is sure to entertain. The movie itself never ceases to delight and anyone interested in musicals, any of the actors or simply wanna see something unlike most mainstream entertainment this DVD is a must. And the price for all of this is great! Recommended!
B00284BMBM|5.0|I really like this CD. I can't decide which I like better the first one or this one. This one is really great. If you buy this one you won't be disappointed.
B000286S8S|1.0|This compilation of Van Halen is just awful. Whoever put this together should be ashamed of themselves. All of the songs are randomly listed, no chronological order at all. The David Lee Roth era should have been disc one, the Hagar era, disc two. And both of them with songs in chronological order. Then the fact that they cut off \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" is really annoying. The three new songs are ok, not great, but could have been done without. There are so many flaws in this collection and I wish they could get it right. I wouldn't recommend this compilation, unless you feel you must have everything Van Halen, good or bad.
078401213X|5.0|Pi (1998) was another great five star film about a paranoid but brilliant scientist who has a preoccupation with numbers. His paranoia is evident as he has practically barricaded himself into his apartment with several redundant locks (like Jack N. in \\"As Good as it Gets\\"), and only ventures out to meet with his old teacher. His prefessor recommends that he slow down.  Max, his fameous and best student is trying to computer model the governing dynamics of the stock market, while his mentor and old professor has been looking for patterns in pi (3.14159, etc.). I suppose working on these objectives is enough to drive anyone over the edge, but his professor actually does die mysteriously from something half way through the film.<br /><br />Although the much overused theme of a paranoid scientist living in the 90's appears on film once again, this movie was really well done. The film featured some great photography using enhanced contrast B&W film stock, neat shots of multi-ethnick lower Manhattan and New York's fameous subway system with lots of atmosphere, and a really interesting plot guaranteed to drive you insane<br /><br />A nice, even charming side feature of the film occurs when Max is approached by a very friendly but odd person who asks him if he is Jewish. A few moments later, just like a regular customer of one of New York's fameous Mitvos-Mobiles, Max is praying and learning how to be a good jew.  He soon finds out that his good natured host is also using math to study jewish scripture.  Hold onto your sanity, now we are really off to the races.<br /><br />One sign I noticed of a low budget film was the bald skull cap that Max wore after he shaved his head. You could see wrinkles all over the poorly fitted prop.  I think you will like this film as it has many subtle touches.  I also enjoyed the opening graphics which looked like they were taken from some advanced work in mathematics. This film was really well done and deserved a full five stars.
0790744295|5.0|I recieved my DVD Creepshow by Stephen King very fast and in GREAT condition. THANK YOU
B000TGCR3I|4.0|This is visually one of my favorite anime films ever.  The 3d environments were beautifully created, without that typical CG look and the character animation was excellent. Excellent character design.  Everything is very fluid and alive.  In terms of the plot, I enjoyed it thoroughly for the first half, until the entire mood took a very dark turn and remained that way until the end.  It got to the point where it wasn't enjoyable anymore.  Maybe if I was expecting that to happen, I may have taken it better.  Overall, a very well-made anime in all respects.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have tried numerous ways to loose weight, stuff off of TV, having a personal trainer, running about 12 miles a week (and I am not a runner), dieting in combination with it all... but nothing, this DVD no joke helped me loose the weight I wanted to loose, boost my metabolism, and helped me gain the confidence to stay this way. I am very happy with the results I am getting from the 30 day shred. I have been using it for over 20 days now. I would not consider myself to be very athletic but it has increased my strength.
B0002IQNAG|4.0|The case is slightly damage due to either from shipping or from the previous owner, but the dvd's and the other items included in this dvd set are in perfect condition. People who are a fan of George Romero's dead films this is a must buy it's worth the money.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Anything but nein, nein, nein, this release is yah yah yah. I received mine from amazon.com today, having pre-ordered with free shipping. That's great work by amazon to have it arrive on 9-9-09. I've only played 'I am the Walrus' from Magical Mystery Tour. The previous CD version has been a reference for my sound systems over the years. I'm very familiar with it. I'm impressed with the improvement that I hear. Other reviewers who have heard more seem to verify the opinion. I'm glad this set is  here. I also received the mono set. That will be a trip to hear. The vinyls were the first versions I heard as I grew up, and they were monaural.
B002JYPV3G|5.0|***Just to get this straight first, I am a 15 year old writing this review on my mom's account***    Anyway, ever since I heard Slipknot was re-releasing their self-titled album (for the billionth time), I knew I would get it like any other album I was psyched to get from them. This 10 anniversery re-release album is by far the second most(Sic)est thing any Slipknot fan will want to get their hands on. The first being the Disasterpieces DVD with heart-pounding live footage. This version of Slipknot contains several new bonus tracks, including the long-lost classic \\"Purity\\" which was supposed to be on the original release of the self-titled album, but was soon removed due to copyright reasons. However I do agree with the reviewer who stated Frail Limb Nursery should have been on before Purity, but this is a very minor thing. I think Purity is already good enough by itself making an appearance on this album, as it is my favorite 'Knot song. FLN would just be a plus, but even without it, it's still a great chance to get never before released tracks on this CD. Other bonus tracks including Eeyore, Get this, and Snap are garunteed to satisfy any crazed Slipknotic. There are also 2 demos/ alternive versions of \\"Spit it out\\" and \\"Wait and Bleed\\" and one remix version of (Sic). But that's not all.....    Just when you thought the bonus tracks were enough, you thought it couldn't get any better, huh? Bet not. This thing just gets better and better. The second disc it comes with contains four music videos (some that may be similar to the ones seen on Youtube)with all of the live craziness you would expect from any Slipknot show. It also has a 50 minute video showing what Slipknot does before, during, and after their shows in 1999 & 2000, all containing just the (sic)est stuff you would expect them to do from beginning to end. Even though the live footage you see on this isn't as thrilling as the stuff caught on Disasterpieces, it's still worth watching these guys go crazy just doing their thing. You still get to see some good shots of each member doing lots of crasy s**t. The shots of Joey Jordison doing those drum lines will bound to please any fan of Slipknot, or just Joey alone. Besides, how many re-releases have this kind of stuff? And for the price? The original Slipknot songs + bonus tracks + demos & remixes + live footage + music videos + behind the nine + absolute (sic)ness, did I get everything? It's just worth every penny. With all this stuff combined, I'd say it's worth the extra few dollars you put in. Now remember, just because it's a re-release doesn't necessarily mean you're buying the same exact thing, it means your getting the same exact thing with A LOT of extra stuff with it. And not a lot of re-releases have this kind of stuff. Slipknot has once again pleased me with their work, and I am very happy with this purchase. I would recommend this to any Slipknot fan.
0316017922|5.0|Interesting theories of how and why people succeed in different kinds of work. Much rings true to me, and the book made me think. It is well written.
B000AMJC2K|3.0|I was satisfied with the product in general.  The cable holders, however, are a joke - they are very flimsy and fall off often.  So I've discarded them.  Also the documentation is a bit unusual - no words, just pictures, some of which aren't understandable at first glance.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Why ruin the pace of this story by the CONSTANT use of the passive voice?!
0307266303|5.0|I was prepared for a book that told a fascinating story of a tribe of natural, talented runners.  What I was not prepared for was the compelling argument that the author made that we are ALL runners.  As someone who is not wildly fond of exercise, I found the information he put forward about our anatomy, our evolution, and our eating habits as fascinating as the story itself.  And as someone who has always preferred to run barefoot but thought I shouldn't, I found the tale validating and liberating. I am going out running!
0307408833|1.0|I was excited to spot this book at the library and promptly checked it out. Like other reviewers, I quickly realized that  the \\"gluten free\\" free in the title is not true. Entire sections of recipes are made with spelt flour. All of the recipes feature expensive ingredients and are heavy in fat and sweeteners. That's fine when you want a decadent dessert, but the author suggests these are snacks, which could be presumed to fit into a healthy diet. They are not.    As an alternative, I recommend The Wheat-Free Cook: Gluten-Free Recipes for Everyone by Jacqueline Mallorca. I had pretty much passed on baked goods until I found this book. The recipes feature a variety of flours, suggest substitutions and variations, and range from everyday to special occasion. There are even homemade pastas. The author is a professional cook, and it shows in the quality and detail of the recipes.
0385341008|5.0|I loved this story beginning to end!  Great writing and very informative about conditions during the war that I had no idea about.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book!
B002BSHXJA|4.0|Having spent the day on a 1 by 1 comparison of each disc in mono and stereo (well, I have only gotten as far as Sgt Pepper), in all honesty, I prefer the stereo mixes. I know they didn't work in stereo until later in their career, but my ears have been listening in stereo and other enhanced formats for some time now...  As to the merits of the discs themselves, the stereo remasters come with some video footage chronicling the times and the productions of each disc. They are keep sakes, certainly. What is certainly the case is what was certainly the case even with the 1987 cds: you'll get a sense of wonder at hearing what they were up to even early on, and as a result, I think you'll find your appreciation for McCartney and Starr as a rhythm section greatly enhanced. PPM is still a little grainy, even in mono, but it may not have been recorded all that well the first time. Who knew what was coming and while they were better than their competition, they were not that much better. George Martin must have snapped to with MTB. In both formats there is a depth and placement that is a huge leap forward over the first record. Basically from HDN until Abbey Road, they never looked back. It was a 6 and 1/2 year recording career and no one else ever made the quantum leaps they did.  You can debate the politics of whose band it was as they went along, but give them credit, they hit on all burners all the time and produced a noble canon. Paul Williams, their first manager, said there was no doubt that McCartney and Harrison would be stars. He also opined that what surprised him about the break up was not that it happened but that McCartney had stuck with Lennon as long as he did. Well, there was a reason - they shared a protean songwriting partnership and an ability to redefine the medium in which they worked on a continually challenging basis for themselves and for anyone who gave a listen. And inspite of everything, the four of them shared an affection for each other that largely, and in the end, overcame any of their differences.  Listening to this music, that's what I remember.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|but a recording LEGEND deserves better material.    First, let me just start by saying, there is some good fun music on this new CD and I enjoy it overall (it's just nice to have Whitney back)... but it should have been EXCELLENT!!!  Three years in the making...?!  The contemporary feel to much of the music and lyrics is absolutely in the hope of getting airplay and appealing to a younger audience who didn't perhaps know her - or listen to her - at her peak.  Going for \\"street cred\\" in marrying Bobby Brown was a mistake many felt she made years ago, and I don't think it was necessary to take this kind of commercial approach for her \\"comeback\\" (\\"your s__t don't stink\\"?!, etc.).  Okay, it makes me chuckle, but again, Whitney Houston simply deserved better and more emotional material. That said, let's just be grateful that Clive Davis was able to get her back into the recording booth and that Whitney - in the studio - still has enough voice to make some enjoyable recordings.  At her still youngish age (45), her voice should be in much better shape.  If the objective listener goes back and reviews some other recording \\"divas\\" at the age of 45 (Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, Gladys Knight, etc.), Whitney should be able to hit those lower notes on \\"I Look to You\\" without any problem at all... but, she can't.  For whatever reasons, her voice has been abused.  I am just being honest here, and I am a fan.    Still, and in my humble opinion, even the current Whitney Houston is a more enjoyable listen than most of the other female recording artists out there - half her age!!  I hope she continues to progress, take care of herself and her family... and with a little help through vocal lessons or whatever, her next CD should be stronger!!
1433502445|5.0|The translation is a close transliteration from the original languages into English, while still keeping a faithful meaning. The study sections follow almost verse-by-verse, plenty of maps & collateral information for context. It is a hit with my church groups and leaders[[ASIN:143350393X ESV Study Bible (TruTone, Forest/Tan, Trail Design)]].
0385342020|4.0|I am not a fan of the Shopaholic series (could any \\"heroine\\" be more annoying and self-centered?) and was reluctant to pick up this book, but the premise was interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  It was a fun, sweet read.  Being a fan of the roaring 20's, I really liked it.  Lara was less manic than previous main characters in Kinsella's novels, but still a bit of a mess (aren't we all though, really?).  Her boyfriend has dumped her, her business partner has run off leaving Lara to run a business she doesn't really know about, her parents are on her case about the direction her life is going and then she starts seeing the ghost of her great-aunt, Sadie, who has just passed away at the age of 105.  Sadie is wonderfully written.  She's very 20's.  I'd love to hang out with her and do the Charleston until dawn.  She makes Lara do things Lara thinks are insane, but ultimately helps Lara get what she's always wanted.    The book makes some very deep observations about the elderly that I found touching, sweet and sad.  It made me wish I'd gotten to know my much elderly relatives better before they passed away.  This book isn't going to win any awards or be required reading for anyone, but I found it to be a lovely story with (mostly) charming characters.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something fun.  Tally-ho!  <--read the book and you'll get that.
B00005ASHM|5.0|We lived in Heidelberg, Germany (Army) in 1969, and had the Pet Sounds vinyl album playing constantly then.  Years later, we become good friends with Larry Knechtel, keyboard and bass player who The Beach Boys summoned to play on this album.  Larry passed away in Aug, 2009, and listening to his music is bitter sweet.  Pet Sounds is one CD I keep in the player.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Who could have ever thought it would have been possible? 09/09/09 has become a red-letter date in the history of Beatle-dom. It could be the repetitive nature of the phrase \\"Number Nine, Number Nine\\" featured in the track \\"Revolution 9\\" from \\"The White Album\\". Or, even the bit of dialogue \\"dial 9-9-9\\" from the 1965 motion picture \\"Help!\\" However, 09/09/09 has become important for a far better reason.    After more than 22 years of having The Beatles' albums on CD, we are finally treated to the definitive box set of Beatles music. This time, the folks at EMI and Apple finally got things right for a change. While having Beatles CDs is a thrill, it is now even more-so with this brilliant audio collection. For the very first time, their entire recorded output has been remastered for the 21st century, complete with unique liner notes and special digipak-packaging to boot. With the exception of the \\"Past Masters\\" set, each disc also contains a brief mini-documentary about that album. These short bits can only be utilised with the assistance of a computer's disc drive. However, the box set does include a bonus DVD disc featuring all of these short sequences together so you can enjoy it on your very own DVD player. What you have here are the original British Beatles albums just like what had been released before; only now, the listener can enjoy the first 4 albums - \\"Please Please Me\\". \\"With The Beatles\\", \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"Beatles For Sale\\" - available in true stereo for the very first time. Combined with the remaining 9 albums recorded by the group between 1965 and 1970, this is a masterpiece set, and a special treasure trove of timeless, classic songs that changed the entire structure of popular music as we know it today.     Each CD is carefully and painstakingly put together in a very special 3-border fold-out, which allows the CD to be housed in a slot on the far right-hand side (except for the double discs, which have their CDs fitted inside the packaging). Eachtitle also comes with a special CD booklet containg many unreleased photographs that represent the time when each album was originally released, plus well-written liner notes (including the original notes from the first 4 albums). The \\"Yellow Submarine\\" booklet contains both the original UK and US back cover notes together for the very first time. And, what a thrill it is to finally be able to have the photo/comic-strip booklet from \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", that was initially issued in the American LP in 1967, in an official CD release for the very first time. The \\"White Album\\" packaging includes the original poster, in a CD sized reproduction, that features the photo collage on one side, and the album's song-lyrics on the other side. This marks the second time that this poster was made available in a \\"White Album\\" CD release, following the 30th anniversary reissue from 1998.     The sound quality of the songs are, without a doubt, the very best that I have ever heard before. For the first time, the audio quality of each track is sharp, crisp, crystal clear and truly an audiophile's dream come true. It should also be noted that the songs \\"Love Me Do\\" (both versions), \\"P.S. I Love You\\", \\"Only A Northern Song\\", \\"She Loves You\\", \\"I'll Get You\\" and \\"You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)\\" are all presented in their original monaural mixes, whereas the remaining songs are all in true stereo. Even \\"I Am The Walrus\\" still has its orignal mix of half-stereo/half-duophonic, just like the first time around. All in all, this box set far surpasses all other box sets that have come before.    And, the bonus DVD of the mini documentaries is also well-produced. Each segment features audio comments from The Beatles themselves along with George Martin. This DVD gives a fascinating insight into why these classic albums have stood the test of time so well, and continue to be so popular, even into the 21st century.    Many current and legendary artists have called The Beatles a major influence. One listen to this music and you too will see why. Beatlemania will live on forever!
B002A9OJ0Q|4.0|Scoundral Days has always been my favorite a-ha album.  I've been a devoted fan over the past 24 years and buy all of their cds and singles.  But I can't say they were flawless.  Most releases have been uneven and sometimes boring.  It's the two or three gems on each that kept me listening.  But Foot Of The Mountain is different.  It's full of gems that have hints of my other favorite 80s groups - Depeche Mode and Erasure.  They must have used vintage keyboards to get that retro sound.  This is full of melody and great hooks too.  One of my favorite releases for 2009 and there's no US release. Too bad because it's so good.
B00160VHM8|1.0|I don't demand too much of a recording, wouldn't even consider myself an \\"audiophile\\", but in this case the disparity between the sharp sound of the violin and the awful opacity of the piano is too much to bear: Beethoven simply can not get through the asphyxiating cacophony the sound engineer constructed around these sonatas.  Being unable to endure even one full movement of any of them, I would return them immediately and without hesitation except I got mine as part of Brilliant's complete works, so my only option is to replace them with a more modern, hopefully digital, recording.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Overall I am very pleased with my purchase of the Stereo Box set.........  I can tell a difference in the sound compared to the other CDs previous released!!  I believe they feel warm and have more depth....... I do have a question though.  My box came with two copies of Yellow Submarine.  No other discs were missing just an extra Yellow Submarine.  Did this happen to anyone else??
B002BSHXJA|5.0|\\"You've never heard 'Pepper' until you've heard it in mono\\"-John Lennon<br /><br />These seminal albums sound terrific in this great remaster boxed set. With \\"Help!\\" through \\"The Beatles\\" appearing on CD in mono for the first time, we get to hear what The Beatles themselves considered the definitive versions of their albums. Nicely packaged with sharp reproductions of the original LP sleeves (at least as they appeared in the UK) this set is missing a two classic albums \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" where the band had adopted the stereo format as their preferred format at the time. They've done a very nice job of also reproducing the inserts that appeared with the original vinyl releases of these albums.<br /><br />While \\"Yellow Submarine\\" was mixed as fold downs for mono, there are dedicated mono mixes for the new songs included here. The \\"Past Masters\\" set sounds terrific--\\"Paperback Writer\\", \\"Revolution\\" and other tracks sound punchier than their stereo variations (that's not to imply that the stereo versions are bad--they just don't quite have as much punch as the original single mixes which were designed to be heard on radio and knock off the socks of listeners.<br /><br />\\"Pepper\\" in particular benefits from this release with \\"She's Leaving Home\\" played back at a slightly different speed, slightly different edits and sound effects for many of the tracks included. The big news though is that unlike the stereo set (which I think sounds quite good as well despite some peak limiting)the mono CDs have the full dynamic range of the original recordings.<br /><br />You'll also hear differences on some of the mixes (and the running speed for \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" which is played back at a different speed than the stereo version)\\"The Beatles\\". As to which one you prefer, it depends on what you were raised on. For me hearing everything from \\"Help!\\" on in mono has been fun because as a kid we had a stereo so I heard the unusual stereo mixes that George Martin and his team put together. I'd also add that for \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" we get the original 1965 stereo mixes for both albums as bonus tracks on the mono discs for each album. This is a nice plus since many fans were dissatisfied with George Martin's 1987 remixes (which are on the stereo stand alone and box set releases of each respective album).<br /><br />I'll admit that I haven't had the time to listen to all the recordings completely here more than once since receiving this set--there's so much here to appreciate. Little details are evident in the mastering here that weren't evident in the first four albums when they were original released in mono on CD (many sounded muddy compared to the original British vinyl--the U.S. Capitol vinyl couldn't compare to the British versions since they were more than one generation away from the mastertapes)The early first four CDs had other issues because they were transferred on a stereo machine even though they were in mono. That is remedied here. Choice vinyl versions of these albums blew away many of the original first four albums released in mono and that's not the case here (although some fans will perfer the vinyl versions to the CD simply because of the medium and the analog sound).<br /><br />The booklet is nice but does avoid a lot of the controversies that often surrounded some of these albums.<br /><br />Capitol will be doing a second run of the CDs for the US (originally they were going to be limited sometimes reported to be no more 10,000 copies per country depending on which report you read). The demand was way beyond what Capitol and EMI worldwide expected (although the mono CD box set was more readily available in the UK)so there will be a second run. Should you pay $500 or $400 for this set? I don't know I would just wait until the second run is released if you can. That way you have more $ to spend on other stuff (maybe that stereo boxed set you were looking at...).\\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" we get the original 1965 stereo mixes for both albums as bonus tracks on the mono discs for each album.

B00278U1WA|5.0|this CD is sooo good. It's perfect for driving in the car or just hanging around the house. I love Regina Spektor; she never fails with her poetic lyrics and beautiful skill on the piano.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I bought the album for my daughter's 28th birthday.  She remembers staying up late on Friday and Saturday nights as a little girl and watching music videos.  Thriller was her favorite. The 25th anniversary Thriller CD was a great gift for her and I bought it the day Michael died.  Lots of other e-tailers had sold it out, but Amazon had it and delivered it in just a few days.

B00127RAJY|4.0|It was a great workout.  I don't run marathons, but I would consider myself pretty fit and this was really hard.  The only thing I don't like about this video is that i find Jillian too awkwardly abrasive.  She tries to joke a bit, but it doesn't work with her rougher personality.  But, the workout is good enough that I can overlook her personality.

0099518937|5.0|Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece.es almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I highly recommend this collection, I realized I never seen Michael as I seen him in the concert, Live In Buccresti, I watched the concert at least 15 times, and shared it with everyone I knew, It was like being at the concert live, Michael is magnificate from beginning to end. I even had parties watching the concert, we even tried to dance to the songs performed, no one could hang through one entire song, people were even injuring them selves trying to kick and spin like Michael.I highly recommend. I bought just the concert for friends as gifts. Its so cool I just want to share with everyone I know.
B000063IQP|3.0|For fans of early experimental ambient, all TD's first phase work would probably keep interest, but music fans looking for the group's prime organic output would hold out for their next, often considered greatest release- the reason being of course this idea-heavy, fragmented work merely hints at production cohesion which was to follow.

And not all these songs were #1 hits so they should've just made it 20 tracks and add in more songs from the rest of his solo career.
0930289234|4.0|Though this book has been around since the 1980s, I wouldn't have even known it existed before I heard of the Watchmen movie. I considered taking out the book soon after I heard of it, but it wasn't until I watched Watchmen in a theater once, and then ordered and watched the director's cut that I finally took the book out of the library. After finishing it, I watched the director's cut on DVD a second time, this time stopping frequently to re-watch scenes and take closer looks at details.<br /><br />Reading this graphic novel, there were three things I noticed. First, it was a fun, quick read. I found myself reading more than an hour each night, and sometimes even reading it for 2 or 3 hours in the day, and at that rate, I was finished within a week. Second, the movie was very close to the book, and it's quite possible that the Zack Snyder film is the most faithful big screen literary adaption thus made, even more faithful than some of the classic novel adaptations like The Outsiders or Huckleberry Finn. Third, it's not exactly the same.<br /><br />Reading the graphic novel, after having watched the movie twice already, I noticed subtle changes. Some little things like there being a glass divide between the prisoners and the cooks in the prison cafeteria, the slightly larger and sturdier laser that Nite Owl caries (not sturdy enough to resist a boot, though), and the less poodle-looking haircut of the older Sally Jupiter, as well as the more noticeable changes such as the slightly altered Ozymandias plot (simplified, more connected, and slightly less stupid than the one in the book), the slightly altered costumes, and the changes in pacing such as removing the unnecessary Max Shea storyline, separation of the Black Freighter storyline, the shortening of the Dr. Malcolm Long encounter (which also has the effect of increasing the character's intelligence, since in the comic Dr. Long seems almost retarded, as he initially takes Walter Kovacs' Rorschach answers of \\"a pretty butterfly\\" and \\"some nice flowers\\" as truth) and lengthening of some important scenes such as the final encounter of Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach. And though I'm not a diehard fan enough to list all the changes, I got the impression that about 9 out of 10 of the changes from the graphic novel to the movie were positive, sensible ones.<br /><br />The overall effect of these changes points out a key fact: The most critically acclaimed graphic novel of all time isn't perfect. Saying it's the best graphic novel of all time simply means that there isn't a better one, or at least there isn't a better one that's as well-known. In fact, I would agree that it's probably at least one of the best graphic novels of all time. The detail that went into the drawing, color and background, the written features between chapters, and the working of the story all point to a superb job done by Alen Moore, Dave Gibbons, and John Higgins. But there are many parts in it which don't make sense, are overly complicated, deserve to be cut out (some simply because the movie doesn't have the space for everything, but many more because they weren't that important to the original story to begin with), and some parts that were just plain mistakes. And thus, I would say that the movie actually DESERVES to be the way that the general population learns about the Watchmen. In fact, I think the movie deserves to be canon more than the original novel deserves to be.<br /><br />TV tropes has one trope which it named \\"Adaption Distillation\\", when a work is shortened to fit a new medium, and in the process, much extraneous material is cut and some errors are corrected, creating a work that's better than the original. In my opinion, that description fits Watchmen perfectly. With the simplification, beauty, movement, acting, and other changes of the movie, the original graphic novel starts to look less spotless by comparison (kind of like a button with liquid blemishing its surface), not to mention the decay as the book ages, not only the physical decay (new or mint copies can be found, but the majority of the ones in circulation are very old. The one in my library was first checked out in 1990), but as history continues to erase some of the assumptions that the novel was founded upon (most importantly the founding assumption of the inevitability of the US/USSR conflict ending in nuclear war, which obviously never happened in reality).<br /><br />Alan Moore famously refused to see the movie Watchmen after it came out, and had little to no hand in its production. Many assumed that was because he feared the movie would not turn out well. It turned out he did not have to fear such an outcome. Instead, now he has good reason to fear that his 35 year old comic will be rightfully replaced in the public consciousness (and be seen by millions more people than would ever have even known about the graphic novel) by a movie which distills and improves upon his original work. So, I would still recommend reading this book, because it stands up well in that it's still a very enjoyable read (plus it's interesting if you're curious about the genesis of the movie, and curious about what was changed). But know that this book has more errors and is less concentrated than the Zach Snyder movie, and that its time and influence as a graphic novel is waning.

If you like 3.5, but are tired of running into the same old problems, Pathfinder fixes them. Updates to all of the classes and races puts everyone on par with everyone, streamlined combat maneuvers like grapple and sunder have been overhauled to a smoother form. The entire book contains, the original races, classes, skills, feats, equipment, rules, spells (fixed polymorph), prestige classes, traps, poisons, diseases & curses, environment, and many more useful rules and appendixes.

B0000931OG|5.0|If you listen to all the Blur albums chronologically, it sounds as if they are gearing up (down?) for this album, especially when you consider 13. It's very mellow, that much is for sure, very sweet and poignant for the most part, but it's got a few jamming numbers true to Blur fashion. Electronics dominate this album, but I would hardly call it techno. In fact, it's hard to categorize this album. Not quite rock, not quite electronica, not quite pop, alternative maybe, but alternative what? Suffice it to say that this is good music and a very bold step from a very creative band. Great album, I recommend it highly.
0345350499|5.0|This is a very powerful book. If you are a woman, you will be LIBERATED while reading this. The copy of this book I read was 876 pages long, with the finest print of all fiction books i've ever laid hands on. Despite it's size, I read it extremely quickly because it was such a good book; reading it was all i did until it was done. Then when it was over, I was SO ANGRY! HOW COULD THERE NOT BE MORE? HOW COULD IT BE OVER!! yet i was a little relieved, at least i got my life back! i'm still searching for a book that is better.
0439023491|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I've had it on my mind since I finished it.  I cannot wait for the next one to come out.  All this added together equals a five star rating for me.  I like it even better than the first one and I can't even tell you why, I is awesome!
B0025KVLT2|5.0|I just received my copy of the newly remastered Rubber Soul on 09/09/09 and it sounds fantastic!  I have not had a previous copy (LP or CD) so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I do have all the later CD's from the original 1987 release.  Hat's off to the people who did this remaster as the sound is outstanding.  I had it cranked up in my car on the way home and was very pleased with the sound.  It was full, clear, realistic without any harshness.  Bravo, and it's a GREAT album.  Great Songs!  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|First off, I'd like to stress that my review will focus mostly on technical aspects of this set: the packaging, the transfer, the menu, etc. I've skimmed some of the other reviews and most of the 4 or 5 star ones give great overviews of the quality of the show itself. When I look here for shows that I like, I tend to want to know about the quality of the set, which helps me decide whether to buy it right away (which I do for quality sets) or whether to wait and get it used (which I do for rush-jobs). I would, however, like to stress my admiration for Anna Torv. For me, she's what sells the believability of this whole idea that is Fringe. Many give much (deserved) praise to John Noble, but I absolutely love Torv and her character Olivia. She's a great strong independent role model, and plays it expertly. Bonus points for pulling off an exceptional American accent!    Now, for those who know the show already, you may be on the fence about purchasing the set. As of 8 September 2009, the set is priced at $50.99, and that's not chump change, especially if, like me, you're a college student. To avoid getting too wordy (I already used more than I wanted to in the above section) I'll give a little pro/con list. [Note: I uploaded plenty of pictures to the customer image section to avoid lengthy descriptions).]    Pros  + Outer Packaging: The outer slipcase looks great, complete with a lenticular cover giving us 2 cool front cover images. The slipcase is nice in that it retains the look of a regular boxed set (cardboard) while keeping in line with the easy-to-use Blu Ray plastic packaging.    + Inner Packaging: As mentioned above, the inside contains a regular BD plastic case with--gasp--another cover image! I was impressed with this (okay, I'm easily impressed) because usually the slip cover uses the same image as the actual package. Here, we get sometime entirely different than what's on the outside which is a nice change of pace.    + Included is an episode guide booklet,which I was beginning to think was a thing of the past. Fringe's episode booklet does exactly what it should, but also contains nice cast pictures and some critic's blurbs. (See more Pro's info in my uploaded pictures for the booklet)    + The discs, which feature artwork very befitting of the show, are easily accessed in what I like to call the disc \\"pages\\"    + Warner did a great job on the AV transfer. I have an average set up (32\\" Samsung 720p LCD, no speaker system to speak of) and so far, the transfer looks just as good as it did upon its HD broadcast    + The special features are about what you'd expect from a J.J. Abrams show; there are a lot of them and they really are interesting--at least as interesting as those on the LOST DVDs. The longer features (between 10 and 20 minutes, I don't recall exactly off hand) are fun and informative, and are in high definition. Besides the lengthier features, every disc has little (1 to 3 minutes) behind-the-scenes videos specific to an episode, also in HD, that provides some insight into a key scene for the given episode. I'm not a fan of commentaries, but 4 are on this set.     Con  - The lenticular cover wasn't exactly perfect. It looks great, but the actual material seems to have been \\"scratched\\", which could have occurred during or after production, I don't know. When looking at it straight on it's not noticeable but if you tilt it, you can see any scratches that may be on the material (which I'm assuming is some kind of plastic)    -The Gag Reel is a widescreen video, but matted for 4:3 (so basically you have the black bars on the sides of the screen and the top of the screen).    - Hmm... I really can't think of any others. I'm trying, too, I promise!     Besides my minor gripes about the little packaging imperfections (whether they are a result of transport or poor production) there really aren't any complaints about this package. Whenever I start following a show, I can tell right away whether I'll want to buy itor not. Then I tend to picture what the package will look like, or at least have an idea about how it should be. The Fringe package is about as good as I could have imagined. Its design fits perfectly with the show, which means the people putting it together really cared about it. Although $50 is a little steep, it's a fair price for an extremely inventive series that will be sure to garner many worthwhile repeated viewings.    Do yourself a favor and buy this set as soon as you can! It's well worth the money.
1567184855|5.0|I have always seemed to have a thirst for understanding and touching what is our ultimate reality. I would often go to Church but sadly nothing resonated with me, nothing touched me and I was always turned off by the dogma that any of the Christian type of religions offered, although I firmy believe in Christ. Yet I have always thirsted for this knowledge and eventual connection. \\"Journey of Souls\\" is \\"The Book\\" that spoke to me in a way that has altered how I see myself, my purpose and my destiny. I am not saying that the Bible does not work for many people and I am not comparing this book to the Bible by any means, I am just saying that this book, Journey of Souls, speaks to me in ways that the Bible cannot.     Journey of Souls is derived from case studies from individuals that are actually recalling \\"scenes\\" from the afterlife- their areas of study, their desire to perfect and actually their \\"humor\\" and \\"recreational preferences\\" as they move along that journey on the other side. Each Soul describes the fact that incarnating on a planet like Earth creates a very special challenge, how an earthly experience accelerates our Soul's growth by learning to deal with all the negative energy and flesh driven desires that come from being a human being on the planet Earth, a most difficult \\"school\\" indeed.     This book is most impressive because of how Newton gathers his data, these 29 individual \\"hypnotic regressions\\" into their own \\"life between lives\\" is important because of the fact that this data is gathered from disparate data points. Newton has regressed many hundreds of patients, and has virtually \\"mapped\\" the afterlife from his clients sessions. These clients did not know each other. They are from all over the world. How could they all be saying the SAME thing under hypnosis? The answer is that it is not possible. This is the main reason why Newton himself went from being an Atheist to now the most prolific writer of our time on the subject of the Afterlife. Hisinterviews are availble on YouTube- just type in Michael Newton, they are extremely compelling as well.    All I can say is that I have never read anything that was more compelling than this book. I have read others on the subject and they all are good- all of the books by Dr. Brian Weiss, \\"Backwards\\" by Dennison, \\"Embraced by the Light\\" by Eadie and many more- they all are insightful and add a piece to the puzzle. This book is the ONE book that is an absolute MUST read on this subject. I absoultely could not put it down, I have read it again 3 different times and I get more out of it each time. I believe that this book will actually speak to your own Soul and you will know insticntively and immediately that this is very valuable information.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I think this album deserves 4.5 stars because it has a lot of great riffs and melodies, but I won't waste my time writing a review because I don't even have to! It seems that the people who accept the reviews don't even care if the \\"reviews\\" don't talk about the album... Over 40 negative \\"reviews\\" were written by ONE person! A lot of \\"reviews\\" don't even say anything about the album! BUT worst of all, a lot of \\"reviews\\" are one guy insulting another guy! Why the *beep* were they allowed?    Here are a few examples of reviews that the people of Amazon find acceptable:    Review 1: \\"DONT LISTEN TO THAT 5 STAR PATHETIC LOSER! hes a moron- he doesent know anything\\"    Review 2: \\"you need to realize this disc sucks- if you like it you dont know music\\"    Review 3: \\"this album is horrific- just like the 5 star reviwer's mother\\"    Review 4: \\"you take this way too seriously-- i almosy feel bad for you-- almost- THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!!\\"    Review 5: \\"who cares? and people ar going to read your reviews? you freakin idiot\\"    Review 6: \\"you must have no life- haha- like anyone is going to ready all of your moronic reviews- and your complaining about the intelligence of my reviews- LOL- like I spend a lot time reviewing what I wrote- I COULD CARE LESS- you and your holier than thou attitude- GO TO HELL-- you freakin dork\\"    Review 7: \\"you read every one of these reviews huh? and you wait for me to come on- you freakin loser\\"    Review 8: \\"help me please ! i'm egyptian and the cd is not sold right here ! so i only can download it ! i need the timing of each track and if possible its size ! cauz there is a fake train of thought published on the net !   if anybody knows a way to download the tracks also please tell me ! thank you..\\"    and there are 20 or so more.    All in all, don't take the overall rating seriously. If stupid trolls didn't exist, this album would have an overall rating higher than 4.
B001WCBPCW|5.0|Kasabian decided that they wanted to make a new album completely different from their previous records.  This could be dangerous or smart depending on the new sound they change to.  Boy, it turned out to be quite the suprise to hear a kind of country bumpkin sound come out of Kasabian.  But you know what, it was genius.  You listen to Fire the first time and your thinking, what happened? Then all of a sudden it hits you and the song sounds so beautiful and epic.  I have listened to that song as well as the rest repeatedly since it came out, and it's never gotten old.  It's such a durable album, I can only compare it to Radiohead's In Rainbows.  It never ever gets old.  This concept album is the best example for artists looking to compose a concept piece.  It takes you to a different world or age and gives you something new that you'll never forget.  It's a powerful album.<br /><br />Luckily its nearly perfect from start to finish.  You'll definetely get your money's worth.  My favorite tracks are \\"Where Did All the Love Go?\\", \\"Fast Fuse\\", \\"Take Aim\\", \\"Thick as Thieves\\", \\"West Ryder Silver Bullet\\", \\"Vlad the Impaler\\", \\"Ladies and Gentlmen\\", \\"Secret Alphabets\\", and \\"Fire\\".  The other songs seem a little off from the concept, but they're still good songs.  \\"Happiness\\" is the only song I really don't enjoy.<br /><br />This album proves that Kasabian is a extremely flexible and talented group.  I agree that it deserves album of the year.  It's definately their best album yet, and it brings about a new genre to their genre, if that makes sense.  Do me a favor, and buy this album if you liked their previous work.  Forget previewing and sampling because you will be disappointed.  Listen to the album a few times.  \\"Thick as Thieves\\" will most likely catch on first.  Then the rest of the album comes at you at full speed.  It's an album you will never let go.  It never gets old.  It's Kasabian's Masterpiece.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I recently purchased the Baby Jogger City Mini and was not liking the price of the parent console baby jogger sold. I came across this and it works perfectly. It provides me with a place to store my keys, phone, pacifiers, wallet, and drink, which is exactly what I needed. It has a nice little zippered pocket you could place your ID in or some cash. So far I have only used the drink compartment with a can of soda, but it worked perfectly fine. The stroller also folds up perfectly with the buggy buddy attached and I like that I can easily move of it to a different stroller if I need to.
B000002L80|2.0|I've heard some bad rap about this album from those who hold true to Talking Heads classics, and what can I say, they were absolutely right.  And She Was is easily the best on here, and Road To Nowhere is also very good, but the remainder is pure uninspiring rubbish that won't be memorable.  Go with '77, More Songs About Buildings and Food, Remain In Light, and even Speaking In Tongues was better than this, and that to me is probably the last album you need to get.  I've heard samples of Naked, and I won't even bother listening to the whole album, since that's even worse.  This seems to be more representative of David Byrne's solo work, which tells me he wasn't listening to the advice of his bandmates, which might have been what expedited their breakup shortly afterwards.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|The Beatles \\"Revolver\\" album was released in 1966 on August 5th, just one year before the influential \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" recording. It was with \\"Revolver\\" that the Beatles really began to experiment and explore some of the ideas that would be developed further in \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and subsequent albums, like the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", the \\"White Album\\", and \\"Abbey Road\\".<br /><br />In \\"Revolver\\" many of the songs are marked by the electric rock guitar sound as opposed to the folk rock songs found on their previous album \\"Rubber Soul\\". In \\"Revolver\\" they began to exploit the \\"bouncing down\\" technique used on two previous songs on earlier albums in order to record multiple tracks. They also explored other innovative techniques to record the sound of a backwards guitar, and various manipulations of vocals, and instruments, such as in artificial/automatic double tracking where vocals or instruments are duplicated and recorded slightly out of sync in order to create the illusion of multiple vocals or instruments. The song \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" used loops sent from various tape machines that were linked to various channels on the mixing desk and faded in and out to create a distinct sound. This song is considered one of the earliest precursors to electronica. The influence of this song on electronic bands can be heard in the likes of The Chemical Brothers' \\"Let Forever Be\\" (1999). Even though this album was released before their last tour in August of 1966 songs from this album were not performed live. The technical complexity of many of the songs, like Eleanor Rigby, prevented them attempting to play them live. From 1967 forward they would stop touring altogether and dedicate themselves solely to studio albums.<br /><br />This remastered CD, which was created from the original stereo analogue master tapes, has amazing clarity, and richness of sound, and comes with a booklet of photos and notes, plus a mini documentary that can be seen on a computer. Three songs appear here that weren't included on the original American release, but were found on the U.K. release: \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", \\"Doctor Robert\\", and \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\". Other songs found on this CD include \\"Taxman\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Good Day Sunshine\\", \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"She Said She Said\\", \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", and others.computer.

B000KITQK2|5.0|We use this device to preamp an orchestral harp, fitted with a specially made dual transducer pickup attached to its soundboard, into our PA. It works great! We run the balanced out, via a microphone cable, into a PA channel. This yields much better results than running an instrument cable from the 1/4 inch output. The onboard EQ (with adjustable midrange frequency) allows shaping the sound to the room size much better than attempting to do it at the PA. We used to use a small stand-alone tube preamp but had frequent 60 cycle hum problems. The ground lift switch on the ADI21 completely eliminated this problem and it cost less than 1/3 of the tube preamp price. The housing is plastic, but it is NOT feather light and feels very sturdy. The footswitch button does not feel as sturdy as the housing but this isn't a stomp box that you kick in and out. It's on 100% of the time. It does have noticeable hiss if you run the output level at 80% and higher so it's not \\"perfect\\" for recording, but for live performance it does everything we need. Behringer does it again!
0156027321|1.0|I think the idea for the story has so much promise, but every time I start reading this book I fall asleep. It's extremely slow to get started and after three times of conking out with this book and I'm only about 10 pages into it, I just said forget it. Obviously, there's a missing ingredient. I don't know what it is but when I really like a book, I stay awake to read it instead of falling into a coma like this one does to me. Maybe it's too conceptual. I don't know. Not enough action? Meandering prose? I can tell already it's trying to have some deeper symbolic meaning and maybe that is what's getting in the way of the author just telling the tale? Your mileage may vary and obviously a lot of people really liked it. Just not the one for me.
B0025KVLV0|4.0|Since I've decided to go with the Mono box and since I have to wait another week (GROAN!) for said Mono box to be delivered, I decided to try and placate myself by at least buying the two albums that are not in the Mono box, 'Let it Be' being one of them, especially since they are on sale. I think it's a bit arch for me to be listening to this particular album first of all of the new remasters because this by far is my least favorite Beatles record.     It is very encouraging to report that the album sounds fantastic, with that feel of being right in the studio very prevalent. This sense of presence adds immeasurably to the 'enjoyability' of these loose jammy songs. 'Across the Universe', even with Spectors heavy hand, gains an almost incantatory power, and even the corny, overrought 'Long and Winding Road' sounds positively lush with it's strings and angelic choruses.    The main thing I was struck with when I saw the 'Let it Be' documentary was that, for all their whining and bickering, when the Beatles finally picked up their instruments and started playing, they seemed to actually be having a good time. This new remaster definitely brings that spirit of fun and intimacy across and greatly increases my enjoyment of the record. If 'Let it Be' can sound this amazing, then I would say these remasters are off to a very good start indeed.
B002L1BJHY|5.0|As a diehard Jet fan, I was a little skeptical that much could follow their first two albums and be just as good. The first time I listened to Shaka Rock, I was immediately struck by KIA and She's A Genius (obviously the two hit singles). However, it took me until the second listen-through that I really began to appreciate the other songs. La Dee Da and Seventeen are two great songs, and Beat on Repeat, Black Hearts and Start the Show are three hard rockers. The others I'll admit I thought were slower and too quiet, until I realized that they got hard and fast and Jet-like a few seconds in. Basically, I've been listening to the album on shuffle and repeat for a week and a half since I picked it up, and I'm still not tired of it. And this is coming from a diehard fan with awfully high standards.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|The video quality of the discs were a joke. I have a 65\\" widescreen HDTV with a PS3 hooked up by HDMI. All the DVD's I watch with this setup are amaziningly clear and almost make you wonder why you should invest in a blu-ray collection. 95% of most DVD's are also in a 16:9 widescreen. These are NOT in widescreen format. These are in the standard 4:3 format. Worse than that - the picture quality looks like it was recorded from a VCR tape onto a DVD. I could see small artifacts that are inherent in VHS tapes of the past, albeit it wasn't as bad as a VHS. For example - the beautiful blue glow from the warp nacelles have a slight haze to them, if that makes sense. And yes - I checked several random disks - they're all the same.    In conclusion, I have Dish Network service with a HD DVR receiver. I record every Star Trek TNG episode off of WGN and SciFi (when they air it) and the recorded episode, although still in 4:3, have a MUCH BETTER picture quality. This receiver is also connected HDMI.    FYI - I'm not some nutty videophile who is beserk over every hue of each color or contrast ratio crap - I don't even know what that stuff means. All I know is this isn't standard DVD quality and isn't in 16:9 which can cater to both widesreen and fullscreen enthusiasts since widescreen can easily be cropped to a 4:3 screen with no letterboxing.      I also concur - the packaging is horribly cheap and I thought I was ripped off by buying it used until I read the other reviews. No inserts, few bonus features, and many of the clips that hold the DVD in place were broken. And my set was BRAND NEW - NOT USED! I bought this to finally have a complete collection of TNG even though I have never believed in collecting DVD series of shows.
B000TGJ7ZY|1.0|A good movie ,but if you are buying this version because you want a good picture look some where else,,the normal dvd is better than this blu-ray ,so don't waste your money.

0439023491|3.0|Catching Fire was one of my most anticipated books of 2009. I loved it's predecessor, The Hunger Games and was so hopeful for this intstallment. I wasn't disappointed per se, but it did fail to meet my expectations. Here's a few reasons why...<br /><br />I don't know what it is with authors and their recent need to load up their books with a hundred or so pages of filler, but I really wish they would cut it out. There is lieterally about a hundred and some odd pages of this book that should have died on the editing room floor. The 9 months that Katniss spends in District 12 only serves to let us know that uprisings are occuring and she has been targeted by The Captial, all of which could have been summed up in a chapter or two.<br /><br />Second, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that about 90% of those of us who read and loved Hunger Games were team Peeta all the way. Though we knew Gale would be an issue, we were hoping Katniss would \\"wake up\\" and realize what a worthy, fine specimen she has in Peeta, well, it doesn't happen that way, and to say I'm bummed is an understatement. I'm kinda pissed.<br /><br />Katniss doesn't grow in this book at all. She is still a brash reacter, instead of a logicl thinker. I didn't mind it so much in the first book, because who wouldn't be, but the Hunger Games taught her nothing it seems, in either the way she responds to situations or in reference to how she really feels about the people in her life.<br /><br />Next, I get that Peeta was never much of a badass, but was it really necessary to injure him 10 seconds into the games? That irked me like nothing else. In hindsight, Peeta is one of the strongest characters, menatlly, if nothing else, and yet Collins reduced him to an invalid so that Katniss could rise up to the challenge. Please. It only made me roll my eyes and steam over the fact that I was going to have to read Hunger Games part duex, which wouldn't have been bad except for the fact that I was expecting something more.<br /><br />Which leads me to my last complaint, the games. Though I could see everything in this book coming, I thought it was rather brilliant to send them back to the games. What wasn't brilliant however, was the games themselves. They started out well enough, but after the crazy fog and freaky monkeys, Collins sort of lost me. Who cares if there is death traps all over the place if you know how to predict it and can avoid it? Not scary.<br /><br />Basically, this booked lacked the magic of the first, and failed to wow with new material as nothing new really happens. Yeah we learn a little more, and the last few pages shake things up a bit, but I shouldn't have to wait until I've read to the end to finally learn something interesting. There were moments where I would catch a glimpse of what made me love Hunger Games, and for that I give this book three stars. But I can't in good conscious give it more for it lacked character development and basically just served as a pit stop between books one and three. Hopefully the third will be better.hing more.<br /><br />Which leads me to my last complaint, the games.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|My only regret about this sumptuous, thought-provoking film is that I didn't get to see it in a theater, on the largest possible screen. To call it a visual feast is faint praise -- the sheer richness of the colors, the otherworldliness of the images, the vividly dreamlike quality of the unfolding story (within a story), are all so luscious & intense that the viewer is easily & eagerly immersed in it.<br /><br />But gorgeous visuals alone aren't enough to save a film if it has no compelling characters. Fortunately, this one is blessed with two outstanding performances: Lee Pace, superb as the injured stuntman Roy, and the remarkably real Catinca Untaru, as the little girl Alexandria, to whom he tells his story. The complex bond that grows between them is both convincing & deeply moving, filled with a sometimes troubled tenderness seldom seen in film.<br /><br />At first some things are kept vague ... is Roy merely being kind to a lonely little girl, or does he have some ulterior motive? As the film continues, we see how both of them populate the story with figures from their own life experiences, from Roy's life & work as a stuntman, to Alexandria's envisioning hospital staff, patients & visitors in the roles of those characters.<br /><br />Gradually we realize that Roy is giving us a symbolic representation of his own precarious mental state, suffused with grief & despair, even as Alexandria reinterprets all that she hears into a vision of her own. For example, Roy mentions a Native American Indian & his wigwam; Alexandria sees this as an Indian prince & his resplendent palace. And as the story continues, we also realize that Roy is seeking death, and using this adoring, fascinated little girl as his means to accomplish that end.<br /><br />I'll say no more about the plot & how it works itself out ... suffice it to say that the story moves into some very dark territory, before emerging into a well-earned, satisfying conclusion. There's no denial of darkness, but at the same time, there's no nihilistic surrender to it, either. We're invited to share in the wonders & terrors of Roy's story, which becomes Alexandria's as well; and we're left to contemplate the ways in which we make stories of our lives, using them to interpret & understand all that happens to us, as well as using them as a means of therapy, healing, and self-awareness - not that it's ever presented in such a clinical, detached fashion!<br /><br />It's true, as others have said, that this film isn't for everyone. You'll most likely love it or loathe it, without much room in-between. But for those who give themselves over to it, a dazzling & transfigurative experience awaits. The everyday world is so often superficial, ugly, crass -- here's a glowing reminder of the beauty & depth of the human imagination. I can't recommend it highly enough -- a triumph!istic surrender to it, either.

B001LF347E|4.0|I am in the U.S. so I watched this whole season online...At first, I must admit, what lured me are the three young, good looking characters (Morgana, Arthur, Merlin).  The story was O.K.  It was more like a Smallville for Arthurian legend, and I hate those type of shows.  Then as I watched it, it began to stick with me.  And the characters and the character relationships began to morph into something more real.     Some things that bothered me though is the fact that all these powerful magical people were killed by mere mortals when they could do wondrous things with magic.  Like in one of the episodes a sorceress was in a crowd while her son was executed.  She came out and cursed Uther and then disappeared in a tornado.  If she could do that, why let puny mortals behead her son to begin with?!  That was always a little frustrating.  Also, what is frustrating, is Arthur.  Well the actor who plays Arthur.  He is hunky but seems REALLY prissy and proud.  He portrays what Arthur is supposed to be like in this series very well (a spoiled brat), but perhaps he does it a little TOO well...Same with Merlin.  But in the opposite fashion.  Merlin is supposed to be this powerful ancient wizard, yet in this series he is shy, quiet and runs around like a maid.  I don't know if I like these twists.    The special effects are fine.  They definitely aren't big budget Hollywood effects, but they are like normal television special effects.      I guess my major complaint is that there needs to be a bit more depth to the character and story.  It needs to begin taking form.  Uther needs to die, like really soon. Merlin and Arthur need to begin getting closer.  Morgana needs to begin getting more powerful and cruel.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I tried to get a handle on what to expect with the remastered BEATLES songs, by comparing the old remastered CDs from the 80s, with  BEATLES ONE (the red CD with the yellow \\"1\\", that had 24 bit remastered versions of their number one hits, that came out in 2000.) You can get a ballpark idea about the new remasters, using this method. But of course, NOTHING from the white album is one BEATLES ONE.  I expected at least some increased clarity, and increased volumn from the added compression.  Yes, its all that and more.  Right off the bat, you start hearing sounds you have NEVER heard (or noticed?) before. This isnt from equalization popping up the top end of the sound. There's improved sonic clarity across the HERTZ spectrum. Its as tho you were sonically nearsighted, and someone just put glasses on you for the first time. EVERYTHING just STANDS OUT with such clarity and force.  YOU get this effect on ALL the songs. If you listen to JULIA, the acoustic guitars just BLOW YOUR MIND! You can hear John's fingers scrape across the strings. His vocals are rich, full, and the bottom end is....well, altho there is NO bass guitar on JULIA, the bottom end is so full and rich, you would think there WAS bass. Naturally, the BIG TEST for the white album, is listening to REVOLUTION #9.  For some reason, deciphering REVOLUTION #9 thru headphones, penetrating the incomprehensible density of tape loops, has been a favorite pass time for some mega-fans for decades. (I'm one.) And you know what? For the first time EVER, I was able to hear more of Ringo's and John's bizarre mumbling jokes, and nonsense verbage. Again, the CLARITY! the DEPTH OF SONIC PERCEPTION! Honestly, its about as much as anyone can hope for.  Of course, the WHITE ALBUM was the first Beatle's album recorded in 8 track, so there is less bouncing to free up tracks on this album. For that reason alone, there has always been less tape hiss, and greater clarity, with this album. But since this isnt a digital remix, like the YELLOW SUB soundtrack, the same clarity and vibrancy can be expected on each remastered title.  Its amazing, that the engineers at ABBEY ROAD were able to find such vivid soundscapes on those (digitally transfered) master tapes. BRAVO!<br /><br />NeedI say how great the WHITE ALBUM is? Let's just stick to the remastered CD's \\"GOODIES\\". First, you have a protective cardboard slip case around the double gatefold CD, EMBOSSED with \\"THE BEATLES\\", just like the first LPS did.  The White album folds open, giving you four panels, each with one of the color \\"glossy photos\\" on it. (originally on seperate sheets, like the poster, but no more.) The first panel contains the 28 page booklet. It gives you all the lyrics, along with a small essay about the album. The information it contains is concise, exact, and puts the album within the context of the Fab Four's total discography.  I loved the extra photos. The July '68 color \\"Hollyhock\\" photos are included, and rare B&W promo shots from that period, but the surprises will give Beatle fans something new to munch on. After the first panel containing the booklet, the next two panels have CD1 and CD2 of the album. (the documentary is on CD2). The fourth panel holds a mini reproduction of the poster, with the lyrics on the back. My only complaint, is that the glossy cardboard CD foldout has the CDs stuck in those cardboard slots TIGHT.  They tend to grab onto the CDs....be careful taking them out, or the cardboard will give you minor surface scratches. (The CDs aren't in something like LP sleeves, which is the norm when this type of CD mini-LP format is used. Next, I played the QUICK TIME mini documentary. (They're about 3-4 minutes long.) I was worried cos my computer is an old MAC, but it supports MAC OS 10.3 on G4 and G5, as well as PC Pentium 3 processor using windows 2000+. Obviously, nearly anyone with a working computer will be able to watch the QUICKTIME documentaries.  They don't have complete music videos, but rather show bits of studio performance. My favorite bit was Paul recording BLACKBIRD. It starts with a close up of TAP SHOES producing that beat, then the camera pulls back to reveal Paul recording on his acoustic. MAD COOL! Also, there's a TON of previously unseen footage from John's home movies of Maharishi's summer camp at Rishikesh India. Plus, photos of the sessions, topped off with studio chatter by the fab four. If you remember the White album section from the ANTHOLOGY, its an extension of that, but no repeats for the most part.  Now that the WHITE ALBUM is over 40 years old, putting the songs in a sociological/historical context, will definately be a service to those new to this album, or discovering the BEATLES for the first time.<br /><br />In conclusion, from the first JET ENGINE flying between your speakers, to Ringo whispering \\"Good night everybody, everybody everywhere, Good night\\", the remastered WHITE ALBUM does NOT DISAPPOINT.  I don't think they could have gotten a better sound if they had gone back to remix the album.  Some people are disappointed that the Beatles didnt put this out on SACD (a format already abandoned), or AUDIO DVD (Perhaps when this format is further standardized, APPLE RECORDS might bring out an AUDIO DVD boxset...who knows?)  So many Beatles fans have complained about the original transfer, and then, complained as 24 BIT remastering arrived, but APPLE RECORDS didnt remaster. Well, now it's done, and obviously they worked their butts off to make everybody happy. I\\"m happy. And, you can bet I'm going to buy at least the ABBEY ROAD, SGT PEPPER, and REVOLVER remasters. If you're on the fence about replacing your whole BEATLES CD collection, my advice is to just buy ONE. Only YOUR ears will tell you where to go from there.of studio performance.

159448385X|4.0|Khaled Hosseini is certainly a splendid novelist. In this gripping tale, he masterfully weaves history, culture, struggle-for-life and engulfing emotion to create an unforgettable experience. The novel literally transports the reader through the last 50 years of Afghan history, a world many never thought existed. Reading this book, one can't help a surging feeling of compassion and empathy for the agony and downright misery the people of Afghanistan had to endure for decades.     The story is about two Afghan women. The scene starts in the world of our first heroine; Mariam and follows her from birth till marriage to a much older Rasheed. The storyline then moves to the world of the second and slightly more fortunate heroine, Laila and follows her from childhood till marriage to the same but now much older Rasheed. Now that both heroines are under one roof, the story follows their deeply moving struggle under the oppression and cruelty of Rasheed. I leave the rest to you to find out!     A word of warning is in order: the oppressive decrees of the Taliban extremists should not be confused with the noble teachings of Islam. Surprisingly, they are often different even contradicting. The dissimilarity is most pronounced when it comes to knowledge, art and the status of women. This is not the place to bring up the discussion but I will take the liberty of giving three examples to clarify the point. The Taliban destroyed the ancient statues whereas Muslims ruled over Egypt, Syria and Iraq for over a thousand years and none of their ancient heritage was scathed. The Taliban hindered education and burned books where as the Early Muslim cities were the pinnacle of knowledge of the middle ages. Finally, women had no place under the Taliban regime but they played an essential role throughout the history of Islam, quoting Hosseini (who is quoting queen Soraya) \\"Women should also take their place [in Afghanistan] as women did in the early days of Islam\\".
0439023483|5.0|Like a jerk I read these books backwards - first 'Catching Fire,' then 'Hunger Games' - but I can honestly say it worked out all right. Even though I already knew these characters by the time I approached this book, I was still able to come away feeling freshly vitalized by them, and that's saying something. It's a pitch-perfect story told with energy and focus that maintains a terrific arc.<br /><br />Potent - compelling - and original. My only cavil is there are some pretty dumb editing mistakes in here, including the use of the word 'vice' when the word 'vise' was clearly meant to be used. Come on!?
0385341008|4.0|Don't be put off by the cover, as I was. I thought it could a twee and uninteresting read. In fact, I couldn't put it down, learnt a lot, enjoyed the romance, and got involved with the characters.<br /><br />The book is set immediately after the Second World War, and is made up entirely of letters between the characters.<br /><br />A somewhat famous writer, Juliet Ashton, is contacted by a man from the Isle of Guernsey. He has ended up with a book of hers which he got from a second hand shop. Juliet's details are in the book, so he starts to write to her. Soon a lot of island folk are writing to Juliet, and she ends up visiting them and falling in love with the place.<br /><br />At the same time, from letters written by Juliet, her publisher and her friends, we learn about war and post war events and experiences in England generally and in London in particular.<br /><br />The writer, Mary Ann Schaffer was a retired librarian and in her 70s when she wrote the book. As she passed away before it was published, her niece Annie Barrows, contributed to the final version.<br /><br />I found the characters we well drawn - they did not merge at all - which takes some writing skill. There are many moments of humour, and of course many more of sadness. I would recommend the book to anyone looking for an easy to read book with depth and interesting subject matter.
B001SMC91M|4.0|Excellent debut album. Great music, horns/guitar, funny lyrics, and a powerful voice with a twinge of James Brown. There is alot of rather generic blues coming out lately, but this is definitely something different.
0439023491|5.0|Before I recieved my copy, I spent a lot of time reading other reviews on Amazon. A lot of them said it was exactly the same as the first book, but I beg to differ. This book is nothing like the first book. We spend more time traveling around Panem and then seeing life inside District 12. There is a Hunger Games in this book, but it doesn't take up as many pages as the previous one.<br /><br />I made the mistake of reading reviews that had spoilers in them, which makes me absolutely furious. Clearly half the people online have never paid attention in their English classes when learning how to write a review without telling major plot points. The book still made an impact on me, despite knowing some of what was coming. There are enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes.<br /><br />When I was forced to put the book down, all I could do is sit and think about the book. I was desperate to get back to it, but knew that it was silly for me to stop living my life to do so. Finally, I finished the book and the cliff hanger is enough to make me, for lack of better words, hungry for the next book.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is, in my opinion, the JK Rowling of American young adult fiction. You tend to love or love to hate every single character she creates. The worlds are crystal clear and magical, but in a way that seems very real. The memory I have of my first journey to Hogwarts with Harry Potter is one of the most precious I have. Second most precious is the first time Katniss Everdeen let me into her world.
B00001PE4D|5.0|\\"Cruel Intentions\\" is a delicious cat and mouse game between two teenagers living the high life on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The movie depicts how two step-siblings play mental games with one another with the intention of destroying the other. I have to admit this is a fun movie because it's always neat to watch those that are rich who have nothing to do but to destroy people's lives. The movie is well-known for the excellent acting by its leads. Sarah Michelle Gellar (from TV's \\"All My Children\\" and the \\"Buffy\\" series) and Ryan Phillippe star as the dastardly duo. The bet the two make is that if Sebastian (Phillippe) beds the headmistress' daughter of the school that Kathryn (Geller) attends, Sebastian can then bed Kathryn. If not Kathryn gets Sebastian's most prized toy. The headmistress' daughter is played by future Oscar winner and wife of Phillippe, Reese Witherspoon. The DVD comes with a collectable booklet and a ton of bonuses including 6 deleted scenes, audio commenatary, music videos, and trailer, plus much more. Subtitles are in english and language is 5.1 Dolby Digital. There are also two fantastic sequels to this film called \\"Cruel Intentions 2\\" and \\"Cruel Intentions 3\\" that are just as good as the original. NBC News says the film is \\"a wild, daring new spin on the classic tale of love and betrayal\\".
B001675YQ6|5.0|I'm not into cheesy romantic comedies. This is a real romantic comedy because it is romantic and will have you rolling out of laughter all the time. Classy, well done, well performed, it is as good as a good glass of refreshing wine.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|FIRST! Watch out for counterfeits. They are all over the place. The fakes have flexible boxes rather than firm, sturdy boxes. The artwork is fuzzy and not as sharp as originals. The CDs are lighter to hold (just a bit) than the originals This is especially true on many Japanese issues whch were actually made in China. In one incident, some of the CDs were not able to play music on a standard USA CD player. So, be careful!<br /><br />FAST FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE! What is great about the original non-fake box set?<br /><br />*Album (CD) covers are Exact replicas of those issued in the UK<br /><br />*The CDs are replicas of the record labels issued in the UK<br /><br />* The CD covers are larger than normal size making them very easy to handle and easier to read and enjoy!<br /><br />* The booklet is large and full of info and photos<br /><br />* Also, the \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" CDs include the additional 1965 original stereo mixes on them so that is very cool.<br /><br />* And please note that even though this is a USA Box set, ALL the CDs state that they were manufactured in Japan. That's actually a good thing.<br /><br />* The four Beatles songs from YELLOW SUBMARINE album which were not previously issued in Mono on CD ARE included on the Mono Past Masters CD in this box set. They are \\"It's All Too Much\\", \\"All Together Now\\", \\"Hey Bulldog\\" and \\"It's Only A Northern Song\\".<br /><br />* Wonderful, clear mono sound with special goodies like the Original Single Record version of \\"Help\\", the fast version of \\"She's Leaving Home\\" which is how Paul intended it to sound (By the way, when George Martin made his \\"Insightful Comments\\" on the \\"Making of the Pepper Album\\", he never talked about \\"She's Leaving Home\\" as he did not actually produce it in its entirety. Paul was upset with Martin's availability at the time and had someone else do the initial arrangments of the song. This fact is rarely discussed and it is still iritating to George Martin.<br /><br />**In overview, these CDs are great with excellent packaging that includes plenty of photos. But be careful Beatle People, it isn't worth more than $230.00 and people (Blue Meanies) are selling these sets for $400.00 on Ebay. Don't even fall for that. Stick with Amazon! It is by far your best buy!<br /><br />Looking Forward to the future CD release of the USA Issue of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" which has some outstanding instrumental music on it by George Martin and His Orchestra i.e. \\"Ringo's Theme (This Boy)\\" and \\"And I Love Her\\". Those two songs actually charted on the Billboard 100 in 1964. And I actually bought the 45 record when it came out. I just thought it was so good! And being very young at the time ( and very ignorant), I actually thought that The Beatles played some of the instruments on these songs. I remember thinking \\"Man, are these guys talented\\"  :)<br /><br />PS: Even though The White Album is interesting to listen to in Mono, the Stereo Issue is still sooo much better....cuz you can see that Paul really put some quality time in on his bass dubs.

B00005N9CV|4.0|I like her style, but after listening to about three songs I am ready to move onto a different cd. There is not much enthusiasm and listening gets dull.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The music sounds fantastic! The packaging is Awesome! Great photos and information. Easy to handle! Top of the Line box set!<br /><br />And...No longer are the MFSL albums the best source for quality Beatles Music. It had to happen sooner or later. The quality of sound is so superior to anything else available previously plus you don't have to deal with surface noise which is incurred during the playing of an album. And, you don't have to worry about needle scratches. Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs has been great over the past 20 years but it is now \\"Old Technology\\" by comparison to these CDs. So, if you want to listen to an MFSL album over these CDs, well, if you have the time and don't mind the hassle then great.<br /><br />I was worried initally that we'd end up with engineers being \\"Cute\\" during the remastering process. But common sense prevailed and we finally have a product that is of utmost quality both in sound and convenience!
0681807148|5.0|I was completely taken by surprise to find the original Frankenstein was nothing like the classic Karloff movie. It is a wonderful read. The monster is articulate, he doesn't grunt, he carries on conversations with his creator, he is menacing, misunderstood, disfigured, but he is self taught and speaks better than a lot of educated people. Amazing. Shelley's description of the surroundings, and the long travels the monster makes, in pursuit of his prey, puts the reader there. It is as if the reader is silently a part of the narration and eavesdropping on the innermost secrets of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster. Shelley eases her storytelling from incredible events to heart wrenching emotions, to intellectual processing of the information, to a battle of evil versus good intention gone hopelessly awry. In the end, it is up the reader to sort through the mad rants of Dr. Frankenstein, and to decide just where sympathy lies, with the doctor, or his monster.
B0002I831S|4.0|GOOD:  Nice picture, complete episodes  Good interviews  Thank GOD no dual discs full of errors like Universal uses    BAD:  Cheap cardboard sleeve and shell that breaks after dropped once  Have to fast forward thru credits on every episode  Bridge annimation at beginning is cute the first two time, after that it is REALLY ANNOYING!!!!!  Where's the pilot episode  How about including the blooper reel?
0307454541|1.0|Okay, the hype caught up with me, and I checked it out of the library.  I would have done better to have read the NY Times review<br />by Alex Berenson.  But just check out the comments of all the one star people and you will find recurring themes:<br />Plodding writing.  Vast quantities of indigestible exposition. \\"Racy\\" stuff thrown in to distract the reader from the fact the NOTHING is relevant.  There are no humans in this, and not enough characterization to fill an espresso cup.  Just paragraphs riven with cliches, connected in enough pages to simulate a plot or two.<br />I suppose enough Aquavit and it wouldn't matter really---
B00164KYV4|1.0|In \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" you will see five women in Baltimore area - Anna (Scarlett Johansson), Beth (Jennifer Aniston), Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and Mary (Drew Barrymore) - seeking for true love in the intertwined tales of love and romance. The male stars include Ben Affleck, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper and Justin Long. The cast is impressive. Unfortunately, the characters they are playing are not.    All the characters in the film are stereotyped and underdeveloped, commonplace, almost a banality itself. What surprised me is, talented players like Drew Barrymore are so boring in most of the scenes, never being allowed to shine. Actually, most of the characters, males or females alike, come across as flat and simplistic. OK, but maybe that is the point of the film. There are lots of talks about love and relationship, but few of them are really funny or insightful. Maybe that's only me.    What really surprised me is that despite (or because of) the best efforts from the actors, some of the characters are annoying beyond belief. Take self-deluded Gigi, for example. She constantly \\"misreads\\" the signs of men and she is seen waiting for phone call we know she will never receive. Gigi's life consists of only one action, which is presented in an exaggerated, unfunny way, and is often painful to see. But suddenly, all her problems are solved so easily. Why don't they give her a chance, just for once, to act like a real person?    I think an ensemble story is the hardest kind of story to handle in film. Just casting Hollywood's A-list actors is not enough. Every character and his/her episodes must be equally engaging and you need special cinematic narrative skills. \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" is directed by Ken Kwapis who did a good job in his \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\\" but still he is no Robert Altman. \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" needs much better director and screenplay writers.
B0025KVLS8|4.0|It is unfortunate that amazon is lumping 280+ reviews of the original CD release of this album in with the new remastered product. The old release was monophonic, and the 2009 remaster is stereo. (A remaster of the mono mix is available only in an expensive limited box set.)  Today I purchased the new stereo remaster, and this is my report. The main reason to purchase the remastered CD is for the sound quality, so I will focus on that question.     Overall, this is an improvement over the original 1987 mono CD. The bass and drums are much more distinct. The guitars are generally clean, maybe a little too clean. I could say the same about the vocals. The dynamics are compressed, but this is true of the 1987 mono edition. The compression is not extreme, but noticeable.     What about a comparison with the UK stereo vinyl release? I don't have immediate access to any UK stereo pressings, but my best friend has a box set. My recollection is that you hear more subtle detail and natural reverberation from the recording studio on the vinyl than the new CD remaster. To some extent, this may be a limitation of the CD medium. (Yet my digital recordings of vinyl from my own turntable do not seem to suffer as much from this defect as commercial recordings, which is hard to fathom.) I think the new CD sounds a little too clean, too processed, with some details smoothed over a bit too much. I had the same reaction to the Beatles Let It Be... Naked album, which remixed the Let It Be album without the orchestrations and embellishments added to the original. Some of the guitars did not have the same raucous bite they had on the original CD.     On the plus side, I'll reiterate that the bass and drums come through very naturally and clearly. It sounds good. It sounds clean and smooth. The best vinyl copies of A Hard Day's Night, played on an expensive turntable, will likely sound more relaxed, more dynamic, more detailed, and retreive more of the natural studio ambience of Abbey Roadstudio. I am unlikely to ever own the best vinyl so I'll make do with the remastered CD. And I have mixed feelings about that.
0783227434|5.0|This movie has to be one of my favorites! Although it is suppose to be a scarry movie, it is more of a comedy than a horror filim. There are those jump through your skin moments in it, but many more laugh till your sides hurt  moments. See if you can remember \\"to say those words correctly.\\" Great fun for teens and adults alike. I wouldn't recommend younger kids viewing this as they might find it scarry, but for anyone over the age of 12-13, it should be ok. I watched it with my 12 year old son who was howling with laughter through most of it.
B00005J6T1|5.0|before there was lady gaga, there was madonna....a woman who wasn't afraid to make a fashion statement and takes control of things. there are no ballads on this album....just wonderful dance tunes to workout. this album should have been #1 on the charts. i love the album cover. it's just soo madonna. she may not have a big voice, but it sounded better in the 80s. i love it when her voice was high-pitched and youthful.<br /><br />1. Lucky Star-love the song and the video. i don't know what else to say about this song other than the music is addicting to listen to. 5/5<br /><br />2. Borderline-classic madonna song. i always thought this was the first single and video from her album. everytime i listen to this song, i'm always thinking about that when i was 3 and i was at some pharmacy. i don't know why but this song just brings memories to my childhood. 5/5<br /><br />3. Burning Up-i'm ADDICTED to this song! i love the guitar sounds on this song. yea, she sounds desperate thru her lyrics but I can't deny that I felt very much the same way and \\"I have no shame\\"!!! the video was hot too. 5/5<br /><br />4. I Know It-the movie annie comes to mind. maybe it's how she sings this song. it's a cutesy song. 5/5<br /><br />5. Holiday-man, who doesn't know this song??? i hear this song all time on the radio. it's her trademark song. it's a great workout song. 5/5<br /><br />6. Think Of Me-the saxophone sounds cool. 5/5<br /><br />7. Physical Attraction-this my favorite song on the album. i love the way she sings it. the lyrics are catchy and fun and flirty. and i just love that 80s sound. \\"it's a physical attraction....a chemical reaction...a sweet satisfaction.\\" 5/5<br /><br />8. Everybody-this is the song that started it all. a great club song. her spoken words seduces you to the beat and the echos just adds to the flavor. 5/5
B000BYA5G4|4.0|Andrew Niccol directs Nic Cage as weapons of mass destruction salesman Yuri Orlov who sells ordinance like the medieval church sold indulgences; spare us your morality, please, for church and Yuri, it's only about money.<br /><br />Very dark humor pervades this shocking story of the personal and professional life of a Ukranian man who is in the business of supplying weapons to any country or rebel that can afford them.  For a while his beautiful wife (Bridget Moynahan) is clueless and his drug-addled little brother is a poor choice as a partner.  Amoral and frightening, this glimpse of the black-market gun trade is only bearable by the slight peek of Yuri as a human being and not the monster he has almost completely become.  This is one of Cage's better roles.  Cage seems to understands how the relentless drive for success can kill the last vestiges of a lost humanity.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Excellent movie - 5 stars!    Very graphic so not recommended for very young children... but I deff. will be showing this movie to my son when he gets a few years older... it is important for them to know the truth!!!

B0021L8US0|5.0|Four years ago, a short 6.5 minute documentary appeared - a criticism of apartheid titled, \\"Alive In Joburg.\\"  However, instead of using apartheid between blacks and whites to illustrate his criticism, the producer chose to demonstrate apartheid between humans and an alien species.  One thing led to another - and this short documentary found its way into the hands of studio execs at Sony/Columbia & TriStar.  They contacted the \\"Alive In Joburg\\" producer and convinced him to expand this into a full-length feature film (with studio funding).  And, four years later, out came \\"District 9.\\"<br /><br />I might not have understood the full force of this film had I not recently seen another documentary film - \\"The Betrayal\\" - showing the life of a Laotian family relocated to New York during the Vietnam war.  In \\"District 9,\\" and on its face, the lifestyle of the aliens forced to live in slum-like conditions seemed barbaric.  But, it was no different than the lifestyle of the Laotian family forced to live in the slums of New York.<br /><br />In short, the aliens were no different than humans - reacting similarly to the conditions they were forced to endure in order to survive.  Yet underneath the surface, the aliens were just as \\"human\\" as their human hosts.  And, it took an incident I won't discuss (a spoiler) to convince the lead protagonist (played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley) that this was the case.  What followed was a physical as well as emotional transformation - and an ending scene that left very few dry eyes in the theater where I saw the film.<br /><br />It may be science fiction.  But Sharlto Copley deserves an Oscar for his performance.  The film, itself, deserves similar recognition.  It transcends the genre and becomes a testament to the way humans treat each other - and would likely treat a vulnerable alien race.<br /><br />P.S.  It would not be a spoiler to say that an alien \\"mothership\\" is seen during the film.  However, in its original incarnation as a short documentary, there were three seen near the end.  Perhaps a \\"District 10\\" sequel will show us more than a single mothership (grin).  In any event, when the DVD is finally released, I suspect \\"Alive In Joburg\\" will be an included special feature.  And in watching it, you will see how the germ of a great idea became THE science fiction film of the year.e seen near the end.

1416914307|5.0|This is wonderfully written and sends you into a world beyond your imagination.  It is full of action, drama, love and heartbreak. When you open this book you are drawn in to the amazing world of the supernatural that heightens your senses.  It made me laugh, cry and left me on the edge of my seat.  Jace and Clary are interesting and superb, strong and loyal, independent and free-spirited.  It is a must read for anyone who is a fan of the fantasy genre and you will find you've never read anything like this.    All I can say is read it, love it, and make sure you buy the entire series.
045122499X|4.0|I read pillars of the earth long before it appeared on Oprah's book club. I got that book for a transatlantic flight but it didn't even make it on the plane - I finished the whole book within 3 days of non stop reading. I loved pillars of the earth, so when I heard that world without end was the continuation of the pillars of the earth I was very excited.     I enjoyed reading world without end, but not as much as pillars of the earth. Of course, there had to be the good people, and the bad, wicked guys. I thought the sex scenes in world without end were a bit too much. I am glad world without end had a happy ending, overall, I couldn't stop reading. It's a good book, well written, and well worth the read.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Coraline is an adorable story about a lonely girl who moves into a creepy home with history. Her parents are too busy with their jobs to give her much attention so left to her own devices she stumbles into an alternate world. Like a modern day ALice in Wonderland but creepier. It's fun. Special effects are great. Appropriate for school aged kids and up.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|I cannot stomach that a wonderful series has been adulterated. If you grew up with the original series, and treasure is original effects, do not buy the new remastered series. I am sorry I did not get a hold of all the seasons in the yellow, red, blue edition. Now they are unavailable and the \\"orwell\\" version of revised television history remains.  Perhaps this silliness will go the way of colorization of classic movies that came and went in the 1980's. Hopefully
0761536434|3.0|This bood was pretty good and probably has a place in my library.  It had a lot of interesting facts and wa a fairly complete history.  I am a real classic video game nut, though.  I would have liked to have seen more picures - there really did not seem to be much effort at illustration.
B0026NWBY2|4.0|Let It Roll has alot of familiar songs and some that I've never heard of.  Not sure if age has something to do with that (i'm in my 20s) but been a fan of the beatles since I was a little girl (my dad is a HUGE fan).  I enjoyed this album considering I have a few beatles album but none of George Harrison and thought it was a great collection of music.  My favorite --- What is Life?  awesome song!
B0000025RI|5.0|I had a copy of this album but lost custody of it in a divorce...:) I am so glad to have been able to find a copy that is in better shape.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Eastwood was outstanding in this movie. It is an intriguing story of 2 people so different that their friendship almost seems impossible.

I really liked this movie and highly recommend it.
0061122416|2.0|Maybe I was hoping for some great, philosophical \\"Aha\\" moment when I read \\"The Alchemist\\" but I didn't.  It nearly lulled me to sleep.  Maybe I had too high of expectations or not, either ways, \\"The Alchemist\\" did have the \\"WOW\\" factor for me.  I was initially going to give this only one star but I decided to bump it up because the concept was there but the writing wasn't.<br /><br />I am a little irritated that I lost 2 1/2 hours of my life that I can not get back.
0061231401|3.0|I enjoyed the book. But plausibility was an issue as a lot of the action seemed beyond realistic. And the ending was somewhat of a letdown. There also appeared to be a lot of filler used to set the length of the book. On the plus side, there was a lot of interesting historical information and theory.
0439023491|5.0|Wow, rarely does a sequel live up to the excitement and hype of the original. Suzanne Collins absolutely outdid herself. Catching Fire is fantastic. This is the kind of book that makes people love to read.<br />I couldn't read it fast enough but wanted to enjoy every moment.<br />This is a great one.
0439023491|4.0|Yes, yes, I've read the Hunger Games and Catching Fire and enjoyed them as an adult reader, but I also read them to know what my 6th grade daughter is reading.<br /><br />When she read the Hunger Games last year, I wondered if it might be too mature for her, but other than the unsettling theme, it was fine.<br /><br />Since she (and I) were hooked, I knew that there would be no keeping her from Catching Fire, regardless of the theme.<br /><br />We both enjoyed the second books in the Hunger Games series, and I offer this content review from one mom to another:<br /><br />1.  Catching Fire is more graphically violent, between the harshness of the peacekeepers and Katniss' bad dreams.<br />2.  The love triangle that was set up in the end of the first book figures prominently in this (and readers are joining \\"Team Gale\\" and \\"Team Peeta,\\" but I didn't feel that the level of romance was too mature for a middle-schooler to take.<br />3.  The complexities of the subject matter are only getting deeper and a bit more mature, but I knew I wasn't going to keep my daughter from reading on.  And after the abrupt ending of this book, I know she'll be reading book 3 as well.<br /><br />Collins has a full grip on the story and I can't wait to see where it goes.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|So far this watch has seemed accurate to me and I love the fact that it uploads automatically to my computer when I get near it with the watch.  HRM seems accurate even though others state it is not.  The only issues I have with it are that it doesn't stay charged very long.  At best you might get two days of running out of it before you have to recharge it.  I charged mine to 100% yesterday and it's at 93% today without me touching it.  My other complaint is that it digs into my wrist bones with the standard band that comes on it.  Other than that it's been a great tool for my runs!

The remastered CD sounds so much better than my old CD, it's really quite a revelation.  I'm currently listening to the remaster of \\"Beatles For Sale\\" and again the improvement is quite impressive.  It sure took them long enough to get around to remastering these albums, but it seems to me to have been worth the wait.  Well worth the investment.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are again creating compelling music with a good beat, sharp catchy lyrics and involving structures.  While nothing comes close to their 1994 Blood Sugar Sex Magic record (one of the best rock albums of all time IMHO), this is another winner from the band. Along with \\"by the way\\", their previous release, RHCP have shown they are back in top form.  a Must have
B002BSHWUU|5.0|As many of you, I am a huge Beatles fan. To me they are simply the best thing that ever happened to 20th century music. Their songs echo everywhere we go in the works of countless bands they influenced. And they are still beautiful after all these years.<br /><br />So it was with a lot of anticipation that I bought this stereo set. And as I opened it, I must say I was overwhelmed with all the care, love and effort put by EMI in making this set the Beatles celebration they deserve.<br /><br />ABOUT THE BOX ITSELF<br />The whole package comes in a beautifully crafted box with the Beatles logo. Opening it, I found the most beautiful set of CDs. Each one in a digipack reproducing the original artwork. Those digipack editions are very fragile because basically it is all paper. So I do recommend the purchase of this stereo box - so the CDs are kept safe.<br /><br />The digipacks come with photos and the artwork of each disc is simply gorgeous.<br /><br />ABOUT THE MUSIC<br />Wow... I sounds beautiful.<br />Not only the stereo sounds great, the whole sound looks sharper, clearer and brighter. It look like it was all recorded yesterday (ha!).<br /><br />Listening to ELEANOR RIGBY, MICHELLE, YESTERDAY, FOR NO ONE, AND I LOVE HER, I FEEL FINE and CAN'T BUY ME LOVE (for example) was a wonderful experience. The recording simply comes to life with a beautiful stereo sound like nothing I ever heard. Those old editions from 1987 really sound awful when compared. For No One is a great example: the french horn part is is much more dynamic and warm.<br /><br />The later recordings like ABBEY ROAD and GET BACK sound simply amazing. GET BACK (the song) is so clearer I felt I was listening to all instruments live in my room. It sounds like all instruments are really there together without the muffled sound of the old edition (funny I say \\"muffled\\" now since I was used to think those old editions were great). It is like listening to it all for the first time.<br /><br />On ABBEY ROAD, for example, the great string of non stop songs in the middle of the album is so rich I had to play certain segments again (because I was amazed). POLYTHENE PAM and SHE CAME THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW are amazing! - And they left me feeling that The Beatles' lesser known songs must all be rediscovered because they sound so good! George Harrison's SOMETHING almost made me cry.<br /><br />Finally we have The Beatles we can blast through our speakers and completely obliterate any Justin Timberlake or Jonas Brothers our neighbors are playing. (laughs) Just put GLASS ONION, I AM THE WALRUS or CARRY THAT WEIGHT and look at the neighbors' kids' eyes as they put Kanye West's CD back in its case. (laughs)<br /><br />I was afraid the stereo separation would feel plastic and artificial - I don't know why - but no, I did not have that feeling while listening to this set. It seems it was all recorded and handled with lots of care, love and cutting edge technology.<br /><br />This is a great day to celebrate the biggest band ever!<br />And congratulations to the EMI team who made this possible and put this all together.<br /><br />I'm very happy.album is so rich I had to play certain segments again (because I was amazed).

B002C6A6F4|5.0|For those who enjoy watching Hannah Montana with their teens, you will also love the movie.  It is a longer version of the episodes with good twists and funny scenes, as the films is set in Tenesse you have a beautiful background.  Very worthwhile! Just one point is that the second DVD is a version of the film to download automatically, if you are in the US you can use either Windows Media Player or iTunes, but outside the US only Windows Media Player works as itunes allows only US customers to use this feature, a bit of a shame but...
B0025KVLTM|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums by The Beatles. And now that it was remastered, it is a great pleasure to rediscover this old friend. SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is not just an album: it is a legendary fragment of the 60's... and The Beatles in peak form.<br /><br />I got this remastered version from the [[ASIN:B002BSHWUU THE BEATLES STEREO BOX SET]] and it was with lots of care and attention that I listened to it from start to end. And I must say EMI made an amazing job. The music sounds brighter, sharper, clearer and much more exciting. Now, it is also clear to me that it all will depend on your stereo. Most people who claim there is no difference perhaps are listening to it in small underpowered stereo equipment that really does not do justice to these remasters. Personally, I doubt anyone won't see any positive difference here... but that's me. With my stereo, these new remasters are shining every second of it.<br /><br />I'm playing it as I write this... and I cannot get tired of it.<br /><br />SGT. PEPPER is an album full of subtleties and many hidden treasures. BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE is one of those songs so rich and multi-layered that it is amazing to be able to listen to everything that is there. And now it is all there brighter and clearer. A DAY IN THE LIFE is absolutely astonishing because the voices of Paul and John were treated so differently that now we can appreciate even more the job done. LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMOND has a spatial depth I couldn't find on the previous CD. SHE'S LEAVING HOME, for me, is the star of this remaster: call me crazy, but I think the whole song got a dimension I never felt before. WHEN I'M SIXTY FOUR has Ringo's drums with an delicate extra oomp.<br /><br />I loved it. This is one of my favorite Beatles albums.<br />Thanks EMI for such a great job.
1847370292|5.0|A friend referred this book to me. I like self-improvement/self-help kind of books and this was a good read. If you are or want to be more pro-active or are optimistic about life in general, this is a good one to read.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I love comic book movies, but I didn't expect this to be as good as it turned out to be.  I didn't see it in the theater, but figureed I'd pick up the DVD.  I really enjoyed the movie.  It's not the typical cartoony comic movie.
B00006DEFA|1.0|I don't get the point of making a fictionalised version of a real person's story. Either tell the real story or present the work as pure fiction. Why overwrite Mozart's life story with your own?    Mozart was a genius. In this movie, he was portrayed as a buffoon. It was irritating, served no purpose and detracted from the story. The story itself is only very loosely based on history. If you like fiction, this would be fine for you, but if you want to learn about Mozart, I would recommend reading the book [[ASIN:096425770X Loving Mozart: A Past Life Memory of the Composer's Final Years]].    I give this movie a 1, at least for the nice music and opera.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I purchased Thriller on vinyl when it originally came out. But this version enhances what is an already great collection of songs. The remixes by the Black Eyed Peas are superb and the additional song (which was considered for the original Thriller album) is one of my favourites. I wish I knew this one, as I would have had this played on my wedding day.  It goes without saying, but Michael Jackson was a true artist and visionary. He was a huge part of my childhood and will be greatly missed, but his music lives on. My 4 year old daughter and 2 year old son, can be found bobbing their heads up and down when I play his music. Maybe he will be entertaining my children in their childhood, as he did mine.

1601251505|5.0|Without repeating a lot of what has already been stated, Pathfinder brings a host of welcome changes to the 3.5 rule set. In short; no dead levels, CMB/CMD (o thank you!), better scaling of feats, more feats, fewer skills and more varied and interesting character development options (without requiring 12 extra supplements).<br /><br />As a DM who has introduced a lot of players to D&D over the last 20 years or so, I have found that most players tend to stick with a single-classed character for a quite a while; the problem with 3.5 (R.I.P.) is that the core rulebooks provided fairly flat character classes which only served as launching points for the inevitable host of prestige classes Wizards released in subsequent splatbooks, campaign settings and one-off modules, none of which were well scaled power-wise to the rest of the game.<br /><br />I plan to thoroughly review the book for the next two months while my players blithely continue using the old rules in our regular games. Once I'm ready we'll be converting our entire 5-year-old, homebrewed 3.5 campaign over to Pathfinder rules; a weeks long project for me. Can't think of a better endorsement than that!

1577312082|5.0|The Power of Now CDs will take you outside of your normal thought patterns to view yourself and the world in more objective, less reactive ways. Eckhart Tolle melds science, religion and practical psychology into a logical paradigm for living that can profoundly and positively effect you. His calm, clear delivery embodies the spirit of his text and makes listening a joy.[[ASIN:B0002EJNVG Realizing the Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle: Choose format-CD ($69.95)]]
0452289963|1.0|Eckhart Tolle, has a gift that He does not own up to: what deity or strong force he was in contact with to write his revelations to the world. Michael Jordan book: ENCYCLOPEDIA OF GODS mentions since the beginning of time, the same mysteries have puzzled people on every continent; the same fears have beset them. They have attempted to explain the mysteries and allay the fears in the same--through the worship of gods. Deities have been identified with the human psyche for at least 60 thousand years. There are so many different deities in the world over at least 2,500.  Is Eckhart Tolle, a prophet? With so many different deities in the world you would wonder which one is really true.  Especially when the prophet relate his revelation with biblical scripture.   I do not feel anything powerful coming from this book. But I can see the painting. I do not feel any authoity coming from the language Eckhart Tolle speaks. But to trust the belief without the approval from an powerful God in assuring me that there is no qualificaton for me to inter this space of consciousness is but to die? Who is accepting me in this space of stillness? Should I get to know him or what deity whom you are speaking of. Because biblically I know that God speaks and reveal revelation and prophecy through his Son Jesus Christ, who speaks and reveals from his Father through the Holy Ghost spirit! God is a Spirit and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth! I don't know what deity that Eckhart Tolle, has worshipped. But his revelation comes with questions.

If you want to hear this stereo box in mono, simply stack your left speaker on top of your right speaker,  crank it up, stand back, hence mono.Whats all the fuss about? If you happen to have an old stereo reciever as I do with optional mono, you can have the best of both worlds.Buy an old stereo for cheap and you'll have it all. Good luck.  Dave Paul.

I thought nothing could get me over Harry Potter, and then you brought Percy and his gang into my life, and just as quickly snatched them away.  Please reconsider...your fans need more!!!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Wow! What an incredible difference a little remastering (actually a lot) can do for an already timeless classic. As someone who begged his parents for the original release some 40 years ago, I can honestly say this release has an incredibly richer, clearer, and fuller sound. The jets in U.S.S.R., the strings in Good Night, the dynamism of Helter Skelter, Paul's bass, and Ringo's drums jump right out at you. Thank you Paul, Ringo, Yoko, Olivia, and of course the engineers at Apple for making this happen.
B001ED7C58|4.0|Nice punky music but \\"Bella's Lullabye\\" is beautiful.  Of course, it's because Edward wrote it!!!
B001MS7IBS|5.0|If you're looking at this, I assume you already have interest in this unique show, so I will focus this review on the blu-ray release.  First things first, the cover has a cool reflective casing, with two different images.  Nice touch considering the content of the show itself.  It has the usual flip type case for multiple discs that we've seen in sets like Die Hard and Blade Runner.  I actually prefer the flip cases to smaller individual cases. Also has multiple images on the CD's, the cover and the inside, nice touch. That's about it for cosmetics.<br /><br />There is over 7 hours of bonus features including the bd-live content.  BD-live is a very cool feature to have, even if you aren't utilizing it now, you might be in the near future and it includes a single insert with instructions on how to get started.<br /><br />Special features exclusive on blu-ray include Fringe Pattern Analysis:  Take a Closer Look at 6 select scenes with the experts.  These are actually really nice, as they focus on select scenes, instead of just some broad behind the scenes generalization that you usually get as an \\"extra\\".  And also additional writer/production commentary available through bd-live.<br /><br />Some other goodies:<br /><br />Featurettes on the show's creation, casting, the real science behind it and a great look at the special effects.<br />There is the feature of Fringe:  Deciphering the Scene Sidebars on every episode, this is an interesting add-on.  I thought it was cool.<br />Disected Files and Unaired scenes are here.  Alot of extras involved in indiviual episodes, which I thought was great and any fan of the show will like, as I'm sure we all have our favorites and our \\"not-so-favorites.\\"<br /><br />I give this blu-ray set a enthusiastic thumbs up for all the extras.  It's appreciated.  I'm a fan of behind the scenes info and if you are as well, you'll enjoy this set.<br /><br />Now, for the look.  I have a blu-ray player (PS3) and an HDTV and all I can say, is beautiful.  If you want to see what its capable of...this is it.  The colors practically bleed off of the screen.<br /><br />This is the best blu-ray package I've received since the Blade Runner release.is it.  The colors practically bleed off of the screen.

B00092ZL80|4.0|I bought this last week.   As a whole I love the DVD.  Earlier someone made a comment that Chicago sounded somewhat \\"mushy\\",  and I agree.  I think it is because they were wearing head phone microphones and it was too small to deliver loud and clear sound.  I can see that they had to scream when they sang.  If they had used a hand held microphone like the EW&F,  then it would have been so much better for Chicago.  EW&F  sounded perfect.  Very clear without screaming the song.
B000V7J82S|5.0|The record itself is amazing and hold many of Bob Marley's fine work, but beware buying this directly form Amazon. They do not take particularly great care when they are packaging the item.
B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|Pricey or not, this is an absolute necessity if you have a long shoot and don't have the luxury of being able to change batteries all day (eg wedding).      I use all eneloop batteries in my flashes and have been quite happy with them.  With 8 in the CP-E4 and 4 in the flash, I can confidently shoot 14 hours and 2000-3000 shots.  Granted 100% of the shots are not flash and the flash power varies based on conditions, etc, etc.  But it works.    It does come with a nice Velcro closing case that has a belt loop.  However I don't use it on my belt and the case adds a little bit of bulk.  Without the case, I usually slip it in my front shirt pocket (yes it sticks out a little, but fortunately noone is taking pictures of me) or my pants pocket.  The cable is easily long enough to carry it in a pants pocket and shoot without issue.    It seems to be well built, I'm not worried about anything breaking and it makes a solid connection into my 580EX flash.    Quite simply it works and if you have the need for it, get it.
0800141660|1.0|This movie was an extremely cut down version of the full flick.  Missing over 45 minutes of movie.  I hardly call that \\"Special Edition\\".  That should be brought to someone's attention when they order.  If I didn't want to see the whole movie, I wouldn't have been shopping for it.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
B00005JKN9|3.0|\\"Gangs of New York\\" is one of those periodic films that grabs a lot of Oscar nominations and comes away with no statuettes.  \\"Peyton Place\\" was the reigning champ in this dubious category but Scorcese's film gave them a run for the money.  After watching it the other night, I came to understand why this happened; The movie opens strong and closes nearly as strong while the interminable bulk of the movie meanders in a repetitious drone.  If Scorcese had a point, he should have made it.  I took time out for supper without a second thought.  Leftovers were better than what needn't have been served in the first place.      When I say that the film opened strong I guess I'd better qualify my statement.  The build-up to a gang war with no quarter was a bit overdone but at least it gave the viewer a sense that this was going to be one of those action movies that can succeed without the extranvagance of a plot.  That's the problem; without the action we are left with a rather ridiculous cast of characters.  I understand that this is based on real Gotham history and I was focussed on the subtleties leading up the the New York Draft Riots.  However, that singularly important event was forced to play a duet with a lesser talent.  The resulting Armaggedon left me wondering if there was anything left in New York City that was worth salvaging.  I read complaints about the lack of a \\"Director's Cut\\" that would have added an hour or so to this lengthy Leviathan.  This was not a case of too much left out but, rather, too much shoved in.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|\\"Taxman\\" alone is worth the full $232! The first time I heard it, at 3 a.m. one summer night in 1966, in a cabin deep in the New Hampshire woods, was one of the transcendent moments of my life. But the stereo separation on the 1980's Revolver CD was so badly done that this phenomenal song had become unlistenable to me. And now, all of a sudden, I have it back, in all its blazing glory! The biting lyrics, the kick-ass drums, the looping bass, the airtight harmonies, McCartney's (!) scorching, brilliant lead guitar break--all pulled back together again into 2 minutes and 42 seconds of pure sonic ecstacy. And if that's not worth $232 to you, check out \\"Slow Down,\\" also unlistenable in the stereo version, but an absolute powerhouse in remastered mono. Or \\"I'm Down,\\" which by itself is better than any rock record that's come out in the past 30 years. Or \\"You Can't Do That,\\" or \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"... you get the picture. And I haven't even had a chance yet to listen to \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" which was intended for mono release in the first place. But it doesn't matter, because, like I said, to have \\"Taxman\\" back, remastered and even more powerful than the original mono version, by itself is worth the very hefty pricetag. Crank it up and you'll see what I mean!
0446581348|5.0|Perfect for : Personal Use, Great gift for a girl getting into makeup (promotes positive self image), Professionals in beauty/makeup field    In a nutshell: I was amazed at the amount of information and detail contained in this book! I was never really taught about makeup, so this has provided me with a lot of practical and technical information that I wasn't previously aware of. From basic beauty equipment and the basics of skin care to the business of makeup and professional artistry, this book has it all! The photographs are beautiful and help to show what the author is talking about, and the explanations are easy to understand. This is a beautiful book that would be great for someone wanting to learn more about makeup for themselves, or as a profession. It would also be a great book to have on-hand at a salon or spa.    Extended Review:  The information contained in the book covers just about everything I could ever think of pertaining to skin-care and makeup and then some. The colorful photographs serve to enhance the book by providing brilliant examples of what the author is talking about as well as how-to's with people actually showing how to apply what the author is explaining.    Content: The book progresses nicely through the following chapters: Makeup Artistry, Equipment, Skin, Face, Lips, Eyes, Ten-Step Guide to Perfect Makeup, Special Makeup Applications, Artistry, Essential Equipment for the Professional, Advanced Makeup Applications, Memorable Makeup Moments and Legends. It also contains a very helpful resource guide that provides Theatrical Makeup Stores, Makeup Artist Agencies, Creative Directories and Suggested Reading. As you can see, there is plenty of information designed both for the end-user (like me) as well as professionals!    Format: The chapters progress through the makeup application very nicely, with plenty of wonderful full-color photographs depicting both finished looks, and the steps to accomplish those finished looks (as well as products and colors).    Readability: Amazingly enough, with so much technical information throughout the book, it was written in a manner that was easy to read - even the harder artistry pages were easy to understand, if not easy to create for the novice!    Overall: A very complete book that is sure to teach everyone from the novice to the professional something about makeup in a way that is easy to understand and duplicate (hopefully! - I haven't tried ALL the examples).

0743437497|5.0|Rarely have five hundred small-fonted pages of a novel passed so fast.<br /><br />Before reading The Shining, I quite wrongly perceived Stephen King as as a pot-boiler par excellence - a turner-out of yearly novels for long enough that bookshop comfortably carry a whole shelves dedicated to his stuff, all spine-emblazoned with his name much larger than the book's title in ghoulish green or red; the time-honoured costume of the poolside horror. I once saw [[ASIN:067103975X Salem's Lot]]  as the only novel on sale at the airport bookshop in the Canaries and even then I didn't buy it.<br /><br />So I can't really explain how I came to pick up The Shining - I was looking for [[ASIN:0307473708 Darkly Dreaming Dexter]] and it had sold out. I had half-watched the [[ASIN:B000UJ48WC Jack Nicholson movie]] (fully watched now - reviewed elsewhere) but, were that any sort of guide, the story didn't warrant 500 pages of anything.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise.<br /><br />Though they bear superficial resemblances, King's novel is a quite different enterprise from Kubrick's film, and a far weightier thing than I was expecting: subtle, thoughtful, complexly plotted, richly characterised, figurative and crisply expressed. Kubrick's film is, well, a film: a piece of cinema where literary techniques developed for a written medium are, understandably, not at the forefront of the director's mind.<br /><br />Outwardly, the novel is a good old haunted house story but you don't need to scratch the surface terribly hard to see there's a lot more to it than that. Indeed, other than through the plot-functional device of \\"Shining\\" - King's premise requires the Torrances to be totally isolated, so there needs to be *some* way of calling for the cavalry - supernatural operating causes are mostly implied: there are *apparent* visions, sure, but (at least until the very end) these are experienced only by characters we know to be losing their minds. This is a psychiatric, and not psychic, horror. That to me, is a far more horrifying prospect. Hence the book's power.<br /><br />The motivations of the ultimate villain - assuming it is, as literally seems, the haunted house itself - are not explained or investigated. I think this verifies my suspicion that the house itself, like its boiler and interventionist hedgerows, is principally a metaphor, and the real source of horror is rooted in the strained relationship between Jack and Wendy, and Jack's own character flaws.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Both boxes (mono & stereo) are better sounding than anything of the Beatles ever released on CD. If the only way you've heard these is from the 80s versions, you're in for a real treat. You'll hear things you've never heard before. These won't be such a revelation for people who own the Mobile Fidelity vinyl versions. As far as I'm concerned those 1/2 speed mastered disks are still the best with the German & Japaneese versions comming in not far behind. But with the kind of price those records are commanding these days, this is without a doubt the best, most affordable (but still not cheap by any stretch) alternative. I don't know if there is a defect in mine but I was pretty disappointed that I couldn't burn a back-up disk of any of these to listen to in my car. The boxes are too expensive to risk traveling with.

B0013FNC38|4.0|I had never heard Jason Mraz until he was on the Today show recently and thought he was great! The huge audience loved the music as well.  Since I had never heard of him before, I went to the Amazon site and was able to find what I was looking for. Within a week I had the CD and have listened to it practically non-stop!
1439130833|5.0|Loved \\"The Secret\\" and read it slowly to absorb the contents!  My granddaughter, aged 20, had read it when it first came out and kept talking about it.  IT HAS CHANGED HER WAY OF THINKING AND HER LIFE!!!!  She is so positive and has accomplished so much, so well!!!  I have also gotten the tape and given it to my non-reading friends and family.<br /><br />I am a very positive person, but this book really makes me understand why I have done well and hopefully will help me to accomplish so much more!<br />Sincerely,<br />Gale
0312330537|5.0|This is the first time I've written a comment for a book but I felt compelled to after reading Shantaram.  I LOVED this book from beginning to end.  I thought when I started the 900+ pages that at least there would be a couple segments that would bore me or I would gloss over more quickly.  This was not the case with this book - it was gripping and entertaining the entire time.  He is a master story-teller.  I'm looking forward to my next read by this author.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|While the quality of the production was excellent I was disappointed in some of the portrayed negative character traits of our founding fathers - especially John Adams.  The series started out strong but deteriorated into an account of a man who pretty much abandoned his family for the sake of his country - and then even that was questioned. Did he do it for his country or to just to make himself look good in the eyes of others?  I have no desire to watch the series a second time.
0894803123|5.0|Excellent bnook.  Excellent buy.  Recipes plus a little background on Ben & Jerry that is entertaining. Highly recommended!

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Forget the naysayers pining for complete remixes, all the great things you've heard about these remasters are true.  What follows are simply my impressions of what I have heard so far.      First off, I'm a 45 year-old Beatle \\"freak\\" and I was going to buy the stereo box set without question.  Upon hearing a portion of this collection [see below], I've also ordered the mono collection.  Yeah, it's that good.  I'm no audiophile or purist, but I do care about sound quality and I do seek to gain the best equipment I can without going insane price-wise [I'd classify my gear as slightly upper middle class, no better].      Thus far, I've listened to five of these discs -- in whole or in part -- in three different situations:  a 5.1 home theater/stereo configuration, a 5.1 computer \\"surround sound\\" set up off the shelf from Best Buy, and on the 4 year-old, factory-issued speakers in my Ford vehicle.    For what they're worth, here are my impressions:    HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  This was the first disc I played, in my van on the way home from the one & only store in my city that still had a stereo box set available.  I chose this because I'm less familiar with the album and it's one I've been keen on exploring.  I was bowled over ... I kept wanting to replay tracks once they'd ended, but I was too anxious to hear what was next to do so.  The acoustic guitars just shimmered, and the vocal separation amazed me.  You can really hear the individual backing vocal contributions with great clarity [assuming you can distinguish George's voice from, say, John's], and yet the harmonies are intact and present.  It was a very \\"intimate\\" listening experience, that's how I can best describe it.    TAXMAN [from REVOLVER].  I also gave this song a whirl on the way home.  It sounded pristine and great, but not amazing -- not that different from my past experience with this track.      HELP!  Meh.  I listened to this via the computer, which perhaps was a mistake.  The vocals were WAY separated and \\"floaty\\" from the instrumental elements, and there seemed to be far too much echo.  I fiddled lots with my controls, but I couldn't seem to make this CD sound \\"right.\\"  Hopefully, this will sound or mesh better on the home system...    RUBBER SOUL.  Okay, now THIS was a shocker.  Listened on the home system, several times over, just tonight.  The \\"artificial\\" stereo of the original mix [vocals on one side, instrumentals on another] IS annoying, and this isn't much corrected on the remaster.  What IS corrected is the harsh, tinny sound my original CD spat out.  The entire record seems more mellow and listenable now.  On the old CD, songs like Nowhere Man and In My Life seemed almost grating, as the vocals were just SO tinny.  Here, they are life-like, well-rounded, and not at all harsh on the ear.  I feel like I can finally enjoy these songs & harmonies again!  Also notable, here and on most everything I've heard thus far, is the acoustic guitar sound.  Imagine Paul seated on a stool, plucking away ... now imagine yourself seated in front of him, a foot or two away ... the sound is *that* close and detailed, it's simply wonderful.    SGT PEPPER.  Sampled a few tracks in the van this afternoon.  I'm going to have to give this a more dedicated listen, as I wasn't bowled over.  Paul's vocal in the title track was much more \\"real\\" and life-like, but in general this sounded like the same track I've grown up with, as did Within You, Without You and When I'm Sixty-Four.  Can't say I was listening very closely, but based on this extremely-limited exposure, I wasn't bowled over.  One interesting thing, though:  once the initial \\"crowd\\" noise subsided and the band kicked in, the bass sound very nearly blew my speakers.  It was WAY powerful and I had to quickly find the dashboard control to lower the bass level & reduce the factory-issued speaker distortion.  That was kind of interesting ...     THE WHITE ALBUM.  THIS was a revelation.  Actually, that's an understatement.  Itwas so good I listened to the entire double-album thrice -- twice on my home system and once on the computer.  A song like \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" completely blew my mind, I felt like I'd NEVER really heard that song before.  The piano on songs like \\"Martha My Dear\\" is so clear, I feel as if I'm leaning over the opened lid of a Steinway, hearing the pedals strike each string.  I cannot even begin to describe \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" ... I stood in the middle of the living room just SWIRLING within and completely overwhelmed by this song.  If you haven't yet, you're just going to have to experience this for yourself, using your favorite Beatle album or song as a barometer.  The White Album also provided me with the best examples so far of what HEFT the Paul/Ringo rhythm section packed.  Ringo, especially -- the \\"heavy\\" songs on this disc [Yer Blues, Helter Skelter, etc.] just REALLY knock you for a loop with how solid they are.  It's like a hard punch right in the chest, and it's something I've never really experienced whilst listening to the Beatles before.      ... And that's it.  I've not listened to any more of this collection, and my impressions so far have been so fantastic I have no desire to rush the experience.  As someone who has hunted down and captured every single known bootleg & outtake associated with The Beatles, and as one who grew up listening to them on vinyl and more recently on CD, I can honestly say that I have NEVER heard this music in quite this way, before.  I've not \\"done\\" any of these tracks on headphones yet, though I can say I'm really looking forward to THAT experience, too.      All of the comments on the packaging are dead-on, this collection is lovingly delivered and I feel as if my money was well-spent in that regard.  The \\"mini-documentaries\\" are fun but a bit of a waste for those who already own the Anthology DVDs.  Each gives a nice & very general overview of the band at the time of the album's creation, and watching theseparate DVD disc included in the stereo box [which features all clips & can be watched as a whole] gives one a pretty good -- but very limited -- overview of the band's growth and progression over the years.  Aside from the odd rare photos and video clips featured in these, the mini-docs will primarily appeal to Beatle newbies, I think.    If you are a real Beatles fan, I highly recommend picking up the stereo box set.  If you're a more casual fan, definitely buy a disc or two and see what you think.  My bet is you'll be returning for more, one day:)
B000EGCITQ|5.0|This girl can sing!! She seems to keep getting better and better. I play this CD constantly. Her new CD Funhouse is great, too. You can definitely feel the emotion in her singing.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|I love this set. The sound is definitely improved over the stereo discs of the 1987 collection.  The engineers did a terrific job, providing a clear, punchy, brilliant result across the board with just a touch of audio limiting.    One issue is that they chose to use George Martin's 1986 remix of the Help! and Rubber Soul albums, rather than the original 1965 stereo mixes (which, oddly, are included in the new mono CD versions). I just cannot figure why EMI would do this. Why did they not put both stereo mixes on the new stereo discs?    Another thing for me is the stripe they put down the left side of the album covers, which is unnecessary and annoying, in my opinion.
0307269981|5.0|Just finished \\"Fire\\" and believe this was as good as \\"Tattoo.\\" The only disappointment is the huge cliff we are left looking over - what happened to Salander, Berger,& Kalle. Stig kept this story tight while filling in missing puzzle pieces YET leaving several pieces out. Recc to all my bookstore customers, a must read sequel.
B002BSHXJA|3.0|I hate to be the naysayer here, but after getting the mono box set and comparing it some to my original CD's, the originals still have a lot to like.  Now, I am not only a Beatles fan, but a musician who has portrayed Paul in a Beatles tribute band. I owned the British vinyl album box set, and I owned the box set of 80's CD's. So I know how the music should sound. Upon first listening to the new discs, I was prepared to be rewarded with richer, clearer sound and a slight increase in loudness. I couldn't resist putting on Pepper first to hear the different mix from the familiar stereo, so I did and it was interesting. After that, I sampled the White Album (which was awesome in mono) and then went further back into the catalog. What I noticed, however, was a somewhat murky, slightly flat sound across some of the mono tracks -- and so I put on the new stereo box to compare. I WAS wowed by the stereo set -- brilliant, punchy, detailed sound with a dash of limiting to raise the overall levels (thankfully, without killing the dynamics). Next, I went and got hold of the 1987 Hard Day's Night CD to do a comparison in my dual CD deck. Upon careful listening, I definitely noticed that (incredibly) the 1987 disc sounded better in many ways than the new CD. Curiously, as my meter confirmed, the sound levels on it were generally higher by a couple decibels than the new version! (Louder does not equal better, but it does take advantage of the sonic capabilities of the compact disc format.) I could also detect that the sound on the 87 HDN was brighter and had more liveliness to it than the 2009. Unbelievable? Yes. But please do the comparison for yourself with unbiased ears and you just might come to the same reality.    I love the packaging of the set, which is a joy to have, and the mono mixes are certainly authentic and cool. But my overall advice is: your money may be better spent on cheaply-gotten 1987 early, mono CD's with terrific sound if you can't drop a bunch of cash forthe new set. George Martin and EMI knew what the heck they were doing.
0452289963|5.0|I have been reading spiritual books for most of my adult life and I believe that Eckhart has nailed it in this book. He has reduced what human beings need to do to get free of the insanity of our modern world to a very simple and compelling and easy to understand framework. I have purchased about a dozen copies and give them to people whenever I sense interest. Reading this book while viewing the chapter by chapter webcast that Oprah did with Eckhart is a unique and powerful way to steep yourself in the teachings and to raise awareness about how to become more present. I highly recommend it.
1607060825|5.0|Overall this is a nice book. If you can't afford or find, the Mars Maidens, Jungle Queens, or the Sketches and Scribbles books, this has a nice sampling of the works from those. The book is from Image, and like the Liberty Meadows books, it's a nice quality hard cover with bright pages. And it's also the same size as previous LM books. Under the dust jacket, the book itself is dark green with a shiny silver skull surrounded by the name of book in the same color. Don't stare too long kids.     I like the way on most of the work, you get a comp sketch, with loose or tight pencils, that precedes the finished work. And the piece will encompass the full page on the left, then the full page on the right. So that you can compare and see what compositional changes were made before going to print. On some pages, there are the finished inks preceding the final.     For about the first half of the book, it's mostly marvel stuff he has done recently. Then the jungle section is basically that, apes and babes, with a few of his older pieces you can see in the Sketches and Scribbles books. Followed by some Brandy and friends. And then ends with the Mars section. Some Conan, Red Sonja, Dejah Thoris, and 4 armed apes.  It's a nice selection of images, new and from books mentioned previously.     If you're new to Cho, or have been following his work, it's worth saving your lunch money for. I don't think you'll be disappointed. With a strong foundation in anatomy, and super clean inks, he fits into that Frazetta, Suydam genre.
B001LMAK88|5.0|Silverado is one of the best western movies I seen in many years.  Westerns come and go but I believe Silverado will be around for many years as were John Wayne's western movies.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I purchased the stereo box set, then walked into a local store to find ONE of the elusive mono box sets.Now I have both!  I have spent my rent on Beatles this month, but it is  worth it. I've enjoyed their music  for over forty years, and the superb remastering job on both sets has revealed wonderful details I've never heard till now. Critics say the biggest improvement is noticed on Revolver, but I disagree. The Beatles (White Album), always sounded listless, hissy and muffled. to me...but not anymore! I now \\"hear through\\" the clarity of Glass Onion, \\"feel\\" the fury of Helter Skelter, and am \\"warmed\\" by the sound of Goodnight...it is a new aural experience.<br /><br />I've sampled both sets and it's first rate remastering that never compromises the original recordings. The Beatles never sounded better in stereo and mono. I hope the Beatles continue to be discovered by generations of music lovers. I'm lucky to have been born in the Beatles time. I'd also like to thank Dad for taking me to see them in Chicago when I was a mere lad of 7.  I'm staying in my yellow Submarine this weekend to give the entire catalog a good listen. Indeed,it is a banner day for Beatles fans around the globe!
B0002GTWQA|3.0|Lord Jim   Jim (Peter O'Toole) is out to redeem himself after an act of cowardice.  He sets out in the hope of gaining a new life and ends up fighting smugglers and pirates in a desperate bid to forget his past.  James Mason, Eli Wallach, and Curt Jurgens play baddies and Jack Hawkins is the officer who sympathizes with Jim.  Is it too late for redemption and love, or will Jim prove a coward once again?    Violent Content   The film includes many skirmishes and battles between natives and money hungry gun-runners.  Men are dispatched in many ways.  The natives throw spears.  Due to the fact that this is a sixties movie, the spears always pass under the persons arm or never actually pierce skin.  There is a lot of shooting.  A few people get strangled.  There are a few kick-boxing matches, and a man is slashed with a machete.     The most disturbing scene of violence is saved for Jim himself.  He is tortured by bandits (mostly off-screen, but we see the build-up and the aftermath) and we watch his face as he screams in pain.  The scene is rather tame by todays standards, but some kids will be frightened.    Sexual Content   Men are shown shirtless throughout the film.  Jim is shown swimming with naked children.  After torture fails, Eli Wallach's character pushes a beautiful woman in front of Jim, telling him that he may make love to her for the next hour.  He then forcibly rips open her shirt exposing her to Jim (we see her back and then her shoulders from the front, but no real nudity).  Jim refuses Wallach's offer, but later admits to the woman that he \\"desired her\\".      Language   Terms such as \\"damned\\" and \\"damnation\\" are used in context, and hell is briefly referenced.    Morales   Jim's morales are slightly amibiguous.  Many of the characters in the film seem to have a basic belief in a god of some kind.  Muslims are portrayed in a positive light.  Jim's search for redemption is the focal point of the story.  He refuses to sell out the natives despite being tortured.  Jim desires that \\"God give him a second chance.\\"     Lord Jim is based on a classic novel by Joseph Conrad.  It might have been better for the film if it had not been.  The film is too slow to be a good action movie, and has too much action to be a good thought-provoking film.  It follows the books plot loosely at best and for the most part, strays completely from it.  Peter O'Toole, James Mason and company all give good performances, there are some good scenes, and the action is well-handled, but over-all the film is lacking and will probably go down as a cheap imitation of Lawrence of Arabia.  The film is the equivalent of a modern PG-13, and will probably not offend most people, but is likely to bore little kids, teenagers, and many adults.  Plus, the dvd is VERY expensive.  Is the film worth it? Probably not.

0307474275|5.0|I read this book while waiting for a connecting flight back in 2006. To my amazement I couldn't put it down. There was so much controversy over the book about what it was about that I had to read it for myself. I don't think I've read a book in such a short time (1 1/2 days) and at that time I wasn't much of a reader. The suspense and fast paced scenes made me so excited that I couldn't wait to get to the next paragraph or the next page. It surely is a page turner.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book before watching the movie as the movie didn't measure up to the book. As a movie buff, I was very disappointed in the movie because it left a lot of gaps. It had me thinking if I would have fully understood some of the scenes. Knowing what to somewhat expect or look for in the movie, it didn't meet my expectations.
0061854549|2.0|I know this is a very popular book, but I found it kind of tedious.  Too many of the examples are drawn from hypothetical situations involving students who then make decisions where nothing is really at stake.  This seems a stretch to me in approximating real life behavior.  For example, Ariely posits that you'd go across town to save $5 on a pen but not $5 on a suit of much higher price.  Hello?  I wouldn't go across town for either.  My time is worth more than $5.  This book strikes me as representing everything that's wrong with modern economics:  Abstracting difficult decisions into odd hypotheticals and thus oversimplifying rather complex issues.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|The improvement in the picture quality is very obvious in this version of the Woodstock movie.   The remastering makes a world of difference. It's like going from analog to digital. The    picture is much more clearer and defined. For those who want to relive Woodstock again this    is a great way to do so.
0385341008|5.0|Juliet Ashton is spunky, delightful, humorous, and kind-hearted. She's also approximately 17 million other things, but those are the words that stand out when I think of her.<br /><br />In a series of correspondence with her best friend, Sophie, her publisher and long time friend (and Sophie's brother) Sidney, and a colorful cast of characters from one of the Channel Islands between England and France, the story of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society comes to fruition.<br /><br />Juliet's exchanges with the people of Guernsey Island begins when she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams. He has recently begun reading a book by Charles Lamb that once belonged to Juliet, and wants to know if Charles Lamb has written anything more. A correspondence begins between Juliet and Dawsey, where Juliet begins to learn more about the people of Guernsey and particularly, a young woman named Elizabeth McKenna who is responsible for the spark of energy and humor that generates the Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Used as a device to escape the oppression of the Occupation, the Society met at least once a month to discuss books. Because the news was forbidden from coming in and radio had been banned in Guernsey, the members of the Society only had their resources - namely, the books they had laying around.<br /><br />As the story develops in letters and telegrams, the members of Guernsey (namely Isola, Amelia, Eben, and Dawsey) are encouraged to get in touch with Juliet and tell her their stories about being under German rule during the second World War. Through their letters, the reader begins to understand more about what the Occupation did to them, and ultimately, about Elizabeth, who leaves behind a daughter named Kit. Juliet (and the reader!) becomes more and more engrossed in learning about how they made the best of the Occupation, and sets to work on writing a new book about the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.<br /><br />Inevitably, Juliet makes the move to Guernsey and the story, which started at a slow burn begins to simmer and boil as it picks up intensity and depth. Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows let the characters reveal the details of life on Guernsey without ever telling the reader what to think or believe. Similarly, because of the strength of their writing, the reader is able to pick up on the underlying romantic tensions between Dawsey and Juliet without the two characters ever realizing it themselves until later in the book.<br /><br />It's hard not to fall in love with these characters; it's even less so to not fall in love with the writing. Shaffer and Barrows do a phenomenal job of making a reader feel as though they are in these moments, transcending every anecdote to real life. I never once felt as though there was a sense of inauthenticity about the characters, as quirky as they might be, and the stories they share with Juliet, first in letters, later in person revealed through letters to Sidney. Similarly, Juliet as the primary narrator has a way of coming across as earnest and humorous - at one point, she tells of a story playing \\"Dead Bride\\" with Kit, and while questioning if it's healthy to play such a game with a four year old girl, she bemoans that she never wants to stop.<br /><br />I can't even begin to guess how many times I laughed out loud while reading at a bus stop while strangers looked at me strangely.<br /><br />One thing I absolutely loved about this book though is how it manages to talk about the effects of the War without really ever delving into it. Guernsey's isolation from the world meant that they only knew what was happening on Guernsey. It's not until Juliet brings up her own memories of the bombings in London (one of which crushed her flat) and the last person to see Elizabeth alive becomes a part of the Guernsey community that the War becomes an actual character in the book. It brings a new sort of perspective to what happened during World War II and how people lived on a day to day basis, without knowing what was happening. In some ways, the atmosphere of Guernsey can be compared to one of a concentration camp, held alone in its isolation and without word from the outside world. Yet, with the bright spark of Elizabeth's invention of the Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, the society members are given the opportunity to recapture their former lives and a chance to make the most of their occupation.<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society has this way of making a reader feel tangled up in its magic, like one never wants to leave this world where the ocean crashes against the cliff and neighbors are full of goodwill and kindness (for the most part). The story of Elizabeth lays the groundwork for Juliet to begin her next book, while bits and bobs of English culture are infused into the present day story. It's the kind of book that when you put it down, you want to pick it right back up and start reading it all over again, to see what you missed the first time around.<br /><br />This isn't a book to read. This is a book to buy and read and cherish until it's been read so many times, its cover is dog eared and the pages are yellow. And then you go out and buy another copy, just so you can read it again at any time you like.what was happening.

B000F9RMHK|3.0|I love collecting the FYE collectors tins, and the very rare Hot Topic ones as well. If I am mistaken this was a Hot Topic exclusive, but it could have been FYE too, don't recall, but it is out of print. Watch out for the Japan knock-off's. I bought this when it first came out, save the two disc collectors dvd which is inside the tin box shrink wrapped, and the sealed necklace, and the Tin, which is much better than lets say the flimsey tin that 10,000 BC and The Departed are in, this is more of a Tin Box, rather than the Tin Specials FYE usually releases.<br /><br />Great for a die hard fan or this movie or collecting, but other than that just a ploy to get more movie fans and cult fanatics into shelling out 20-40.00 to make them more money.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I could forgive the HBO series story-line for deviating from the book series, but Anna Paquin's horrible acting ruins the series entirely. She couldn't act when she was in X-Men and she apparently hasn't taken any lessons between then and now. With a new lead actress, the series would be at least less horrible than it is... except for the fact that the HBO series is nothing but soft-core porn aimed to disrespect and sexualize women - something that Charlaine Harris most certainly would not do.

B002BSHXJA|1.0|Yes, for all those fans who grew up hearing the Beatles mixed Front to Back (mono) instead of the cheesy Left & Right channels where you could turn off a channel and make instant Beatles Karaoke--your wait is finally over.    Now for the bad news: EMI/APPLE is making you pay through the nose for the privilege. Remember that wonderful Paul vocal flourish at the end of the Sgt. Pepper reprise? It's back in all it's glory--but you have to shell out $230 to $300 for it, as EMI/APPLE won't (for the moment) issue the Sgt. Pepper individually.     Real fans will also be disgusted to see that they've left off the Yellow Submarine Mono album (which DOES exist--PMC 7070 is the catalogue number on my copy).    I can't in good conscience recommend you look for bootlegged and file-shared versions of the key mono-era releases (which will no doubt soon appear), but EMI/APPLE should take note: you're going to drive a fair number of folks to the route of illegal copying by charging $23!!!!!!!! a disc for music which will soon enter the public domain in the European Union. At the very LEAST a Sgt. Pepper Special Edition Mono release is in order--for which I'm sure dedicated fans will gladly pay $25.    P.S.  Thank you amazon.com for allowing freedom of speech in this forum: I posted this same review on B&N and it was deleted as being \\"off-topic\\"--guess they're more interested in their profits than what fans think.
B001GCUER0|1.0|\\"Mad Men\\" - a perfectly shallow and narcissistic show - bears as much relation to the emotional, psychological, moral and political moods of the early 1960s as does Twitter, \\"So You Think You Can Dance?\\"(no you can't), the iPhone, and places like Salon.com. Far more a version of \\"Sex and the City\\" with much cooler clothes and cars and music (and girls), what's left out of this piece of plastic is everything we truly know about the time, which is everything its smarmy Yuppie audience has had a major hand in exterminating in our current culture: earnestness, optimism, a sense of community, grace, complexity, self-deprecation, hatred of the rich and big business, a refusal to demonize others and puff up ourselves, and (perhaps most important) the assumption that people are basically good.    Not only were slick and shiny dime-a-dozen ad-men no one's idea of a role model in the early 1960s, they became the embodiment of everything repulsively corporate, compromised, materialistic and oh-so-1957. ('Course one of the wonderful things about that time is no one thought along the lines of \\"oh-so-1957\\".) Take a look: \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", \\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\\", \\"Lilies of the Field\\", the Beach Boys, Stanley Elkin, David Janssen, Jasper Johns, the 1962 Dual-Ghia, Steve Allen, Ornette Coleman, Rosemary Clooney, \\"The Hustler\\", \\"The Ladies Man\\", the TWA Terminal at Idlewild, and of course Jack Kennedy himself.    What we get here, rather, is the same old campy, self-referential \\"I gotta go right out and buy that tie!\\" mutant elite ass-kissing. Creator Matt Weiner tries very hard (and very successfully) to pull the wooly over the eyes of the self-enchanted mind-travelers who read/watch/listen in order to feel even more self-enchanted, for this glamorama soap opera has all the \\"subtlety\\" of a Bloomingdale's store window. (Come to think of it, \\"Mad Men\\" is the ultimate Bloomingdale's store window.)     Just take the role models. We have the ubercompetent corporate drone. Thehysterectical stay-at-home worthy of \\"Desperate Housewives\\". The frail, tremulous heroine buried under an avalanche of agency problems. (With the coming gravy of sexual harassment ladled over her. Abortion anyone?) The porcine connected jerk invulnerable to retribution because of his seniority. The burnt-out case, with bad job, bad marriage, stacks of unpaid bills. And everyone always chirp-chirp-chirping at those oh-so-important client meetings. (My kingdom for a cell phone!)    Sure smells like 1963 to me. Or is that the Starbucks down the block?    What's most repulsive about \\"Mad Men\\" is how this time (the \\"last time before America became a slave to anxiety,\\" as Mailer put it) is seen through the Weiner-ish prism of contemporary Yuppoid self-congratulation. Yeah, sure they had the music and the cars and a real man as President. But we're so much smarter now! So much more dedicated to our work, our appearance, our health, our environment. So much more civilized about race, and gender, and sexual preference. So much more educated with so much more knowledge right at our fingertips. And how `bout that clunky & pathetic old technology?!    An incredibly stupid show for its appropriately stupid audience. How is it possible to make a series about a time that seems more golden as the years go by, especially from the POV of the emotional & cultural cesspool America has now become, without so much as a glimmer of regret, sadness, or melancholy toward what's been lost? But then, what narcissist is capable of regret?

B00288KNL8|2.0|I was very disappointed in this movie.  Mainly due to the fact that for over 5 minutes there is a character who is hardly clothed at all.  And she's the one that the film focus on for over 5 minutes.  The lady is very big chested and has a tiny bit of covering over her nipples.  But the whole rest of her chest is left for everyone to see.  And she's wearing a thong!  I found this totally inappropriate for children.

In my opinion (if that counts) this album is great. Although I like all their albums, this one is definitely different. But a Good Different. You won't be disappointed if you like the older releases you'll like this for sure. I hope this helps all a-ha/music fans out there who have yet to get this album. Make it the 9th album in your a-ha collection.

0201633612|3.0|This book is just \\"OK\\" for me but that's only due to the fact that I don't know SmallTalk or C++.  I was able to follow the descriptions of how the design patterns work, but that's because I already read the Head First Design Patterns book, which for me was a much better instruction on Design Patterns.<br /><br />This book is probably very informative to someone who has a Computer Science background, but for the relatively moderate programmer and someone who doesn't know the particular languages the book covers, it may not be valuable.<br /><br />Side note: the authors are the \\"Gang Of Four\\" who are famous for Design Patterns designs and their web site, [...]  is a good resource for patterns in other languages.  I'm a C# developer and they have a package available with examples of all the designs patterns that I've found invaluable.
0316044695|3.0|I believe this was a decent book that will entertain the average person looking for an exciting story. To be truthful, I felt that the first half of the book was a little slow and pretty repetetive on the whole \\"I love Texas\\" and \\"Look how awesome SEALs are\\" subjects. No disrespect because SEALs lead the way along with the rest of SOCOM forces, but you don't have to constantly remind me of it. The SEAL training portion of the book was interesting and helped speed along the first half of the book. After Operation RedWings kicks off though, good luck setting this down. It becomes a high-paced action saga with details that make you feel like you are there with the team. This book is a good book, it's not great, but in no way is it the worst military book I've read. If you do read this book then I recommend that you read \\"Victory Point\\" by Ed Darack to hear another side of the story. It will make you question some of the material in \\"Lone Survivor\\".
6305754969|4.0|From time to time I've revisited this movie. Entertaining it is.<br />\\"El Dorado\\" has its hokey moments, James Caan going on and on about \\"ride boldly ride\\" in a poem about El Dorado, Maudie (John Wayne's love interest) taking up where numerous women in Wayne's movies have left off: \\"I'm not going to cry. I'm just going to buy a pine box, about 6-foot for you\\" and then the requisite speech about how men are dumb for fighting and women are saintly for waiting valiently for their men to come back home, blah, blah blah.<br />It has has a geezer sidekick (Arthur Honeycutt)who mimics Walter Brennen from \\"Rio Bravo,\\" James Caan who mimics Ricky Nelson from \\"Rio Bravo\\" and Mitchum who mimics Dean Martin from \\"Rio Bravo\\" and, finally, Charlene Holt, who mimics Angie Dickinson in \\"Rio Bravo.\\" See the pattern? \\"Rio Bravo\\" and \\"El Dorado\\" are essentially the same movie. A sheriff, his sidekick and John Wayne, his sidekick and his girlfriend. Formulaic.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there is a good movie in here.<br />There are elements of Wild Woolly Westerns here.<br />Christopher George plays the bad guy gunslinger who nonetheless warms up to John Wayne's Cole Thornton and SPOILER ALERT! gets it in the end.<br />But there is a scene that is gold: George and his band of bad men walk into the bar to see the other bad guy/rancher Edward Asner.<br />As they walk in, tinkly piano music plays and they swagger in. It's straight out of a 1920s shoot-em-up.<br /><br />It's not a work of art. But it will entertain. It will grow on you with subsequent showings.<br />John Wayne is the ultimate John Wayne with his John Waynisms. Mitchum is pretty much a bystander and goes through the motions.<br /><br />All in all, entertaining and a poem to formula Cowboy movies.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|Plenty of people in the prior reviews tell you all the features and if they like it and what not.  I purchased the G13 to play WOW. I am not a hard core WOW player but I am a hardcore RTS player.    Within about 2 hours I had 3 profiles set up on the G13. Much to my surprise I find using the joystick very natural.  I use it to move forward/back and sidestep left and right.  Everyone is correct about pushing the joystick button, it is difficult, you will need to use your thumb knuckle) so I simply left it jump as there is usually no reason to jump in WOW.  Once you get over the wierd feeling of movement from using the stick you will most likely never go back to w,a,s,d in an MMORPG.  As for RTS games, again the joy stick is worth its weight in gold once you figure out how to move the main screen around with the stick and even zoom and manuver the camera (Supreme Commander).  Even in warcraft III you can set up the stick to do many things like camera and basic unit commands.    After using the G13 for about 3 weeks I have decided to get a smaller keyboard so that I can fit the unit on one side of my keyboard and my mouse on the other side.  The piece of kit is pretty big and if you use a pullout keyboard shelf that can hold a keyboard and mouse you will be hard pressed to fit it all on the shelf.  One solution I have found is that Microsoft makes a gaming keyboard with a detachable keypad.  After measuring everything up, it will all fit. Be aware the G13 is fairly large.    The LCD is cool and programs are available from outside sources that do enhance the experiance, namely performance monitors from various manufacturers and then you can also get a FRAPS program that actually charts your frame rate performance.  You can also map the Fraps keys to the G13 so that is pretty cool.  Other than that the LCD  works fine but is not really paid attention to much.    One last thing about the unit.  It is very comfortable but I have noticed my palm starts to ache somewhat after hours of gaming.  I think the layout of the unit is top notch and compared to the belkin unit which I also have it is light years ahead in comfort.  But after a while the spot where you rest your palm will probably start to ache.  Not a deal breaker by any means, as most computer accessories will become more and more uncomfortable the longer you use them in one session.  But it does surprise me that they did not make the resting area just a tinny winny bit padded, would of helped in the long run.    To conclude I will say this is a home run knocked clear out of the park.  I have been on the fence about these specialized devices for a few years, looking at the saitek unit and then finally buying the Belkin unit.  The Belkin unit, altho decent was not the device to make this segment of controllers legit in the eyes of the mainstream gamer.  The Logitec G13 IS the unit to own if you  A. Play an MMORPG  (cannot even imagine using my keyboard now)  B. Play RTS games  (again, there is no way I can go back to keyboard for Supreme Commander or Red Alert of Warcraft III)  C. Play FPS games  (not so much different than keyboard as you are back to W,A,S,D but with easy access to more buttons without moving your hand)    I would recommend that if you only play FPS you should definitely give it a try, but the only benefit you are getting from the unit is access to more buttons without picking up your hand, and I am not sure if [...] is justifiable for some extra keystrokes and a few macro's.     If you play WOW or any RTS, go buy this thing, take a little time and think out a profile for each game and give it a couple weeks.  You will not be dissappointed.      Oh and I just got another one for my girlfriend that plays wow.  She loves it.  Very nice piece of gear if you are a gamer.

0525421033|5.0|What an amazing, amazing novel!  I have thought about it ever since I finished.  It just stays with you and you start questioning what you would do in Mia's situation.  On one hand, her parents and brother are gone, but on the other she has an amazing boyfriend, best friend, and grandparents that love her.  It was really hard for me when I first started reading.  The beginning is so emotional and quite depressing.  But as the story goes, it completely draws you in.  I couldn't put it down!  The back story of Mia's life flows seamlessly throughout her current predicament.  The story is the ultimate package and will satisfy all readers.  I greatly recommend reading this wonderful and arresting novel.

B002BSHWUU|1.0|If you have a very revealing system, and if you are familiar with this music and how well-recorded music is supposed to sound, then I would recommend skipping this set.    Sure, it's beautifully packaged; but the previous reviewer who indicated that the levels have all been topped off, with compression applied, got it dead on.    I had not read any of the negative reviews when I started listening, but I could tell immediately that something was not right.  It is louder, and some material is a little clearer than in previous releases, but in so doing, the hacks who re-mastered this, the greatest music catalogue of the 20th Century, have completely eliminated the \\"live\\" sound to nearly every track I have heard.    \\"Louder\\" is not always \\"better\\".  If you have a merely decent system, and are not attuned (no pun intended) to what fine recordings are supposed to sound like, then you will probably not notice to what I am referring.  I envy you, because I just plunked down $200 for some nifty packaging.    I might rip this and put it on my iPod; it will probably sound good hooked up to my car stereo.  I doubt if it will receive much play in my home system, because it is just too obnoxious for higher-end gear.    I hate to have to review this so negatively; again, I consider The Beatles to be the greatest band in the history of recorded music; Lennon and McCartney were two of the most prolific, profound, and downright brilliant songwriters whose music I will ever enjoy. It is a shame that this was done to their music, and it was thrust upon the masses as being an improvement.

This book will remind you that there are great Americans who selflessly sacrifice for the greater good of thier country. The thing that makes this inspring story so powerful is that it is true. Remind yourself of that with every turn of the page.        This book is also an excellent narative for those who may have an interest in joing the military, specifically the Special Forces.

B000J10EQU|5.0|Superman is the Grand Old Man of superheroes, and so a movie dusting the character off after an almost twenty year absence needs to walk a fine line between reverance and pure high adventure.  Bryan Singer's Superman Returns does just that ... at once a loving homage to the great work Richard Donner did in 1978 with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman and an elegant re-imagining of a hero we all know by heart, even if we think we don't.  What Bryan Singer delivers is a smart, action-packed and heartfelt movie, bringing Superman to us after a fruitless 5 year search for his home planet, Krypton.  His return to earth as Clark Kent coincides with Lex Luthor's newest real estate scheme, this one involving Kryptonite and a place to detonate it.  (It's funny that the Lex Luthor of the Superman movie universe is so brilliant but only obsessed with real estate.  And Kevin Spacey does the arch-nemesis complete justice ... making him both funny and very terrifying.)  Our first real encounter with Brandon Routh's Superman (an excellent Brandon Routh) is a set-piece involving a fiery airplane and an endangered Lois Lane.  This first glimpse of him is as satisfying as when Christopher Reeve snagged a falling Margot Kidder from the Daily Planet building and she screeched \\"You've got me?  Who's got you?\\"  And statistically, flying is still the safest way to travel. -- Brandon Routh's Superman already has an old soul and he wins our hearts from the beginning.  He is an alien on an alien world and his outsider status never fails to touch us.  This is not a question of Superman Returns being the best movie since Reeves' first two outings.  Superman Returns belongs on the same shelf with these two.  It is, simply, the most satisfying super hero movie to come along in a long while.  Epic and intimate, spectacular and touchingly ordinary, Superman Returns does proper tribute to the first (and best) superhero flying around out there.  Highly recommended.

B0028DRGDQ|5.0|So Rec borrow elements from The Blair Witch Project and 28 Days Later, but it actually works here. This is a tight and intense Spanish horror film that should really put the American remake to shame (though I haven't seen that one, and I don't think I ever will). A female news reporter and a cameraman are doing a documentary on what goes on in the night. As she starts interviewing firefighters, they get a call from an apartment. So the news duo and the firefighters spring into action and rescue a woman who appears to be in trouble. The hellish mayhem begins as soon as the woman unexpectedly bites one of the firefighters. It's seventy-five minutes of fear, panic, and infections.<br /><br />Rec is one of the scariest horror flicks I've seen. It's just as scary as Asian horror films like Ju-On: The Grudge and The Shutter. The hand-held camera adds to the nightmarish atmosphere in many places, while the \\"jump scenes\\" are pretty effective. And the ending is purely frightening: watch it completely in the dark if you have enough courage.<br /><br />P.S. Let's hope the sequel is just as good.

B00168OIOE|5.0|Before anyone starts saying this has not been released yet and  there cannot be a review of the Bluray edition let me tell you this, this movie has been available in Japan and Mexico for quite some time now, and I was able to get a copy of the Mexican edition, which was at one time, identical to the one to be released in the US. It is a 3 disc edition (2 BD plus DVD copy of the movie), this has now been changed to a 4 disc set in the US to include the additional digital copy.<br /><br />Disc one starts with an intro by director Pete Docter, in which he pretty much explains all the contents in this 'glorious' high definition version of the movie.  A mini documentary on the 'Monsters, Inc: Ride & Go Seek ' ride in Disney Japan is also included. The highlight to me was the creators 'Round table' in which they talk about the process of creating the movie, some deleted scenes not included in prior DVD versions are shown here and they finally explained to me why is it so difficult to get a reservation at 'Harryhausen's' if all the staff from the scare floor seems to hang around there!<br /><br />The Pixar shorts 'For the birds' and 'Mike's new car' (originally made on 4:3 format) are also included in HD format (as previously released in 'Pixar shorts)<br /><br />The movie is presented in 1:85:1 aspect ratio. The word that comes to mind to describe how this looks is simply 'Beautiful', the colors, the textures, Sullivan's fur, the character's skin textures, Roz' sweater. Details pop up, colors are bright and clear. I had never noted that the real name of 'Boo' is actually in the movie until I saw it on Bluray!<br /><br />The audio is another improvement of this BD edition. Presented in an uncompressed 5.1 track, the music by Randy Newman and the sound effects (check the audio in the door chamber sequence or every time 'Boo' laughs/cries and there is a power variation) sound just great. Spanish and French Dolby Digital tracks are also included. An audio commentary with the creators provides a lot of details of the movie, since I have watched this over and over with my 2 year old kid I have been able to play the commentary a couple times so he watches the movie and I learn about how it was made.<br /><br />One thing I noted though, the end credits in the Bluray are not the same as in the DVD. The DVD will have the bloopers play while the credits roll, while the Bluray does not. Those 'Bloopers' though are included in disc 2 as additional features.<br /><br />Disc 2 includes a feature called the 'Employee's manual' Additional spots created to promote the film are included too. Storyboards and drawings from the artists in HD as well as the '100 doors challenge', which is like a trivia game in which based on your responses you will be offered a position in Monsters Inc.

B001GCUO4I|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars because i am a fan of the movies. However, i didn't like this one as much. Maybe because the first three were older, whereas in this one feels like they're trying too hard to recreate the old ones. Even the deaths are repetative. In FD2 a woman gets smashed with a bus, and in FD4 the same thing, only with a guy this time.

B002BSHXJA|4.0|Hello. I really need an information, hope someone who already bought the mono box set in the US can help me. And maybe this information can use to someone else as well.  I Read that all the albums are presented in miniature vinly version, including sleevs and inserts, and that the actual Cd have the LP labels on them.  Being this one the american version of the box set I wonder if they put on the CDs the Capitol labels artwork (like the american LPs of the 60s) or the Parlophone black and yellow labels artwork (like the british LPs of the 60s). I think it's unlikely that they used the Capitol artwork cause the album before Sgt.Pepper had different titles and different songs in the US, but I would like to make sure of it.  In short, I would need to know if the Cds in this box set look like the ones in the \\"mono box set\\" which is for sale in the UK or if they're different.  I can't menage to find any photo of the Cds artwork so I hope You can help me to clarify that.  Many Thanks.    Massimo
1448646421|5.0|Persuasion is a beautifully written book, as one would expect from the polished wordsmith that Austen is. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot is persuaded by a family friend to not pursue a relationship with Captain Wentworth because of his lesser status in `society', even though she is in love with him, and he with her. Years later, she is reacquainted with him and her love for him has not diminished. She is unsure of how he feels about her. He is now a prestigious and admired captain; his station in life completely reversed from before.  The real story is that of following our heart or our head, which Austen does best.      This is a heartwarming story of romance, life, human nature, and finally a great ending, (which I won't spoil).    Well worth re-reading, and I can recommend this charming edition.  If you have not read Persuasion, persuade yourself that you must, and do so today, you will only be enriched by the experience.

144864738X|5.0|This is where Hercule Poirot first entered the world, the first Poriot mystery!  I found it by accident, and was so happy, as I had read most (all I think), of Poirot's cases.  He's my favorite of Christie characters, but there are so many, that I'm never unhappy with Miss Marple, et cal.<br /><br />The plot has all the hallmarks of Agatha's great works. A person is murdered. There are small assorted clues, but no smoking gun. There are people who hate the victim, and people who love them, & Christie manages to draw suspicion upon both sets of characters alike without making the plot seem contrived. The intricate plan for the murder that eventually comes out is similarly within the realm of possibility.<br />If you have missed this mystery, you'll love this charming edition!
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|I love The Beatles to no end. \\"Abbey Road\\" is one of my favorites. It all sounds clean and fresh, backbeat and bass making its noise. As far as owning the previous 1987 CD remasters, for me, this purchase was worth it.     In reading other reviews there is a point to the bass and drums being turned up with little else in mastering than volume levels. Playing Ringo's drum solo \\"In The End\\" is sounding clearer, better, and well...more thumpy than I remember.     \\"Abbey Road\\" remastered isn't bad, just could have done a little better, cleaner, less emphasis on volume and more track seperation. At the time, studio's were just beginnig to use 8 track recording and in this case, recording and mixing all to one 8 track and bouncing down another 8 (making a whoping 16) for more musicaly ambitious arrangments. I'm sure ther was limitaions on how to remaster the disc, but it all sounds good and less flat than the previous 1987 release.     The choice is yours, and if you're not too picky, should be just fine with your 1987 remaster.    To critique this CD's music content would be like scrutinizing an Monet painting.   There are standards here every rock station plays, and in frequent rotation.    Part of the sale for me was, besides a great sound, enhanced material. It should play if all is normal, but if not, read on.    Computer Playback Issues:    If you have any software to encryption break, you must turn it off to view the enhanced content. DVD43 comes to mind.    From Microsoft Windows on CD playback issues:    Close any DVD or Burning Software. These programs may be attempting to use the drive, which keeps Windows from accessing the disc. Programs to look for include:   Roxio family of products .  Power DVD   WinDVD   Media Direct   Windows Media Player   Nero Burning ROM    Mine now works, as to where it wasn't with DVD43 running.    A great buy, will be getting more Beatle remastered discs when the funds allow it.     For a truly great Beatles remaster, look into purchasing 1999's \\"Yellow Submarine\\". That was actual remastering from the original tapes. Sounds were brought out that I never heard before. Highly recommended to own.
1448646464|5.0|Northanger Abbey is truly a fascinating book!  At the time it was written, Gothic Literature was the common style for novels, and was dismissed by most as a low or silly albeit a popular mode.  Austen wrote Northanger Abbey (her first book) as a part comedy and satire on this Gothic method.  Read the book and laugh along with Austen, as she is not to be taken seriously.  Some people read the book, as if it's written straight forward, and for sure, there is a good story there, it's not a complete joke, there is a drama of manners AND part parody of Gothic literature.     It's a great read on many levels, you will enjoy it, and it's worth reading - & I can recommend this charming edition, if you can't find your old copy.  If you have never has the pleasure of reading Northanger Abbey, or resisted because it was a first novel, move past that and read it.  If it was the only book Austen ever wrote, it would be as well known today as Pride and Prejudice!
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|There was enough in the film to keep me watching it---beautiful shots of Barcelona and the countryside, charming outdoor cafes, warmly lit intimate interiors, etc.  Lots of eye candy.  A nice travelog with characters and a sexy plot.    Allen is obviously highly enamored of Scarlett Johansen and who could blame him---she is gorgeous and lights up every scene she's in, even if you can't call what she does \\"acting.\\"  Penelope Cruz is her match and the scenes with the two of them are probably the most interesting.  Javier Barden is appropriately swarthy, sexy and Spanish and fills the bill for the role, which is pretty one-dimensional. Rebecca Hall who plays Vicky really plays Scarlett Johansen, who is sort of playing Woody Allen.  I found Ms. Hall's performance slightly better than execrable and I have to assume that the only reason she was cast was that she resembles Ms. Johansen a lot....just without the star quality.  All of them do Woody's stumbling word shtick that was cute about thirty years ago but now.....no!      The story concerns two young American girls spending their summer in Europe and find romance, or something like it, and then....go home again.  It's a story that has been lived out countless times by countless American college girls.  It seems that drinking and romance with Europeans with looser morals than the ones they left back home is a mandatory coming of age ritual for lots of girls with enough money to make the trip.  All under the pretense of art.    It did remind me of Henry James' wonderful novels in which naive Americans found themselves over their heads with decadent Europeans, but James did it much better!      I do give it three stars for the visual beauty of the film.  Maybe just play it without the dialogue, if you can get it free from the library and you can have a glass of wine or two and some interesting friends to chat with while it's playing.
1448646375|5.0|Austen's amusing examination of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both amusing and shrewd.     Emma Woodhouse is a young, rich woman living with her strange father in the town of Highbury. Fed up lacking a life - eager for some sort of diversion, she decides to play matchmaker her new friend Harriet Smith with the local vicar Mr. Elton. Emma is convinced that her matchmaking skills are extraordinarily talented when they are in fact, the reverse.  One hilarious mishap occurs after another resulting in broken hearts and uncertainty, However, and happily, in the end all is well, with all three of the main couples finding happiness.    It is Emma's character that makes the whole book so worthwhile and adding to one's library.  Time to read this one again, if its been a while, and if you have only read Pride and Prejudice, it's high time to read Emma!  You won't regret it!    PS this is a very charming, nice edition, I loved the cover!
B0025KVLVA|2.0|I got this CD hoping to be blown away by the sound improvements and I was deeply disappointed.  If your looking for that deep rich sound you heard in \\"Let it Be\\" (Naked) or \\"The Beatles LOVE\\" you won't find it here.  The packaging is nice but you need a CD ROM to see the mini documentary.  I would not recommend this CD to anybody especially if you purchased the original \\"PAST MASTERS\\"
1439138311|4.0|Brooklyn, by Colm Toibin, is a story that centers around a young woman named Eilis Lacey. Eilis lives in a small town in Ireland, along with her recently widowed mother, and her older sister Rose. Where Rose is fun-loving and out-going, Eilis is quiet and reserved. In Ireland, Eilis is studying to be a bookkeeper, and although she is doing well with classes, she has difficulty finding a decent job in Ireland, like her sister Rose.<br /><br />When Father Flood, a priest visiting Ireland from the United States, meets Eilis and her family, he offers to sponsor Eilis in the US. Father Flood has a small parish in Brooklyn, and he promises to find Eilis, a good job working in a store there, as well as a place to stay with other women her age. Shy and afraid to leave the life she is comfortable with, her sister Rose encourages her to go, and tells her it would be a wonderful opportunity for her. She reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />On the boat to America the nervous anticipation of the unknown quickly sets in. Once she arrives and gets settled at the boarding house, she soon begins getting letters from home, which make her even more homesick. Father Flood keeps her busy with work, suggesting she enroll in classes at the local college, and attending parish dances. At one of the dances she meets a young Italian man named Tony, who is immediately attracted to Eilis. They soon start spending time together and enjoying each other's company. When bad news arrives from Ireland, Eilis, decides she must return home for a while, but not before, she fulfills a secret request to Tony.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this character driven novel from beginning to end, and without giving spoilers, I thought the ending was great. The author does a great job painting a vivid picture of 1950's Brooklyn, New York. What it was like for immigrants in America at that time, and the discrimination experienced by Jews, Blacks, Irish, Italians etc. This author is new to me, but I now plan to read more by him soon. RECOMMENDED
B0025KVLSI|3.0|If you're looking for that deep rich fat sound you heard in \\"Let it Be\\" (Naked) or \\"The Beatles LOVE\\" you won't find it here.  Sure the sound is cleaner and the packaging is nice but that's it.  I saw Paul McCartney on \\"Entertainment Tonight\\" he said that the sound is so great it sounded as if the person singing was right next to you.  Nothing was remixed or anything done to bring these recording to today's standards they just took the original mixes and used some software to clean them up don't believe the hype it doesn't even compare to the original albums.  My advise skip the CDs unless you just don't own the original ones.

B0025KVLT2|2.0|Let me start out by saying that the chances of me getting the rest of the Beatles Remastered is about 99%. As for this CD, it sounds almost identical to the 1987 release. Granted, the sound is a little louder than 1987. What I didn't care for was the seperation. The Beatles themselves admitted, they were not to crazy about the musical instruments on one channel and their vocals on the other channel. They have the technology to have done better (my opinion).  I was expecting to hear songs like \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"Think For Yourself\\" to sound like they did on the 1999 release of YELLOW SUBMARINE Songtrack. Great Stereo Sound.<br /><br />Also, I was expecting three of the songs to last a couple seconds longer (sorry to be picky). \\"You Won't See Me\\", \\"The Word\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" were longer on the American release. Fortunitlly, they can be heard on THE CAPITOL ALBUMS Vol.2 CD collection.  The one major disappointment is the 'false start' on \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" was not on this CD, wher it can be heard on CAPITOL ALBUMS Vol.2.<br /><br />I don't know how the rest of the CD's will sound yet. I will know as I buy each one at a time. I may not get YELLOW SUBMARINE because the Great Stereo Sound is available the 1999 release.<br /><br />PS - I also agree with the reviews, stating that the \\"2009 Remastered\\" release should be seperate from the 1980's release.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|It's not possible to explain how good these remasters are compared to the compact discs from the 80's so I'll just say this ... if you love the Beatles' music; throw away your old versions of these cds buy this box set.   Also, you are in for a treat if you remember the original vinyl albums as the original packaging is recreated for the cds right down to the album sleeves .....very groovy.
0439023483|5.0|I read this book to my 5th/6th grade class.  It was the most successful book I have ever read aloud.  I had students begging and bargaining with me not to stop reading. Though violent at times, the story gave the students great food for thought about loyalty, trust, superficiality, and survival.  The plot has gut wrenching twists, the characters are strong yet flawed, and the setting is imaginative.
0061438294|5.0|My father-in-law is a retired FBI agent so I bought this book to even the playing field! I was very pleased with the book. The greatest strength in this book is Navarro's often repeated refrain that there is NO sure-fire way to tell if someone is lying by body language alone. For this, I respect the man because it's absolutely true, and it seems that Hollywood (with all those terrible law enforcement stereotypes) haven't gotten the message. That aside, there are plenty of pictures which help to show exactly what Navarro is explaining (it would be hard to describe 'arms akimbo' in words alone) and he adds true stories to further the points. I read this book along with [[ASIN:006124189X Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (Collins Business Essentials)]] by Robert Cialdini (4 stars) and [[ASIN:0470051418 Covert Persuasion: Psychological Tactics and Tricks to Win the Game]] by Kevin Hogan and James Speakman (3 Stars) and recommend this book over the others.

B001PPGAIA|5.0|The history is intreguing ... it was a raw country ... two seasons - desolate and dry - beautiful when wet.    The chemistry between Sara and The Drover was so cool - two different worlds clashed at first and then the attraction blossomed and my my my i watch it at least twice a week ... at first it was nearly every day - I wanted to live it.      I had never seen Nicole in a movie and was pleasantly surprised but Hugh Jackman is positively type cast - he was a natural for the part...so bad.

0545128285|2.0|I was disappointed with this book. I love the Harry Potter series, so this was a major letdown. The series was 100 times better than Beetle the Bard. If this was the first book that I read, I may have had a more optimistic view on it, but it was the last. Rowling just can't compete with her own writing when it comes to the Harry Potter series.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|I just purchased this on 9/9/09.    My first impressions are that they have drastically improved the vast majority of these tracks while not losing any of the tone or style that came with the initial releases.  Clearer with better seperation.  The only negative once again goes to \\"I Am the Walrus\\" that once again starts in stereo, moves to mono, then becomes fake stereo.  I understand that the King Lear radio play is only on the mono version, but couldn't they get the full stereo version and drop in the mono portion at the end.  Yes, there would be a lot of bleed and less seperation, but I could do with less as opposed to none.    As far as the songs go, this is a very good Beatles album featuring numerous singles, including two double A-sides.  A couple of songs are, imo, weak (Your Mother Should Know, Blue Jay Way, and Flying), but the rest are all top notch.    Because of the sound and the 3 weak tunes, I rate this one a 4 star effort.  If you are an audiophile, you will enjoy this remastering.

B001608QVS|5.0|A must-have for every \\"early\\" Clint Eastwood Fan. Picture and sound quality are excellent, especially when you consider the age of the first 2 productions. One of the best blu-ray boxes available on the market. The extras:  a 40 page booklet; a wallet with metal badge, Lobby Poster Cards and much more. Also a documentary about Clint Eastwood. A great product which I really do enjoy. Also interesting for european customers since the blu-rays will play without any problems on all european players.
0881889148|3.0|book was delivered quickly, however the softback cover is glued to the front and back pages - it is not attached ot the binding. very peculiar. i have never seen a soft cover book or song book attached to the front and back pages, the covers are always attached to the binding, far more secure.
0446618306|4.0|I recently began audiobook walking as a way to keep me interested in a daily 1 hour walk.  This book kept me honest to my walk time each afternoon since I couldn't wait to hear what happened next.  I am pretty sure I will replay this one some time in the future as it warmed my heart with (usually) sweet emotion in several different chapters.  Also, I am always a sucker for storylines involving  relationships between a father & son, and I was crushed when John accused Savannah of faking her feelings for the purpose of doing a case-study on John's father's illness.  Would make a great movie!
B00003CXA6|5.0|I am staggered by some of the negative reviews. Many of them focus on Martin Sheen's performance as R.E. Lee. I was born in the South and I was exposed to all the idolatry of Lee. Unfortunately, there is a different R.E. Lee and I think Sheen and the director are trying to show him: Lee the religious man, Lee the Southern Fanatic and Lee the Military Believer. Lee was not some kind of grandiose, kind-hearted benevolent man. For one year he committed his troops to a hopeless cause in Petersburg. He watched them starving and dying for no reason. Grant begged him to stop the carnage and Lee refused over and over . Think about that Lee when you are watching Gettsburg and I think you will understand the message. I highly recommend that you read de Werts biography of Longstreet and you will understand why \\"Gettysburg\\" is a great movie
B000001ELL|5.0|There are three songs from Ace on this album 2000 Man, Hard Times, and Save Your Love. That makes it worth the price. This was also Peter's last classic album. He only had one song though, Dirty Livin'.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Abbey Road has always been one of my favorite albums of all time. From the original vinyl to the cd from the 80's and now this jewel of a record. The sound is a lot cleaner and does not have the muddy, heavy handed sound of the 1st cd. It was like listening to these songs for the first time. Now you can differentiate the individual voices when they do duets. clearly separate the guitars and the drumming also. Paul's bass sound taut and precise, not boomy. No wonder he's considered the premiere bassist in rock music.

B001DELX08|4.0|Not much to add to the previous reviews. Excellent production, good singing from the three principals. But the acting or Mr. Vargas is pretty bad, his facial expression at the dramatic \\"Amami Alfredo\\" is embarassing to those that are following the pangs of Violetta. On the other hand, Ms. Georghiu's constant \\"close mouth saliva production\\" before she begins singing is a distraction to the viewers that are absorbed in the ongoing drama. Opera singers, used to the large theater stages and the safe distance from the live audience, should begin to be concerned with the close-ups the new media allows. Better yet, video producers should have moved the camera to another target everytime she begins pressing her lips, munching the void in search for a humid environment for her voice to reach our ears. Really ugly...

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive these from another online retailer, in time for Labor Day weekend.  I've casually listened to most of the mono albums by now, so I'll break up my review into several sections:<br /><br />1) The packaging.  A real treat for hard-core fans - each CD is enclosed in a miniature version of its vinyl counterpart, and the attention to detail is simply AMAZING.  Examples: The title of the Sgt. Peppers album is upside down (just like the vinyl LP), the cutouts are all there, the MMT booklet looks exactly the same as the vinyl LP version, each CD has a small duplicate of the vinyl slip cover that can be used to hold the CD, and the CD's themselves look like the original vinyl pressings.<br /><br />2) Overall sound quality.  Since this is the first time that all the mono versions have been released on CD, it's obviously hard to compare them to anything else but bootlegged needledrops.  I think that hard-core fans will not be disappointed, going on what I've heard so far.  Using the mono 1987 CD's as a baseline, the new remasters are superior - it is subtle, but definitely noticeable (like some \\"sonic grime\\" has been removed from the master tapes).<br /><br />3) Differences between the mono and stereos versions.  For the uninitiated, the mono mixes are not fold-downs from the stereo mixes (in other words, that the mono mixes are not just the stereo mixes converted to mono).  These mixes are completely different - the majority of them were created before the stereo mixes (with MMT and The White Album being the turning point where the Beatles started looking more deeply at stereo).  In some cases, the differences are subtle  - but, in other cases (like \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" or \\"She's Leaving Home\\") the differences are very noticeable.  Whether or not these versions are \\"better\\" than their stereo counterparts has been an endless argument for Beatles fans, for decades.<br /><br />4) The price.  Unfortunately, EMI has treated the mono set as a \\"limited\\" edition and the price reflects that.  You get fewer CD's, but the excellent packaging more than makes up for the difference.  I only wish that they had added packaging for Abbey Road / Let It Be / Yellow Submarine CD's, even if they didn't include the actual stereo-only CD's with them.  That would have been the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Overall, this set is a real treat and I think that Beatles fans will definitely enjoy them.dition and the price reflects that.

B002LS4M9E|4.0|The evolution of \\"neo-soul\\" and the reinvention of funk and R & B has been the unspoken blessing of the past decade. The slow mutation from Jill Scott to the British throwback queens of Duffy and Amy Winehouse have shown you don't have to reinvent the wheel, just take the old one and paint it a different color. Mayer Hawthorne's debut on Stones Throw Records, thankfully, finds an untapped niche in this genre with great results.<br /><br />\\"A Strange Arrangement\\" isn't your older brothers booty-shaking R & B, your uncle's old Earth Wind and Fire records, or your dad's collection of Al Green. This record has a lot more in common with the Temptations and Otis Redding. Combining Motown soul and funk breaks and instrumentation, Mayer Hawthorne's music owes a lot to the classics and the easy listening sound of the early 60s and their favorite topic: love won and lost. Hawthorne plays every instrument on the record and has been quoted as having to learn how to sing for this record. It is easy to hear why: the melody lines frequently dip into falsetto and sometimes he executes it, sometimes he doesn't. No matter. The effort he pours into it makes up for the lack of training. The title track oozes along with vocal harmonies to create the lushest arrangement (no pun intended) on the record, first single \\"Just Ain't Gonna Work Out,\\" despite its sparseness of arrangement or melody, just feels great. The horns of the cover \\"Maybe So or Maybe No\\" jump out of the record as well.<br /><br />As a whole, A Strange Arrangement feels familiar and nostalgic in a good way. Of course there are drawbacks to his approach and style. I can't help but wishing Burt Bacharach or Hal Mooney (if he was alive) could toss their arrangements onto these sparse compositions and make them really fly. Very few multi-instrumentalists (Beck, Jon Brion, or Prince are excluded) can really put a session musician's technique on each instrument and careful listeners can hear this lack of polish. But for most listeners, \\"A Strange Arrangement\\" is an intimate, informal collection of love songs that goes down easier than your favorite nightcap.

B000VASG3M|3.0|Strip away the excess padding of the film's hefty 111 minute running-time and some of the more overblown musical numbers and you just might enjoy this as much as the first \\"High School Musical\\", but then you've missed the whole point.  Director/choreographer Kenny Ortega really goes to town with HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 2, the sequel to the surprise smash-hit Disney Channel movie, set during the gang's summer vacation.<br /><br />When Troy (Zac Efron), Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) and their friends all land summer jobs at the ritzy Lava Springs resort owned by Sharpay and Ryan's parents, they simply can't believe their luck - and there's even going to be an end-of-summer talent competition!  But when Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) starts manipulating Troy for her own amusement, will he choose a college scholarship over Gabriella and his friends?<br /><br />The plot is as predictable as the first movie, but these \\"High School Musical\\" films need to be enjoyed on another level entirely.  Kenny Ortega has furnished the movie with tonnes of electric dance routines and the cast gives their absolute all.  Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens make sweet music in the leads but the spotlight always ends up roaming to Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel as the duplicitous twins Sharpay and Ryan--they really get to shine in this film.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00081912E|3.0|I remember my x-boyfriend taking me to see The mask back in 1994 when it first came out in theaters, and for some reason, I had a really tough time staying awake. I'm not a huge Jim Carey fan. The only movie of his which I genuinely love is Liar Liar. Over the years, I tried to watch this movie a few more times, but never could stay awake. It was almost weird. Then, just recently, I got the opportunity to watch this with audio description, which as a totally blind movie/tv fan I always find to be extremely beneficial. Anyway, I was finally able to stay awake through the entire movie, and while it is fairly enjoyable, the animated series which followed it is infinitely more entertaining, at least to me. Unfortunately, coming across the animated series on dvd is next to impossible, but I was fortunate enough to get my hands on most of the episodes, and it's sheer brilliance. If you think that Jim Carey did a great job portraying the mask, which over all, I would say he does, you haven't heard anything yet. If you're ever somehow able to get an opportunity to watch even one episode of the animated series and are able to hear all the incredibly amazing things that Rob Paulsen does with the mask character, it will probably blow your mind as it did mine. While I can't comment on the visual aspects of the animated series, I can assure you that all of the voice work is top notch. Tim Curry is also extremely entertaining as the main bad guy, Pretorious. Anyway, I would give the mask movie 3 stars because it is mildly entertaining now that I'm able to follow it, but the animated series easily earns a solid 5 stars. Unfortunately, since that isn't available to review here on amazon, I've decided to review the movie instead. Here's to hoping that the animated series someday gets a full DVD release. That will be a very happy day in my little world.
031606792X|5.0|OMG... I cannot believe people are so caught up with what Ms. Meyers had to write in this book for the climax. If people are so upset about the way the story ended, I think the most upsetting point of all the \\"VAMPIRE\\" sagas (including this one) is the concept of vampires themselves. I mean c'mon.... the immortality, the immense strength... romance and \\"the powers\\" crap... all these things make the leeches so enchanting. If anything, be upset with this to begin with. But then it's all fantasy and that's why we choose to read these books, to get away from the reality and dive into the world of our own colorful imagination.     Even if the BD did not seem like written by the writer of the first 3 books (no offense to the writer Ms. Meyers by any means) it's all fantasy. So just enjoy the time with this one too like the rest of the first 3 in the series. They are all so well written. I cannot fathom the idea that people are so upset with Edward and Bella having sex and a baby \\"after\\" they are married. Who cares... It's all happening in a la la land where vampires (and warewolves) exist and then co-exist, they are immortal and do not grow old, are so powerful and have their charms. Now wouldn't that be interesting if this was any real, then people would have a say in the direction the story goes. And since it isn't real... let's just enjoy the books and get on with our lives :)
B002BSHWUU|4.0|what a teaser! They put the DVD of the mini-docs in the box to have us compare the stereo cd's to the DVD sound in the docs - the snippets of music on that are soooo much more vibrant than the basic remastered cd's - so, EMI, do we need to wait until the 50th anniversary to see REALLY enhanced audio?!    p.s. I am happy about the mono box that it was made in Japan - as only the Japanese do it (replicas) best - too bad there are no obi's though!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I received my boxed set last weekend (care of another online retailer who shipped them early) and have gone through most of the CD's by now.  I was reluctant to purchase this set, given that they are NOT remixes as I'd hoped.  However, I took the plunge and they are definitely superior to the 1980's effort - it's very noticeable.<br /><br />Of note:<br /><br />1) The packaging.  Although I prefer the mono packaging (which replicates the vinyl packaging exactly), these cases are certainly an improvement over the measly effort back in the 1980's.<br /><br />2) Beatles For Sale.  There's a story behind why this album was released in mono only, back in the 1980's.  Suffice it to say that this error has finally been corrected.  Thank goodness.<br /><br />3) The White Album and Abbey Road.  Wow.  What an improvement over the 1980's CD counterparts.  It's like a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />4) Paul was really a decent bass player.  Since bass was usually toned down on vinyl (for fear that the needle might jump off the groove), and since the 1987 remasters were just flat transfers of the masters designed for vinyl, Paul's bass always sounded pretty anemic.  But not anymore.<br /><br />I do hope that remixes will be the next project to impress us - but for now, I will enjoy the remasters and re-live my fascination with the Beatles, all over again.
0545128285|3.0|I really think it was a waste of time and money, but it was my decision to purchase to live with it.  I think we all wish that Harry Potter would remain with us forever.  But he will grow up and become an adult and then it isn't quite as good as a 10 year old wizard.  Oh well.
B000001GPX|5.0|It's an interesting experience to compare Kleiber's studio effort with Vienna, with Karajan's early 1960s recordings with Berlin.    I've done it a few times now, same sound system, and I find Karajan's readings more urgent, more exciting, and possessing much more weight--in a good way. Also, rather oddly--considering Karajan's later reputation--Karajan's readings from the early 60s actually sound more spontaneous than Kleiber's.  I suspect Karajan was smart enough to let the Orchestra have its way more than he might have later--so he gets some of the benefit of the more-spontaneous Furtwangler-trained Berlin Philharmonic, added to what must have been some careful rehearsal by Karajan, and the result works to his advantage.    Kleiber's studio-work in particular was often notoriously over-controlled, and that seems to be the case in these recordings.  I find the Vienna orchestra has insufficient weight compared to Karajan's Berlin Philharmonic, and Kleiber seems to have everything in such a tight grip, the music really never cuts loose.    If you're looking for big-orchestra Beethoven, there are many choices in these two symphonies.  On balance, after so many years gone by, Karajan's '63 recordings are still extremely satisfying, where Kleiber's work here just misses the mark for me.    Try the comparison.  Memory is tricky.  Try it and see what you hear.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|As a guitar player,I'm always trying to find people who can still play like the guitar greats of the past.This guy is one of them.He has a wonderful tone and a lot of feel.He's versatile and has a soulful voice.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|The album is fantastic for sound quality and clarity.  However I was very disappointed to see not one of the song titles displayed on my JBL stereo in my `07 Camry Hybrid after the sticker on the outside of the album bragged about how they had taken extra steps for Ipod song labeling.  Granted it is not an Ipod player however other albums show the song names just fine.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The White Album in particular and Abbey Road as well are the stars of the remastered stereo reissues.  From the jet engines on Back in the USSR to the final orchestral on Good Night, I was unable to walk away.  McCartney's bass jumps from the speakers, Ringo's drums are sharp and sound like drums and the vocal harmonies are riveting.  The quiet songs such as Prudence and Julia shine as they never did before. If you are a White Album fan, you'll feel like you're hearing it for the first time.
B000K1P66W|5.0|I was recommended this book when going through rough times; separation of a 13 year relationship. I tried psycologist, healthy activities, and this book was the third element that fulfilled my inner peace to find serenity on the black clouded storm. It helps you undersand the power of our words and understand why people say what they say without letting the bad vibes or black magic as the Toltecs and Don Ruiz refer to it, affect you. It has help me change my perspective in my actions and share with the people that sorround me a better view of life by spreading the love or as the book puts it, the white magic.<br />If you're into finding inner peace and making this world a better place, I recommend reading it.<br />Peace Warrior of many,<br />Pedro.
B002LE8MJ4|5.0|Caught this film yesterday and all I can say is wow. If you like music, guitars or any combination of the two catch this one on the big screen. Then you can easily decide if you need to add this dvd to your music archives. The progression of stories and how they are told is excellent, as well as the music presented. [...]    I came here yesterday after getting home from the matinee to see if there might be a \\"soundtrack\\" available to accompany this movie. There's probably enough material here (Link Wray, Son House etc.) to make a sweet multi-disc collection. It may seem like an odd combination of guitar players, but all three are well represented and there are too many highlights to mention. Seeing these guys playing bottleneck slide guitar together on \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" is worth the price of admission by itself. Seeing this film was a joyful experience for me and my heart does a little happy dance just thinking about it.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Being an Xbox 360 convert, I was used to a certain standard feeling for my triggers. The PS3 original triggers just didn't do it for me, and I needed something with more curvature so I didn't accidentally slip and for that feeling I was used to. These little suckers did exactly what I needed them to do and were extremely easy to attach to the original buttons. Make sure you don't step on your controller when it's on the floor, because they will pop right off and freak you out!!! ...Fortunately they lock right back in, so no sweat!

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I've been a Beatle fan since I heard them at the age of six. Had every LP, Cassette, CD, CD remasters and the MFSL's since then....also since the tender age of six I loved music!!! So growing up in a household of music by my teens I started to learn about audio equipment and it's capabilities. Great speakers and a clean amp/receiver results in great, clean and accurate sound. Having said that, I have a great audio system and a good ear.  I was reluctant to pick this set up ...how can these be better than my MFSL's? Shame on me if I bought this and they were a disaster like the previous \\"Remasters\\".  Reading that it took 4 years to remaster these...hmmm...ok..what the heck somethings got to come out of it!   ... The Beatles Remastered Stereo Box-set are a gem and well worth the wait (as I did not expect this to happen n my lifetime) When I put in the first CD I noticed a difference right away, was not sure what..? Next Cd and so on... after hours of listening, my ears were not fatigued, the harshness of any previous recording.. gone! The sound of these have a new dimension, clarity and sonic beauty which I've never heard before. It's The Beatles re-mastered for real...A great job!!!!!! Highly Recommended!

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I/m usually the last person in a room and the last one to leave, so this review on season one of this HBO show may be sooo yesterday considering season two is almost done and the box DVD set is probably in its infancy (but soon to be released most likely for the summer).   First of all, Charlaine Harris? Never read any of her books. The market being flooded with tomes about the undead (Rice, Hamilton, etc., etc.), I just couldn/t chisel away enough time to catch up of on one of hers (although I did recently acquire the first three novels in a handy three-in-one anthology from Science Fiction Book Club!)  Alas my review will be brief (since many have already seen the series and raved and another rave would just be another drop in the bucket). Praise goes to Alan Ball (the brainchild of another HBO original Six Feet Under) for his take on the south and having the vision to lay on the goth and supernatural extra thick in order to enthrall us with a world resembling ours with all its wonders and imperfections while at the same time never letting us forget that not all monsters have fangs and drink the blood of the living.  By now its no mystery the two leads- Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer- off set are an item. Which probably explains why the screen pops every time those two fill it. Talk about chemistry! Ana/s mind-reading Sookie Stackhouse is tender and painfully vulnerable while Moyer/s Bill Compton provides the dark, brooding undead (who also happens to the only person whose thoughts Sookie can/t read!). With the support of a strong ensemble cast- Tara Thronton (Sookie/s fiery best friend), Sam Trammell (the shape-shifting bar-owner), Ryan Quanten (Sookie/s philandering older brother), Nelsan Ellis (as the hilarious short-order cook), and a host of others, the show draws you into their outrageous lives with all the ease of a child to a sugary treat.   Kudos of course goes to Louisiana for the setting of fictional Bon Temps and its atmosphere rife with seduction and plain ordinary charm. It provides the backdrop for which the stage of this explosive original is set.   In conclusion, only HBO (with the exception of perhaps Showtime) could bring this very adult, hot-blodded, sexy, violent, compelling drama to the small screen (depending what size HD surround sound TV ya/ll may have!). I myself have no cable so I had to wait for the DVD box set (and will most likely wait for the next one as well). Ladies and gentlemen: this is what TV entertainment is all about. Enjoy your True Blood! It/s on the house.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Sid the Elf is here to once again help solve life's difficult dillemas: What is the best thing to watch when you're hanging out with Mr. Collins? It has to be The Beatles Anthology. Most Mr. Collins fans are also Beatles fans and the two go together perfectly. The Anthology combines a ton of music(mostly footage from live shows or studio outtakes that were only heard on the famous Gray Tape)and first person accounts of the band's storied history. One thing that stood out to Sid during the viewing was the perfect pace of the documentary. The show follows a steady routine of a few minutes of interview of one or more of the principals then a song from the time that had just been discussed. It is perfect for the short attention span that accompanies Mr. Collins.<br /><br />Of course, the film was released in 1995, so the current interviews were from Paul, George, Ringo, George Martin, Neil Apinsall, and a few others. However, the old Lennon interview clips they used were excellent as well as always pertinent. Everyone interviewed was always talking about something with which they had direct knowledge, so it is without conjecture like so many other documentaries. It actually gives you what feels like an insight to the amazing journey that was The Beatles.<br /><br />If you are a Beatles fan, or even remotely interested then you should at least give the Anthology a try. If you like The Beatled and Mr. Collins and haven't seen this, wassa matta? It is ridiculously entertaining and interesting. And you get to listen to Beatles tunes. So, on the recomendation of Sid the Elf, put on your gold boots, jump out of the stocking and chase the Anthology and Mr. Collins around the room. But watch out for the couch.

B000002UAX|3.0|I jumped on the band wagon and bought the new digitally enhanced Sgt Peppers and the White Album. Two of my favorite Beatles albums. I have to say that the audio has improved over the original recordings and I have a whole new perspective as it pertains to Ringo's drumming. The drums really come out in these albums which really kick up the songs. Ringo was indeed a class act drummer however, these are the same old very tired Beatles albums that have been played over and over for the last 40 years to the point where I have become tired of hearing them. I have to give the Beatles and Co credit for re-releasing the new enhanced albums with the Rock Band game to maximize sales of both. Pure marketing genius. However, I am not buying anymore because I have the old ones and they are just fine also so I will save a few bucks and stick with those. My review is \\"same old same old\\".
1401207529|3.0|Most Bat-fans will tell you Miller's Year One is one of if not the best Batman story ever told.  I finally got to read it and have to say that while its good, its not anywhere the best.  Batman/Bruce Wayne actually plays second fiddle to Jim Gordon who gets treated the best.  Gordon comes off as how I have always pictured him in my head.  Mazzuchelli's art is very good and much apppreciated over Miller's.  Good but not great stuff!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|this could be the best box set ever released due to the thought and care that went into the wonderful sound and great packaging!the sound is clean and pure the way that the fab four had intended it to sound!i have learned alot about the beatles preference for mono recording through listening to this mono box set.put the white album on and you will understand exactly what im talking about. when back in the ussr starts and you here the lead guitar hit that note and it hits you right in your ears !!!!! and in your heart !!!!!it sounds good enough to bring a tear to your eyes !!!! god bless the beatles and emi for this wonderful listening experience !!!!!

1439157383|1.0|This book was selected by my book club to read for this month. I tried to get through it, for no other reason than I felt obligated to; but I couldn't. The first turn-off was the topic. It's a book about a 13 yr-old girl, Anna, who only exists to be a perpetual medical doner to her cancer ridden older sister, Kate. With Kate going to die soon, whether Anna donates more of herself or not, Anna makes the decision to sue her parents for medical emancipation. She wants to right to refuse to donate anymore of herself. It's a difficult decision, because she loves her sister, who is her best and only friend in life. Anna was conceived and lives only for Kate. She struggles to find her own place in the world, and not lose the people she cares most about. I don't know how it ends, but I assume Kate dies her innevitable death and Anna's family (mom especially) learns to love Anna as her own person, not just as the means to keep her sister alive.   Even though I objected to the story line (strike one) I kept reading. What finally was the last straw was the continual bad language (strike two) and crude/innapropriate comments (strike three). I made it to page 126 and couldn't take anymore. I shut the book and returned it to the person I borrowed it from (thank goodness I didn't purchase it!). I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, and I won't be reading anything else by this author.

B00005N6KG|1.0|Updated Oct 2017:  In case people keep coming back here hoping for a new supply miracle like I am, after much trial and error, I find these to be an acceptable sound replacement AFTER you bend the headband vigorously to disable the vice-like grip it puts on your head and reduce the pressure the buds place in your ears.  Probably will not work on larger heads though as mine are at max position before the stretching.  Hope this helps.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/Koss-KPH14W-Firing-Headphone-White/dp/B00XHRTVOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_sims?ie=UTF8<br /><br />Updated July 2017: while possibly the best ever for the style & price in the past, do not touch at these prices. There is a serious design flaw in the manner which the wires attach to the speakers inside the sealed shell and its only a matter of (limited) time before one or both channels lose the sound. I've bought over 50 over the years and average 3 months exercising 45 minutes a day before breaking. They were disposable at $8-10. A curse on you SONY!<br /><br />As others have pointed out, great sound and wearing convenience.  But best to buy in bulk.  I insist on this style and the sound is superb as compared to other makes of this style but if you are active and get more than 3 months out of them, you are well ahead of the game.  They used to be reasonably priced at stores (well under $10) but now its ridiculously priced everywhere except Amazon.  So if you order or see a great price, grab several and carry a spare when traveling.  A wire will eventually loosen and you will loose a channel.  No idea why this can't be made better so I left off a star, waffling between 3 and 4 due to the hassle.  Yes, its annoying but its something you just have to get over and embrace the great sound & price.

B0007AHQEG|2.0|As many of you know, the BBC released information showing the account to be a fake.<br /><br />If you read the book, you will likely agree.  There are things in the author's account that are hard to digest. Swimming in near freezing water, surviving artic cold without shelter and clothing, the siting of the \\"Yeti\\", and many others.  While reading the account of the men traveling, I could not help but question the \\"democratic\\" way in which they conducted themselves.  For an adult reader, the account of \\"Kristina\\" was unrealistic.  But mostly, the complete lack of any contact with the \\"survivors\\", especially the American \\"Mister Smith\\" left me shaking my head.  Many of his descriptions lack sensory detail as well.<br /><br />I did not know about the BBC's revelations until I had finished the book.  The person who recommended the book wanted to know how I felt about the account before revealing the news reports.  I told her that it was fascinating but that I had strong doubts about the credibilty.  It was then she told me about the BBC's findings.<br /><br />It is fairly well written, and although not a quick page turner, it held my interest moderately.<br /><br />However, if you have read the rebuttals, you will not enjoy the book.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I was very excited when I first saw the remasters on Amazon. The first thing I did was to pre-order what Rolling Stone Magazine ranked the Greatest Album of All Time. It came today.    1. The title track, well, to me it doesn't sound much different than the 87 release. Still a great song, short though it is.    2. It was only with this remaster that I realize how great Paul's bassline on With a Little Help from my Friends is. Ringo's vocals sound great.    3. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds... definitely one of my favorite Beatles' tracks. To me, it sounds like they actually decreased the volume of George's guitar on this track, but I may be mistaken. The vocals in the first verse sound crystal clear, like John is right in the room with you.    4. Getting Better sounds great, much clearer than the 87 release.    5. Wow... Fixing a Hole sounds ten times better. I only just now realize how great a song it is.    6. She's Leaving Home sounds great. It seems like they raised the string volume a bit.    7. The bass on Mr. Kite is brought out a lot, and sounds awesome.     8. Never cared much for George's Sitar songs, especially this one, but it sounds amazingly clear and sharp.     9. When I'm Sixty Four and Lovely Rita both have the bass emphasized a LOT. And it sounds great. I wish they'd have made the piano solo on Rita a bit louder.    10. All I'll say about GMGM is that I wish they'd have made the backing guitar chords louder. Can barely hear them!    11. Reprise is same as first.    12. The whole reason I got this album, my favorite Beatles song, A Day in the Life. It sounds great. I can really hear all of the instruments clearly, especially the acoustic guitar. I have one comment though, it sounds like they lowered Mal Evans' counting... not sure why they would.    Overall, this remaster is definitely worth it, whether you're a casual fan, new to the Beatles, or a die-hard like me.
0553278398|5.0|If memory doesn't fail me, it's the last of the Foundation books written by Asimov himself, and it's one of the links to the other trilogies (that consist in Robot and Empire books). In my opinion, this book is somewhat better than the original Foundation Trilogy books, if nothing more because it is tighter, as long as it was idealized from the beginning as one single volume. The Foundation trilogy was published as short weekly stories, and so it includes A LOT of repetition of the plot's central points, to update (and hook!) the more casual reader.<br />It's a book from the mature Asimov's pen, so it's somewhat less naive (although not that much), and the reading is easier and \\"smoother\\". A nice plot that integrates the Foundation saga with the Robot era, which is lost in the pre-Empire history on Asimov's Universe. Those familiar with the Robot novels will be glad to see again a very beloved character, whom makes this book stand to the high level of the entirety of Asimov's works. Mandatory reading for all those who read and liked the original Foundation books, as are the \\"Foundation and Earth\\" and \\"Forward the Foundation\\", the two other late-written books which complete the Second Trilogy Foundation by the man himself.
B0000024YL|4.0|Simon & Garfunkel helped shape my 1960s teenage years - a crucial time in the development of every human being, when we are propelled toward adulthood - and my early adult life in the 1970s. \\"I Am A Rock\\" became my personal anthem, echoing my own attempts to be strong, although I felt cut off from almost everyone else. \\"But a rock feels no pain, and an island never cries...\\"!<br /><br />\\"The Sound of Silence\\" was my window on the world. It was how I viewed what was going on around me. I whispered my own tortured sentiments into the darkness, wishing that others would awaken to what I saw happening around me. It was the era of the Viet Nam war, and the nation was in a state of unrest. It was the time of hippies and the Black Panthers, of war protestors and illegal drug use.<br /><br />\\"Scarborough Fair/Canticle\\" superimposed my peaceful eastern Kentucky home life onto the world at large, and, again, the Viet Nam war.<br /><br />\\"Homeward Bound\\" took me toward a safer place, although I was at home while listening to the music, and contemplating my world.<br /><br />\\"The Boxer\\" reminded me of the grim realities of trying to make my way in the world as a young adult.<br /><br />\\"The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)\\" added a kick of fun to otherwise dreary thoughts.<br /><br />Later, \\"Bridge Over Trouble Water\\" and \\"El Condor Pasa (If I Could)\\" both provided a bridge to a safer place in life, and they soothed what troubled me.<br /><br />I never cared for \\"Cecilia\\". \\"Mrs. Robinson\\", although a catchy tune, I rejected because of the movie to which it was tied. The other songs I barely listened to, but I did like \\"America\\" some, and \\"Bookends\\" a bit.<br /><br />The applause was something for which I did not care. I get into the music and the lyrics, and they transport me to an inward place of meditation and introspection. The applause tends to ruin that effect! It jars me back into reality!<br /><br />All in all, this is an important collection of songs that actually helped shape my thinking, and my life, as I grew into adulthood. I recommend it for those who think deeply, as well as those who love poetic lyrics in their music.commend it for those who think deeply, as well as those who love poetic lyrics in their music.
B0001I561E|4.0|The movie is a great Disney classic. However, the disc skips in a few parts which makes me question whether it is an original.
B00133KFGW|5.0|After this movie, I felt alive, inspired and just wanted to bask in the joyous belief that everything works out perfectly in the end. Sure we each have our own trials and experiences in life, but if we choose, we can learn and grow from these experiences, which is ultimately why we're experiencing them in the first place, and in the end, All is well.  The Universe, God, Source speaks to all, plays beautiful music for all, it's up to us to listen, and when we do, Life gets that much sweeter.    I LOVE this movie and the ideas and hope that it portrays.
B00142X56Y|3.0|Let nothing I say here imply that this is less than a first-class production of Zauberfl&ouml;te, and it's not a bad way to start one's collection of operas on Blu-ray. The singers are all at least good, if not uniformly great. The following singers are excellent: Simon Keenlyside (Papageno) with a voice that is expressive, well-managed, and handsome in every way, not to mention that his acting is a thorough delight; Diana Damrau  (Queen of the Night), manic and technically and dramatically brilliant; and Dorothea R&ouml;schmann (Pamina) with creamy tone and perfect technique. This is not a girlish princess, which is to say that the role is often sung with a lighter voice; but I cannot complain about a voice as luxuriant as this. Sometimes Tamino and Pamina are presented as characters just barely out of their teens, which can suit the freshness and innocence implied by their roles; however, this thirtyish-looking couple works fine, too, especially as it allows us to experience fuller voices. R&ouml;schmann probably looks rather young from seats in the theater, but the Blu-ray close-ups aren't very flattering. The Three Ladies are also among the most excellent singers in this performance. Choral work is very good, as would be expected in Britain.<br /><br />This performance falls short of the best in several respects. The first weakness I observed was during the overture, which failed to build much excitement or sense of anticipation for this evening of magic & music. I have never wholly understood why Colin Davis is held in such high regard as a Mozart & Haydn conductor (his reputation as a Berlioz interpreter is better deserved in my opinion). \\"Fortune favors the bold\\" is a line in the libretto, which should have been heeded by Davis, who fails to ask much of the orchestra and doesn't get any more than asks for. Everything is elegant, safe, and in its place; and only rarely do things sound stodgy; but there is neither fire nor anything else particularly revelatory or affecting.<br /><br />The sets and costumes are just OK; they do not detract (as in the stark & cartoonish Met production premiered in 2006); but they don't add much either, except for those worn by the Queen of the Night and Sarastro.<br /><br />Will Hartmann is not especially well cast as Tamino--it would be nice if he looked more youthful; however, in the world of operatic tenors, one could do a lot worse; and I am being especially picky here, but I must say that his intonation falls a touch short of the ideal in that it is not 100% secure, and he often lands a bit sharp on upward leaps.<br /><br />Franz-Josef Selig is convincing as Sarastro and has a voice that is rich throughout its range but especially impressive in the lower registers. At the risk of undermining my own credibility, I have to admit that I do not like the work of operatic basses very much; their bellowing is often wobbly & pitch-inaccurate. Once in a great while one runs across a bass who is fully in command of his instrument, but this is not one of those times. So that I don't malign all of bassdom, I'll mention that John Relyea and Bryn Terfel are excellent positive examples; unfortunately, both are bass-baritones rather than bassi profundi; and I have to admit that Selig's heft on the low notes is perfect for Sarastro.<br /><br />Adrian Thompson is suitably snarly & nasty as Monostatos. I have heard the role sung much more pleasantly by others, more for its musical beauty than dramatic character; here, however, Thompson trades prettiness for loathsomeness. Of course by that reasoning, a Papageno should have been chosen with more vulnerability in his voice, rather than the strength we get from Keenlyside. All things considered, if I had to be absolutely consistent, I'd say go with Keenlyside's musicality rather than Thompson's theatricality; but I am not upset to have both approaches in the same opera. The inconsistency in casting philosophy may, however, help to account for the lack of asense of unity in this performance; there is little chemistry among the cast.<br /><br />Even though the Popageno-Papagena romance is nominally a side show next to the serious subject of \\"rescuing\\" Pamina, the former is the emotional center of the opera for me. The duet that starts off silly with the repetition of Popageno's and Papagena's names but then makes a turn into one of the most rapturous climaxes in all music. Productions can make a big deal of it or not and be dramatically true; but a great opportunity is lost if it is not played to the hilt, which, to change metaphors, means that the music has to be milked for all its considerable worth. It has to be allowed to breathe and reach its climax at full force with no rushing or glibness. This performance doesn't reach the height of the very best; but neither does it trivialize, even though the scene is played mostly for its comic value; and Keenlyside's & Ailish Tynan's rich voices provide an abundance of beauty and substance.<br /><br />To sum up, this is an expert performance, with many fine moments, that runs just a bit too much like clockwork. One of the reviews of the standard DVD version of this production gets it right: \\"Flute, yes. Magic, no.\\" Also among the reviews of the standard DVD, there is as of this writing a very accurate assessment of this production, which gives it two stars and is titled \\"Disappointing,\\" Although I rate the disc a little more highly, I find myself almost completely in agreement with the detailed assessment there, one exception being that, as noted above, I thought the chorus was rather good. When looking at reviews of a Blu-ray disc, for which there is only a small sample of opinion, it behooves one to look at the more plentiful reviews available for the standard-DVD issue.<br /><br />Finally, speaking of Blu-ray, this disc is technically fine, in 5.1 PCM audio, which is to say no matrixing or compression--each channel has at least the full quality of a CD.

0440178002|5.0|A good read.  Had never gotten around to it.  Now I'm \\"round to it\\"!
1400063515|5.0|This book was a real thrill for me...with perhaps as much influence on my thinking as when I read Atlas Shrugged in my twenties. For a fifty-five year old curmugeon, that's saying something, isn't it? First of all, I've read the one-star reviews and I agree, Dr. Taleb is very self-absorbed. So what? Up front, he admits that his book is part memoir. If you want a dry economic treatise, there are plenty of other books to read. Go read Samuelson and Nordhaus again. Who's stopping you?<br />I was entertained by Dr. Taleb's flights of fancy, but that's not what hit me upside the head. For my whole career, I've resisted detailed planning and forecasting, and now I know why. I don't live in Mediocristan and I don't want to live there. I thought there was some missing piece to my intellect or that I am simply lazy. But, I hate the nonsense of forecasting. Passionately. I always felt it was better to go into a project with open eyes and be ready for things to go wrong or right and take advantage of the opportunites. I think I understand a lot of my success in life. I prepare, work hard and roll with the punches. If you're happy in a cubicle playing with numbers in a spreadsheet and prefer to think of the world as linear and Gaussian, then that's great. You'll hate this book and you can add to the many bad reviews. You'll be in good company. Baaaa.<br /><br />Ken Coffman is the author of Hartz String Theory and other novels.
0439023491|5.0|I am motivated to write a review for Catching Fire though i rarely feel compelled to do so. I read a lot of books in a year. Probably about 250 to 300 of them and, although I read other costumer reviews, my own reaction is usually not strong enough to compel me to write my own. NOT THIS TIME! I have to speak up for this book for the sole reason that it made such an overwhelming impression on me. There is no need for me to rehash the events in the book so I will just provide my opinion.<br />I am a rational person and do not often become emotionally involved to a great extent. If I invested to much in fictional character's lives I would have quite a roller-coaster to deal with. I shed tears more than once during this book. The book is not overly poignant and not particularly sentimental in comparison to other books in their treatment of the horrors that the characters face but it is so well written that you are none the less sucked into an empathetic perspective that lasts throughout the book. The subject matter that is addressed in Hunger Games and Catching Fire is nothing new but the writing is so high caliber that it reinvigorates the dystopian landscape. I have asked myself, despite the excellent writing, why i was so affected. I have to admit that the themes have always been appealing to me but, even so, my response is out of character. The only answer I have is that I recognize the potential it has to reach out and possibly cut through the somnabulistic state that we as a culture find ourselves in and..... I found it in the young adult section!!! I hope that every teenager reads this book because 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and Brave New World just won't have the same impact with them as this book will. Collin's writing style and pacing keep your attention to the end. I didn't think it would be possible to write a second book that had the same gripping suspense as the first but she did it and in doing so may be able to make a small dent in the apathy of teen life and the minds of jaded adults.<br />Bravo to you Ms. Collins!the minds of jaded adults.<br />Bravo to you Ms. Collins!
1591391105|3.0|I had just started a new job when I got this book and although it had already been 90 days I figured this was still quite a bit I could learn. There's some good material in there but I found the writing to be rather dry and academic. Although there's a little story/case that starts every chapter it would be good if there were real word illustrations and examples of the concepts throughout. I found that the book focused a lot on \\"what\\" a leader should do but not enough on \\"how\\" to do it. Obviously knowing what to do is important but sometimes it's pretty obvious and what differentiates a successful leader from the others is how they do it.    When I was in business school and we worked on case studies we spent 90% of our effort writing up our analysis and recommendations and then there was a tiny little write-up on how to actually implement the plan. When I re-joined the real world I realized that it should have been the other way around. This book didn't really add insight into the \\"how.\\"    One other comment that I think may benefit other potential readers (and I have seen this mentioned in other reviews): much of the material seems to be aimed at very senior management (think Presidents, VPs, CEOs etc) in traditional industries.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|The problem with these \\"REMASTERED\\" releases is that they (EMI, I guess) made the mistake of releasing Yellow Submarine Songtrack, Let It Be... Naked, and LOVE before.  Because those three albums let you hear what can be done with new \\"REMIXES\\".  The Anthologies sound better than these \\"new\\" edition also. Is it an improvement to the 1987 edition? yes. It sounds a little bit better, but way short for the quality of the remixes done on the three mentioned albums.    If you listen to Hey Jude on Past Masters and then in the LOVE album you will know what I'm talking about.    The The Who albums were all remixed, respecting the volumes of the original mix and the essence of the albums, in 1996!!! and they all sound much better than the original releases in CD.    Genesis just remixed all their catalog and included DVD DTS 96/24 5.1 versions with all the albums (plus videos of concerts and tons of extras), that is what we are missing.  I don't have the LOVE DVD-Audio, but I am planning of buying a copy to make me feel better after this tragedy.    Five stars for the quality of the music (is The Beatles), five stars for the presentation (Packing/Art), minus fifty stars for not doing what could and should be done with the audio.
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|Wow, what an interesting array of comments on this film.  I actually quite liked it and did not see the FOREST GUMP comparison at all (other than the Hollywood sheen to the style and look of the filmmaking).  Brad Pitt, an outstanding actor in my book, did a wonderful job with a challenging role.  Cate Blanchett was not up to her usual standards, but also was not nearly as awful as some reviewers suggest.  And the film itself was by no means \\"boring.\\"  Americans often expect films to be packed with non-stop action and lots of loud sound effects, otherwise they get bored to death.  This was a very subtle examination of our concept and fear of aging and the impact it has on our relationships and motivations in life.  It was also a very nice statement about the enduring nature of love, even though common sense sometimes tells us that the love we feel is impossible to nurture and cannot endure.  Boring indeed!  Maybe those of you who found is so boring should stick to formulaic action films - they're probably more up your alley.
1563899426|3.0|When I first opened this book (just to check it out) I didn't even make it past the first six pages, I found the basic concept was idiotic and frankly not that original. It was only after reading one of the later volumes ('Storybook Love' I think?) that I went back and read it through.    What we have here is quite simply a murder mystery with well known characters from Fairy Tales and Folklore filling the required roles: The Big Bad Wolf is the gruff detective, Rose Red is the Murder Vicitm and her sister Snow White is the distraught hanger on, Prince Charming, Bluebeard, Jack Horner etc fill in the cast as a multitude of suspects and other required roles.     The story is set in New York City in a Clandestine little society called Fable Town where the aforementioned fairy tale characters live in secret from the mundane world having been exiled from their own storybook homeworlds by a mysterious figure known only as the Adversary.    All this proves quite complicated but strangely not all that engaging. The mystery itself isn't that interesting or plotted very well and ultimatly serves as a frame for the real purpose of this story, to set up the characters and the setting elaborated and built on in later volumes all quite honestly much more interesting than this one.    Now as this is supposed to be a positive review I'll stop myself there and give a few props to the things I liked:    The Art: This is a comic book after all and the drawing is very well done, though a bit to detailed and realistic for a story dealing so much in the fantastical(can't help myself, I'm ashamed.)    The Characters: As stated these guys are going to have to endure and carry many more stories beyond this, particualy Bigby Wolf and Snow White and most are very interesting each owing a little to their resective fairy tale or rhyme but still being modern and unique interpretaions (A couple of my favourites only get a brief apperance in this story, Frau Totenkinder and Pinocchio)    All in all the concept proves a much richer and involving one than I originally gave credit and could easily have been overlooked in this first volume, others may disagree however and find this a cracking read but if not I only implore you to bear with it for the time being as it gets much better later on.             Every story has to begin somewhere I suppose...
B0025KVLVA|2.0|So, I should begin by saying that my interest lies in the \\"remastered\\" part of the Past Masters collection. As a die hard Beatles fan since I saw them on Ed Sullivan as a kid, it goes without saying that this is a great collection, full of wonderful songs, a must-have for Beatles afficianados, etc, etc.    But does it SOUND significantly better than the equivalent CDs released about 20 years ago, now?    In my opinion: a little, but not much.  On many of the songs in this collection, I'm hard pressed to tell the difference. Okay, maybe I can tell the difference, but this new release does not jump out at me as sounding significantly better than the original.    For me, the benchmark for Beatles remastering is the 1999 Beatles Yellow Submarine Songbook.  Those remastered songs sound almost like different recordings. They're fantastic! They reach out of the speakers and grab you by the ears. So, I was very encouraged to see that the roster of engineers and producers who tackled that project has a lot of names in common with the team who took on this new re-mastering of the entire catalogue.    If they had pulled off a repeat performance, I was prepared to buy the whole Beatles catalogue all over again, just as I did when I replaced my original vinyl collection.     Alas, the results are pretty pale compared to the Yellow Submarine songbook collection. I don't know why. I suspect it has something to do with the way in which the original recordings were dismantled. Released simultaneously with the 1999 Songbook CD was a re-mastered DVD of the Yellow Submarine movie, which had a 5.1 soundtrack. If you don't have that Soundtrack CD, pick it up. It's stunning!    Sadly, I won't be buying any more of these re-mastered Beatles CDs--at least not if the Past Masters collection is any indication of the overall sound quality for the rest of their song collection. To my ears, it just doesn't sound that much better.    What a disappointment.
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|I don't find this remaster to be as good the previous cds and is sadly, a waste of money.   Like many modern remasters, the first thing you notice is how LOUD it is and how bass heavy it is. Its in the nature of hearing that the same thing louder sounds \\"better\\". Matching the volume of the old cd to the new, the compromises made to get that \\"loudness\\" are revealed.eg-Listen to Maxwell's Silver hammer: Paul's singing sounds like a generic BBC announcer, loosing its depth and character, Sometimes as his singing rises and falls, the non-linear amping  comes in and makes it sound almost like his voice is cracking.Ringo's cymbals are clipped into little zit-zit sounds.The bass is to prominent and almost like it was overdubbed somewhere else-its no longer an intergral part of the whole. Overall, it sounds as though they rerecorded it in a heavily draped room-it lacks the the vibrancy and resonance of the original.     To be fair there are many more heavy handed remasters out there and the engineer probably restrained as much as the fudicary intrests allowed..     Many casual listeners may find the remaster acceptable ,even \\"better\\",but some of the depth has been scrubbed away ,a loss...           [...]
B00122FYMO|5.0|At first i was alittle nervous to listen to this album, after listening to like a virgin. I wasn't a fan of her second album. It sounded to girly, outdated, and cheesy.  In fact, I didn't even realize she had released a first successful album until watching an MTV show. ANyways,i decided to listen to this after cutting the grass.  This is truly dance pop at its simplest and best. And I can see why people say that this is the format for all teen pop princesses to run by. Alot of the songs on here are all classic, and everybody almost knows them lyric by lyric. Borderline, Lucky Star, Holiday, I did find that some of her other tracks tended to be a bit more new wave like Burnin Up, Physical attraction. And to me this is def. a different more simple version of Madonna. I really enjoyed this album. I think it's the 2nd best she did in the 80's behind true blue. I think the song that stands out the most has to be Borderline, I just like the little cheesy grove. True, the fashion and sounds may be outdated. But to me this stands up with Michael Jackson's Thriller.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|Just an outstanding piece of Video History!  This set completes the original movie with a wonderful look back at everything that happened. All the timeless Music that still rocks, all the amazing footage of what surrounded the event as it happened and even all the mistakes and improvising that went into making a once in a life time event take place. It's all in here. If you were there you must have it, if you weren't there then you need it to see what you missed!!
B0025KVLTW|5.0|I bought the individual CD of Magical Mystery Tour and not the box set.  However, on the actual CD label there's an error that says \\"LET IT BE MINI-DOCUMENTARY\\" and not \\"MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR MINI-DOCUMENTARY\\".  If you play the documentary on your computer it is indeed the Magical Mystery Tour one FYI.  Just wrote this review for Beatle collectors as Apple/Capitol will probably fix in future pressings.  The remastering is great.  John Lennon's favourite Beatles LP.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Three great films that are fantastic for pushing your home cinema to its limits! The bonus features are pretty good as well, really interesting documentary on the philosophy behind the matrix.    All in all, very pleased! Blu-rays good, import duty bad!
0375413405|5.0|Julia Child is a superb chef.  We worked together for a while many years ago in New York. I loved the picture...which is what inspired me to purchase the book.  My son is learning to be a chef as we speak.  He menu's and how to do it are terrific. Although I personally am more favorable to Italian cuisine than French...Julia's narrative might make me change my mind. Most excellent and worth every penny of it.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I'll echo the sentiments of many about the quality here (and assume that virtually all are intimately familiar with the Beatles already) - this box set truly does the music justice - stellar packaging, sound that is nicely defined (deeper bass, overall crisp yet warmer sound than the 1987 CD's) and has a presence that will make you pay attention to stuff you've no doubt already heard hundreds of times before, like you're hearing it fresh for the first time.  I haven't watched the DVD shorts yet as i'm too busy 're-discovering' and re-absorbing each album, one by one.  I plan to savor this box over several days of listening.  No regrets about this purchase (as if there's any chance there would've been?) - it's a must have for any Beatles fan.
0375413405|5.0|I can only say one word \\"excellent\\".  I have enjoyed preparing meals with my girlfriend of delightful dishes found in this cookbook.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|My very first record was the 45 of \\"Hello Goodbye,\\" and I've enjoyed listening to The Beatles ever since. Naturally, when the box arrived the morning of 9/9/09 (thanks, Amazon), the first song I listened to was \\"Hello Goodbye.\\" But who knew that there was a harmonizing voice right behind Paul?<br /><br />That was the beginning of a rediscovery process that will continue over the coming days as I play these albums for the first time. The White Album has harmonies and delicate layering of instrumentation without any of the shrill sensory overload that was present on earlier CD versions. And with my old LPs worn out, it's not even worth attempting to compare them.<br /><br />The question you're asking is, \\"I have this music already. Is it worth over $150 to buy it again?\\" And the answer is straight forward: You don't have this music already. You have only half of it, and the half you have sounds muddy with indistinct lyric, miserable dynamic range, and unsound instrumentation (in comparison, of course).<br /><br />The only remaining question is, \\"What do I do with my original Beatles CD's?\\" Coasters, anyone?
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Great quality and well worth the price.  I bought this for a friend of mine who has been dying to see Beauty and the Beast and she loves it.  Great edition to bring out of the vault!
B00127RAJY|5.0|-Wow!! This DVD is awesome. I consider myself very athletic -played sports all thru High School and College; I run on average 20-25 miles a week, go to spinning class twice a week and do weight training. I tried this workout for the first time today because I sprained my ankle last week and I have to say I am sore (but only my upperbody)! I did the first level and some moves in the second level with 5lb weights. I thought I could waltz through both levels, but I highly recommend you stick with level one first till you feel it has become easy for you.    I plan on canceling my gym membership and combining the dvd with my running, and cycling regimine. I think her DVD would be more effective for maintaining body tone then any machine at the gym and it saves time! Then I plan on switching to P90X OR Beachbodys' Insanity once I get more upper body strength.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|So I purchased both sets, stereo and mono.  In my honest opinion, I prefer the sound quality of the stereo set to the mono set by a huge margin.  To my sensitive ears, listening side by side (so to speak) through a good preamp and good cans between the new stereo box set, the new mono box set and the previous 1987 releases, IMO the mono set sounds only marginally better than the previous 1987 cds... you really have to listen carefully for the subtle differences.  There is a better low end there for sure, but the difference is not night and day.  The stereo set is the real standout. It sounds amazingly clean, clear and warm with clarity, definition, depth and details not present in the 1987 releases.  In most respects, it sounds better than recordings of music done with the most modern equipment rather than these which were recorded up to 46 years ago! (can you believe that?)... seriously.  You will not believe it until you strap the cans on and hear this for yourself!<br /><br />Yes, the simple panned stereo versions of \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With the Beatles\\" and some of the later albums take some getting used to (especially with headphones).  But they don't have to.  I decided to conduct an experiment to see what I thought sounded better - the mono versions just as they are or the stereo versions combined into mono and then more balanced stereo mixes.  Intrigued?  Read on.<br /><br />What I did was rip the stereo versions of \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With the Beatles\\" to WAV files.  I loaded those rips into SoundForge (which is a commercial audio editing program) but you can likely use a free program like Audacity instead (which is available via audacity dot sourceforge dot net).  I combined the left and right channels into a single mono channel at an average of 62%, checked that no peaks were clipped on each track and saved the resulting mono WAV files. (at this point, you could encode them into whatever format you like such as MP3 or FLAC or whatever).<br /><br />In my honest opinion, the results of my self-made stereo-to-mono tracks were easily as good as what the audio sounds like straight from the mono set for the first two albums I tried this on, Please Please Me and With the Beatles.  The punch of the original mono set was all there, but it lacked the depth of the stereo.<br /><br />So instead of going completely mono, I also tried to balance the panned stereo effect, but keep the tracks with some separation.  In SoundForge, I combined the stereo channels at 62% left and 50% right for left channel and 50% left and 62% right for the right channel.  The results are still stereo, but a more natural sounding mix than the highly panned original.  To me, it sounds better than the mono.  You may not agree, but for me this was the best solution for having the best possible sound quality and depth (from the stereo set) and yet not have the distracting issue of the especially primitively panned unbalanced stereo present on those albums (and some tracks on later ones as well).  I will likely revisit this procedure and experiment with different percentage ratios as my time permits.<br /><br />With A Hard Day's Night and Beatles for Sale, I find the stereo versions better than the mono without having to make them mono or combine the channels to balance the stereo as I described above.  Even though the instruments may be panned they are not nearly as unbalanced as they are on the first two albums and most importantly, the vocals are perfectly centered - and to me, that makes all the difference in the world.<br /><br />Tracks on Help!, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Pepper, The Magical Mystery Tour and the White Album sound just great in stereo but some tracks do suffer from a heavier panned effect than others.  I will likely try combining stereo channels on some tracks from these albums as I previously described above and see how I like the results.<br /><br />Abbey Road sounds just amazing in it's stereo version!  No issues with that.<br /><br />I haven't listened to Yellow Submarine, Let It Be or the Past Masters yet, so I cannot comment on these yet.<br /><br />Overall, so far I found the sound quality of the set to be clear, rich and exceptional.  The difference in audio quality between this set and the 1987 releases is astonishing.  You will hear things that just were not there before.  I know it's clich&eacute; and that others have said it in their reviews, but it's true!... It's like hearing the fab four for the first time all over again!  A good analogy would be that it's as if they peeled the thin plastic protective layer from the screen of a new phone to reveal the pristine, shiny glass beneath.  That's what these discs sound like compared with the 1987 releases.<br /><br />Honestly, this whole mono vs. stereo thing could have been avoided by combining them into one set.  It's not like it would have cost them significantly extra to do that and it would have satisfied just about everyone with one set.  I'm giving the set five stars, but I would give it 4.5 stars if I could just because of the unnecessary dual release that could have easily been avoided.  And yes, it would be nice to have this on SACD or DVD audio.  And yes, full, balanced stereo remixes would have been even better IMO.  Still, I am VERY VERY VERY happy and massively impressed with the sound of these discs.  There is simply no way I can explain how much better these sound over the 1987 counterparts.  If you have decent equipment and decent hearing, it is likely that you'll instantly love them.<br /><br />So I can't help but recommend the stereo set for all except the purists who would balk at what I suggested for the sake of the history of the mixes, etc.  IMO, if you want the best possible audio quality and depth, go for the stereo set.  Optionally, and if you have the ability, try making your own mono or balanced mixes for the first two cds (and possibly some tracks on others).  Whatever your choice or preference, Happy Listening!Be or the Past Masters yet, so I cannot comment on these yet.

0793518326|4.0|I'm a guitar player and I think this book is worth every penny of the $50.00. There are, however, problems. Tab should always reflect the chords relative to the capo. I don't have the book with me as I write this, but I believe that the tab for Norwegian Wood, as written, is unplayable--until you realize that it should be played in the \\"D\\" position with a capo. I dabble with the piano and I find Let It Be, Hey Jude, and For No One to be just fine for my meager talents. However, Lady Madonna is pretty bad. I would like to see a version of this book with just guitar, bass, lyrics, and piano. Most of us are not looking for exact transcription of the orchestral and drum stuff and--if other reviewers are correct--the scores are inadequate anyway. And do we really need a \\"transcription\\" of Revloution #9? That is just silly and a waste of paper.  Some of the reviewers who gave this book a one-star review are being pedantic and over-reacting. It really is a fun book to own, and, all in all pretty accurate for guitar. My advice would be for the authors to go back and edit the book for errors and release a volume with just guitar, bass, piano, and lyrics. Perhaps release it in volumes with spiral bindings for ease of use.This would cover what most of us are after and it would solve the problem with the small font.  I, myself, would be willing to buy copies of the edited versions even though I already own the full transcriptions.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love and hated this workout DVD. Jillian kicked my butt the first two weeks but got hooked so I bought her other two DVDs, Burn Fat Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones. I used 30-Day Shred first for two weeks alternating between Level 1 and 2. They were hard for me to do at first. Then I added Level 3 and Burn Fat Boost Metabolism. I work out 5x/week using these two DVDs and consume a net of 1200 calories a day. I will add No More Trouble Zones to my workout routine in about 2 weeks.    I lost 5 lbs in a month and a half. My starting weight was 120 lbs at 5'1. Also, note that I sit and study pretty much all day so I think other people can lose more weight than I did in the same amount of time. I would definitely recommend this DVD.
B000002OMN|5.0|It's not often that we regress into our former selves. Sometimes you need a reminder of where you've been to relate to where you are now. The lyrics of this album created a mental time warp. With tracks like \\"Wasted Youth\\" and \\"Rock ans Roll Dreams Come Thru\\" as another song states \\"It's all coming back to me now\\". Meat Loaf, after a 20 year gap, still has the power with the stong Steinman lyrics to touch a nerve that is now a fond memory, versus the reality of when I owned this on cassette and played it 'til the tape shot out of the dashboard. Great album! Stands up to the test of time with its operatic scope. I recommend it to anyone who is \\"just another case of arrested development, another case of wasted youth\\". It takes me back so I can move ahead...\\"wasted youth IS better by far,than as wise and constructive old age\\". Enjoy!

B00003CXXS|4.0|This movie is the best one out of the 3 Jurassic Park movies made.  The movie is fast paced and very entertaining.  My two boys, ages 3 and 7, love it and watch it over and over.  It has a bit of everything: raptors, pterdactyls, T-rex, and a surprise huge addition.  You can't go wrong with Sam Neill and William H. Macy either.  I just wish the scene with the T-rex lasted longer.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|The variety of voices and instruments make the classic songs new again. The DVD is a visual treat. The performers and settings are fresh, honest, and unpretentious. The quality of the music excellent. This is a DVD to be watched over and over again - you will always find something new in the background. The fact that it's for a good cause is just icing on the cake!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|When I heard that this series was being added to the Star Trek universe, I was thrilled -- \\"Oh, boy!\\" I thought, \\"It's going to be exciting to have a back story to TOS!\\"<br /><br />I sat down and watched it.  Got the idea that the producers were trying to take first achievements away from Kirk, but, okay.  I could live with some of that, although when they introduced the time war I found it a little hard to swallow.  Then came the third season -- the Zindi season.  Over half of it was devoted to preventing Earth from being destroyed.  BORRRRRINNNNGGG!  Where were the stories of exploration?  The new species to meet?  The friendly, gentle captain that I had grown to like?  Suddenly, Archer's personality changed, people that I liked died (unnecessarily if it wasn't for the Zindi).  I got tired of the of the long-winded Zindi story line -- and that, plus, what I thought were Berman, et al.'s desire to change the rules precedences that had begun in the original series (and, to a certain degree it was since it was based on Michael Okuda's rewrite of Star Trek history, which seems to ignore TOS), and I stopped watching it. I never saw the last season. Too bad for me and the rest of the viewers who gave up.<br /><br />Well, it was on SyFy now for about two plus go-rounds, and still shows up occasionally.  I've watched the entire series twice and a little more, and since I can't work and have lots of time to fill -- I became a junkie and watched 3 episodes a day (and no one come to the conclusion that I'm a bit balmy -- that's a given).<br /><br />And, I have found out that there weren't any changes that took away from the start of the TOS, etc. cycle, but set some things up -- explained why Klingons looked different on TOS and in the movies and later; other things that I can't remember right now to list.<br /><br />In short, I've come to love it. I'm still not too happy about the Zindi thing and the temporal time war, but I have found that it does serve as a wonderful prelude to the rest of the Star Trek universe.  Now, of course, Scott Bakula is a big part of my love for it, but the other regulars came into the series fully-fleshed out and grew as the series continued.  The stories, for the most part, are well-told and leave me with a feeling that I've not wasted my time watching it.<br /><br />If you can, watch a few episodes.  Then, turn around, save your money, and buy the series.  My copy lives right next door to my collections of the first 2-episode at a time release ($1,400 worth) as well as the Blu-ray version that is coming out) of TOS.<br /><br />I will always, first and foremost, love TOS the best -- I was 15 when it came out, and it gave me a great many aspirations.  But Enterprise has become my second favorite.ude to the rest of the Star Trek universe.

B001AEF6IQ|5.0|First of all, I have to say that one of the reasons I love this series is Captain Jack.  And I don't care whether John Barrowman is gay -- he's a hell of a hunk. And love is more important to Jack than sex (although, in the second episode, we find out that he'll bonk anything that moves).  For anyone who doesn't know it, this series is a spin-off the the newest Dr. Who series.<br /><br />But, there are other things, too.  The fact the series (1) isn't set in space; (2) not set in a big city (Cardiff is about the same size as the city I live in) and (3) Barrowman and his co-stars make the stories feel real.<br /><br />The characters live and die.  They have real lives that we learn about, which makes us understand them more fully.  There is laughter, loss, powerful stories and stories that can keep you on the edge of your seat (even if it is an uncomfortable way to watch anyone).<br /><br />I am furious that the series has been cancelled because I wanted it to go on for a long time, even though Jack find a gray hair.  If you have not seen the series, hit that purchase button fast. [[ASIN:B0013GS3WW Torchwood - The Complete Second Season]]

B000F1IQNM|5.0|After watching the movie, Nanny PcPhee on TV and being thoroughly delighted with it, I went to the computer and ordered the DVD from Amazon and had it shipped to my four year old great granddaughter.   Her dad e-mailed to tell me that the family had just watched it and were also delighted!   It is a visual feast;  outrageously colorful,  beyond adorable baby scenes, surprising physical changes in a few of the characters throughout the course of events....and an exquisitely beautiful finale.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|I've been listening to the Beatles since I was old enough to know what music was. My older sister was, and is, a huge Beatles fan and bought every album and single that was released here in the U.S.. I can remember as a small child, my sister and I getting ready for school listening to the Beatles blasting on our RCA TV console record player. The stereo my mother had won on the TV game show Let's Make A Deal. The school day mornings were ours, our parents were off at work already, so we were free to escape into the world the Beatles had created. Later on when my sister had her own record player, don't tell her, when she was away I would sneak into her room and listen on headphones to her prized collection. I became very intimate with all of the songs the fab four shared with me. Their music so inspired me that I became a singer, songwriter, producer etc.. Thank God for the Beatles' music. Cut to 1987 when with great anticipation the Beatles finally released their music on CD after many years of legal wrangling. As has been stated before, they didn't live up to the sonics I had remembered. Gone were the clicks and pops, but so was the magic and excitement I so cherished. They sounded very flat, mushy and overly compressed. It was still the same songs but as heard through a filter. Now in this glorious age of technology and even more compressed volume wars of the digital era, they have been finally res erected. Everyone, including me, who cared about the great legacy that is the Beatles were skeptical. Would the powers that be try and please the masses that are used to overly hyped, compressed, CDs and MP3s? Or would they treat them as the musical historical documents that they are? Well worry no more! The remastered Beatles albums are a revelation!<br />I can honestly say I am very impressed. To my ears, these sound much better than I have ever heard these songs. As I have read from others, I have heard things in these recordings that I have never heard before after intently listening to these songs ever since their original release. The clarity is startling in it's honesty. Most musicians would be horrified to hear their vocals and playing with such a microscope after being used to having things so meshed together by the past mediums' masters. These aren't your ordinary musicians as the world knows. It is jarring at first to hear these recordings that we have loved for so long. They sound like the same songs but so clear that they sound different. The first thing you notice is that you can now hear the bass and drums with much more clarity and authority. Next I noticed the vocals of such amazing resolution that you can really hear their spit and snarl. I can go on, but you are wasting time reading my ramblings.

0805079831|2.0|There are many good or even great books that cover the neoliberal period from moderately left-wing perspectives, such as those by Andrew Glyn, Joseph Stiglitz, Robert Pollin, Alice Amsden, and Ha-Joon Chang among others. Is this one of such books? No.<br /><br />The only good aspects of this book are some interesting historical facts about the dark side of the American foreign policy (e.g. coups in Iran in 1953 and Chile in 1973) and useful descriptions of neoliberal reforms. Unfortunately, it all turns into a massive hysterical rant as bad as those of Milton Friedman.<br /><br />Klein's research is often very sloppy. According to her, \\"Austrians\\" are a grouping within the Chicago School, she does not differentiate between Frank Knight's first Chicago School and Friedman's second Chicago School, and keeps perpetuating the myth that Adam Smith was a proto-Friedmanite. Poor Dani Rodrik, a progressive in the neoclassical mainstream and a critic of the Washington Consensus, is slandered as some devious rogue of the \\"neoliberal tribe\\". Neoliberals and neoconservatives are supposedly the same thing. These are just details, of course, but her reasoning is even worse. I almost put the book down for good when I reached the part where Thatcher succeeds in crushing unions solely because of a manufactured war. Whatever happened to union militancy which brought down Callaghan's government and discredited Labour and moderate \\"One Nation Tories\\"?<br /><br />I would not be so mad if I actually opposed a more generous social safety net, universal healthcare, or stronger financial regulation. In that case I would be glad that left-wing \\"intellectuals\\" are such easy targets. But as it is, I can only recommend people with center-left sympathies to ignore this and pick up some book by one of the aforementioned authors. Glyn's \\"Capitalism Unleashed\\" and Pollin's \\"Contours of Descent\\" are great sources on the economic performance of the neoliberal period. Chang's \\"Bad Samaritans\\" and Amsden's \\"Escape from Empire\\" cover developmentalism well. Stigliz is great, plain and simple. Do not waste your time with Klein.\\" cover developmentalism well.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|I am absolutely ECSTATIC to see HBO's nonpareil series \\"Rome\\" scheduled for release on Blu-Ray!  This is one of the four essential Blu-Ray series releases that will ensure that the great unwashed public will FINALLY invest in Blu-Ray players.  We still await two of these seemingly made-for-Blu-Ray series -- we are still patiently waiting for Indiana Jones and Star Wars, but at least the Harry Potter series is being released in a timely (and most entertaining) fashion.  And Rome is the fourth.    If any of you who actually have working brains have not yet seen Rome, I suggest that you do so forthwith.  It is, to state it quite bluntly and unequivocally, the very best television show ever made by anyone throughout the entire history of the medium.  Indeed, if you use a scale of zero-to-ten, and you give Rome a ten, the second-best television show ever produced will score no better than a six.    It excels on all levels.  The part that pertains to historical events is factual and illuminating.  The parts that are historical fiction are contextually accurate and rivitingly engaging.  The characters are compelling and become your friends and foes.  The stories are thrilling, edge-of-your-seat nailbiters.  The acting is worthy of the very best of the legitimate stage.  The cinematography is rich and flawless, every scene just as you would wish your eyes to view it.  The sets are utterly exquisite, stunning, glorious.  The costumes actually serve in an active way to enhance the viewing experience.  And to add a delightful frosting to an already incredibly delicious cake, you get to see the gorgeous, voluptuous English actress Polly Walker (among others) running around naked a lot (or, for you girls and alternative lifestyle sorts, you get a good view of James Purefoy).    The only thing to criticize about this show is that it was canceled too soon.  It leaves us craving so much more.  While the wonderful PBS production of \\"I, Claudius\\" (the show that would have gotten therating of six that I mentioned above) pretty much picks up where \\"Rome\\" left off, historically speaking, they could have gone on to do Nero into Vespasian in the same style the following year and provided just as compelling a story, and then gone on right through the rest of the Flavians, the Antonines, and the fall of the Western empire in subsequent seasons.  Elagabalus (among many others) would have made a GREAT character!

Go out and get your favorite album and have a listen. Or just find some money and buy all of them, if you are a Beatles fan you will be glad you did. Simply,no,majestically a masterpiece body of work.

B0025KVLV0|5.0|I've been listening to the Beatles since I was old enough to know what music was. My older sister was, and is, a huge Beatles fan and bought every album and single that was released here in the U.S.. I can remember as a small child, my sister and I getting ready for school listening to the Beatles blasting on our RCA TV console record player. The stereo my mother had won on the TV game show Let's Make A Deal. The school day mornings were ours, our parents were off at work already, so we were free to escape into the world the Beatles had created. Later on when my sister had her own record player, don't tell her, when she was away I would sneak into her room and listen on headphones to her prized collection. I became very intimate with all of the songs the fab four shared with me. Their music so inspired me that I became a singer, songwriter, producer etc.. Thank God for the Beatles' music. Cut to 1987 when with great anticipation the Beatles finally released their music on CD after many years of legal wrangling. As has been stated before, they didn't live up to the sonics I had remembered. Gone were the clicks and pops, but so was the magic and excitement I so cherished. They sounded very flat, mushy and overly compressed. It was still the same songs but as heard through a filter. Now in this glorious age of technology and even more compressed volume wars of the digital era, they have been finally res erected. Everyone, including me, who cared about the great legacy that is the Beatles were skeptical. Would the powers that be try and please the masses that are used to overly hyped, compressed, CDs and MP3s? Or would they treat them as the musical historical documents that they are? Well worry no more! The rematsered Beatles albums are a revelation!<br />I can honestly say I am very impressed. To my ears, these sound much better than I have ever heard these songs. As I have read from others, I have heard things in these recordings that I have never heard before after intently listening to these songs ever since their original release. The clarity is startling in it's honesty. Most musicians would be horrified to hear their vocals and playing with such a microscope after being used to having things so meshed together by the past mediums' masters. These aren't your ordinary musicians as the world knows. It is jarring at first to hear these recordings that we have loved for so long.

B000MMBRJY|1.0|The Boogeyman II (Bruce Starr, 1983)<br /><br />Ulli Lommel's original film The Boogeyman was one of the very definitions of the neologism \\"craptastic\\", a mishmash of pieces pulled from other movies wrapped in a paper-thin plot that many of them tore through. But compared to Starr and Lommel's sequel, the first film is a masterpiece.<br /><br />It's six months later, and Lacey (Lommel's wife Suzanna Love, an heiress to the DuPont fortune) has gone to California to see her old college friend Bonnie (The Princess and the Call Girl's Shannah Hall), now an actress married to struggling art-film director Mickey Lombard (Lommel). After the two of them hear Lacey's story, Bonnie puts together a party of some of Hollywood's sleaziest personages, with the hope that one or more of them will recognize Lacey's story for what it is--a bangup movie plot. The inevitable occurs, but while actresses are campaigning to play Lacey (who doesn't like the idea at all) and producers are constantly on the phone looking for backers, Bonnie and Mickey's faithful, if somewhat creepy, butler Joseph (Shoto von Douglas, who never appeared in another film) stumbles upon the piece of the mirror that Lacey keeps with her. Once again, the inevitable occurs.<br /><br />As you may have guessed from the first part of that synopsis, the majority of the first half of this movie consists of footage from the first flick. It's a device that I find spectacularly annoying, and I have never once seen a movie in which it's used that's been anything more than execrable. This is no exception. The worst part of it is, however, that the conceit Lommel works with here can be used well (look at Wes Craven's final Nightmare on Elm Street movie, which takes the same conceit and applies some great twists to it), but no one involved with this flick had the remotest intentions of trying to do anything worthwhile with it at all. At least that makes Lommel's character in the film, an art-flick director doing everything he can to avoid being sucked into the Hollywood exploitation machine, amusingly ironic. Doesn't help his incredible lack of acting talent, however, which is shared by the entire cast. And the murders are even sillier than they were in the first movie. Worth watching only if you're a completist, and even then, I'd advise great caution, This way lies madness. (half)into the Hollywood exploitation machine, amusingly ironic.

0780626966|4.0|I am a fan of the nightmare on elm street movies; I would recommend purchasing this box set, all movies are in wide screen, and have optimal sound quality. My favorite the nightmare on elm street movies would have to be the first 2 movies. I like the first, which is directed by Wes Craven. All the nightmare on elm street movies have great special effects, and Robert Englund as Freddy Kreuger, I think revolutionized a new era in the term slasher flicks. If your a fan if 80's slasher films then the nightmare on elm street movies are a good bet that you will enjoy one of the greatest franchises in slasher films. By purchasing the whole entire box set, minus Freddy vs' Jason, Freddy Kreuger is in a league of his own, along with Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, in the term slasher films, watch them over and over again you will be glad you did.[[ASIN:0780626966 The Nightmare on Elm Street Collection]]
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I wasn't a Johney Cash fan prior to seeing the movie. I did however enjoy the his music and the revelations of his personality and his life within the context of his biography. Reese Witherspoon did an excellent job in playing,June Carter, his devoted and pricipled wife and lover. At times I felt that , at times,Joaquin Philips over dramatized Cash's movements. All in all a very entertaining and informative story about an interesting and talented personality.
0060760273|5.0|Love this book!  Although it is a bit above my son's head (he's 9 months old), I still notice that he's interested in this book both for its bright colors and for the rythm of the text as it's being read.  It's definitely a book that will be used for several years!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Very happy with the purchase of this series.  I am reading the books and decided I wanted to view the DVD's since they are never in at the video store and figured it must be that good if they were never in and guess what I wasn't disappointed at all and am looking forward to purchasing the 2 Season when its available.  I am addicted to vampires what can I say I mean at least the reading about them.  To whom ever trying to decide to buy this series definitely do you won't be disappointed.  It follows the books pretty well and it leaves you wanting to watch more.  Love it as much as the Twilight series.  Can't wait for New Moon the movie to come out in November.
0307269981|3.0|For those that enjoyed the Dragon Tatoo, I found this book less enjoyable. The plot was not as intriguing and I found the end to be bizarre and disappointing
0786838655|5.0|I decided to give this series a try after seeing reviews for the most recent book, The Last Olympian. I seem to have developed an attraction to series titles lately, but I have to say that I am really looking forward to continuing this one. The Lightning Thief was an engaging, enjoyable read--if I hadn't had such a busy first week on the new job, I think I would have read this in one day. Unfortunately it took me nearly an entire week to get through, but I enjoyed reading a few pages whenever I could spare a few minutes.    I really have to give a lot of credit to Riordan's creativity in writing this book. He was able to put Greek gods, mythical creatures, and heroes into an entirely different setting and story, thereby making them new and interesting. The pacing is spot on--the action and adventure never really stop from the first page. Equally pleasing are the characters: Percy the troublemaker and his two sidekicks, Grover and Annabeth, seem to be no match for the daunting quest they inherit but in the end they manage to prove their worth. Riordan's characterizations of the mythical creatures and Gods was also entertaining--in fact, there were many touches of humor throughout the story. Add to that a tight plot with a few well-timed twists and turns and you have a book that I believe any fantasy-lover (or perhaps any reader, at all!) is sure to enjoy.    Thanks to this incredibly clever first installment, I'm already planning to go ahead and get my hands on the remaining books in the series, so you can expect to read more about my thoughts on Percy Jackson's adventures in the future.
6305882592|5.0|I loved this movie.  I liked the music, the actors, the script. I laughed out loud and woke my husband, who didn't think it was all that funny.  I guess it depends.
0439023491|5.0|How shall I start except to say that I devoured this book today. While I haven't thoroughly read all of the reviews out there, not wanting to spoil the book for myself, I had seen mainly glowing reviews and a few dissenting opinions, as well.<br /><br />All I can say is that for me, this book worked. In general, I didn't find the first person present tense to be too awkward, with a few exceptions. But what Collins does so successfully (in my opinion) is that she simply grabs you with the story and I just didn't want to put this book down. I thought the pacing was excellent and I never felt like the story was slow at any point--I was always trying to read as fast as I possibly could to find out what was going to happen next. The plot twists were thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat.<br /><br />And oh, these characters! Naturally, the primary focus is on Katniss and Peeta, but Collins also does a fine job with the supporting cast, in my opinion. From Gale, to Katniss's mother, to Haymitch, to the clueless citizens of the hated Capitol, Collins has created characters and a story that will stick with you long after you put the book down. Yes, the wait for book 3 (when's it due out?) may likely kill me, but I'll do my best to wait as patiently as possible. (The ever-growing TBR pile will probably help with that.) I can honestly say that I enjoyed Catching Fire just as much as I did The Hunger Games. In fact, reading Catching Fire may have gotten me out of the reading slump I feel like I've been in for awhile now--it seems to have lit a spark that makes me want to pick up another book already.
B0025KVLV0|4.0|the beatles ;let it be was released in may of 1970. sadly by the time let it be came out the beatles were about to break-up as a band.let it be was originally recorded in january of 1969,as a sound track to the movie that would later be titled let it be but was originally titled get back.at the time the beatles weren,t to pleased with the raw quality of get back. so for over a year the project was shelved.by the summer of 1969 the beatles regrouped and decided to record one last great album which was abbey road.by the end of 1969 allen klien  and the beatles decided that the get back project should be salvaged, and producer phil spector was called in to handle the project.i really like the raw almost live feel of this album.with billy preston on keyboards as an additional musician the songs sound that much greater!!i think one of the all time best filmed performances by the beatles was the rooftop concert on the apple records building in january of 1969!!!these remasters are great!!great sound,cool mini documentaries and great booklets!! if you are a beatles fan get it!!!

B000NU2CY4|5.0|I got Braveheart and Gladiator at the same time- as they were released the same day..I saw the reviews from a few who were complaining about the Blu Ray quality...from a \\"normal guy\\" --this looks just great and in comparison to Braveheart which looks no better than an average DVD, it is even outstanding...    This was a great flick to begin with and the extended version even better(both the theatrical and extended versions are on the Blu Ray)...    Good extra with the timeline version of the movie production albeit a bit truncated...

B000NQRE0K|3.0|I really thought that this was meant to be comments on the Blu Ray or the specific products from Amazon rather than reviews on the movie itself...SOOOoooo- I just want to say that I think this Blu Ray is not much better than the average DVD---sad because the areas filmed in Scotland and Ireland(locations per the Timelines extras on the disc) are breathtaking....you want the added dynamics of BluRay and yet the opening minutes show scratched footage and disappointing sharpness;  Gladiator is MUCH sharper and has more useful visual contrast. It is true that Braveheart is about 14 years old vs the more recent Gladiator but it is a bummer to see or more accurately not to see the beauty and added enjoyment that Blu ray is supposed to offer;  A shame because it IS a terrific movie--everyone who buys it already knows that and thus the reviews movie-wise are superfluous...

B002BSHWUU|4.0|First off, the Cd's sound great, louder, clearer, more definition in the bass, etc.     However- and this is an important point to those reading this review before purchase- these are \\"remastered\\" versions of the original stereo mix downs, not \\"remixed\\" versions.     Remastered means the audio was cleaned up. Remixed would mean correcting the extreme panning techinques of early stereo separation. They did not do this.    In the stereo box set - especially noticable in the first four albums- you are still getting the odd sounding panning of all the music coming from the left channel, vocals on the right or in the middle, and a cowbell or maraca coming from the right channel.     This is where the mono box comes in. The first four albums sound MUCH better in mono- strong and punchy- instead of the stereo versions which sound hollow and just odd. The with the rest of the albums, more attention to the stereo mixes were given and those mixes are certainly subject to endless debate over which is better- but in my opinion- the mono set really brings back the sound of the early Beatles and makes the early part of their catalog much easier to appreciate and actually seems to fit better with the later stereo versions when I put them on shuffle.    Also- the 1965 stereo mixes of Help! and Rubbersoul are noticably louder on the Stereo Remastered version than on the Mono Box.    Maybe 12/12/12 Paul and Ringo will get around to \\"Remixing\\" the entire Beatle catalog and give the catalog a truly modern treatment. Until then, if you are a Beatle fan with deep pockets, buy both sets or at least the Mono box and then the select Stereo counterparts.
B0000009SY|5.0|A rock opera is something that Frank Zappa would be a perfect artist for.  His albums are usually strung together in some way, he loves putting in all these characters, and a lot of his songs are about stories.  This album works very well.  It includes Frank Zappa's goofiness, and his musical talent.  The story is basically the story of all of the things that happen if you choose a career in music... at least in some sort of future.<br /><br />Just about each track begins with an introduction from the Central Scrutinizer, who is basically just the narrator, performed by Frank Zappa, whispering through a plastic megaphone.  Frank Zappa also portrays a few other characters, the first one that comes to mind is Joe's best friend who betrays him.  Ike Willis portrays the star of the album, Joe.  Joe starts out as a young teenager in a garage band.  The story is a very weird and sometimes confusing story that doesn't end the way that anyone who buys this album would consider a happy ending, but the ending is barely even an ending.<br /><br />The music of the album shows both major sides to Frank Zappa, the more simple rock and roll parody and comedy side, the weird melodies that you would never expect any human being to be able to sing and get every single syllable, and the instrumental guitar solos.<br /><br />In general, this is a great album for fans of Frank Zappa.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|A little about myself first.  I believe I'm relatively younger than the average Beatles fan.  I'm 25 and got hooked on them when my dad used to play the original vinyl records as a kid.  I love their music, but have always been dissapointed with sound quality on the old CDs, especially compared with the rest of the music of my age.      The sound of on these Stereo Remasters is definitely a lot livelier than before.  Everything is a lot more crisp and tight when it needs to be.  The only problem I have with the Stereo Remasters is with the earlier albums.  What bothered me with the old CDs is that vocals come primarily from the right channel while instruments come from the left channel.  Unfortunately this is still a problem in this remastered set.  From what I've read this is just how stereo mixes were done back then in order to really exaggerate the effect of 2 distinct channels.  For me that is too big of a problem and I will be on the hunt for the Mono Remasters which should fix this problem.  I primarily listen to music in my car and on headphones, so hearing this much seperation between the vocals and the instruments is too much for me.

The story is well written and beautifully told in the first person, so the reader can appreciate the effects of Alzheimer's Disease by the way the narrator's communication skills break down as her disease progresses, all while telling her story.

B0014DC0AK|5.0|So here we have Symbolic, for those with lisps (myself in 2nd grade) reading this, that's Thymbolic. However, everyone else will call it what it is: A model meritorious masterpiece of metal music made in MCMLXXXXV.     Alliteration aside, Symbolic is an album that falls into the \\"Brett Favre/Michael Jordan\\" model of operation: The Band breaks up, only to come back later and do a little more before leaving for good, either because no one wants you around or your knees aren't what they used to be; Or in this case, because the main musician wants to spread his wings. Although this is neither here nor there and only serves as a light joke to seque into the main review...    So Symbolic was going to be Death's final release, then Chuck got back into the studio and made The Sound of Perseverance, which is not what I am reviewing here, so I will cease all allusions to it's existence. Although that album also rocks.    This album, the one I AM reviewing, begins with a riff catchy enough you'll be humming it in your head for days afterwards. Once the vocals come in, two things will happen to you, dear reader:    1.) You'll find Chuck's vocals of less guttural belchiness and more growly raspiness abhorrent, either because you are a close-minded death metal \\"purist\\" who only listens to music that's BRUTAL, who hurts small animals for pleasure, who probably reeks like Old Style and marijuana, and who is also secretly some kind of sexual deviant.    -or-    2.) You'll like them.    Yes, his vocals take a noticeable change with this album, and I really like them. For whatever reason, they actually fit the music better this time around. I do love Death's early works, all of them. But I must give this album top marks for its own attributes.     The lead work is brilliant and possesses a sound that only Chuck has, the songs are complex and varied and don't all sound the same, the drum work is intricate and meshs together great with whatever riff is going without overpowering it, andthe bass work deserves a gold star and super-smiley face as well. If you need more detail, then read on:    The songs aren't quite as fast as previous albums, though this is actually a blessing in disguise. You won't find filler riffs consisting of straight sixteenths ad nausuem, you won't find excessive breakdowns or repititive choruses or anything that you see in \\"typical\\" metal acts. Every riff, and I do mean EVERY riff, has something to say and molds together to create some of the best metal songs I have ever heard. Conversely, the leads are masterfully constructed, creating a vibe like no other. Chuck possesses an ear unto himself, allowing him to write music from his heart and not from what a teacher or theory said he should. For most people that would not work, but for Chuck it was his secret weapon, his M.O. And he throws a little classical guitar into the ring to totally get you off-guard. Not just as a cliched intro, but in the meat of the songs. Yes, Chuck has an ear like no other.    As for the bonus tracks included with this item, allow me to express my interest in them: I am interested by them. It was very cool to hear a version of Symbolic with a couple deviations from the album version. You will also hear 4-track versions of a few other songs, which I enjoyed, actually. I ended up jamming along to a couple of the songs while they played. Of course I suck, although I could merely claim that it's abstract music.    So, should you decide to buy this album, you will be happy. You'll listen to this album, and then you'll listen to it again, and then you will be compelled to listen to it again. And every time you do, you will hear something you missed the first or second time around, you'll notice a harmony or lead you neglected before. It's like Houdini pulling out handkerchiefs from his sleaves. And every time you think he is about to run out, BAM! He punches you in the nose and keeps pulling out handkerchiefs.     If you need a numerical score, or a score that is concretely quantifiable, I'll say A+. However, Amazon has system that reminds me of the third grade teacher with the board of her entire class that she uses to track each students good and bad deeds. In this case, Symbolic gets five gold stars and gets to be the line leader.
B00009RGBS|5.0|I'm not a big fan of musicals, especially when there is no real plot and actors are shaking it aimlessly. \\"Chicago\\" is an exception to that pointless wave of musicals and the story is a great one on stage or on the screen.<br /><br />What makes the movie very special is that it highlights all the characters and doesn't take the light away from the leads: Roxan, Velma, and the attorney.<br /><br />Certainly, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere shine together but great direction by Rob Marshall enhances a perfect plot and makes every character a star including the deceived husband, prison mates and even Velma who's annoyingly played by the equally annoying Zeta-Jones.

1594202249|5.0|Thomas Pynchon's new novel is dazzling on any number of levels, but the merging of the hard-boiled noir genre with the stoner novels of the middle to late 1960s is brilliant. Evocative of the kaleidoscopic social satires of Robert Coover and Ishmael Reed, Pynchon treats the pop culture of 1970 in L.A. with what seems like a whole lot of love and an equally fond disrespect.<br /><br />The characters are appropriately absurd, particularly the tender-hearted skinhead hitman with the swastika tattooed on his forehead and the songbook of Ethel Merman in his heart. There are the forced metaphors of Raymond Chandler with an acid/surf spin. There is a gleeful anti-intellectual abandon that runs throughout.<br /><br />A certain amount of cultural literacy is essential to milking everything out of the book, but if people want to guess at the jokes, they'll still probably enjoy the trip. For those of us who cut our literary teeth in the early 70s to the accompaniment of Toklas brownies and bean dip, \\"Inherent Vice\\" is a gonzo throwback masterpiece -- and nothing less.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Introduction: The following is pretty much a full review of both the mono and stereo CD reissues from 2009 largely written in real time as a series of e-mails to an old friend who once owned a legendary record store here in Chicago. The story of the CD reissues really comes down to the technical limitations of two-track, four-track, eight-track, etc. recordings and the relative complexity of the music of the Beatles.  Listening occurred on what would be considered an audiophile system with Quad 988's as the speakers.  If following reading this review, you wish to read an expanded essay by me on the box sets, please visit The Beatles Wiki site by Hyperarts.<br /><br />Please Please Me:  The sound on the mono is just amazing. You can hear the echo in the room as John sings Anna. The vocals just soar. Ringo was just so good, even at this early stage and so was Paul. They supported and framed the songs so perfectly. And just think, in twenty-one minutes, or so, Twist And Shout!  Stereo can't hold a candle to this, if for no other reason than the left/right \\"stereo\\" found later in With The Beatles, Rubber Soul and Revolver.<br /><br />With The Beatles: As with Please Please Me, the mono sounds so, so, nice.  As the stereo has that annoying left/right \\"stereo,\\" no contest: mono hands down.<br /><br />A Hard Day's Night:  Seems better and more enjoyable in stereo. I think the reason is that they now had four tracks so George Martin could do proper stereo mixes and still have a mostly fresh first generationish sound.  Remember, there were only two track available for Please Please Me. However, when they got to Rubber Soul and Revolver, four tracks weren't enough, which required, in some instances, numerous dubs of the four tracks to another four track tape, merging the four tracks to one track, thereby opening up three new tracks. While this degraded the sound somewhat it also made it difficult to back-track and do the after-thought stereo mixes, which is why we have the atrocious \\"stereo\\" of Rubber Soul and Revolver.  Consequently, the reason the monos of these albums rule has mostly to do with technical limitations.  While the mixes on A Hard Day's Night are true stereo mixes, they carry George Martin's idiosyncratic, but really right, decision to put the vocals in the center, the rhythm section to the left and the other instruments to the right.  I always have loved how Martin took care to isolate the brilliant work of Ringo and Paul so many times instead of just following the convention of placing the drums in the center.  This is why one of Martin's memoirs is entitled: \\"All You Need Is Ears.\\"<br /><br />The Beatles For Sale:  Comments, preference and reasons for preference similar to A Hard Day's Night.<br /><br />Help: Well, thank God we have three different versions to compare to make life ever so easy. First, mono is the definitive mix, that's a plus. As a minus, while it sounds richer, it is also a bit muddy compared to the stereo mixes. As for the stereo mixes, the remaster of George Martin's '87 remix does show some limiting in this new incarnation. A bit a hard to dial in the right volume. Sounds fuller, but that's the limiting. Not sure I care for this version too much. As for the `65 stereo version, that comes on the same disc as the mono version, as this album is somewhat acoustic, the absence of the limiting that was done to the new stereo remix/remaster is a plus. The delicacy is there in I Need You. Overall, the \\"old\\" stereo is prettier than the \\"new\\" stereo. One can argue over whether the \\"new\\" stereo or the \\"\\"old\\" stereo is better, I come down on the side of the \\"old\\" stereo, I like pretty.  But as you get both the mono and the \\"old\\" stereo on the single mono disc, the cheapskate in me screams if you had a pistol to your head and only had to purchase one version of Help, it would be the \\"mono\\" disc.<br /><br />Rubber Soul: Mono over stereo, if for no other reason than the left/rt channel mix that plagued Please, Please Me, With The Beatles and Revlover.<br /><br />Revolver: There is a section of I Want To Tell You where Ringo is just so muscular and explosive in the mono that is missing in stereo and this is before we get to the issue of the left/right \\"stereo\\" of the stereo mix. Plus, there is just this overall richness of sound to the mono that is missing in the stereo.  That said, it is a bit cooler to hear Tomorrow Never Knows in stereo. But, overall, mono.<br /><br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:  The things you have heard are correct about the mono mix, the clarity and control over the notes, instruments and vocals is all there.  Overall, it just sounds better, fuller and richer than the stereo, plus it is what the boys intended.  Oddly, the thing that was most breathtaking was She's Leaving Home; just a full, gorgeous, sound.  In stereo, it just sounds relatively wrong; thin compared to the mono. That said, because Day In The Life is such a mind-f the stereo is the definitive version of this song.<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour: While Pepper's sounded better in Mono, MMT sounds better in stereo.<br /><br />The Beatles (The White Album):  Both versions have their merits, you need both.  If you can only go for one, it's the stereo.<br /><br />Abbey Road: The defining moment of these reissues, and why it took four years, may be found on AR's I Want You (She's So Heavy). Because they couldn't take the tape hiss out without compromising the sound, they didn't.  But when it came to John's final \\"yeah\\" which was over saturated and clipped previously, they were able to take the clipping out, and for the first time, you can hear all of John's vocal.  Second side now, Here Comes the Sun and now Because.  Wonderful sound throughout.  Can't wait for Ringo at the end.<br /><br />Let It Be: Now that I have had the time to compare three versions of LIB, an original 1970 EMI vinyl, this remastered CD and LIB Naked, it turns out that LIB is one of the more interesting remaster releases.  First, LIB Naked has it all.  It is true to the original vision of the Beatles for this music.  It has clarity, correct dynamics and musicality.  One of the places you can hear this best is in the title track and the differences between the Martin and Spector mixes. Martin got the church-like nature of the song. Consequently, you get more organ and the choir-boy harmonies of John and George, which Spector dubbed over with horns, strings and over the top solos by George. And I'm with Sir Paul concerning the damage done by Phil to The Long And Winding Road.  As for the 1970 LIB vinyl, it has its problems from a sonic standpoint, particularly as it is a Phil Spector production.  This brings us to this remastered CD.  It trumps the 1970 standard vinyl in clarity but not LIB Naked.  The real surprise is that the compression added to this remaster actually makes this a more Phil Spectoresque production than the original.  And surprisingly, I like it, at least compared with the 1970 vinyl.  Still, Naked is what you want.<br /><br />Mono Past Masters: Right now, listening to the The Inner Light, which I hate, but it sounds so, so, so good in mono that I may actually like it. And, look out, Paul's bass piano notes in Hey Jude are right there as is Ringo's tambourine. Can't wait for Revolution plus the mono songs from Yellow Submarine.  The mono Past Masters would have been perfection if they had added a stereo Let It Be and The Ballad Of John and Yoko.  After all, the \\"stereo\\" Past Masters is actually a mixture of stereo and mono.<br /><br /> So kids, here's where we end.  Your core, oddly enough, should be the mono box set.  Augment this with the stereo Hard Day's Night, The Beatles For Sale, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, The Beatles, Abbey Road, Let It Be and stereo Past Masters.<br /><br />Addendum: As I live in Chicago, and have access to one of the country's remaining great stereo stores, that also boast three incredibly knowledgeable owners and an original Sgt. Peppers British Stereo pressing, following posting this review I went over there to compare the original vinyl with the two new CD reissues.  We listened to the reference system, Naim Audio electronic and Quad speakers.  There was total agreement on what we heard.  First, Pepper's mono CD had better tonal balance than Peppers stereo CD.  Pepper's stereo CD had better coloration than the mono, but this was defeated by the harshness of the sound (more on harshness shortly).  Thus, overall, between the two CD's we preferred the mono CD.  All that said, the stereo original British vinyl pressing crushed both.  It had both tonal correctness and coloration.<br />Now as to the harshness issue, please be mindful that I have listened to these discs on two audiophile systems.  Something like harshness is likely to be more prevalent the higher up you get in the stereo food chain.  Thus, someone who doesn't have an audiophile system may not experience the harshness at all, but it really is there.  This may render some of the stereo CDs more listenable for these people than they were for me, at least when it comes to Pepper's.<br /><br />9/12/09 THANKS TO ALL: The past few days, following the posting of my review, have been a lot of fun. So many people have taken the time to write me, quite a number saying the review was flat-out the best review of any sort they have read. Others shared memories and feelings about how important this music is to them. Amazingly, two brother, one in Boston one in Paris, found they were reading the same thread and were kind of amazed by the co-incidence. All in all, it has been a very rewarding experience.

First, as the theme of this review was \\"a cheapskate's guide\\" we can address this theme before the actual release.  The fact of the matter is it is incredibly hard, and very expensive, at this late date, to amass a collection of quality original mono pressings of the Beatles catalog.  I know this because this is precisely what I did after writing the CD reviews five years ago.  Besides the cost, and difficulty, there is also the issue of the necessity of cleaning the vintage albums once they arrive at your doorstep.  This turns out, in many instances, to be a very difficult task and, in most instances, more involved than simply using something like a VPI record cleaning machine if you desire to reach the point of the greatest lack of extraneous noise in the grooves.    So, right out of the box, unless Apple/Capitol completely botch these vinyl releases, these vinyl releases are going to be what the overwhelming majority of people seeking to experience these albums on vinyl will want and afford (both in time and in money) to purchase.    Second, as Amazon's editorial comment accurately indicates, what we have learned, pre-release, of these releases is incredibly positive.  First, they are using an all analog chain.  Second, other than some necessary EQ adjustments, nothing is being done to \\"model\\" the sound.  Third, they are using the services of Steve Berkowitz, along with Sean Magee, as sound engineers and the methodology they used is far superior to that which was used for the CDs.  Steve has immense experience with this link in the chain and there is no reason to doubt his ability to be up to the task.  Fourth, the lacquers for the vinyl issues were cut by Greg Calbi, who has decades of experience in the difficult task of cutting lacquers.  It is hard to find anybody better for this critical step in the process.  Fifth, \\"ALL\\" the vinyls pressed, world-wide, were done at the Optimalpressing plant in Germany, which has a wonderful reputation for the quality of their pressings.    Third, while I reserve judgment on the final product, based on my own experience, those who have heard the pressings, pre-release, are nearly uniformly in agreement: They got it right this time!!!    That's enough for now and until I actual receive my copies.

B001F12J0C|5.0|Perhaps the people who said this disc set has no extras haven't actually looked at the back of the DVD cases.  Each movie has a lot of bonus material that is quite interesting.  There is feature commentary with the director, interviews with cast members, deleted scenes, fight sequence planning, driving school, going on location, and lots of other really cool stuff (too much for me to write it all down here).  If you are interested in how these movies were made you will really enjoy all of the bonus features.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Like many others who appreciate the Beatles, I have found the sound of the original CD releases stale for many years have have been looking forward to this material being remastered.  Well this glorious day (9/9/09) has finally arrived and I can say it was well worth the wait.  This boxed set features the entire Beatles catalog remastered and sounding amazing.  The earlier songs (Love Me Do, I Want To Hold Your Hand) still sound like oldies, this being for the reason recording technology was less advanced than it was in the later part of the sixties.  However, the songs are still great and they sound better than they have on the countless \\"Best Of\\" collections.  The later albums, \\"Abbey Road\\" in particular, could pass for new releases.  A lot of care was put into this set.  And say what you want about The Beatles: They put out more great songs in a span of eight years than most bands put out in multi-decade careers.      Please ignore those who are complaining about the $180 price tag for this box.  Remember you are getting the entire Beatles catalog for about $12.85 a disc, which is not a bad deal at all.  And there are some really amazing documentaries to go along with it.  If you love The Beatles and can afford this collection, treat yourself.  You deserve it!      Peace.

Suffice it to say, my daughter loved it too.  Both agreed that the story was funny and easy to understand.  Above all, they loved the lessons they learned from the story.

0439023491|5.0|Like the first book it takes place in Panem, the nation that exists where the U.S. used to be. Every year the Capitol holds a televised tournament in which two teen \\"tributes\\" from each of the surrounding districts fight a gruesome battle to the death. In the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the tributes from District Twelve, frustrate the Gamemakers and force them to let both teens survive. Catching Fire picks up as Katniss returns to District Twelve to find that she is now the center of attention. An unprecedented surprise visit by President Snow forces Katniss and Peeta to do a Victory Tour through the districts in preparation for the 75th Annual Hunger Games. After returning to their daily lives in District Twelve a twist of fate drastically changes the rules of the 75th Annual Hunger Games.<br /><br />Catching Fire has less action than Hunger Games because this book explores more of Panem's power structure, district rumors, and the spreading rebellion. I was a little disappointed that the majority of the book took place outside the Hunger Games arena but the book overcame my initial disappointment. If you enjoyed the Hunger Games you will enjoy Catching Fire. If more books are written in the Hunger Games series I look forward to reading them.

Have only watched the movie and cannnot comment on any of the extras that are included in this edition.
0812975219|2.0|There are some interesting ideas in the book. That's why I would give it 2 stars and not 1.  Other than that the style is quite bad (IMHO of course) but the one biggest problem for me is that  the author lacks even a single smallest drop of humility. Most of the book is about how smart   the author is and how stupid everybody else is. I did not need all that.    The message of the book if there was any is lost in all this bragging.
B001CRGSKG|5.0|Along with Iron Maiden's \\"Powerslave\\" and Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells...\\", \\"...And Justice For All\\" was an important part of my introduction to metal in the late Eighties. While not a concept album per se, musically this record has such a balance of composition and movement to go with it's themes and lyrical content, a refined version of what we call Thrash. Many scorn the production values. I am actually in favor of the dryness of it, even the minimised or highly controlled bass mix. There is something monochromatic and symphonic about it that lends to the record's power. Metallica's finest moment, in my opinion.
0393327655|3.0|Sam Harris is an amazing writer, a bold and -- mostly -- intelligent thinker.  In The End of Faith, he's penned as stunningly clear and unassailable a position on the absurdity and danger of religion as one can write.  However, for reasons that we can only guess, he's also chosen to package these intellectual gems with some of the oldest and most spectacularly detrimental ideas available to mankind, casting a decidedly Rumsfieldian pallor over the entire work.    Harris immediately begins with and somehow maintains page after page of riveting prose, making the book nearly impossible to put down despite the above-average effort required to follow his carefully constructed analysis.  Harris systematically builds cogent arguments that our cherished modern religions are not only obviously the product of nothing more supernatural than a hodge podge of ancients possessed of powerful superstition, but that continued blind belief in their words poses a very real threat to everything we hold dear -- including our very lives.  I find it difficult to imagine anyone afflicted with the sort of faith decried herein, yet wielding at least modest intellectual capabilities and an earnest desire to read carefully, coming to the end of this book without sustaining significant damage to the foundation of his belief.    Harris' intellectual bullet train runs incredibly smoothly through the first chapters, yet one begins to sense certain rumblings on the tracks as we ride into the chapter called The Problem With Islam.  The altogether valid point is made that modern day Islam is in a bad way, and has made the kind of mess in its people's heads that makes one think of Christianity's more embarrassingly brutal days.  But Harris pushes beyond that fact to argue that Islam, at its very foundations, is simply more broken than Christianity or Judaism, and cannot be reformed as those two other now more advanced (if only slightly) faiths have been.  He does this despite digging equally distressing dogma, scripture and horrifying acts (many more of the latter from Christianity's fascination with creative torture mechanisms than from the others) from the closets of each faith, and despite noting that the Islamic world's failed attempt at modernization about 50 years ago looked to all those watching like a cusp that could be crossed.    But one can forgive and overlook this difference as verging on a quibble over semantics.  The fact is that the Islamic world *is* in a mess, and we have good reason to think hard about how to encourage a gradual weaning from Islam in favor of, perhaps, less of the abject poverty and hopelessly corrupt governments that appear to be encouraging it.  But we are not allowed to merely overlook this suspicious argument, because it is at this point that the intellectual bullet train positively derails with the spectacular sparks of Harris attempting to use his considerable rhetorical skills to convince us that torture is, well, just fine if you can conjure up some sort of reason that smacks of public safety or the fight on Islamist-based terrorism.    After creating an entire book primarily dedicated to detailing the atrocities done to our fellow humans in the name of religion (and he really does so well ... many of the dark age torture methods described are best forgotten as soon as possible), Harris spends the book's next to last chapter vigorously attempting to convince his readers that torture is ok as long as it is administered by us logical-minded humanists in ways that seek to disturb the torturer's mental health as little as possible.  The well-known point that torture yields very little accurate information is illustrated brilliantly in a variety of examples in the preceding chapters, and is in fact noted in this pro-torture plea, yet dismissed with an \\"any little bit helps\\" argument.  In short, nearly every excellent point made previously in this otherwise fine book is rendered null and void by a position that one can easily imagine coming directly from the diary of former US vice president Dick Cheney (except not so well written, if that were the case).    To be fair and complete, the last chapter was, again, exceedingly well done and though provoking.  There Harris explores the alternatives to faith-based religion, and makes a variety of interesting points about observation-based \\"spirituality\\" (in quotes because it is important which meaning this loaded word is given in the sense that Harris discusses it).    Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is critical minded enough to take the good from such a powerful thinker as Harris while not feeling too sheepish about discarding the bad.  The book is exceedingly well written, and the majority of the ideas need very badly to be expressed.  It is unfortunate that Harris takes the axe to many of the most important implications of his ideas with his absurd stance on torture, and I hope this will not overshadow the crucial points that The End of Faith Makes so well.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I've always liked Coldplay's music; Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head are both five-star albums in my opinion.  However I did not even remotely enjoy their \\"X & Y\\" album that came out before this one, at all.  I was ready to chalk another one up to 'lost in the sellout realm of popstardom' in fact, but thankfully that motion was denied with my listening to this album.  The lighter side of me loves it, is truly uplifting music to listen to during this economic Hell we find ourselves living in.  Brian Eno came through in fine style with the sonic soundscapes of his music production, and Chris Martin's vocals blend excellently within them.  All of the songs on this album are either good or great, the middle portion of the album being good and the outer portions being great.  My favorite tracks are Cemeteries of London, Lost!, and Strawberry Swing.  The album is filled with simple lyrics that can read like poetry at times: \\"I don't want to battle from beginning to end, I don't want to cycle through psycho revenge, I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends.\\" Might seem tame but I take that as a profound statement during these times.  Don't expect a Joshua Tree but you can expect something close to it.  A solid album easily worthy of four out of five.

0783227434|5.0|I hadn't watched AOD in years, and after another viewing, I'm kicking myself for not making it a weekly ritual.<br /><br />Think of your favorite sci-fi, medieval, slapstick comedy, or fantasy movie of the last 20 years.  Guess what?  AOD is not only probably a better movie in that singular genre, but it also includes all the other genres.  Imminently rewatchable, it's the perfection of an otherwise unsavory blend of King Arthur, Leslie Nielson, the combined might of a zombie and skeleton army, the special effects of Clash of the Titans, and a final showdown between good and evil that has paved the way for countless others since.  In fact, it could be argued that AOD has been the inspiration for more scripts, concepts, and subplots since its creation than is even worth mentioning.<br /><br />Aside from the aforementioned special effects - which are admittedly bad - the rest is perfection.  The homage to the Three Stooges, the trash-talking during sword fights, the hokey skeleton army storming the castle, all perfect.  Comedic timing that would make even a headliner jealous, there are numerous moments throughout the movie that illicit snorts.  Even the musical score, which blends seamlessly with the action as well as the romance, is nearly without equal.  A person going back in time several hundred years and immediately being the smartest, most powerful person is a hilarious concept because it's cemented in probability.  Not only smarter, but more than likely stronger, craftier, and better suited for an actual battle in nearly every way.  Which brings me to Bruce Campbell.<br /><br />He's absolutely untouchable as far as I'm concerned.  The fact that he doesn't placate the armor-wearing simpletons by changing his word selection, using slang that would obviously confuse and amaze all, is brilliant.  Every sword swing, shotgun blast, and taunting laugh is the epitome of entertainment.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie...WHAT is wrong with you?!  If you have, do yourself a favor; watch it again.  This is still one of the most enjoyable movies of all time.<br /><br />Jason Elinain.  This is still one of the most enjoyable movies of all time.    Jason Elin

This book will make you think and it's more interesting than 'Tipping Point' by the same author.    Gladwell didn't mention Theodore John Kaczynski who, in my opinion, is probably one of the most popular geniuses of our time who also failed.

159448385X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini gives a riveting portrait of Afghanistan from the 1970s to the present day. The story revolves around two women who are forced to marry the same abusive man, Rasheed, namely Mariam, an illegitimate girl who longs for her father's love and Laila, a beautiful woman who loves her childhood friend Tariq. Both women witness regime changes, bombings, executions, droughts, diseases and marital problems. Thanks to their friendship and love, they find a certain happiness in spite of all the dramas.<br />I would have preferred a happier ending to the story and couldn't help but feel a little disappointed by how things turned out, but this is life sometimes. This is a very poignant and realistic story.

They are wonderfully structured and are filled with acute psychological observations, eloquent writing and detailed descriptions. The main themes are about family secrets and relations. In one of them, there is the story of a widower who has a mistress and who prefers to keep it a secret from his daughter, in another, a married woman who falls platonically in love with a friend, in another, a sister who introduces her brother to alcoholism, in another, the story of a teen who cannot accept the father's new wife, etc.<br />Lahiri's stories of exile, identity, disappointment, bitterness, relations and maturation are brilliant and extremely realistic. Her language is aesthetically marvelous.

0385342020|5.0|I was trying out B&N's new eReader and decided to pick a book to read.  I can't remember exactly how this book jumped to the top of the list, but I am SO GLAD it did!    I loved Lara, the perfectly imperfect herione of the story.  She struggles with bad choices (her own and other people's) and has to fight to keep her head above water.  Who can't relate to that?  Actually, I'm not sure she is the herione of the story.  Her great-aunt Sadie stole the show with her boundless energy and her quirkiness.  I wasn't able to guess the ending halfway through either which was refreshing.    I was so disappointed when this story ended - not because it didn't have a happy resolution, but because it was over.  I wanted to read more about Sadie!

1881273156|5.0|This is a remarkable work of honesty on the subject of \\"LOVE\\" and how it differs from what so many people mistakenly think of as love but is really infatuation and obsession- the falling in love experience which lasts for up to two years but is inevitably replaced by reality.  This euphoria caused by chemicals and not effort that many mistake for \\"TRUE LOVE\\" and think will conquer all requires no effort on behalf of those stricken.  After a tremendously trying time in my own marriage I have come to learn through personal experience what real love is and Dr. Chapman is completely and utterly correct in the fact that love is a choice and that sustaining a \\"perfect\\" marriage where both parties are happy and feel loved requires realizing that your partner may not feel loved from all of the a)things you are doing for her, b)ways you verbally affirm and compliment her, c)quality time you spend with her, d)gifts you consistently give her, when she is crying out for PHYSICAL TOUCH!! This is just one example.<br /><br />  Just because you feel loved when people spend time with you does not necessarily mean that your partner, child, or parent feels that same particular fuzzy feeling when you try and reciprocate the effort.  It does no good to commit so much time and energy to give gifts to someone who's primary love language is \\"acts of service.\\"  The point here is that it is really very simple to figure out what love language your significant other ACTUALLY speaks and then concentrate your efforts in that area and stop wasting your time expecting results from doing all the things that might make YOU feel loved.  One must decide that they will do the things that make the other feel loved even if it may not make sense to them.  The ideas presented in this book are very simple but not necessarily easy.  It is like learning a foreign language and requires some work but the results are amazing and real.  I bought the childrens' version for my sister and the ideas in this have helped us understand my entire family better.<br /><br />  After many years of thinking my brother is greedy and weird about money I have come to realize that his primary love language is \\"gift giving\\" and that all the years of him comparing gifts given to us by our parents and taking personal offense to the fact that every child is different and receives a different gift- something that we could never understand since we had no idea that receiving gifts is the primary way in which he FEELS LOVED.  Of course!  The reader of this book will have many such experiences as they start to expand this idea to all the members of their family or people in their life.  This book does have a slight religious slant but it's very slight and does not make the message any less true or helpful.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is the best money I have ever spent. Now, please keep in mind that I have unilateral hearing loss, meaning that I am profoundly deaf in one ear (something I was born with, not the result of years of blasting music), and as a hearing-impaired person, I was worried that I might not be able to hear a difference between the 1987 remasters and these shiny new 2009 remasters.<br /><br />I didn't have to worry. Ripping these in FLAC first thing, I can already definitely hear a wonderful difference in the sound. It's so much clearer, more vibrant, and it's just all around a revelation to hear the greatest music ever made sound as it was meant to sound: AMAZING. One concern I had as I awaited for my pre-order of this box to arrive was the stereo channel separation of the previous remasters and such (a huge problem for me, as I own an iPod, and I had to convert these ones to mono for the sound to come out in only one earphone, which compromised the quality). Thankfully, these remasters do NOT have this channel separation (or panning, as I've seen this be referred to as). I tested out the main victims of the panning: Yellow Submarine, Eleanor Rigby, and A Day In The Life to name a few, and I was so very pleased, to say the least, that I could hear everything in one earphone. I will not have to compromise quality merely for playback on my iPod (once I convert them to V0 VBR mp3 for such playback).<br /><br />I am in love with the digipak packaging. Although admittedly it was a tad difficult to remove the CDs so I could rip them in FLAC, I am glad these albums are in digipak. So much more aesthetically pleasing to me, and a lot easier to carry around without the worry that the cases will crack (or worse, break) if dropped. I also love how the CD labels' designs mirror the designs of the original vinyl labels. The glossy booklets detailing the history (and, in some albums, including the original liner notes and reviews) and recording notes are a huge bonus.<br /><br />Hands down, I urge every fan of music, including those of my generation (I am 18), to purchase this stereo box set if they have the means. Do not merely settle for downloading rips of it. As for those complaining about remaster versus remix: either coherently and rationally criticize it (as opposed to having a caps lock and punctuation fest, which is disrespecting the English language) or keep it to yourself and save this product page some review space for those who actually appreciate this product for what it is.f music, including those of my generation (I am 18), to purchase this stereo box set if they have the means.

B0000247D1|5.0|Gunther Wand was a great Bruckner conductor. This performance, a live recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, is to my ears the finest performance of this symphony on disc. Wand's pacing and phrasing of the music seems perfect and the Berlin Philharmonic demonstrate why they are one of the best in the business. An additional bonus is the warm and detailed recording. Move aside Herr Karajan, Bohm, Jochum and Celibidache. Good as your CDs might be, Wand comes up trumps. More good news; Amazon's price is a bargain.
B0025KVLRO|4.0|Been waiting for the offical stereo version of this CD for years.  I already had a stereo version from other sources.  This doesn't sound that much better than what I already had.  But the big flaw on the newly remastered version - is that there isn't  a good version, in stereo, of the specific cut, Please Please Me.  The harmonica is way distorted making that cut unlistenable -- they should have stuck with the way less distorted mono version  (they still used the mono versions of She Loves You and I'll Get You  for the remastered Past Masters).  Stereo or not -- they should have picked the better version.  Guess they will fix that for the 2022 rerelease.
B00005Q66Y|5.0|The dedicated Brucknerian will need no reminder of the majesty of this long symphony. They will also know of the excellence of Gunther Wand's skills in conducting Bruckner's compositions. Added to this, on the evidence of this live recording of the Eighth in the Philharmonie, is the greatness of the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. And another thing.... the sound as captured by the engineers is warm, clear and detailed; if you have a quality sound system you will be thrilled.<br /><br />Wand's pacing of this symphony is unerring. There is the required repose when called for, as well as energetic projection of the more dramatic sections. He brings off the famous adagio perfectly. This performance is superior to his DVD live concert reading with the NDR Symphony. It deserves to join Karajan/Berlin/DG as preferred version on CD. It's cheap too!

B0025KVLTM|5.0|This album, which came out in 1967, changed everything that was to come after it in the history of rock. Songs like \\"A Day in the Life\\"or \\"Lucy in the Sky of Diamonds\\" took us into the stratosphere.  Paul McCartney's interest in contemporary classical music, such as in the compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen (who appears as one of the figures on the cover), and George Harrison's interest in music from India, helped shape their ideas about what was possible in music.<br /><br />This particular remastered CD, which was created from the original stereo analogue master tapes, is exceptional in its clarity and warmth. One element that was missing form the original American release is presented here, which was the chaotic splicing of voices found at the very end of the recording. This CD also comes with a booklet and a mini-documentary that can be played on a computer.
B0025KVLRY|1.0|If you don't like your main vocals to only come out of one speaker (Right), avoid this.  It's really a shame you have to fork out $250 to get the first four CD's in mono.  (Of course you get more, but those are the only ones you really need .. maybe Mono Masters too.)    Back when they released the original CD's, the first four were Mono, then all the rest in Stereo,  with good mixes as far as my ear could tell. The Past Masters also contained Mono mixes for some  of the songs.    I've been ripping these new 2009 CD's to the computer, and comparing back & forth.   So far I've noticed a big improvement, except here. I literally hate this one.    So my new plan is to keep the first four + Past Masters, and upgrade the rest.  Hopefully in the future, they'll make those first four available in Mono by themselves.    Update 9-13-09    I have tried the Mix to Mono suggestion a few other reviewers have mentioned. On a Mac I used  Quicktime Pro to export each track to Mono. On a Windows machine, you could use a free program  such as Audacity. (It only takes about 5 seconds for each track.) I have to say that this is  a great idea. I realize we all have different tastes, and so each of us may prefer these albums   the way we remember them. So if you can't afford the Mono set (I fit this category for sure),  then this is the best alternative. I still hope EMI will make the Mono Masters available   individually, so until then this will have to do.

I felt about forty years younger as I read the book . . . but I didn't have any flashbacks.<br /><br />The book's main drawback is that the ending doesn't live up to the opening.<br /><br />Pass that brownie, will you?

I am recommending it to any one that cares to listen
B001AQTWF2|2.0|I love Whitney Houston. No, I mean I luuuuuuuuuuuuuuuv me some Whitney. I love that woman. UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUhhhhhhhhWheeeeeeeeeeeeee. I love Whitney Houston. I love Whitney.I luuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuv that woman. OOOOOOWWWWWWWWW, I am in pain , I love that woman so much. So when I say this cd stinks, it is nothing I want to say. There are four songs worth listening to. Two are very good-the title track, I Look To You and the last song I Salute. There are two others that are not so bad, but the rest stink. This was Whitney's bad attempt at reaching a more urban audience with urban music, but Whitney , you are no Erika Badu. This is not just nostalgia for the old Whitney. These songs are not Whitney. It would be like Elvis Presley singing M C Hammer's Humps and Bumps.  There was a happy medium between Whitney's old style of music and trying to go more urban. This album did not find it. Most of the songs just stink.    Now for the worst part. First, I love Whitney Houston. I mean I love me some Whitney.....but the voice is gone, even on the title song, which is a good song. The fifteen different levels of range just don't cut it. Those musical notes that should be beautiful suddenly go sandpaper rough. ON every song the voice just isn't there. I love me some Whitney. There isn't narry a lick of her that I don't love. I love me some Whitney. But she can't sang a lick no more. I suggest this beautiful piece of musical history venture into the acting field full time. If you want to hear Whitney \\"get down\\" with the brothers and sound like she swallowed three of them, this is the cd for you. If you want to hear musical notes so beautiful you don't care what the song is, youtube anything by Susan Boyle or Whitney's older material. By the way, I luuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuv me some Whitney Houston.
076790382X|5.0|This is the most hilarious collection of memoirs on America life that I have ever come across. After traveling internationally to India, I had a different perspective on America while returning. The way he pokes fun at the US and some of our Midwestern cultural idiosyncrasies is absolutely refreshing. He seems to poke fun at everyone equally (small towns, city folk, church, highway system, government, need I go on?) This book was exactly what I needed to get a good laugh!<br /><br />If you've ever been out of the USA for an extended period of time --read this for a good laugh
B0000VCZKM|4.0|My 2 year old granddaughter loves all the music, well worth watching with younger kids. Purchased as a present for her.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|I actually own this exact product.  I also own the older CD of this album and it was thin sounding.  There is a strong improvement.  It is in particular with the instrumentals, from my ear.  There is still distortion in the vocals and I think that is as good as it gets.      I love the songs on this album.  It's always fun to listen to it.  That's subjective.  Its just good energy.  This album is in Stereo (I understand this disc from the box set is in the original mono mix, yes?) and it follow the old idea of Stereo mixing (vocals on the right).  That makes it authentic for the approximate period but it makes it odd to listen to in a car (obviously because you are sitting by the left speakers when driving and if you balance it for you, the passenger suffers).  So, it has a novelty aspect some might not like.  I understand.  It just doesn't bother me that much and is actually kind of fun when you can almost completely isolate the vocals or the instrumentals .... Karaoke anyone? A little high for my range in my dotage.     I had a problem where this disc (and the another remastered disc I bought) would not play on my PC but it was the drive on this stupid Dell.  I had someone swap out the drive. It wouldn't even open and when I look in the drive itself, it looks like a blank disc. NOW FIXED... again, had to swap out the DVD drive. The bad drive was TSST corp DVD+RW TS-L532B
B0018RWMNM|4.0|The way it should have been seen. Fantastic! There are a few glitches along the way and some low light scenes are to dark but those issues are minimal and are quickly passed by to be forgotten.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|For me the remaster took a little getting used to.  They are \\"bright and clear\\" like everyone keeps saying, but to me this initially seemed \\"harsh.\\"  On the White album the drums hit you in the neck when they're present.  You can hear the bass pluck- and tell whether McCartney is using his fingers of a pick- it is that clear.  On \\"I Will\\" you can hear him making bass sounds entirely with his voice (I had to go back to the un-remastered CD and check if that was there in the original mix).  Some of the previously more laid back songs like Julia, or LongLongLong, stand out a lot more.  The acoustic guitars are fierce, and deep.  Check out Blackbird- that song threw me back a little.  Definitely different.  You can hear the percussive monotone tap of Paul's foot.  The bird sounds are really prominent toward the end- but overall his voice is just so beautiful and the guitar so well composed that it still works for me.    Overall the album seems \\"woken up.\\"  For me the original CD release always seemed a bit sleepy.  Now even the acoustic pieces have punch.    BUT, I don't think that the white album is the most noticeable of the remasters.  There is a lot of improvement/ change- but the real bulk of the remastering happened on the earlier albums.    If the White Album is your favorite- get it.  If you planned on getting them all- get it.  But if you're looking to see a really obvious improvement I would try some of the albums before Sgt. Peppers.  You may just find that these more drastic changes (cleaning of the tape hiss, fix in dynamics etc.) will make you a new fan.  I've camped on the post 1965 albums for some time just because I couldn't stand the early quality.  These remasters opened my eyes.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I purchased the American stereo versions when they came out but what really stands out in these sets are the mono versions of Sgt. Peppers and the White Album.  I was always wondering if they were ever going to release these and now they have.  Apparently the stereo version have been cleaned up considerably also according to these reviews.
B000WS4QJG|3.0|I thought I was buying a copy of the original Cd.  I was mistaken; guess I didn't read the description carefully enough?     Bought this for my wife (birthday present).  She said she LOVED it.  When we made a short trip recently, she admitted she was disappointed in the last 4-5 tracks on the CD; seems they were re-mixes!    There weren't enough of the original songs on the CD.      She hasn't watched the DVD yet; wonder if there's any \\"re-mixes\\" on it, too?
B001FB4W0W|5.0|hubby was surprised and excited to get the 1st series... cant wait for the 2nd to be released...to surprise him again...
B0025KVLTW|5.0|The remastered Beatles CDS are out (finally), after a too long wait. If you want to get a quick idea what to expect from the remasterings, the best way to do this is to compair one of the 1987 remastered songs to  your copy of BEATLES ONE (the  number one singles CD from 2000.) The BEATLES ONE was remastered with 24 bit technology, and sound solutions to negate the hiss.  A lot of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR came out on the BEATLES ONE CD, as well as the remastered and remixed soundtrack to YELLOW SUBMARINE. (It included all 15 songs used in some way for the cartoon film.) So, I had misgivings about buying MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR remastered, cos I already had so many of the songs remastered. Nevertheless, i'm really glad I did. The remastering job is just hands down phenominal.  Most of what pops out at you, are the little bits that were too sonically blurred, or buried in the mix, to decipher. The BASS is very punchy, while the top end resonates with much greater clarity and distinction. The ride and crash symbols come across so REAL. My only real disappointment, is that with the purity of the sound we now have, all the problems with bouncing down so often to free up tracks is evident. Its no secret that MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was recorded on four track, like Pepper.  So, because almost ALL the musical instruments ended up crowded onto one track, leaving another track or two for vocals and lead guitar, then a track for the sound effects. (I think Martin wanted the sound effects seperated, like the bus that drives between the speakers on the song MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, to produce that psychedelic movement between the stereo channels.) Sadly, this gives problems in the soundscape that sound very odd to our modern, 48 track hearing. Like having the drums crowded into the left channel, along with the guitars, maracas, keyboards, while the vocals and the Bass, or lead guitar, get stuck in the other channel. Of course, this is why the MONO editions were given such focus, until 8 track recording made the stereo soundscape more balanced.  Still, for clarity, definition, and distinction (like finger cymbals or keyboard parts played low, around middle \\"C\\"), this remastered edition is just fantastic.<br /><br />The other goodies that you get with the REMASTERED version of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, is a VASTY IMPROVED booklet. For those you had the original Vinyl of this album, you know it came with a \\"comic book\\" in the middle, that had lots of photos and these drawings that told the \\"story\\" behind the movie the Beatles made in 1967 called MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. I often wondered WHY they didnt reproduce this booklet in the first CD edition, but the new 38 page booklet finally fixes that problem. IT also has some recording notes, and a mini essay about how this album fits into the Beatles Discography. The layout of the new cardboard CD holder is pretty cool. It opens up into three panels, like a triplyct. The first panel shows the cover, that also holds the thick booklet. The next two inner panels combine to show all four Beatles looking out the top of the Magical Mystery Tour bus (it had a skylight opening). In the third panel you find the CD slipped in, but without a CD \\"record cover\\" as you normally see these \\"Vinyl reproduction\\" gatefold albums, so you need to be careful pulling the CDs out to prevent surface scruffs. When you fold in the gatefold panels, you have outside one panel a full color reproduction of the photograph taken for the SINGLE sleeve of STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER. (The fab 4 with bright floodlights around them, overexposing the film.) All in all, the design and layout are a HUGE improvement on the first CD release. Even the CD itself is printed like the old PARLOPHONE LPs.  And lastly, here's a word about the 3-4 minute mini documentary.  I was worried that my 10 year old MAC may not play it, but the QUICKTIME documentary will play on MACS with G4 or G5 processors, and anything past a OS X.3, or any PC with at least a pentium 3. Themini-doc shows a little bit of the first 5 song's \\"videos\\" from the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR FILM.  While the edited \\"videos\\" play, there's voice overs from the guys, including JOHN's famous statement about this album being his favorite, cos its so wierd, and cos its the album where I AM THE WALRUS was placed.  Paul defends the film, as usual. Then, they continue the voice overs, while you see bits of the promo films for HELLO GOODBYE, PENNY LANE, and STAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER.  As for studio chatter, there's a couple of bits, but not that much.  I didnt own the Magical Mystery Tour DVD, I would have thought much more of this particular mini documentary.  I am certain of one thing. The guys at APPLE wanted to make sure this sound remastering was done right, and would be the LAST WORD in upgrades for a long time. (At least until they do go back and remix from the original four tracks, and put out AUDIO DVDS.  I wouldnt hold your breathe, tho.)<br /><br />All in all, there's enough sound quality improvement here to make it well worth buying. If you dont want to replace your whole BEATLES CD collection, I suggest just buying one of the REMASTERS, just to put your toe in the water.  Even tho I've always loved this album for the songs on it, I'd still buy WHITE ALBUM as a first pick, maybe even ABBEY ROAD. Since they were both recorded on 8 track, there's just that much more clarity, from the lack of bouncing down of tracks. The stereo soundscape was much improved by then as well. But whatever REMASTERED CD you buy, know this: You are hearing EXACTLY what George Martin and the Beatles heard, when they played back the master tapes in ABBEY ROADS studio. For some the sound improvment might only be subtle, but for me, any improvement to the BEATLES catalouge is VAST.  The improved artwork, the quick time documentaries, etc is just icing on the cake.

B0010YPTGU|5.0|Two of the greatest voices on planet earth Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman perform on this exquisitely produced dvd/cd combination. I   enjoyed the dvd tremendously and must say that the other supporting artitses were all flawless in their performances. Particular mention must be made of Heather Headley she was magnificent. To borrow a line from \\"tcm\\" this dvd is one of the essentials. highly recommended. .

B0000793ZB|4.0|Yes, I know.     Fans of early Simple Minds (which includes me, I suppose) despise their more commercial work of the mid 80's. And it's true that 'Once Upon A Time' feels like a real sellout after their groundbreaking work of the late 70's and early 80's. The complex, experimental arrangements have been pared back to straightforward rock riffs, and Jim Kerr's enigmatic lyrics have been replaced by stadium-ready banality like 'la la la la la' and 'wo ho ho ho'. Of course those of us who delighted in 'Premonition' or 'Thirty Frames a Second' or 'Love Song' will be disappointed with this direction.    However, taken on its merits alone, 'Once Upon a Time' is a strong stadium-rock album. Muscular riffs, catchy melodies, anthemic lyrics, and massive choruses. Jim Kerr's bombastic voice is well suited to such an arrangement, and the musicians seem to know that the aim is to outdo each other in sounding as loud as possible. It can get a little overwhelming, and probably works better in Wembley Stadium than your home stereo, but there's no denying Simple Minds' passion or enthusiasm for its music.     So, yes, this is a blatant grab for commercial glory.  And, yes, such a move is a let-down after their previous artistic triumphs.    But the move pays off. Why not make such anthemic stadium pop/rock if you're good at it?
B0016A2FFG|4.0|Forget all those $2 R&B stars, starlets and posers, like Trey Songz, The-Dream, Ashanti etc etc etc. THIS is one of the best contemporary soul discs there is out today, period. And I'd go as far as say it equals some of Al Green's past greats as well. There are just so many good and delicious songs in here: \\"Lay It Down\\", \\"Standing In The Rain\\", \\"You've Got The Love I Need\\", \\"Just For Me\\"...     It's also a true testament to how talented Ahmir \\"?uestlove\\" Thompson and his producing partner James Poyser are. Not forgetting the main man, of course, whose voice hasn't changed (or aged) one bit.     Just a few uneven songs keep me from giving this a full 5 stars.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|This is actually pretty good movie  - although it has a predictable ending.  It continues the story of the lush life of four girlfriends from a TV Series.<br /><br />Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her friends continue to show off beautiful dresses, shoes and purses.  A fashion show that helps designers sell their clothes I am sure.  Not a bad marketing idea...<br /><br />The movie turns out to be an interesting romantic comedy that continues after four years have passed from the TV series.  The film begins with everyone married but Carrie at 40 years of age.  Carrie and Mr. Big (Chris Noth) decide to get married as a practical idea as they search for an apartment together.  It should be in both of their names and each contribute equally to the costs.  Carrie buys a practical dress and settles for a small wedding with 75 people.  Somehow the plans snowball to a wedding with 200 guests, a designer wedding gown and a fancy location (Library with many romance novels.)  Mr. Big backs out and Carrie is devastated beyond belief - same old story.  Her friends Charlotte (Kristin Davis), Samantha (Kim Kattrall), and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) go down to a Mexican Resort with Carrie to help her heal and forget the man who ripped her heart out.<br /><br />Carrie and friends return to their lives and sub-plots on each are shown.  In the end Cinderella gets her prince, and let's hope this is the final chapter.  It ends on a high note with all loose ends tied nicely.
B002BSHWUU|2.0|When I heard there was going to be a re-released version of the Beatles Stunning catalog, I was thrilled.  I have EVERYTHING they have ever done on numerous mediums(...vinyl, cassette, cd...).  I am an obsessed fan!!! I am also a musician who writes and records my own material.  I am very familiar with recording studio techniques and I must say I am DISSAPOINTED with these mixes!!!!    Why am I dissapointed??  Though I am a purist, I wish they TOTALLY REMIXED these albums and corrected the insane 1960s PANNING techniques!  Though it is sometimes charming to hear ALL of the vocals coming out of the Right channel of the audio spectrum, it is also annoying.  It is great for learning or dicovering intricate details of these recordings, but it is ALSO VERY DATED!!!!! RUBBER SOUL,and REVOLVER are the worst offenders. These mixes don't sound all that different.  I spent the whole day comparing these mixes to the 1987 mixes (back and forth in real time).  The major differences are in the Bass.  McCartney's Rickenbacker bass has never sounded better...especially on Sgt. Pepper.  Other than that, not much different....THE NEW MIXES ARRE DEFINATELY LOUDER.    I LOVE the Yellow Submarine Songtrack and the LET IT BE NAKED CDs because they are TRUE REMIXES that sound INCREDIBLE (and Modern).  THEY HAVE GUTS TO THEM. They do not sound dated.  With 1960s production and panning, an entire drum kit can be drowned out with a tamborine (example: the chorus in \\"HELP!\\")    LISTEN TO THE WHO's MY GENERATION DELUXE EDITION stereo remixes.  I don't know what they did to those tracks but they sound like they were recorded 2 days ago, and that was The Who's first album.  The drums are crystal clear in a way Moon's drums have NEVER sounded before and the mixes shine...THAT IS WHAT I WISHED THESE NEW BEATLES RELEASES SOUNDED LIKE!!!!!!!!    Sorry, but that is MY opinion and I may tick off true sound purists, but how much money are they going to try to milk out of us consumers...WE ALL HAVE THESE ALBUMS often 3 TIMES OVER....GIVE US NEW MATERIAL for our MONEY!!!!    Anyone who argues with me about this, wait 5 or 6 years until they decide to milk more money out of us and RE-RE-Release these albums IN A REMIXED FORM with corrected panning and Modern gimmicks.    THEY SAID THEY DID THIS TO BRING THE BEATLES' MUSIC INTO MODERN TIMES AND UPDATE IT FOR NEW GENERATIONS TO COME....WELL,   WHY DIDN'T THEY???????
B000ZLFALI|3.0|\\"Across the Universe\\" is a musical with Beatles songs. But do we really need another Beatle musical (after \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\") when we already have \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" \\"Help!\\" \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and \\"Let it Be\\"? How about fabulous \\"Yellow Submarine\\"? But of course, I may be wrong. After all, it's the Beatles and you can't go wrong with their great songs, but as far as \\"Across the Universe\\" is concerned, I am not still sure.     You either love or hate \\"Across the Universe\\" which is directed by Julie Taymor. Her works as film director include \\"Titus\\" and \\"Frida\\" and if you have seen her previous works, which some viewers call creative while others, well, pretentious, you know that storytelling is not her forte.     Because so many reviewers have already summarized the plot (or the lack of it) I will not go into the details of it. In short, a young man from Liverpool Jude (Jim Sturgess) meets Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) in America and they fall in love with each other. The time is set in the 1960s, politically and socially turbulent years.    So far, it is good. But the romance of Jude and Lucy needs a better story. Their story is clichéd, disjointed, and their romance is uninvolving. Moreover, \\"Across the Universe\\" runs more than 130 minutes, which is 40 minutes too long.    But you might say it is a musical and it is music that matters. Unfortunately our Jude is no Paul and his singing is just passable. Besides, it seems some songs are randomly chosen, which do not fit in the story. Visually intriguing as it is, for example, the musical sequence featuring John Lennon's \\"I Want You\\" sequence is rather pointless, with one bizarre idea of \\"She's So Heavy.\\"     Also, many references to the Beatles songs and the group member's background (Jude's father, for instance) are thrown in. They are mildly amusing at first, but soon start to look shallow, even silly. You remember the song \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window.\\" Yes, she really does.    Some musical scenes are really brilliant (\\"I've Just Seen a Face\\" in a bowling ally scene and Joe Cocker's \\"Come Together\\" with a nice choreography). But as I said, you can't go wrong with the Beatles songs.

My favorite cookbook - grimy and a bit dogeared from constant use.
0756405890|4.0|There are a lot of reviews about this book already, many whom go into greater detail than I will in this review.  I agree with both the glowing reviews and the negative critiques, because I sort of feel that this book can easily be divided into the section about the older Kvothe (which I thought was pretty abominably written) and younger Kvothe (which I thought was much better).      The book starts out (and is interspersed) with older Kvothe (which takes place in his inn), who I agree is a huge Mary Sue type character.  He is a legend in this world, and doted on by a supporting character Bast (who would be interesting, if he did anything else other than fawn over Kvothe).  I agree with the criticisms that say that Kvothe is not a very sympathetic (yes that was an intentional pun) character, but I like older Kvothe far less than younger Kvothe.  Perhaps it is because the author tries so hard to make Kvothe seem like a perfect person who has been beaten down by life experiences; i.e. he has Seen Horrible Things and Experienced Much Pain.  However, he tries to keep the reader in the dark and in suspense for as long as he can - the result is that Kvothe comes off as unbelievably cliched.  I laughed all the way through the first few chapters not just because of the character, but because Rothfuss's metaphors (particularly the about the three types of silence) were incredibly labored.  Again, I think he tried too hard - this time, it was to make his writing flow lyrically, to evoke meaningful imagery, and to be poetic.  He overdid it, and comes off sounding pretentious instead.    When Kvothe starts relating his personal history, the writing style changes.  Rothfuss goes into great detail about the culture and politics of the world, of the things young Kvothe sees.  Yes, the book is rather long, and he does cover a lot of minutiae, but I like reading about the environment (even many of his detractors say that Rothfuss is great at world building).  I appreciate the details about his magic system, sympathy (see the pun in the previous paragraph).  And yes Kvothe is incredibly smart, gifted, dexterous, talented, what-have-you, but I think young Kvothe stayed just on the right side of being a Mary Sue.  Why?  Because he was not perfect.  Because not everyone fawned over him.  Because although he had enough intelligence and other talents to justify his arrogance, he suffered for his hubris.  He was indeed a jerk and made stupid, immature decisions like any inexperienced 15-year-old, despite his being extra clever.  He was punished/faced fairly serious consequences for these bad decisions.  For instance, there were many times when he was an orphan that he was offered help, rejected it, and starved or was beaten as a result.  His stubbornness and impatience caused him no end of money trouble and academic problems (for instance, being banned from the University library).  While, like many negative reviewers, I did not relate to young Kvothe very much, I did not feel like I had to to enjoy his story.  The world and its mechanics were interesting, and Kvothe did not lead a charmed enough life to seriously annoy me.  And Rothfuss's writing style during most of the young Kvothe parts was much more readable than the parts with older Kvothe.  I really wish the supporting characters were fleshed out more though - some of them seem to be very interesting (the librarian and the naming professor, for instance).  I also wish the other University students were less flat (they seemed to have even less personality than the professors).    I would give the young Kvothe parts 4 (I overall enjoyed reading it) stars, and the old Kvothe parts 2 (I did not like it overall).  I give the whole book 4 stars instead of 3 because I cannot give it a 3.5 and because, despite the flaws, it was a compelling read (to me 3 implies a neutral opinion).  There were some parts that were bad enough that reading them sort of jarred me out of the flow of reading, and there were parts I thought were brilliant, but I think it was good overall.  (There also weren't nearly as many parts with old Kvothe and the inn as with young Kvothe.)    Edit:  Also, for Kindle readers - the book was very readable.  I only noticed one typo where there was no space between two words - there may have been more, but it wasn't obvious.[[ASIN:B000UG78NG The Name of the Wind]]
0385493622|5.0|Simon Singh is among the very best science non-fiction writers. Though I am interested in the underlying subject matter, Mr. Singh's treatment of the material never fails to draw the reader in, regardless of their level with the underlying components.    At the heart of this story is an amazingly simple equation (which I will not state here). Its a testament to the beauty of mathematics, that something so simple could be quite so complicated. My hats off to Andrew Wiles for proving the theorem, it is surely an event for the ages. And under Simon Singh's careful direction, this story turns epic.    Anyone with a passing appreciation to mathematics owes themselves a read of this book.

The \\"Other Mother\\" was very creepy, and I found myself up during the middle of the night taking peeks at the artwork.  It is definately too scary for my 6 yr old.  I'm wondering if the movie is less intimidating and less frightening.  I have yet to see it.  But I can recommend this as a great graphic novel...the art is great and the concept is first rate creepy.
159562015X|2.0|I bought this book hoping to learn what my strengths are, how to improve and utilize them, and what might be the best careers for me. Unfortunately, this book failed to deliver on any of those expectations.    The book itself requires a ONE TIME ONLY test that you have to take online, which amounts to a personality test. The test results are EXACTLY the same as the results written in the book. Honestly, I don't know why they distribute a whole book, its a waste of paper since the website is better in every way.    Honestly, you could achieve the same results by taking any number of online personality tests, and then looking up your personality type in a standard psych book. If you were hoping to find some direction on how to use your strengths, look elsewhere.    This book is based on an interesting premise, but there is little substance to this that you cannot find elsewhere.    I hope this review deters at least one person from wasting their money as I have (this book is NOT REFUNDABLE once the entry code on the back page is opened).

B001GKJ2FM|1.0|My mother in law LOVES this movie so I was coerced into watching it last night.  It was TERRIBLE!  First I don't like watching grown women running around and squealing like 12 year olds at a pajama party.  I mean how old are these people?  The whole cast acted like 12 year olds.  High School Musical was more mature!  But the defining moment came when Remington Steele (Brosnan) and Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) became complete and total buffoons.  I grew up with Remington Steele and Brosnan will always be Remington Steele to me, comical yet sophisicated and elegant.  Colin Firth in A&E's production of Pride & Prejudice was brilliant as Mr. Darcy.  I expected more mature and serious roles of Brosnan and Firth.  I mean did they intentionally want to play buffoons because they certainly did a good job at it.  I suffered in silence until Brosnan started singing 'I Do, I Do, etc.' and then I lost it.  How ridiculous!  Yeah right.  He's loved her for 21 years.  Sure. Until then I just found the movie immature and childish; that performance made it a complete and total joke.  The only saving aspect of this movie was the music, and that was pretty much ruined by the terrible performance of Brosnan.  The other singers were tolerable but very lacking compared to the broadway musical and ABBA itself.  This wasn't a 'feel good' movie; it was an embarassment and painful to watch.

B000001E3V|5.0|This is a classic performance of Eric Clapton in concert with the band minus Duane. Eric & the band cover songs from studio album minus Layla, as well as 2 Blind Faith numbers and Eric's 1st solo classic : Let it Rain  All I can say is this is a historic concert not to me missed .
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|I was very pleased with this movie, it was amazing. However, I'm displeased with the fact that there was nothing in the case other than the movie. Methinks it was Amazon's attempt to decrease the shipping costs that they had to pay for.
1400063736|5.0|This book is more like a collection of interrelated short stories than a novel.  Each chapter introduces a new character, usually related to the previous characters.  They are all connected via their relation to the historic moment when Philip Petit walked a tight rope between the twin towers of the world trade center, shortly before their completion in 1974.    The chapters vary in style and quality, but the good ones are really very good.  The author uses beautiful poetic, emotional language, and the strong parts of the book range from ecstatic to heartbreaking.  The beginning of the book is a bit slow, but I recommend that you stick it out for at least the first quarter.  If you haven't been moved by that point (which is hard for me to imagine), then this book is not for you.    More about the language:  The book is written in a staccato style.  Lots of sentence fragments.  Sometimes more like poetry than prose.  Not always making sense.  But beautiful.  Sometimes I felt that the language was not entirely authentic, that is sometimes it did not sound like a New York novel, but rather an Irish novel about New York.  But this can be forgiven.    I have heard it claimed that this book is a 9/11 novel.  I don't buy it.  It has the world trade center and it has tragedy, but aside from that I can see no relation to 9/11.  However it is still a beautiful book.
1416914307|5.0|If you like romance, actionm drama and tons of comedy mixed up into story with fantastical characters and creatures then this is a great book for you. The story was very good, but really predictable. It might have just been me, because i do always guess how movies and stories end, but it just seemed like Clare was trying to be like Rowling and give us a minor detail of something and make it a big story-turning event, Clare just doesn't execute it sucessfully. I give this book a 5 of 5 review because i loved every minute of it and i don't think it could have been any better (in the story line itself).
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I was skeptical about this remaster project at first. But after listening to the great sound quality on Sgt Pepper I'm very enthusiastic. I'm a huge fan of Paul McCartney's bass playing, and this remaster makes all those great bass lines come alive with a remarkable presence, clarity, and fullness of sound that really helps you recognize what a brilliant player he was. And finally, we get to hear Ringo's drums with a clear, present sound that adds a wonderful crisp, snap to the music. If those were the only improvements I would still say this remaster is well worth having. However, there are many other enhancements that make this updated album an absolute delight to listen to. The sound of the background vocal harmony on With a Little Help...is stunning, and She's Leaving Home has a vividness and clarity to the vocals and strings that brings this masterpiece to another level. I recommend listening to this on a good component system with the volume turned up a bit to really bring out all the nuances. If you love the Beatles, and you enjoy focused listening to the intricacies of sound and music then you should get this CD. Five stars...Highly recommended.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|I do not normally like westerns but Jimmy Stewart is becoming one of my favorite actors, including in the westerns.  This movie has much suspense and is not boring.  It keeps you engaged in it and has some very lovely romance too.  What surprised me, however, was that the movie began with the end and went back to the beginning to tell the whole story.   That you need to know, but it is a very good movie.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this CD.  It had most of Michael Jackson greatest hits.  Love it.

B000UAFDP2|4.0|There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version.  Troopers has more pluses, but the BD version does highlight flaws more that were less noticeable in DVD.<br /><br />I can now discern details on the actors make-up, such as battle injuries, that are no longer realistic.  The CGI lacks texture and resolution, some battle cruisers look like toy models others like CGI, and I can discern the difference between CGI insects or set models.  Some insects had obvious spray paint, and remind me of the toys you'd buy at a Discovery Channel store or a museum gift shop.  The video was a bit grainy, as I had my BD player set for high sharpness, and I was able to select a less sharp setting to reduce this artifact.  Actor's clothing no longer looked space-age, but the material seemed somewhere between WalMart and Lands End.  Note, the better BD programs, such as Brad Pitt's Troy or HBO's Band of Brothers, is so well made my fine setting does not create such artifacts.<br /><br />The audio is clear and sharp but lacks imaging, so the effects do not use 5.1 sound to great effect.<br /><br />Disk extras are identical to the DVD version, and in DVD quality.  The BD-Live supports picture in picture, and what it does is play commentary with video simultaneously with the main movie, but in a tiny PIP.  It hardly does anything more that had the commentary audio track played simultaneously, like in the DVD.<br /><br />Many BD player manuals state clearly you need external memory, usually an SD card or USB drive, to run BD-Live.  Knowing that ahead of time, my disk ran without a hitch, but it took over 1 minute to boot longer than none BD-Live disks.  I simply put whatever SD card I had lying around, a 32MB card ran fine, but maybe it needs more to run speedier.  Note, if you remove the extra memory the disk will not boot.<br /><br />While BD-Live seems like a nice addition, I find the software and game like capacity it provides crude compared to any DVD or online game, thus its more annoying than a benefit.  These extra features never really caught on in the DVD world, so I am not hopeful for BD-Live.<br /><br />BD is best as a high quality movie transport medium, so I hope makers focus on this and make all video on BD disk as best quality available as the main movie, and pay less attention to the effects that we see in BD-Live.hus its more annoying than a benefit.

B002A4Q652|3.0|Delain was my first forray into symphonic metal, or what ever you want to call the genre. I don't even remember how I stumbled onto them except I do know it was an accident. I'm an old timer and a hard rock fan from way back. I heard Delain and thought WOW! Who are these guys? Of course I promptly looked them up on amazon and bought the cd. I quickly discovered all the bands doing this type of music ie. Nightwish, Within Temptation, The Gathering and many more and my pocketbook has taken a big hit as I've gotten more and more of this sort of music.    I have been anticipating this new cd from Delain for a long time. Strangely though, I find myself disappointed. Why? I'm not really sure. The songs are nice enough. The singing is fine. The band is tight. It just doesn't seem to have the bite that Lucidity did. Maybe it's because I'm now more familiar with this great type of music and have heard the best of the best. Maybe I just expected too much. Maybe I expected some growth. I just don't know.    Don't get me wrong, it's a good cd and I'm sure it will get plenty of replays from me. I like it.   Don't hesitate to get this cd as it is good. It's just not as good as I expected.
0307269981|5.0|Meet Lisbeth Salander, a Swede. She is 26 years old, stands 4-feet-11, weighs less than 90 pounds. Multiple piercings and tattoos. Is a superhacker and gets by as a freelance investigator for Milton Security. Sleeps with men and women, as it suits her. Dresses in black. Knows martial arts. Has a photographic memory. Is a ward of the state and has a guardian. She has at least one secret identify.<br /><br />And she can react with shocking violence when provoked. Seriously. Do not piss her off. She is dynamite in a tiny package.<br /><br />Lisbeth came to light in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" the first in Stieg Larsson's Millenium trilogy. In that book, she first met Blomkvist, the disgraced journalist and publisher of Millenium, a muckraking magazine. They were hired to discover the fate of a girl who disappeared nearly 40 years ago. They also go after a crooked financier. The revelations were horrifically perverse, the ending violent. Rate these books a hard R.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" starts out about a year after the conclusion of events in \\"Tattoo.\\" Blomkvist is back at the helm of his magazine in Stockholm. He and his staff are working with a freelance journalist and his wife on an expose of sex trafficking in Sweden and the story is going to name names, including cops, judges, politicians, etc., who make money importing prostitutes from the Baltic states. On the side, Blomkvist's still conducting his not-very-secret love affair with his editor-in-chief, Berger, who is married to someone else.<br /><br />For her part, Lisbeth is island-hopping in the Carribean, spending her stolen fortune (see earlier book). She has a little adventure involving a hurricane and a wife-beater. I'll leave it at that, but the scene is a taste of what she's capable of. She returns to Stockholm and checks in on her guardian, a detestable lawyer who hates and fears her, who she is keeping on a short leash with information that would put him in jail if revealed. She rents a luxurious apartment (under her secret identity) and begins stocking it with furniture. She hooks up with an old pal, a lesbian, to show off her new breast implants (Lisbeth was really flat chested before).<br /><br />All is just fine until one night the freelance writer and his wife are murdered in their apartment. Across town, Lisbeth's  guardian is also found murdered. All were shot with the same gun, which is found immediately. It has Lisbeth's fingerprints on it. Her photo is on the front page of every newspaper in Sweden the next day. She is a target for the whole nation.<br /><br />At this point, the novelist does something risky.  Lisbeth disappears from the novel for about 100 pages. Three separate investigations get under way -- the police, Millenium magazine and Milton Security. A lot of characters crowd into the novel, including cops (both honest and crooked), reporters, private investigators, motorcycle outlaws, mental health professionals, even a boxing instructor. Nearly all of them, of course, have Swedish names. American readers might have trouble keeping track, You might want mark pages to refer back to if you forget who someone is.<br /><br />It's a thrilling moment when Lisbeth resurfaces, sending Blomkvist a dramatic e-mail. They begin parallel investigations. Lisbeth is roaming Stockholm in disguise. She escapes trap after trap. Her lesbian friend is kidnapped, leading to a smashing (literally) rescue scene. In an incredibly cinematic scene, Lisbeth gets cornered by two armed and hulking motorcycle outlaws. It becomes evident there are people who really, really hate her. The book races to a conclusion that has Lisbeth, at one point, gun in one pocket and Taser in another, leaving mayhem in her wake as she blisters down the highway on a stolen Harley.<br /><br />Dismaying revelations about Lisbeth's upbringing emerge during all this and the reader comes to realize that deep inside this ruthless and fearless young female warrior is a once-frightened and badly damaged little girl.<br /><br />A word of WARNING: I liked this better than \\"Tattoo,\\" which has more complexity but less adrenaline. Also, less of Lisbeth. But \\"Fire\\" contains a MAJOR SPOILER to the first novel. Highly recommended you read \\"Tattoo\\" first.<br /><br />The book is seamlessly translated into English. One oddity, though -- The spelling is British (criticise, programme), but vehicle velocity is in miles per hour, which is American.<br /><br />As those reading these posts know, Larrson died after completing only three in the Millenium books. The third and final novel has already caused a sensation in Europe, but has not yet been published in English. I may have to learn Swedish.<br /><br />Coffee. Lots of coffee. Must be a Swedish thing.<br /><br />The ending is a total cliffhanger. From what I understand, the third book begins at the very moment this novel ends.NG: I liked this better than \\"Tattoo,\\" which has more complexity but less adrenaline. Also, less of Lisbeth.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|Saying this remaster of the White Album sounds better than the 1987 release is not really saying much.  Technology has moved forward, and that includes the facilities at Abbey Road. What is impressive is that I detected this without having a state of the art system at home. My home system is good, but not great. I thought I should test this remastered version on a friend's system (a higher end system) and once I did the differences became more apparent, as I thought they would. We kept the volume constant and switched between the 1987 release and the new one. We listened to portions of each track and, yes, the remastered White Album sounds better. The bass has more punch. The vocals are clearer. Horns and strings have definition not present on the previous release. I guess my friend shared my delusion. He agreed with me. I have one additional note. The remastered version is only marginally louder, which is a good thing. The engineers at Abbey Road did not compress the hell out of the songs. The dynamics are there.
B00260HH3K|1.0|i heard this sucked before i bought it but because im such a huge fan i had to watch it,  omg ok ok characters dont look like the characters why not i guess the acters didnt want to act-- story was nothing like the cartoon wait a sec they probably never watched it!!!! before making this!!! beware cgi was horrible i almost died when i saw piccilo really i think they watched the first half of movie and said it was doodoo and threw crap in to end it fight scene was 2sec lol totally not dragon ball, ok give me 1,000,000 ill make dragon ball z ill start it off with freeza and spend more time with this --- 1* if i could i would put it at negative 10-- by the way if u see this dude playing goku punch him in his face for destroying this terrible all the way
B001AQTWF2|3.0|I PURCHASED WHITNEY'S NEW CD THE DAY IT WAS RELEASED, AND, NO, IT IS NOT ONE OF HER BEST AT ALL.  WHAT WE ALL SHOULD CONSIDER IS SHE'S BEEN IN \\"DISPOSE\\" FOR QUITE A WHILE AND WHAT SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH.  I FINALLY LISTENED TO THIS NEW CD IN ITS ENTIRETY THIS MORNING ON MY WAY TO WORK (I DRIVE QUITE A LONG DISTANCE) AND THE CD TITLE SONG, \\"I LOOK TO YOU\\" IS PRETTY GOOD, BUT THAT #10 SONG, \\"I GOT YOU\\" IS AN EXCELLENT ONE TO ME....I LOVE IT!  HER VOICE, OF COURSE, IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE, BUT \\"ALL\\" THINGS CHANGE.  I HEARD SHE WAS STILL SMOKING (CIGARETTES!), AND THAT IS PROBABLY MOST CERTAINLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HER VOICE IS NOT THE SAME (STOP SMOKING, WHITNEY!!!), ALONG WITH, SHE \\"IS\\" OLDER!      THE CD IS NOT TERRIBLE AND NEITHER IS HER VOICE.  SHE JUST NEEDS TO SING MORE AND DO MORE WORK ON THAT VOICE OF HERS TO STRENGTHEN IT.  I GUESS WE ALL COMPARE WHAT WE USED TO HEAR COME OUT OF HER MOUTH.....SO, NOW, LET'S JUST GET USED TO SOMETHING \\"DIFFERENT\\"........GIVE WHITNEY A CHANCE!!    \\"PEPPER\\"

B0025T65GC|5.0|I've been a fan of Devin Townsend since Ocean Machine and have thoroughly enjoyed his solo stuff since. Ki is no exception as it is a brilliant album! Devin hired a group of talented and unique artists to play on this album and it comes through in the music. It sounds like nothing he has ever written before with clean guitars, at times a sort of funky, bluesy sound that is extremely catchy. Ki will have you listening to it over and over again.    In my opinion Devin has also written his most beautiful song ever in Terminal. It somehow brought me back to my childhood, very chilling...in a good way.    I've thought for years that DT was one of the most talented musicians in music and Ki only confirms this even more.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|great movie only 1 thing,,, the ending on dvd and blu ray was not the same as in theaters--- acting was intense bale was well batman lol a great role for him the joker wasnt a bad guy he was a gangster, loved this movie purchase it for ur collection!!!!
B002NHBNWW|4.0|I think this will be a great series.  However the free preview film was horrible!!  It was like a stop action slide show.  It would freeze and go and freeze and go all the while the dialog would continue.  It makes it hard to follow because the dialog was ahead of the stop and go images.  If you could get it to work properly I'd love to see it again so it makes better sense!!

B001KVZ6FW|1.0|This is a product review. There are many positive reviews of the movie itself, and I agree it's a wonderful movie..up to Pixar's standards.   BUT:   Disney seems to think that they can take advantage of the consumers merely because this is a Pixar film. Notice:    The SINGLE disc set contains:  The movie  Dug's Special Mission  Partly Cloudy    The TWO-disc Edition contains:    DISC ONE:  The movie   Dug's Special Mission  Partly Cloudy  Commentary  The Many Endings of Muntz  Documentary    Disc Two:  Digital copy ONLY...no other special features on disc two...    If the second disc of this \\"TWO-disc Special edition\\" only contains the digital copy, then technically speaking, the first disc could (and/or should) be EXACTLY the same for both the single and two-disc versions.     Some people would rather have ALL of the bonus features and NO digital copy. What's more: the digital copy requires a special code to access it, and the code expires...so it's not really a \\"two-disc\\" deluxe version for very long.    For those who complain about the Blu-ray version, I feel your pain as well. Even so, I would appreciate it if Disney put all of those \\"Blu-ray exlcusive\\" features on regular DVD as well..maybe if those were included as part of the \\"Two-disc\\" version, then it wouldn't look as bad.     Even the makers of the Luxo Lamp have noticed Disney's ridiculous attempt at corporate greed for this film. They are suing Disney for offering a replica Luxo Jr. Lamp with a limited number of copies of the blu-ray version of UP. Disney didn't have the right to the lamp, and message boards are claiming that the replica is largely plastic (versus the actual metal Luxo lamp). Disney is trying to sell an inferior product, and they deserve the lawsuit.      As much as I want to buy this film, I am simply disgusted with Disney and Buena Vista Home Entertainment for their ridiculous DVD treatment of this film.    I miss the day when only one superb version of the film was released for one price, i.e., Finding Nemo...

B00006G8HX|4.0|Quickly following the events of \\"Star Trek II:  The Wrath Of Khan,\\" \\"Star Trek III:  The Search For Spock\\" takes the filmgoer on a highly unusual \\"rescue\\" mission.  This go-round finds Kirk, McCoy, and the rest of the crew (minus Spock, who sacrificed himself to save the others) returning to the friendly confines of the Federation for rest and, unbeknownst to them, the decommissioning of their beloved Enterprise.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Federation starship Grissom is studying the newly alive Genesis planet and discovers a lifeform on its surface.  Kirk's son, David (Merritt Butrick) and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis) journey down to the planet's surface to investigate.  What they find is a young Vulcan boy who is rapidly growing.  They also find that the Genesis project isn't quite as successful as they believed.  The planet is quickly deteriorating and will soon destroy itself.<br /><br />Having acquired information about the Genesis project and planning to use the Genesis device as a powerful weapon, Klingon commander Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) sets a course for Genesis.  Couple this with a visit to Kirk from Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), who reveals to Kirk that Spock's \\"katra\\" was placed inside one of the surviving Enterprise crewmembers and must be retrieved along with Spock's body in order to properly put him to rest back on Vulcan, and you have the stage set for an exciting space opera.<br /><br />In order to make it back to Genesis, Kirk and company steal the Enterprise.  It's a bold maneuver that Kirk knows will be costly, but he is determined to help his old friend.  When the Enterprise arrives at Genesis, they find the Grissom destroyed and face-off against Kruge, who has Saavik, David, and the Vulcan boy held hostage on the planet's surface.  Kirk realizes that the boy is Spock, and now he must try to save his son and his best friend.<br /><br />From this point, the film turns into an especially emotional struggle for Kirk.  Kruge gains the upperhand on the Enterprise almost immediately, and uses his hostages as pawns in a game of wits with Kirk.<br /><br />Who survives the outcome?  You might be a bit surprised if you haven't yet watched this third installment of the Star Trek film franchise.<br /><br />While Khan was a powerful foe in \\"Star Trek II\\" (and quite possibly the greatest villain in all of Trekdom), I have to admit that Christopher Lloyd does an excellent job as Kruge.  He forces Kirk's hand in ways that will shock the viewer.  While it's quite hard today to see Lloyd as anybody but Doc Brown from \\"Back to the Future,\\" his portrayal of Kruge is good enough that the \\"flux capacitor\\" takes a backseat while the renegade Klingon is on the screen.<br /><br />William Shatner delivers one of his best performances as Admiral Kirk.  Kirk goes on an emotional rollercoaster ride in this installment, but manages to keep his composure under immense pressure.<br /><br />Nichelle Nichols (Uhura) is relegated to a small supporting role, but she does have one very hilarious moment that was a highlight of the film.  Walter Koenig (Chekov), James Doohan (Scotty) and George Takei (Sulu) have somewhat larger roles, but their characters aren't challenged as much as Kirk or even McCoy.  McCoy, by the way, shines each and every time he's on the screen in this film.  DeForest Kelley is brilliant this time around, being both humorous and caring at the same time.  Robin Curtis does a solid job as Saavik, as does Merritt Butrick as Kirk's son.<br /><br />While it's been stated that the odd numbered Trek films have always been the worst ones, I have to say that \\"The Search For Spock\\" stands above the pack for two reasons:  1)  It is one of the most emotionally tugging films in the entire series and 2)  It manages to be a solid stand alone film despite acting as a bridge to the fourth film, \\"The Voyage Home.\\"<br /><br />Nimoy does a solid job as a director, holding together a plot that could have easily fallen apart due to its somewhat outlandish setting.  The film's score, provided by James Horner, is wonderful.<br /><br />The special effects are sketchy at times, but they get it right at key moments in the film, especially in the space battles.<br /><br />The fight sequences aren't up to par with other hand-to-hand combat scenes in other films from the franchise, but I have to admit that Sulu does have one of the best fight scenes in all of the Trek films in \\"The Search for Spock.\\"<br /><br />This particualr DVD offers numerous extras.  Highlights include commentary from Nimoy and an interesting (if rather dryly delivered) explanation of the development of the Klingon language for the film (and the future of the franchise).  Oh, and there's an interesting Easter Egg for those Trekkers willing to hunt for it.<br /><br />With exceptional highs, powerful emotion, and just a few miscues, \\"Star Trek III:  The Search for Spock\\" is a fine addition to the Trek universe.  It's a mandatory purchase for Trek fans, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys their space opera with plenty of emotion.wonderful.

B001P1L606|1.0|This may be the biggest pile of drivel I have ever heard.Please give me my money back.
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|this movie fooled me, the effects were amazing the story was so boring, the trailer completely was a lie to the story, the acting was good hopefully next time it will be action packed like its preview.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|his songs became a part of our lives and he was mesmerizing to watch.  This CD gives you some of his best  and will be enjoyed by die hard MJ fans and newbies as well.  I dare you not to sing and dance along!  Enjoy!

B0025KVLTW|3.0|Magical Mystery Tour seems like a close brother to Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band.  I think if you have either album and are looking for more of the same then you will want both albums.  Maybe there is enough material hear to assemble a better \\"concept\\" album than what Sgt. Pepper was--not better song quality, but better relation between songs--maybe not.<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour - This songs gets this collection of songs off to an exciting start just as does \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" on that album, but this time there is no reprise.  The orchestrations and rhythm change as the chorus returns in the latter part of the song are great.  A quiet brief piano solo at the end contrasts the song's grandiosity with sadness, as if the tour is already over and the circus is leaving town.<br /><br />The Fool on the Hill - Quieter song about the fool/wise man.  Is he crazy or are we?  Funny ol' dude...<br /><br />Flying - A Beatles instrumental?  Who'd a thought...  Mellow, not particulary exciting; perhaps shows that the Beatles were not such great instrumentalists.  Still...if this is the only instrumental song they recorded, that fact alone makes this song interesting.<br /><br />Blue Jay Way - Mysterious song, hypnotic...although as I've read this song was inspired by a fairly mundane event.  There is sadness and fear in the voice; a kind of helplessness that is disturbing.<br /><br />Your Mother Should Know - Sentimental, mildly joyful song.<br /><br />I Am the Walrus - Cool, nonsensical song that you want to get.  Ominous, preachy, evil, crazy good.  One of the Beatles longer songs (almost 5 minutes).  Coda takes us towards insanity.<br /><br />Hello Goodbye - As if to shake off the scary dream of the last song...an upbeat song about a mismatch or miscommunication between two people.  I like how the vocals blend with the violin and the guitar before the chorus.  Coda has you just about clapping your hands.<br /><br />Strawberry Fields Forever - Back on the pot again are we?  Maybe a little LSD too...There is a depressive quality to this song which struggles between a futility and then another theme comes in with a sense of determination, aggressive horns blaring; nice juxtaposition between the two.  This back and forth ends with another coda which suggests a strange procession that wanders off and back...and off again.<br /><br />Penny Lane - Lyrics paint portraits of people remembered; brass instruments provide a fanfare; this song prefigures the sound of Chicago's pop songs somewhat.<br /><br />Baby, You're a Rich Man - Sarcastic song about the privileged; the combination of two different melodies enriches this song.<br /><br />All You Need Is Love - This song starts off humbly but gets you up on your feet in the end proclaiming the virtue of Love.  Maybe this album should have been called coda as it is a sort of coda to the more developed Sgt. Pepper and has so many notable coda's in it.  This coda sends you merrily on your way...<br /><br />(5 stars)  Not as dynamic as Sgt. Pepper but then again not intended originally as a proper album.  Contains many songs people will want to have in their great pop song collection.  These Beatles songs are growing slightly in length and I suspect that the copious codas have a lot to do with this.  While longer songs ups the value of the album for me (I just need my songs to be longer than 3 minutes) somehow this album (song collections) doesn't have the magic of Sgt. Pepper.  Still this album belongs in any collection where Sgt. Pepper is appreciated.<br /><br />For progressive rock fans I recommend \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", \\"Blue Jay Way\\", \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".  \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"All you need is love\\" are great pop songs.ity to this song which struggles between a futility and then another theme comes in with a sense of determination, aggressive horns blaring; nice juxtaposition between the two.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|OK, sounds great and judging from from the majority of the reviews, both in sound quality and packaging, The Beatles catalog has finally been brought to standard that is worthy of their music. I noticed that a few reviewer who gave this release less than five stars cited the Yellow Songtracks Submarine and Let It be Naked release in camparing it to the new box set release but no one thus far has campared them to the the Capital Albums VOl 1 & 2 released a few years back. While poorly packaged, in sound quality the Capital Albums was a much improvment over the 87 releases. They presented both stereo and mono versions for each song. Except for the sticker on the box that read Digitaly Remaster, The American Albums did not contain any information on the process involved in their digital upgrade. So my  question is this, has anyone who purchased the new box set(s) and also owns the American albums did any comparisons of both. If so, please share your findings in a review.    Yes I own the 87 releases, and the Capital Albums Vol 1 and 2 and will soon purchase the stereo box set and maybe some day the mono box. I own everything Beatles and Apple records love people like me. What will I do with 87 releases and Capital Albums, keep them, they will be personal Bealtes collective items. Thank you all who submitted review, enjoyed reading them and again if anyone compared the Capital Albums VOl 1 & 2 against the 09,09,09 release, I will look forward to reading your review also.    LL

0316017922|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Interesting facts about successful people through the years.  I thought it got off track in the chapter about plane crashes.  I do understand the point the author was trying to make about a person's culture, but to link it to a plane crash was not in the spirit of the rest of the book.  The book ended with more interesting facts about successful people.
B0027HOBM2|4.0|This Blu Ray of Mad Men Season 2 is as good as I expected. I just wish Season 3 is now available.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This is principally a review of the Blu-ray Disk. There is little to say about the film that hasn't already been said. It's a classic -- not just a great Western, but a great movie, one of those very rare films that perfectly captures the tone of the book it's derived from. (The book was originally a screenplay for Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, and John Wayne. That's another story.) But I /will/ say a few things.<br /><br />Though Robert Duvall's performance has been universally lauded -- he utterly nails Gus -- not enough has been said for Tommy Lee Jones', which is arguably even better than Duvall's. Woodrow F. Call is a loyal, hard-working, but dismally dull human being, highly asocial and devoid of (and largely incapable of understanding) basic human feelings. This is fairly clear in the novel, and made all-too-clear in the two (quite unnecessary) prequels. When Maggie throws hot corn meal in his face, you're glad she did.<br /><br />What's amazing about Jones' performance is his ability to bring complexity (and even some warmth) to what is essentially a \\"dishwater\\" character, while not losing Call's fundamental cluelessness. This is particularly notable in the scene where Po Campo explains why he doesn't ride animals: \\"You are an animal. Would you like another animal riding you?\\" Jones portrays Call's utter inability to see things from any point of view other than his own shallow, parochical perspective, in an amazing piece of facial acting. Ditto for the scene where he gives Newt his father's watch. * The expression on his face is indescribable, as is his inability to articulate his feelings. And then there is Gus's death scene, as great a piece of acting (from both men) as you'll ever see anywhere. It never fails to reduce me to tears. As fine an actor as TLJ is, I've yet to see a performance from him to equal this one.<br /><br />Though the mini-series was shown in prime-time on CBS, I should warn parents that \\"Lonesome Dove\\" includes \\"adult\\" subject matter that is treated bluntly, and there are a few scenes of appalling violence. It is not suitable for pre-teens.<br /><br />As for the BD transfer... Until now, \\"Lonesome Dove\\" has never looked very good. It wasn't particularly impressive in its original broadcast, and neither the LaserDisk nor the DVD did much to improve it. The image was so soft and grainy I suspected the film was shot on 16mm -- which made no sense.<br /><br />Why? Because it would most-likely have been shot in widescreen on 35mm stock, in anticipation of producing a shorter theatrical version for European distribution. It turns out that \\"Lonesome Dove\\" /was/ shot in 35mm widescreen (1.85:1), and that's what's on this disk. The difference is a revelation, an extremely sharp image with gobs of beautiful (but not exaggerated) detail. I'd give the image quality a solid B+. (If there weren't even better BDs out there, it would get an A-.) You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The cinematography is outstanding. Not only are scenes shot at the appropriate time of day (a rarity for any film), but the lighting is perfectly balanced. For example, indoor shots look as if they're lit by indoor (or window) lighting, but the outside (as seen through windows and doors) is /not/ \\"blown out\\". That's not easy to do, especially in a long film with a short shooting schedule.<br /><br />My only complaint about the transfer is that some of the night scenes (indoor and outdoor) are extremely grainy (probably because they were underexposed, due to an obvious attempt to use only lanterns, desk lamps, etc), and nothing appears to have been done to reduce the grain. Worse, some of the outdoor night shots show white horizontal streaks, as if the negative had been damaged. Most of this could have been fixed, but it wasn't.<br /><br />A wonderful film that you can now see as it was meant to be seen. Unreservedly recommended.<br /><br />* Call is so asocial, even to the point of being somewhat feral, that one wonders how he could ever have /had/ a father.d ever have /had/ a father.
B000CNE092|5.0|Don Bluth does it again.  Great movie, great villian and great villian side kick (voice by Hank Azia of The Simpson's, Mad About You and Herman's Head fame).  Meg Ryan is Anastasia, John Cusack is Demetri, and Kelsey Grammer is  Demetri's partner.  Very well done, entertaining with great original songs (sung by professionals not the actors).
B002NHBNWW|5.0|Looks like it is going to be an interesting series. I do think it is rather similar to the Twilight series though. I was kind of anticipating that something like this would eventually happen. I'm glad that it is just different enough to stand on it's own and I can't wait to see what happens next. I like the fact that you also get to hear what they are both thinking and the diaries help tremendously. I will be an avid watcher of this show just like I am with True Blood. I hope it will live up to all of it's expectations and that eventually the story will differ enough that it might not be compaired to twilight at all.

B0025KVLV0|5.0|This refers to the new remastered version, but I have not commented much here on the sound quality. Suffice to say it is better than it was.<br /><br />This is a much maligned album. I gotta admit, it wasn't on my list of the Top 5 Beatles Stereo Remastered albums, to replace my old cd's. But due to a twist of fate, I did end up buying this as one of my first 5.<br /><br />I was \\"there\\" when Let It Be was originally released in 1970, having been a Beatles fan since 1963. I had been anticipating the Get Back sessions, I had followed the whole drama surrounding this release, in Rolling Stone and other magazines at the time. I had heard they had finally turned it over to Phil Spector for production duties. I was dubious.<br /><br />In the meantime a bootleg came out called \\"Get Back\\" and it was basically the Glyn Johns mix, but the boot was pretty poor quality, not like the ones you can get now of that mix. But I loved it and was excited to hear \\"the real thing\\" soon to be released! (again, I am referring to the original release in 1970, right now)<br /><br />When I first heard \\"Let It Be\\" as it was officially released, the overblown orchestration and choir threw me for a loop! Females singing background on a Beatles album? Mantovani type strings??! This is often referred to as the \\"Spectorized\\" album.<br /><br />I admit to not loving it at first, but over the days and weeks it grew on me. Then, over the years, I've grown to actually prefer it!<br /><br />When \\"Naked\\" came out I had hoped it would be much closer to the Glyn Johns mix, but frankly I just don't care for it. Yeah, some of the songs sound really good without the orchestration, and it's nice to hear them that way sometimes. But overall, I find myself preferring the original!<br /><br />So I just finished listening to the new remaster of the original version, and while I did not listen CAREFULLY for sonic improvements, I must say that I LOVE this \\"musical album\\", this document of music in time! Even \\"I Me Mine\\" which has been said to have been ruined by Spector: I love it. Even \\"Let It Be\\" with the choir, even \\"Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" which have also been referred to as \\"ruined\\" by Spector: I love them!<br /><br />One thing I love, which I was sorry to see deleted on \\"Naked\\", is the intros and outros to some of the songs, the Lennon and McCartney \\"chatter\\". As strange as it was to add the element of a \\"live album\\" to orchestrated overdubbed arrangements, it was a nice touch!<br /><br />Anyone else share my love of \\"Let It Be\\"? For me, it's not in my Top Half of Beatles albums, but still, every time I give it a spin, I end up loving it! There is not one bad song on the album, it has lots of emotion, as the last Beatles album to be made, and well, isn't that enough to recommend it?<br /><br />p.s. If you can get your hands on a good quality booted copy of The Glyn Johns mix - the way it was ALMOST released - I highly recommend it. It's basically this album without the \\"fixing up\\". The Beatles felt it was too rough, but I find it energetic and fun! The Johns mix and the Spector mix are like 2 sides of a coin. Personally, \\"Let It Be - Naked\\" leaves me cold, although I do like the treatment of several of the songs better.<br /><br />In the end, it's oranges and apples. Get them all, for a balanced Beatles diet!I love it. Even \\"Let It Be\\" with the choir, even \\"Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" which have also been referred to as \\"ruined\\" by Spector: I love them!

B002DKGWSE|2.0|While the 70s original was brutal and cruel it had some clever psychology, horror and conflicts.  But this version sheds anything interesting in favor of more brutality including an on-camera rape, bloody fist fights and beatings.<br /><br />The final half of the movie has nothing clever, just unending fist fights between the parents and the criminals.<br /><br />Give it a miss.
0547258305|5.0|This book is fantastic, I absolutely loved it. If you have this book sitting on your TBR pile then I urge you to read it NOW. It reminded me of the Poison Study series by Marie V Snyder, it's a similar type of fantasy. I'm sure that anyone who likes Historical fiction or fantasy will love this book. I can't believe this is a 'first' novel, Kristin Cashore tells the most wonderful tale. She has made it to my 'must have' authors list, held sacred by the special few, the list is not a long one.<br /><br />Gracelings are people who are easily recognised because they have two different coloured eyes and a special skill/ability. That ability can range from excellent night vision to being able to control people's thoughts. There are seven kingdoms in this fantasy world and the author created some beautiful imagery as we floated through the kingdoms and scenery in the story.<br /><br />Katsa has the Grace of killing, she is like an extraordinary machine and can't be beaten. She is a rough, kick arse heroin and the way in which this character develops through the novel keeps you enthralled. Katsa's childhood was not a pleasant one and her Grace is one that repels people in terror. For years she has been controlled and exploited by her Uncle Randa, King of the Middluns.<br /><br />The we have Prince Po, the seventh son of the Lienid King. Po is also a Graceling but I'll let you read the book to discover his Grace. I couldn't possibly do it justice with my inadequate words. Po and Katsa met while both are separately trying to rescue Po's grandfather. Of course, Katsa wins and knocks Po out cold leaving him to be questioned for theft.<br /><br />The world of Graceling is a beautiful and dark one, full of evil Kings and people with extreme skill. The Quest, essential to all good fantasy is intriguing, frightening and presents challenges that the reader can't possible imagine will be resolved.<br /><br />At the end of this book I could swear I'd just watched a movie with scenes not unlike some out of Lord of the Rings. Don't wait to read this book, it is excellent!. Don't wait to read this book, it is excellent!
B001CJJWJ8|5.0|Don Carlo (or Don Carlos,the original French 5-act version) has been very fortunate with the record industry. I already have twelve and still looking for more. This one is among my favorites, together with the Karajan/Carreras/Ghiaurov; Siepi/Bjoerling/Merrill/Stiedry and Christoff/Gobbi.<br />  I've heard for decades people declaring this a failed Don Carlo because of Fischer Dieskau's Rodrigo. As a Verdi baritone he has not the voice of a Bastianini, a Merrill, a Milnes or a Cappuccilli, but his voice is not worse than Gobbi's, reputed as the best Posa on records,because of his interpretive skills. In this field Fi Di is also extraordinary, and I personally find his Posa at the same level of Gobbi's.<br />  Verdi specialist Bergonzi is marvelous as the Prince, one of his best achievements.<br />  Tebaldi should have recorded this ten years before, but you still hear the golden voice.<br />  Bumbry to my ears sounds like another soprano, very good indeed, but still a soprano. Lacks the mezzo color of a Zajick or a Nicolai.<br />  I have three Philips in my heart,Ghiaurov, Christoff and Siepi, and I just can't decide. That's why I have all of their recordings. Three different approaches to the same character by three geniuses. I love them all.  Martti Talvela is overwhelming as the Grand Inquisitor, and his scene with Ghiaurov is one of the greatest moments in operatic history.<br /> Solti is one of my lifetime favorite conductors, the other being Karajan. This is an almost complete original version including Act I in Fontainebleau, but translated to Italian. Very peculiar indeed. Col mio maggior rispetto, but I've never heard recordings of Tebaldi and Bergonzi singing in French...<br /> This second remastering sounds even better than the previous one. You can't afford not having this Don Carlo, and at this new price it's a total bargain! Buy it quickly, before it's deleted again.

1577311523|1.0|Eckhart Tolle, has created his Own way of receiving genuine peace and happiness. He has transformed himself with his Own ways. He now wants to transform others to receive his spirit within. Even though rebellious against Biblical<br />scripture and principle. His book is very challenging against what is biblically written.While Eckhart Tolle focuses on receiving peace He  evidently does not know what is biblically written from God about receiving peace through God. A biblical truth reveals in Matthew 10 that is being manifested daily in the majority of the worlds families, businesses, and even the church. God says that Think not that he has come to send peace on earth. He come not to send peace but a sword. He that loveth father or mother more than God is not worthy of Him and he that love his sons and daughters more than God are not worthy of Him. Therefore God sends us division. Saying that He would  set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And the list goes on to where God reveals division in-which no peace is received from such unless we spiritually be transformed by the True living God. Now if Eckhart Tolle, can break the power of God's judgment. More power to him.<br />Of course we should deal with the issues troubling us in the Now but under spiritual wisdom and knowledge from God who reveals our lives and our troubles biblically. It is biblically inportant to know why we are seeking peace through God who is the power and judge over our lives. In jeremiah 12 God says cursed be the man that trust in man and make flesh his arm but blessed is the man that trust in the LORD. We have a spiritual choice to be spiritually transformed.

B000000IRB|5.0|i originally owned this album on cassette tape years ago when i was a teen, then when the digitally remastered cd came out i bought it, but then my uncle bought the MFSL (Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs) gold cd version and when i listened to it i was amazingly astounded by how much better and more dynamic it sounded compared to my remastered copy. so i eventually bought this version because of that fact. if you can get a MFSL version of any album you're looking for don't look any further because MFSL's digital encoding processes are bar none to any other audio cd manufacturer out there, and that's no bullsh**
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I purchased the stereo box, but have also had the opportunity to listen to the mono box.  Personally I love the stereo box, but many say the mono sounds better because the albums were originally mixed in mono and the stereo mixes were not true stereo.  That may be true, but at 25 years of age, I did not grow up listening to these albums, nor any albums I listen to, in mono.  To my ears, the mono mixes sound flat, dull, and lifeless.  In my opinion, having remastered albums in mono makes them not sound remastered at all, but rather like a regression of sound quality that sounds dated and boring.  Listening to the mono mixes feels like listening to an old worn out cassette tape instead of a cd, or watching a vhs tape instead of a DVD.  It just doesn't sound pleasant or enjoyable.  Listening to the stereo mixes, on the other hand, is a vibrant, breathtaking, and immersive experience.  I have never heard these albums sound so lively, dynamic, and clear.  Sgt. Pepper's in particular, I believe sounds better in stereo due to the many different sound effects moving around you, rather than all crammed into one single channel.  I think the remastering job is fantastic and is a long time overdue, but worth the wait.  The packaging is superb, with great liner notes and gatefold lp style digipaks which house discs with labels that resemble the labels of the original vinyl albums.  If you are wondering whether to spend the money on this box set, do it; you won't regret it.  If you are wondering whether to get stereo or mono, get whatever you are used to or have a preference for.  I am not going to say that the stereo is better than the mono, because that is what I prefer, but others may prefer the mono.  If you grew up in the 60's when the albums were released and originally owned the mono vinyls, you'll probably appreciate the nostalgia of the mono box more.  If you are like me and grew up in the 80's-90's, listening to all stereo, you would most likely enjoy the stereo more.  However, if you're still not sure, I would suggest you sample both and see which sounds better to you.  If you are a Beatles completist and have the money to spend, get both sets.  Obviously, Paul and Ringo understand that neither version is the best version for everyone or they would not have released both.  Mono may be the original version, but to say it is the best is your opinion, not an indisputable fact.<br /><br />*Note: Abbey Road, Let it Be, and Yellow Submarine are only included in the stereo box, as they were never released in mono.  If you purchase the mono box, be sure to purchase those separately.  Whether you prefer stereo or mono, no Beatles collection is complete without those albums and Abbey Road is my personal favorite of all.However, if you're still not sure, I would suggest you sample both and see which sounds better to you.

045122499X|5.0|Wonderful insight into the world in England's emerging cities during the 14th and 15th centuries, the conflict between church and state, and the emergence of the tradesmen as they begin to take authority and power in the political system in England.  Well worth the read as it avoids the more traditional politics of royalty and favors the view of the governed.

0618918248|4.0|As a retired biology teacher and a non-religious person, I have greatly enjoyed and admired Richard Dawkins books.   Indeed, he was one of my most admired authors -- until I read \\"The God Delusion\\" in which, on the very first page, he implicitly blames religion for the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001.   On what does he base this view? What the media tell us, of course.   Dawkins' uncritical acceptance of the official account of what happened on 9/11, is reminiscent of the naivete of the child who accepts the word of his or her parents.  He bases his atheism on lack of evidence, so it is particularly ironic that it was a theologian, Professor David Ray Griffin, who was prepared to question official the official account of 9/11 and to go where the evidence took him, no matter how distasteful the conclusion.   The ability to change one's mind in the light of new evidence is one test of a good scientist. If Dawkins were to read Griffin's books, such as  \\"The New Pearl Harbor\\" and \\"The New Pearl Harbor Revisited\\", his true calibre as a scientist -- as opposed to a polemicist -- would be put to the test.   He has seemingly invested so much in Muslim fundamentalism to bolster has case that I am not holding my breath.
1416972242|4.0|I didnt really expect to gain literary knowledge from this series. It definitely does what its supposed to. Entertain you. Its predictable yes, but the world that has been created by the author needs imagination.. so kudos to her on that. Other than that..I read the entire series in a week... What can I say I enjoy fiction.
B000OGTUDS|5.0|This is a very easy read. Steinbeck lays a moral foundation through the characters and develops each of them well. He shows the weaknesses of humanity through the lens of the story. In a nutshell this is a very good, well written, story of hope and possibility despite decadence, greed and corruption within all of humanity.
B0000009SY|5.0|Say what you will about Frank Zappa but the man was never meant to suffer in silence - always putting his torment hilariously out-in-front of the cultural zeitgeist. Case in point - Joe's Garage. About 25 years before former Vice President Al Gore launched his crusade to reduce our carbon footprint to Colonial proportions (and just before Tipper Gore's, Parents Music Resource Center attempted to put their scolding, censorship-dusted fingerprint all over naughty song lyrics) Zappa unloaded a 3-LP broadside against what he perceived to be a growing intolerance of free expression in the arts.     As only he can, Zappa blended his signature love of infantile profanity superimposed against some of the most complex and improvisational rock composition ever recorded. Joe's Garage is for all intents and purposes a government-sponsored propaganda play, produced as a tone-deaf high school documentary - crudely inveighing against the \\"sleazery\\" of youth gone wrong through music. The protagonist, \\"Joe\\" is a feckless garage musician who unwittingly gets drawn into a life as a rock roadie (for the band \\"Toad-O\\") to save his girlfriend, \\"Mary from Canoga Park\\" who is now a wanton comfort girl for all the \\"boys on the bus.\\"    The story is puerile, the lyrics coarse but the overwhelming absurdity of the plot-line - told through Zappa's omniscient narration in the guise of \\"The Central Scrutinizer\\" is beyond brilliant. Wet T-Shirt contests go awry - prophylactically enhanced home appliances talk - STD's abound - as Joe and Mary fall irreversibly in the X-rated trance of Rock `n Roll. As extreme and profane as the story-line is, as is the case with most great satire, it is always difficult to know where extreme ends and truth begins. Joe's Garage is no exception.    Even if the lyrics offend - there is always the music. Zappa was a perfectionist and Garage does not disappoint. While the score is challenging, if you stay with FZ through all three parts - the reward is some of the finest solo guitar work produced before or since. Watermelon in Easter Hay is stunning and worth the considerable cost all by itself. They don't (and can't) make them like this anymore. Five stars for an artist that never took the easy way out.
068484267X|5.0|Don't let the title fool you. This is no chick book. It's the gritty biographical story of a boy growing up in the desparately poor conditions of WWII Ireland. The writing style is unsual, but the story is compelling. This is real history, not fiction. I will admit the title put me off from reading for years, but a recent NPR review at the time of the author's death changed my mind. I'm glad it did. I'll never see Ireland (or England) in quite the same way again.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you like the Beatles you'll adore this film. The songs are done very well and the singing is superb.
B0013LPS8E|5.0|The phrase \\"echoes of things to come\\" comes to mind when I hear this album now,  but back in 1983 when I first heard it, I thought it was the most passionate,  urgent statement that I'd ever heard in modern rock up to that point!  Coming out of Ireland, U2 had a sound and a message that nobody else was even  thinking about at that time! \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" went through me like a  laser beam and I was enthralled by Bono's almost crying delivery!  There are 5 other songs on here in addition to \\"SBS\\" that rocked my world too,  so I would say that this is U2's really first complete artistic statement as well.  They we're hungry, they had something to say, and they were hellbent on saying it!  This is U2's 3rd masterpiece in my opinion...\\"Joshua Tree\\" is #1, \\"Achtung Baby\\" is #2,  then comes this one for my money!--The remastering sounds good and brings it back to life!

0446560065|5.0|Simon Tofield's, Simon's Cat, is a compilation of adorable illustrations that gives us a hilarious look at our furry friends and the love/adventure they add to our daily lives. I recognized the escapades of my own cats on almost every page. This is a laugh-out-loud look, at not only our cats, but ourselves, as well. This one's a keeper!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|It's just a fantastic album. I know I'm 28 so some may think that it doesn't effect me in the same way as it touched and moved and sang what they wanted to say which is just fine. While those people are probably right that it's not the same it is still moving and inspiring and fun. This is an Epic CD but only because it was an Epic Record first.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|First of all, let me say I own the DVD version of Advent Children and love it.  So, after finally getting a Blu-Ray player, this was one of the first titles I picked up.  I thought the new scenes added to the story and gave it a little more body, which had been lacking from the original.  However, they also killed the pace of the movie - I felt that some of the quieter scenes were just jarring where they were placed and broke up the overall flow.  Still, great to watch the new stuff, like Tifa getting a bit more action time (at Cid's expense.)
B0028O34SG|5.0|Mozart's 1786 opera buffa Le Nozze di Figaro was controversial from the beginning. Napoleon described Beaumarchais' play - upon which da Ponte based his libretto - as \\"the Revolution in action.\\" Although Emperor Joseph gave Mozart his sovereign permission to present the new opera in Vienna, imagine the poor monarch squirming in his plush box seat as he watched a mere servant outwit a member of the nobility right there on stage. The Emperor may have particularly regretted his decision to allow Mozart to proceed when he witnessed the Count kneeling and - to the stunned amusement of all - humbly begging his wife for her forgiveness in front of his valet and others of his class. Vienna's conservative audiences were slow to embrace Figaro but it became a big hit in Prague which led to a commission for a new opera: Don Giovanni.<br /><br />This production was filmed at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in 2006. The action is updated to post-Revolutionary France in 1830 as a deep ennui afflicts the striving, struggling members of France's class-ridden society. The Revolution has failed and all of that Enlightenment hopefulness has dissipated. Using oblique lighting to suggest the late afternoon sun and the slow dying of the day and setting the opera in a decaying villa which - though still elegant - teeters on the precipice of seediness, Le Nozze di Figaro now unfolds in a world where cynicism has replaced hope and humor is tinged with sadness. The opera's mood is often more reminiscent of Don Giovanni - described by Mozart as a 'dramma giocoso' - than suggesting a frothy opera buffa. One senses that the director has his eye fixed firmly on our modern world even as he portrays one nearly two centuries in the past. The sets are monumental and imposing, looming ominously over the protagonists and emphasizing their vulnerabilty. Mozart's music helps these characters overcome their environment but we can't help feeling that there will be precious little safety in their future.<br /><br />The singers are all excellent with Erwin Schrott portraying a very strong Figaro and the beautiful Miah Persson embodying an absolutely delightful Susanna. Gerald Finley presents the Count as arrogant and self-absorbed while Dorothea Roschmann sings a truly mournful Countess. The rest of the cast are all good and their interaction with the titanic sets is fun to watch. The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House is  conducted by Antonio Pappano, who revels in the music's great beauty while feasting upon the nearly limitless well of creative energy that is the hallmark of Mozart's immortal score. The stage direction cannot have been easy and it is usually spot on. Only rarely is it marred by visual confusion whenever characters appear to have been swallowed by the extravagant set.<br /><br />Presented in 16:9 1080i high definition with audio in 2.0 and 5.0 uncompressed PCM, the two blu-ray discs run for 202 minutes. The high resolution video makes the sets look stunning, the costumes look beautiful and the singers look alive. The audio has comparable clarity with the added spaciousness of 5.0 surround sound providing some breathtaking moments whenever we hear ensemble singing or orchestral crescendos. If you've got blu-ray equipment here is an opera that can provide a musical and visual showcase. This production of Figaro is entertaining and insightful, and in high definition it offers vivid beauty to both eye and ear.<br /><br />Mike Birmane singers are all excellent with Erwin Schrott portraying a very strong Figaro and the beautiful Miah Persson embodying an absolutely delightful Susanna.

B002DYKP8S|1.0|The movie itself is fantastic, and I have been looking forward to this release for months.  Today I got online and started reading some reviews on this release and come to discover that the English dubbed version of the film is the only soundtrack that is in a lossless audio format.  That is ridiculous!!!  It makes no sense since on every release of the film the mandarin audio option is the default format.  I will not be buying this film and hope that enough people notice the audio formats before wasting there money on this crap.  How can an independent movie company like miramax let someone butcher the blu-ray of a great movie by releasing a version like this....
B002NHBNWW|4.0|Reminescent of the Twilight story - good vampire gone vegetarian, claiming \\"his\\" town off limits to bad vampires, protective of the girl. In spite of these similarities, it still makes for a good story. I like the diary angle,  since it gives the viewer insight into what's going on in the heads of the main characters.     There are interesting complications with one brother who turns to drugs and alcohol because he can't cope with the tragic loss of both parents; another brother who has an unspoken grudge against his brother, and wants to cause trouble for him when he returns to their home town after a hundred years or more; a psychic friend who doesn't quite realize that her powers are real, etc.    This pilot kept my interest; I was entertained, and will definitely be looking forward to more.
B000025192|4.0|Arrasadora y vigorosa expresión musical que arremete con furia, de una virulencia inusual para la época. Mensajes movilizadores y revolucionarios en sus letras, cuando todavía el rock no había sido domesticado ni vendido al mejor postor. Hoy, casi cuarenta y dos años después, \\"KICK OUT THE JAMS\\" sigue sonando peligroso...  Más allá del sonido sucio y poderoso de la grabación original en vivo, la calidad sonora del CD es un tanto inferior a la del compilado \\"Big Bang: Best of the Mc5\\", que fue remasterizado.
B002EEY8JE|5.0|First, I want to mention this is a stunner in Hi-Def, richly colored, finely detailed and the night scenes are full of inky blacks and blues.<br /><br />The main reason I want to write a review for this movie is because I think alot of people look at the cover and make the assumption that the story is sexist, and it'd probably be a fair guess, but it really isn't at all. It's a uniquely honest fable about redemption and facing our flaws.<br /><br />Lazarus (Samuel Jackson) is a farmer and former blues guitarist trying to deal with his own demons, stemming from his failed marriage to a younger woman who leaves him for his younger brother.. Rae is a girl with crippling self-esteem problems, she loves her boyfriend fiercely, but when he leaves for a tour in Iraq, she lets herself be passed from man to man. Lazarus finds her one morning, comatose from drugs and being beaten by her boyfriend's best 'friend' on the side of the road, and realizes that if he can help her clean up her act, he may be able to save himself.<br /><br />In the hands of any other director, with any other actors or actresses, this film probably would have been a complete disaster...  yet somehow it ends up being one of the most emotionally honest movies I've ever seen. Neither corny nor overly sentimental.  I highly recommend.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is a tale from Anthony Burgess about an adolescent boy, Alex. Alex is, \\"Our humble Narrator\\" who takes us on a journey through his youth in London (set in a future time period).<br /><br />We read as Alex goes through what I'll call an extreme rebellious period - his reformation and subsequent life choices. Sometimes when I read what others call \\"a classic\\" I'm left wondering why exactly the book was given that honor, but I can see why A Clockwork Orange was. It's a gruesome but cautionary tale of violence and government repression (in some sorts). Alex is originally allowed the choice of good or evil before others try to take it away, which makes the question of this novel. Is it better to have the choice of good or evil, even if people may pick evil?<br /><br />The storyline and character actions often go to the extreme but I think there is a great point to be found within these pages that is still functional today.<br /><br />One caution: Burgess uses many of his own slang words through the novel - I found a great online site and spent most of the first six/seven chapters translating from their dictionary.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|This is an engrossing, eerie pas de deux between two young people who warm to each other in the silvery cold landscapes of Sweden. My DVD automatically started to roll with English dubbing and no subtitles. The dubbing seemed fairly good, so I just left the DVD at this automatic setting. However I perhaps did get a hint of how any translating subtitles might have been very inadequate, because the title itself, rendered in English as \\"Let the Right One In,\\" doesn't seem quite right. It has a misleading Spike Lee declarative tone to it. Although it plays off a line ritually used by one of the character, it doesn't fit the sense or mood of the film.      However translation failings wouldn't seem to make a lot of difference here, because so much of the film's emotion is carried in the silences between the children. These two leads in the film, supposedly both pre-teens, present an astoundingly different view of youth than the one that most current movies and sitcoms typically present. At last, we have examples of young people who are not sexually precocious, wisecracking, and preoccupied with trivial consumptions. We are presented with a more Victorian view of children - quietly observant, unobtrusively intense, capable of profound attachments.    It's true that the capacity for such gravitas might arise from the fact that one or both of these children is perhaps actually decades, or even centuries older than appearances suggest. Through some brilliant photography and make-up work, the viewer can at certain moments peer at these children and find the ancient aspect in them. There's an exquisitely subtle shift from pre-teen to old soul that's simultaneously frightening, thrilling, and yet somehow strangely hopeful - or should I say \\"sanguine?\\"    This film is at heart a unique love story. The children make a rare connection based on fond fascination and need. Looking down the road at what will become of them though, the viewer is left in a frisson of wonder. Which willprevail in the long run - the love - or the need?
B001P9KR8U|5.0|If you like Charles Dickens and, to a lesser extent, Horatio Alger, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />  Jamal and his older brother Salim are children of the Bombay (now Mumbai) slums. The viewer is not spared the very apparent misery of those slums and the legions of poor who pick through the garbage, the beggars the very lowest on the social ladder.<br /><br />  The tale is of Jamal, Salim and a girl, Latika, who becomes attached to them under horrible circumstances as very young children. Taken under the wing of a villain lifted directly from Dickens, but who is probably all too real in such poverty, the children are groomed for lives as beggars and prostitutes.<br /><br />  Fate conspires to separate Jamal and Salim from Latika. The boys go off on their not-very-honest adventures across India. A few years later - with the kids being played by different actors now to reflect their emergence into adolescence - Jamal returns to Bombay to search for Latika, a rather daunting task in a city of 19 million, but as a product of the slums, he knows where to look.<br /><br />  The story takes darker and darker turns with the would-be lovers separated again and again.<br /><br />  Finally, in an unlikely set of coincidences, Jamal winds up as a winning contestant on \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\" and as a victim of police torture.<br /><br />  There are more twists and turns to this story than you can count, but the literate viewer will be able to identify all the plot devices lifted from classics and name their authors. Dickens and Dumas are prominent as is Shakespeare and numerous others. In short, this is a brilliant concept for a love story, turned into a compelling script and then an irresistible movie. It is a classic love story as well as poor-boy-makes-good. Some might be put off by the brutal depiction of Indian poverty, violence and generally depressing lives of many shown in this film.<br /><br />Jerry
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I'm not going to waste your time complaining about corporations releasing remasters to make more money, nor whether Yoko broke up the Beatles or claim that only my dog can hear the difference between both editions.  But what I will say is that the sound quality is basically the difference between standard TV and HD TV when comparing the regular CD and the Remastered CD.  I listened to several of the albums today through high end headphones and a headphone amp and I was mesmerized by the sound quality.  You can hear sounds such as a chair move, an inhale before a note is sung and you can visualize the bass strings moving on the bass during While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  I compared both songs from the old and new disk and there is a big difference.  Original sounds flat while the remastered sounds three dimensional and rich.  I highly recommend it if you appreciate good, rich sound.  Do you need to own both sets of disks?  That's your call.  If you are into good sound (you probably have an HDTV) then buy it.  If you just like to hear music on your radio and aren't moved by quality sound, don't waste your money (you probably have a tube TV).

B0006J28BO|5.0|The Cat Returns / B0006J28BO<br /><br />Miyazaki movies, in my experience, tend either to be very serious and thoughtful ([[ASIN:B0001XAPZ6 Nausicaa]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXBK Princess Mononoke]]) or somewhat sleepy and whimsical ([[ASIN:B0001XAPY2 Porco Rosso]] and [[ASIN:B00005JM2O Kiki's Delivery Service]]), but \\"The Cat Returns\\" manages to superbly combine a serious message (knowing oneself) with wonderful wit, charm, and fast-paced laughs.<br /><br />When an unlucky young girl selflessly saves a small cat from being run over in the streets, her life takes a decided turn for the worse as all the cats in the city start \\"repaying\\" her for her efforts with gifts of mice, catnip, and an offer of marriage to the cat prince that the cats just won't let her turn down. When she turns to the head of the local \\"Cat Bureau\\", a small group of helpful misfits, for aid, the elegant Baron (voiced beautifully by Cary Elwes in the English version) reminds her to, above all else, know herself, and then she can never truly go wrong.<br /><br />\\"The Cat Returns\\" stands out among the many \\"trust yourself\\" movies in two important respects. First, it is a masterful piece of work, not another cash in on this all too common theme, and the comedic elements in particular stand out. The insane Cat King (voice by Tim Curry) missteps frequently and amusingly - and always without shame or guilt, even when his golf practice knocks out his own guards, rather than the fleeing party of misfits he is aiming for. All the cats are superbly rendered, with the \\"Fat Cat\\" Mufa in particular adding a wonderful comic element. Beyond the comedy, I was deeply impressed with the dialogue, pacing, and direction of the script - this film truly showcases why Miyazaki is such a respected figure in his field.<br /><br />The second unique feature of this \\"trust yourself\\" theme is that the movie actually takes its own advice seriously in a way that most movies will not. Once our heroine truly learns to know herself, trust her instincts, and become her own person (not dependent upon others to 'complete' her), she never wavers from that, not even when it would be tempting to abandon the premise at the last moment for a sugary, stereotypical \\"happy\\" ending. I am also deeply pleased with the character of her mother - it's so nice and refreshing to have a parent figure in movies that isn't stupid, cruel, or otherwise loathsome in order to further the plot.<br /><br />I would recommend \\"The Cat Returns\\" to anyone, young or old, but especially to cat lovers and quilters! This movie provides English closed captions for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoller own person (not dependent upon others to 'complete' her), she never wavers from that, not even when it would be tempting to abandon the premise at the last moment for a sugary, stereotypical \\"happy\\" ending.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|The second disk is the best one to me--primarily because I like the later Beatles.  I'm not having any problems with the remastering jobs done. In my opinion they sound very good to great. Packaging, of course, is a mess. I agree with others on that one. I'm not putting the cds back into the package, but into cd/dvd sleeves that will give them the protection they deserve. How easily they will scratch in the current packaging. I give them an absolute F on that one. What's a \\"pretty\\" package worth if the damn things are going to scratch one's cds? Not much. I still love the music!
1592400876|5.0|Correct me if I am wrong, but this is a grammatically correct sentence. Or is it? Along with a profound sense of punctuation paranoia, Lynne Truss's book, Eats, Shoots & Leaves, delivers caustic wit, legitimate humor and intriguing history (Yes, the letter \\"s\\" follows an apostrophe after a possessive name ending in \\"s\\" - see page 55). I chose this book merely for need of a good grammatical guide in response to several teachers, and, as of this morning: professors, spilling red ink all over my papers as their hearts bled for my miserable lack of grammatical sense. I supposed I'd find a boring how-to manual; what I discovered was a book as fascinating as a novel. Why? Truss weaves actual teaching with wit, style, and an unimaginable number of stories and references masterfully! While not fully confident in my abilities to write a full paragraph with perfect punctuation, by the end of the book I smiled with a newfound delight in grammar and by the end of this introduction I will have used all the marks Lynn Truss discusses in her guide...   She makes you laugh. Far from the simply subtle style of Struck and White in their The Elements of Style, Lynn Truss is laugh out loud funny. She explains the importance of a hyphen by highlighting how \\"extra-marital sex... is quite a different bunch of coconuts\\" than extra marital sex (169). Tying humor to grammar instruction makes it all the more accessible to readers like myself. I never found it distracted from her overall theme, that of a call to fellow \\"sticklers\\" to uphold the rules of grammar, either.   She tells stories. She does not just rant from her own perspective: she shares the knowledge that brackets were named \\"lunulae\\" by Erasmus in the 16th century for \\"their moon-like profile\\" (161). With stories of sarcastic letters written by George Bernard Shaw to T.E. Lawrence about the latter's use of grammar to the quoted thoughts of Lewis Thomas on the semicolon, you'd be hard-pressed to find a page without researched knowledge into the development of grammar in the English language.   She teaches the reader. As soon as I closed the book I noticed a change in how I spoke, verbally even, to my roommate. I literally have been watching every punctuation mark in this critique, remembering her examples on correctness and the importance of not looking like \\"a stupid person\\" (98). I feel I have improved.   With a final chapter on her lament at the emergence of \\"Netspeak,\\" or the internet's effect upon grammar, Lynn Truss ends a book that is more than a guide; it makes a point. She truly wishes to bring the understanding of grammar to everyman, yes, but she also takes a blunt approach in reacting to poor punctuation. Lynn Truss entertains, yet she writes as someone truly convicted by a call to proper grammar; an academician with a purpose able to connect through clever writing and style.
0307454541|4.0|It's been on the Best Sellers List forever.  I keep looking at it,reading reviews and just didn't think it was for me.  Saw it at Sam's Club (sorry Amazon), for a few bucks and thought I'd try it.  I loved it.  Wasn't sure in the beginning.  Had a lot going on in alot of directions, but I'm so glad I kept going.  Once I start a book I keep going.  I always figure that they'll get better.  This one really lived up to it's hype.  So much so, that I bought the second one in the series (The Girl Who Plays With Fire).  It was good.  Lost my interest in the middle, but made up for it in the last part.  I will definetly get the third book in the series (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest).<br /><br />Anyone who wants to read a really great book...read \\"1000 White Women\\".  I'm by no means someone who's really into \\"history\\", although I do like John Jakes books,but this book (it's fiction) was incredible.  Reading it I kept thinking..\\"this should be a movie, & who would play the different parts\\".  It's that good. Check the book out here and seriously, don't be scared off if you're not into history or westerns, etc...I had serious doubts, but I'm so glad that I read it.  I could not put it down once I picked it up.  Enjoy![[ASIN:0312199430 One Thousand White Women: The Journals of May Dodd]]

B0025KVLT2|5.0|I had a chance to sit down with a decent set of headphones and AB my earlier CD, vinyl and the 2009 remaster of Rubber Soul, one of my all time favorite albums.  I even used an audio editing tool to take a look at the waveforms of the two digital CDs.  Here is my 2 cents.    Bass has more depth    Balance is better, but still follows Sir G. Martin's 2-channel master from 1982, which is the source of the remaster.    Highs have a my crystaling sound, especially noticable on cymbals.    Levels are highers and there doesn't seem to be as much compression.  Nice.    Overall balance is better making the melodic voices more clear and forward sounding.    Well worth the investment.  Next stop, grab on to one of the boxed sets.    I see they are almost gone from all the stores, but I expect more to come and I can be patient.

It has a good mixture of \\"monster of the week\\" type episodes and story arcs so it doesn't get serious to the point of being depressing or boring.    The acting is superb and Sam and Dean and Bobby just keep getting better and better. The characters are so believable which is saying alot for a show that is purely fiction.    One of the things I have always liked about Supernatural is that they have little nuggets and inside jokes for those of us who have been watching it from the begining.    I can not wait to watch it this season!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|There are a lot of entertaining vampire flicks floating around out there - [[ASIN:0767817664 Fright Night]], [[ASIN:0790742829 Salem's Lot]], [[ASIN:B0000AUHOK Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter]].  Entertaining films all, but -just- entertaining. Unfortunately, it seems most vampire movies that actually try to be poignant or artistic fall spectacularly flat and end up coming across as a mishmash of Hot Topic \\"goth\\" nonsense and softcore S&M, all topped with a huge dollop of pretense. \\"Let the Right One In\\" is probably the only vampire film I've ever seen that is actually genuinely affecting, heartfelt, and (dare I use an irritating buzzword?) spellbinding.    The plot of the film, in which a bullied, unhappy boy grows to love a mysterious, eternally young vampire, has been discussed at length in many of the other product reviews on this site.  I'll be the first to admit that it even sounds kind of trite on paper, but I cannot overstate how masterful the execution of this film is.  This isn't some overwrought, angsty drama club piece, but it is rife with genuine, palpable emotion that draws the viewer deeply into film's world.  All of this hinges on the incredible performances by the two young leads, bolstered perhaps by the director's skill at exposition through understatement.  Many loose ends (A great deal of which were resolved in the novel) are left untied throughout the film, but rather than detract from the movie, I found that leaving some aspects of the characters open to the interpretation and imagination of the viewer enhanced my enjoyment of the film.  When the credits started to roll there were only two things I wanted to do: a:) Watch the movie again and B:) Talk about it.      Much ado has been made of the issue of the \\"incorrect\\" subtitles attached to the initial DVD release of the film.  This is a legitimate concern: The DVD subtitles hack away at much of the film's dialogue, leaving little more than a stripped down gist of several scenes in the film.Luckily, versions of the DVD with the proper theatrical subtitles have begun to surface, mostly (for some reason) at Super Target stores, where it is typically shelved in the IFC section of the movie department.  Look for \\"Subtitles: English (Theatrical)\\" in the spec box on the back of the package.  For folks who just can't wait for a version of the disc with proper subs, I'm happy to report that the unexpectedly well-done English dub track is more-or-less in line with theatrical subtitles.    In conclusion, if you're a fan of vampire films, \\"smart\\" horror movies, or drama, \\"Let the Right One In\\" is certainly worth your time.  Trust me, I generally detest \\"artsy\\" vampire movies, but this movie is so much more than that.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Satisfying second effort that zeroes in on the sex slave trade. The deeply revolting history of Lisbeth is revealed and the only false note is when Palmgren magically avoids all impairments from a stroke to reveal long winded dissertations to Blomkvist. Please. Minus one star for that unbelievable exchange.

0525478183|4.0|Those people who, like me, were exposed to more than one John Green book, are probably starting to notice a pattern - all his novels, while distinctly entertaining and touching upon different themes, feature a slightly nerdy boy who gets attracted to/mystified by/obsessed with a girl who is everything he is not - adventurous, mysterious, bold, beautiful, and ultimately, she becomes his quest.  Paper Towns (and also Looking for Alaska) are the best examples of this story type. When Quinton's childhood friend and high-school dream Margo sweeps him up in a night of mayhem and mischief and then abruptly disappears, he must solve the clues possibly left by her and find where she had gone, before it is too late. In this book, we encounter a very interesting description of what it would be like to try to understand someone else, and possibly to discover their true nature, previously cleverly concealed even from the closest friends. As Q follows his search for Margo, he puts himself in her shoes repeatedly and is forced to consider that what he imagines of her may or may not be what she truly is. Ultimately, the author is telling us, even the best clues left to us are being interpreted with our own eyes, and thus, their resulting meaning is never quite the same as intended by the person leaving them.  A very short but fast-paced and engaging novel, will keep you awake during an out-of-state trip.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Hi there! I'm new to reviewing albums, so this might be kinda confusing. Here goes:<br /><br />Like most of the CD's in my library, I stumbled across this album in the library. Amazon had been trying to sell it to me for a while, but I ignored that since they've recommended some really weird stuff too. But I checked it out when I saw it on the library and instantly fell in love with it. It's slow-moving, with rustic sounding lyrics and vocals to match, in amazing harmonies. Some tracks DO get old kinda fast (I was thinking specifically of \\"Quiet Houses\\"), but every song has a reason for being there. And the songwriter is SO YOUNG! Ribin Pecknold was 22 when this album was published, meaning he's been writing since he's a teenager.<br /><br />Look up \\"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\\", \\"Heard Them Stirring\\" (instrumental), \\"Meadowlarks\\", or \\"Ragged Wood\\" (they were originally going to call the album after this track). Those are my favorites, but there's not a disappointing track on here. I'll be anxiously awaiting their next album.<br /><br />All I can say is there's a reason this was one of the highest rated and most critically acclaimed albums of 2008. At least give it a chance, since it's kinda strange on first listen, but it grows on you.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|We have enjoyed this series. I believe it is overpriced but lovely to look at and learn from.

B001UXJQHE|5.0|Each of Andre's performances are different.  Andre Rieu in Australia was similar  to his performance in Toronto, and other places with the castle as a backdrop.  Still, this DVD is a great addition to any AR collection.  It never ceases to amaze  me on how much energy and creativity he and his group have.  He really knows how  to involve the audience, and that's entertaining as well.  Super DVD!!!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney Houston's latest album proves she's still one of the best female vocalists of our time. Sure, her voice and her vocal range have changed over time, but her voice remains strong and Whitney sings to express all the subtle nuances of the lyrics to every song on this album! This CD will be a thrill for Whitney Houston fans especially if they don't mind her more mature voice with its limited range; she's back with a vengeance and that's terrific. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I love that artwork, too. R. Kelly made some significant contributions too, writing lyrics and composing some music that really blows me away! Johnta Austin and Diane Warren did some songwriting, too.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Million Dollar Bill;\\" this tune has a fantastic beat--don't be surprised if you find yourself jumping up and dancing practically wherever you are! Whitney carries this song easily; her excellent diction and sophisticated phrasing is flawless and I'm very impressed. The music fits perfectly with Whitney's vocals--I love it! In addition, the upbeat \\"Nothin' but Love\\" has a strong beat and Whitney belts this out with all her might! The backup singers sound great--not that Whitney ever truly needed backup, but they do sound good anyway. \\"Call You Tonight\\" slows down the pace a bit; Whitney handles complex tempo and key changes like the pro she is and always will remain! \\"Call You Tonight\\" is a highlight of this fine album.<br /><br />The title song, \\"I Look to You,\\" moves me with its poignant beauty; Whitney sings this with panache and the piano arrangement is very well done. Whitney sings this with all her heart and soul and \\"I Look to You\\" is a real gem of a number. \\"Like I Never Left\\" has Whitney teaming up with Akon; these artists make this memorable and the beat is awesome to say the least! \\"Like I Never Left\\" is great. \\"A Song for You\\" is also very moving; I could never tire of hearing Whitney do this cover of Leon Russell's tune with its beautiful melody. Whitney delivers this with great sensitivity. I can tell she's really throwing herself into \\"A Song for You\\" to make it shine brighter than silver and gold--and it works, too.<br /><br />\\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" again has Whitney squarely front and center; this is perhaps a somewhat autobiographical number that gets the royal treatment from Whitney who delivers this to perfection--and beyond! The piano sounds just right for this song, too. \\"Worth It\\" is yet another song with a terrific beat that is catchy and \\"Worth It\\" makes a good number for this CD. \\"For The Lovers\\" is also a solid tune that Whitney delivers with lost of energy; and listen for Whitney to ace \\"I Got You.\\" Whitney makes it all seem so easy; but of course we know it really isn't all that easy--Whitney's talent carries her through. The album ends nicely with Whitney Houston performing \\"Salute.\\" \\"Salute\\" rounds out the album very well.<br /><br />Whitney Houston gives a strong performance on this album--she's back and she's going to be around for a very long time to come! I love this album and it's a great one to get if you love Whitney Houston (even with her more limited vocal range) or club music in general. It's also a great album for people just discovering the magical artistry of Whitney Houston--you won't be disappointed!lody. Whitney delivers this with great sensitivity.

B0025KVLS8|1.0|Sorry, but the euphoria of listening to Beatles music has to be set aside for some hard facts. Many tracks are inferior in sound to the recently released \\"1\\" and \\"Something New\\".  I can't explain the drastic sound difference on the 2 cd's. A Hard Days Night in the new remaster is very clearly rough and muddled compared to  the track in \\"1\\". Tell Me Why & I'm Happy Just To Dance With You\\" sound much better in \\"Something New\\", the recently released \\"Capitol Album\\".  Can't Buy Me Love\\" is punchier and clearer in \\"1\\". While the stereo versions are preferable to the mono ones previously released, it seems the  master tapes have degraded significantly in just a few years since the release of 1 and Capitol Masters. Last but not least, no version of A Hard Days night is complete without the instrumentals, which have never been release in the US. It's easy to miss these differences when just playing the CD start to finish. I expected the remasterings to be better than 1.  It turns out, that was not the case.
1442192461|5.0|Although Austen's longest novel, Emma is a lot of fun to read.  It was a   real challenge to make us truly care about this spoiled   and meddlesome character.   I guess it because it is Emma's depth of feeling   and her reactions to all the chaos she creates throughout the book that really   endear her.  That and the fact that in the end everything works out as it   should (no major spoiler that), and all her messes are resolved happily or  comically.     I can see why many consider this to be Austen's best work: it has many of the  best qualities of the other work,  but it also builds into  a mystery  with a surprising resolution, and many characters turn out to be quite  different from what we initially suspect.
B000006NUW|4.0|A very good collection of Motown hits.  99% of the songs are the original artists.  A real blast from the past.  Good sound quality.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Having had the old UK Mono Collection LP set for years, the new box is a stunning revelation.  I cannot add much to what everyone has said in terms of the audio (5 stars for me), but I absolutely must comment on the reproduction packaging.    Every album in this set is faithful to its original released counterpart, from the foldover-glued jackets of the original albums to the inner sleeve reproductions, (including the black sleeves for THE BEATLES as originally issued) and the top-opening form and raised lettering of the 'White Album' jacket (only caveat - no numbered jacket).  All these features are faithful reproductions of the original vinyl releases. The protective CD sleeves and mylar album slipcovers are the right touch to help preserve this special set.    'Dr. Ebbetts' has officially retired, and a long, justified reign he had. Collectors should be very proud to own this set.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|I can't believe people still are surprised when shows and movies don't live up to the books they're based on.. ???  Have you ever heard somebody say, \\"The book was pretty good but that movie was awesome!\\" ?  NO!  If you're going to watch any movie or show based on any book than just think of them as alternate possibilities if a couple things were different or else you'll be let down every time.    And if you're not sure about this one than watch it on hulu before you buy.

0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key taught be about a tragic event in France's history about which I had never heard. The story was wonderful, and I read the book in less than 24 hours. I couldn't wait to see what happened. At times the book is sad, but mostly it's just a fantastic story and not nearly as depressing as you'd expect given the content. You MUST read this book. I can't wait for her next book to come out in English.
B001D84NKQ|3.0|This cd is mediocre at best.  I would say it is ok but not as good as I thought it would be.  There are a couple of good songs but that's about it.
0131479415|5.0|This book is a must for any software project manager.  If you are new to Agile, then you will appreciate the beginning chapters which go into great detail as to why agile is better than traditional waterfall approaches.  I really like Mike's agile receipe, a blend of Scrum, XP, and Evo.  If you are not familiar with these methods, I suggest reading a bit about them before reading Mike's book.      I would have preferred more detail and real life experience in the role modeling and user story sections.  I've outlined some suggestions here at my blog: [...].  I'd also would have liked to seen an example for hardware engineering.      I definitely can't wait to read his next book!
0805211063|5.0|I read The Trial several years ago, and I remember that I struggled with it and did not enjoy it nearly as much as I enjoyed Kafka's short works. So it was with some trepidation that I gave Kafka's novels another chance with The Castle.<br /><br />Happily, I found it surprisingly absorbing. The Castle begins as if in a dream. K. wanders into a village on a cold winter`s evening, seeking a room for the night. He is quickly told that the authorities at the Castle do not allow strangers to pass the night. K. responds that he was summoned by the Castle; he is the new land surveyor. Is this true? Is it merely a ruse K. invents to secure shelter for the night? It does not matter. As in a dream, what K. says becomes, at least to K. himself, immediately true. Furthermore, taking up his position as land surveyor becomes a matter of prime importance and urgency. Yet he of course immediately encounters the chief problem of the Kafkaesque universe -- to reach the Castle he must navigate a system of rules that is as incomprehensible and senseless as it is uncompromising.<br /><br />In the years since I last read Kafka, I had forgotten how bitingly funny he can be. The Castle is rich with satire and even slapstick-style comedy. Although this is often cited as an autobiographical work, Kafka allows little sympathy for his bewildered land surveyor. K.'s constant scheming, manipulations, and obsessive behavior are portrayed as ironically absurd and pathetic. Only in rare reflective moments could I feel the full impact of the tragedy of K.'s situation: that of the tenacious seeker left eternally in a dark, cold courtyard, hopefully waiting for an encounter that will never come.<br /><br />This is not to say that I never found The Castle challenging to read. Kafka not only writes in long sentences, but he also writes paragraphs that can extend for many pages without a break. The tiresomeness and frustration of reading this style might add to the atmosphere of the novel, but it also makes voluntarily sticking with the book something of a test of will. The chore is not relieved by Kafka's plain, unexciting prose and tendency to ramble. In the end though, I was glad that I finally took the time to read this funny, frustrating, and ultimately sad work, and I am sorry that Kafka never finished it. This is not an easy read or terribly exciting plot-wise, but if you enjoy imaginative, absurdist situations and colorful characters The Castle is highly recommended.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I remember watching the Grammy's one year and being angered at the singer who called herself Norah Jones.  I knew nothing about her except she had a kind face and was easy on the eyes.  I also knew that she won almost every award that night.  Beating out my personal favorite Bruce Springsteen.  After the initial dislike wore off, I broke down and bought her c.d.  I mean how bad could she be?  After listening to it for the first time, I said \\"o.k, nothing special.\\"  Then that 'Come Away with Me' song kept getting stuck in my head and I listened to it more often.  Before I knew it I was addicted.  Her voice is so beguiling.  Being so simple, yet packing with it joy, sorrow, heart ache, and a deep deep passion.  Some may say it puts people to sleep.  I disagree.  Its rich and powerful, and the c.d is deserving of the awards it has.  So if at first you don't like Norah Jones, let her grow on you and maybe you'll end up liking her!

1584282584|5.0|I've been on one of Neil's courses and they are excellent and highly recommend if you want to learn how to get the best from your flash, if you can't go on one of Neil's courses then this is the next best thing. You can an idea of Neil's great advice from his website [...] This book is also very good in that it covers both Nikon and Canon systems, it is also very up to date with equipment. If you use Nikon equipment, this book along with Joe McNally's books and the Nikon DVD Joe did is all you need for getting the best out of your Nikon flash.    Neil's explanations and way of teaching is excellent, the book is laid out in a clear and easy manner with plenty of diagrams and examples.    This is a must for anybody who uses Nikon or Canon flash lights.
055380684X|5.0|I was so impressed with this book, I had to read it twice. I would definitely reccomend it to any who who has intentions of excelling in a particular field.
B000002H70|4.0|The disc itself was in great condition, as well as the liner notes. The case was cracked when it arrived, I suspect damaged during shipping but that was an easily remedied thing and had nothing to do with my overall satisfaction with the condition of the actual CD. The item arrived well within the window provided. Thanks!!!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|If you're a Jane Austen fan and know Pride & Prejudice, you will LOVE this movie!  Actually it was a UK miniseries and its pretty long but it's worth the sit!  Great for a plane ride!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I received this today, and after reading other reviews on here, I checked all of the discs in the set. I was hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones who got a great box-set, but I had no such luck. Sadly, most of them are scratched up, and 1 looks as if water has been spilled all over it! I decided to return it for a refund instead of an exchange, since I'm not sure that the next set I get will be any better. It's a shame because this box-set would be awesome if so many weren't defective. On the plus side, Amazon has a really easy return process, so I'm glad I ordered it from here. If you decide to go ahead and purchase it, get it from Amazon, and make sure to check every single disc!
B001993Y2C|1.0|I should note that his review and star-rating is for the PACKAGING not the quality of the blu-ray's themselves.  I love the series.  I have the entire series on DVD but when this Blu-ray came out I had to have it.  HD really does improve the experience and is worth purchasing even if you have the DVDs already.    HOWEVER, the packaging is horrible!!!  The Blu-rays are difficult to get out of the season packages.  They are not in there properly and WILL eventually scratch.  The Season packages are flimsy and will become dented and creased regardless of how well you handle them.  The large container is MASSIVE and actually makes it a pain to get at the discs.  The cyclon toy is cool but REALLY? do I care?...no.  Will you?  probably not.    The reality is that this packaging looks cool on the store shelf and nowhere else.  It does not fit into any stylish media storage unit.  If you get this the packaging will seem fun and interesting at first but after dealing with it once or twice you will find its wothless and cumbersome.  I would throw the larger box away but the individual season containers are too flimsy.    Wait for this to be released in a cheaper more standard container.
B002NHBNWW|5.0|Yes, I know its hard to compare something to Twilight. Twilight has become and hit in no time. I honestly feel this show will as well.  Vampire Diaries is very similar. The story line, yes similar... To me this show is a good fill in between the Twilight Saga movie gaps.  I have followed the girl who plays Elena from her original show Degrassi and have to say she was a excellent pick.  CW is pulling a lot of girls from Degrassi lately but they are making the right picks.  And our bad vampy gone good has a very appealing face. I dont find him Edward Cullen-ish at all.

B0025KVLUG|5.0|As to avoid any confusion, this review is specifically for the remastered version of \\"Yellow Submarine\\" since many past reviews are appearing here.<br /><br />I began my quest to obtain all of the Beatles' remastered CD's with this one per my son's request; he loves the movie as well the music, so this one was an obvious choice for him!<br /><br />With all of the hype surrounding the release of the remasters, I went into it with a lot of expectations, & after hearing the opening of the title track, my wife & I were believers immediately; our collective \\"WOW!\\" reaction was all it took!<br /><br />The difference between this & the original 1990 CD issue is literally like night & day; the sound is greatly improved & the clarity is incredible.  Of course, the technology to achieve this was not there in 1990, so for what it was, it was good; but this is astounding!<br /><br />If the band tracks are not enough to convince you, listen to George Martin's orchestral score beginning with \\"Pepperland\\"; in short, it will take your breath away!  Lush strings, horns & percussion all come to the forefront like never before; the sound is so beautiful & crystal clear that you feel as if you're there in the studio with them.<br /><br />Do not hesitate to buy all of the remasters...I certainly won't!

0061191981|5.0|Ever since I discovered \\"Kitchen Nightmares\\", I've been a fan of Gordon Ramsay.  I've never watched \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" because I was turned off by the swearing when the trailers are shown.  But in \\"Kitchen Nightmares\\", Gordon shows his softer side.  He really wants people to succeed. So when I heard about his autobiography, I just had to read it.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.  It is an honest recollection of what happened to him in relation to the important people and events in his life.  It's raw and Gordon Ramsay was unafraid to relate details like how he watched his brother shoot up heroin or how as children they would be dressed up in rags while his father bought Fender guitars in pursuit of his pipe dream of becoming a country singer.<br /><br />I found out why Gordon has a British accent and not because he's ashamed of being from Scotland but because his family moved around so much and they lived on and off in England.  And that he rides motorcycles.<br /><br />But what I really liked about the book is his passion for perfection.  He didn't let obstacles get in his way and it is truly inspiring.  He is also so down-to-earth and makes sure his kids are the same.<br /><br />Gordon doesn't pretend to be some haughty chef who was born to high society but everything that he learned about fine food he learned the hard way.  I didn't know that becoming a chef was like moving in the ranks of the military.<br /><br />What he did with his life is truly amazing and I'm glad he wrote this book.  It's almost like Gordon was sitting down and chatting with me over a cup of tea.
B002E2QHBS|4.0|I gave this 4 stars since the set is missing at least one song from every performer; shame money got in the way of this great effort.  I also think the powers to be will be shooting for the big 50th anyway.    I especially enjoy hearing the raw, imperfect sound of the recordings.  I can imagine the tremendous challege the recoreding team had in capturing the events of those few days.  And some of the performances are truly great (e.g., Santana).    But a bit of warning for you late baby boomers or younger.  I was only in junior high school at the time of Woodstock.  While I'm very aware of most of the groups and music, and in hindsight, Woodstock was a milestone event, I have a bit of a problem getting into the emotion of the day since it wasn't \\"my event\\".  So, for you older baby-boomers, enjoy your chance to re-live this one.  However, given the low number of people rating this product, I'm beginning to wonder if many really care anymore...
0061474355|4.0|Have only read about half of it but it is a worthy sequel to the first two parts.<br />If you have not read the first two parts of the trilogy read Sabriel and Lireal in sequence before starting Abhorsen. They are really interdependent.

0375826726|3.0|I don't know, maybe it's just me but I had a really hard time getting into this book while I found the first two totally engrossing. Don't get me wrong, it was a good read and yet I still find myself mildly disappointed. Maybe it was because this book was so much more technical where the first two were more raw and powerful, they swept you in from the first page and didn't let go. This one I had to force myself to keep reading and every few pages I was rewarded and then it was back to drudgery again.
0790740443|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Soldier, a \\"side-quel\\" to Blade Runner that should in no way be considered in the same league with that far more visually inventive film, has nothing to recommend it aside from a cool fight scene fought on chains suspended from the ceiling (imagine climbing the rope in gym class...then ripping out the eye of the guy climbing on the adjacent rope) and the fact that it moves reasonably quickly and could be a lot worse; don't look for anything approaching creativity and you might have an okay time.    2/4
B001FB55H6|5.0|This movie is great for people who like the action of the super hero genre but are tired of the cheesy plot lines. For once a super hero movie carries depth and offers critical thinking to its audience. The blu ray special features are definitely a nice touch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a little more than the usual stop the bad guy with your super powers cliché.
B000BB14YY|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Ran's gorgeous photography and impressive first hour may be just enough to recommend it despite the fact that its King Lear-meets-Japanese-folk-legend plot doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, the closing battle scenes aren't staged very well (men on horses ride toward the enemy, men get shot, men fall off horses, horses are all fine) and the 160-minute running length often feels interminable; know what you're getting into before you watch this dubious classic.    3/4
0061537969|3.0|Enzo is a great character and his take on life and the world in general was fun to read.  Anyone who loves dogs will adore this book.  What I didn't like were all the pages and pages devoted to racing, which I found tedious.  The metaphors about racing and life simply didn't work for me; then again, I'm not a racing fan.  I also found Denny to be immature and hard to like, even though I disliked the antagonists in the story so much that I would have rooted for Denny no matter what.  Thing is, most of Denny's problems could have been avoided if he hadn't been so hung up on racing and hadn't made so many bad decisions.  He needed to grow a backbone, I thought, and that colored my feelings about him to the point I very nearly didn't finish the book.  But I'm obviously in the minority.  Most people seemed to love this book, and that's good.  If we all liked the same things, the world would be a boring place.
B001N26GFM|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is well-made enough but the ending is abominable, **spoiler alert** not only relying on ridiculous contrivances like the ability of an 8 year-old boy to dig a tunnel at about 55 mph, but also it's set up in a way that has us rooting for the evil Nazi to whisk his poor gentile son out of the gas chamber lest he die like the Jews who, hey, were gonna die anyway; if the movie makes you feel manipulated and slightly ill at ease, you're not alone.    2.5/4

B000021YQV|4.0|This is a great sophomore album, but it's not really as spectacular as the self-titled first album. I mean, the lyrics are still significant, and the music still heavy and enlightening, but there does seem to be a bit repetition that goes on in some of these songs. And unlike the first album, the second half of the songs do seem to get tiring afterwards. But still, I admire SOAD and I admire this album. The best songs have to be \\"Aerials,\\" \\"Bounce,\\" \\"Psycho,\\" \\"Prison,\\" and \\"Chop Suey.\\" Still, not their greatest album, but it still a likable effort.
B00159679S|5.0|I first saw this package a few months ago and was weary about purchasing it.  Sixty five dollars for all of Richard Wagner's mature operas seemed just to good to be true.  As a college student who finds himself constantly on a budget, however, I decided to take the plunge-and was very glad to be drowned in it.  From the storm-tossed sea of the Dutchman to Brunnhilde's fiery end, this set can be described as one word- fantastic!  All of these performances are very beautifully done and the audience is very well behaved for the most part. (A little coughing in Lohengrin but the music is so exceedingly lovely that one soon forgets about this.) Of course, there are the singers, including some of the greatest Wagnerians of the century, such as Anja Silja, Birgitt Nilsson, Wolfgang Windgassen, and many others.  Many of these recordings are available separately and at a much higher cost.  The Bohm Ring costs over 100 dollars by itself.  So, is this the bargain of the decade?  Absolutely.  The quality of the recordings, while not top-notch studio, have a very energetic feel to them and are all in fine stereo sound.  Thus, the wonderful acoustics of Bayreuth.  Thus, the magic of doing it live.
B000007T1M|5.0|I was an avid listener of this SOAD debut back when I was in High School. Now, as I return to the album, I can still get a kick out of this kick*** music. Everything from Serj's energetic vocals to Daron's awesome guitar melodies really stand out. The songs \\"Spiders,\\" \\"P.L.U.C.K.,\\" \\"Know,\\" and of course \\"SUGAR\\" are some of my all-time favorites. Thanks, SOAD, for creating this great first album.<br /><br />Grade: A
0316044695|5.0|Lone Survivor is both well written and informative.  It held my interest and was extremely gripping and compelling.  It's a real salute to the 'American Fighting Man' (and Woman) -- especially to our special forces and most definitely to the Navy SEALs. Luttrell's story reflects the close and dependent relationships among small specialize military units whose 'under the radar' missions are quite dangerous and not always appreciated. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of close family ties and support of friends and community. You cannot help but have respect for all our military described in this account of patriotism, dedication and sacrifice for each other and for their country.<br /><br />I found it very interesting how it addressed and reflected tribal life and the value systems we as an \\"advanced\\" society should try to emulate. After reading Lone Survivor, you get a better understanding and appreciation of what it is like to live, fight and survive in a part of the world most of us know very little about (Afghanistan).<br /><br />It certainly brings to vivid life the challenges our nation faces in this strange and foreign world -- especially the day-to-day challenges faced by our troops being asked to make it a better and safer place. Continuing to give them our full support and backing is certainly paramount. Definitely a \\"must read\\" for every American, no matter what age or gender.<br /><br />((This is a review by my father, a retired Air Force Colonel. I gave him this book as a birthday gift and felt it fitting that he get a chance to share his thoughts. I will include my reactions when I get a chance to borrow it from him.))

0307408833|2.0|I dont think these recipes have been tested out accurately because I have been following the directions downb to a T. I have been leveling my measuring cups and spoons and monitoring temerature and I just made the jalepeno -cheese cornbread and it was NOT GOOD.1/2 cup agave is way to sweet. I would reduce it to 1/3 cup agave. It is also VERY EXPENSIVE to try to attempt these recipes as I have already spend over 100 dollars on all th BOBS RED MILL and all the special ingredients such as coconut flour, coconut oil, lemon essence, etc.     It's really not worth it to bake all these Items on your own. I have also made the lemon poppyseed cake and the bananna bread and both are now in my trash can. I think the Xanthum Gum really is too much and I dont think these recipes have been tested out enough. Great design on this book it really got me excited but now I am very disappionted.     I have also tried to tweak the recipe one time because every time I used Xanthum Gum my bread went flat. Since i am not VEGAN I used 2 eggs in place of Xanthum gum for the bananna bread and it actually came out great....Xanthum Gum is not a good egg replacer for breads.. I dont recommend using it..if you do reduce it to 3/4 teaspoon instead of the 1 teaspoon it calls for. If you can have eggs, USE EGGS instead.
0312370849|4.0|This book was highly recommended by several friends and it did not disappoint.  It was a real page-turner.  It not only told a beautiful and extremely sad story but was very educational - I, for one, had never heard of the round-up of the Jews in Paris -- evidently from reading the book neither had a lot of French people.

Thank you and this movie was off the charts and a great family movie, especially for the kids, lots of lessons learned from this movie.

B00003CXBK|5.0|A stunning anime! This was wonderful! I really enjoyed this one! I can't say anything else about it, exept... wow!
B00003CXB4|5.0|This movie is probably the most important animation film for a whole generation. For the nostalgic, the last traditionally animated master piece. And with Beauty and the Beast, the top film of the Disney Renaissance.    A great story with wonderful characters surrounded with an extraordinary music. Believe it or not, you can laugh and cry every time you watch it as the first time. You fall in love with this movie.    Simply, maybe the best movie ever.
B001YV504U|4.0|First of all, I love the movie and it's an absolute classic. I just wanna throw my two cents in on the Blu-ray release and say that despite some other reviews, I am satisfied with the picture quality of the Blu-ray version.  First of all it's an older movie- we're talking like TWENTY YEARS OLD, so no matter how many times it's remastered, it's not going to reach Dark Knight-esque quality. Yeah, there are definitely problems with grainy-ness and other imperfections, but I just got done watching a close-up of Shoeless Joe Jackson on my Samsung in 1080p, and I can promise you this isn't just marginally better than DVD, it's quite noticeably better.     Some of the professional reviews I've read suspect that Universal used the same transfer for this edition as they used for the hd-dvd release a few years back. Since that's probably very likely, I wouldn't be surprised to see an improved transfer in the future, since transfer technology and remastering technology improve over time. But how soon? NOT FOR A LONG TIME! I wouldn't expect a new transfer for another 10 years since transferring/remastering is very costly(take for example North by Northwest's gigantic one costing $1 million recently). After all, Universal is not going to invest the money if they can't recoup it with sales. So moral of the story- this is the best edition you're probably gonna find for a long time :)
0061122416|3.0|An easy read with undeveloped characters but stocked with a few nuggets of wisdom and inspiration. Sometimes the simple things are the best. If you're looking for deep esoteric symbolism and mysticism this may not be the book for you. If you like simple messages of facing your fears, applying faith, overcoming obstacles and finding the \\"treasure\\" that is already around you, then read this book. I'm glad I did.
B00164GDD2|5.0|25 year old movie and it looks so fresh ..... some of the sound effect leaves much to be desired but hey ..... this IS a restored 25 year old film .... hats off
B0025KVLT2|5.0|The musical content on \\"Rubber Soul\\" is five-star.  The Beatles are one of a very few entities whose output lives up to its \\"hype.\\"  And in the days leading up to 09/09/09, there has been a LOT of hype. The remastering engineers at EMI \\"nail\\" it here.<br /><br />In the 2009 edition, you can feel the beans shaking around in the maracas and the bells in the tambourines (\\"Wait\\").  I never found the 1987 disks inadequate; they were state of the art 22 years ago and I don't think they sound badly now, perhaps the best term is \\"outdated.\\"  The 1987 edition had a little more distortion to my ears.  Overall the 2009 remaster is clearer and crisper than the 1987, and with enhanced bass tones, and previously-unnoticeable subtleties in the drumming surface, for example.<br /><br />Sound of 2009 is somewhat warmer and richer, with better presence, but not as much as on the special edition 1978 Japanese vinyl \\"Original Recording Remastered\\" (just kidding).  Seriously, though, I have it playing in the next room and I can tell that the sound isn't coming from a vinyl LP.  If you're a \\"vinyl\\" person, get a clean import on vinyl (and be prepared to pay).<br /><br />Acoustic numbers stand out best, and are most improved on the remaster.  They distinguish \\"Rubber Soul\\" as being the closest thing to \\"The Beatles Unplugged:\\" \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" \\"Girl,\\" \\"Michelle\\" and \\"In My Life.\\"<br /><br />Electrified guitar numbers \\"Nowhere Man,\\" \\"Drive My Car,\\" \\"You Won't See Me,\\" \\"Wait,\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" crackle and bite with warm harmonies.  The sound quality is improved from the 1987 disk, but the improvement is not as noticeable as on the acoustic songs.<br /><br />I suspect that other discontent reviewers expected a stereo \\"remix\\" (i.e., affecting what instrument/s are heard in the right or left channel, or both), and not merely a remaster improving sound quality.  Mona Lisa was not the prettiest woman in Florence.
1401216676|5.0|This is hands-down, one of the best Batman stories ever, however, it is intended for mature audiences, and with good reason.  This is a no-holds-barred look into the madness of the Joker, why he became who he is, and his absolute disrespect for life.  There are some scenes of partial nudity, a few instances of foul language, and the violence is graphically illustrated.      Alan Moore is truly an outstanding comic book author, but his stories are meant for mature audiences, (see also V for Vendetta, The Watchmen, and Swamp Thing), but all are well worth reading.      The story is entertaining, and provides a fascinating look at how Batman and the Joker are truly alike, different sides of the same coin, as it were, all due to one bad day.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|In the last years of his life, George Harrison compared the \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" albums to a two-volume transformation of the Beatles music from \\"black and white\\" to \\"color.\\"  \\"Rubber Soul\\" is acoustic, rootsy, earthy, and introspective, exploring intricacies of post-adolescent love and relationships, and friendship. Arrangements are spare, seldom with any excess.  \\"Revolver\\" is electric with first-rate songwriting, recording experimentation, strings and jazzy horns, social disconnect, richer harmonies than its predecessor (\\"Here, There and Everywhere\\"), and character expositions (\\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" Doctor Robert,\\" Taxman,\\" \\"She Said She Said,\\" \\"I Want to Tell You\\"). \\"Revolver\\" is edgy electronic excess.<br /><br />But you already knew this.  How does this affect the 2009 \\"Revolver\\" CD remaster?  Well, for one, it makes me want to play it louder than I used to play my 1987 version.  The 2009 remaster plays to different strengths in \\"Revolver\\" than in the 2009 version of \\"Rubber Soul.\\"  I agree with the \\"black and white\\" turning to \\"color\\" comparison, but the two albums have very different emphases and their 2009 remasters improve upon the 1987 CDs in different ways.<br /><br />In the 2009 CD \\"Revolver,\\" the vocal presence is phenomenal.  Close your eyes when you listen to \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\"--loud.  That much of the singing was double-tracked is more noticeable, and the surrealness intended by this effect stands out far more than in the 1987 CD version (\\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" She Said She Said\\").  The horns in \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" have \\"bite.\\"  The strings in \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" shimmer.  In \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" I can now tell that it is Ringo shouting back to John during the middle-eight with comical sound effects.  I didn't know who it was before.<br /><br />If I had to make an \\"analog\\" analogy, the 1987 version sounds like a first-generation copy of the 2009 remaster.  (I know, I know, both are digital.)  The 1987 versionstill sounds good to me, and 1987 copies  can be snapped up cheaply now (Beatles albums on iTunes for $9.99 US?-meh), but the 2009 is a considerable improvement if you're a fan.

0679643362|5.0|A friend and I agreed to re-read Siddhartha. Quite fortuitously this was the edition we chose.  Either the book has been stripped of all inelegance in this translation, revealing its poetic and timeless beauty, or we have finally caught up to Hesse's grace and wisdom.  I suspect it is more of the former.<br />Yet, in the translation lies something very structural about the book and its themes.  There is a kind of inevitability of the tale that seemed to be missing in earlier versions.  It flows just as we, at some unconscious level, imagine it should unfold. Siddhartha's challenges to himself and the people who surround him form a profound framing of his life's quest. It is his acceptance of the results of this quest, and the tone of the revelation of it in this text that flows much more like poetry than in prior versions.  One senses that this is the tale Hesse meant to tell, and the feeling he wanted to impart.  It is a simple tale of the Jungian completion of the self, but told as a tone poem, a lullaby, a prayer, a myth, a celebration, and ultimately, as a wonder.<br />The major characters of the book - Govinda, Kamala, Buddha, the boatman, and Siddhartha's son - all play their parts at various points in the tale, but the boatman and the river itself take Siddhartha the farthest.  Siddhartha's skepticism of dogma and doctrine (of the Buddha, of Govinda, of the world of business) drives him to find his own way, but it is not until he has been satiated with both the \\"spiritual\\" and the material world, and been tortured by the indifference of his son that he comes back to the river and the boatman to find his ultimate way and true peace. It is at once the individual and the universal peace of \\"solving\\" oneself - of the self and the Atman united in a very lyrical playing out of the inner theme common to us all.  When philosophy becomes art, and when that art becomes mythic poetry, one is in the presence of something truly transformative.  That is the sense that this version of the story conveys.<br />Good for Modern Library for coming out with Susan Bernofsky's translation.  It is a new book in many respects, but one that is now being sold as what it will rightfully become - a great world classic in English as well as German.on of the story conveys.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|We are all entitled to our own opinions so let's respect that and agree to disagree. I am so HAPPY to see that Whitney is getting her life back together. Yes her voice is notably different but that was said  about her Just Whitney CD and I absolutely LOVED it.     I didn't, however, care for her live performance on GMA. I do think she sounded a lil bad. From what I have heard of this new album I'm loving it. I will be at WallyWorld TOMORROW to pick up my copy.    I love Whitney and I'm praying for her all the way. Her music does sound better than a lot of the music out today. Then again I'm older so most of the younger gen.. wouldn't agree with me:-) It's ok because I like some of their music also.    Whitney we are so happy for you:-) You go girl.
B0025KVLTC|4.0|Just today I listened to the remastered Beatles on \\"Revolver\\" and its ironic how time only makes this music sound better. Like most listeners, the Beatles were part of my household, on LP, and this album only serves to reiterate the mastery they had over the musical medium. This album also marked the time when the Beatles experimented with more Eastern elements in their music - courtesy of George, to be sure, but this certainly enhanced their output at the time.<br /><br />\\"Revolver\\" is regarded as one of their greatest achievements for various reasons. First, it contains quite a few of their commercial hits, but also contains some of their most esoteric, 'artistic' statements that pacified the more critical audiences. This dual balance works very effectively here, as the layering of the songs combined with the obviously stark imagery conjured up by the Lennon-McCartney songwriting team, lead to the tag of 'epic', and this album certainly has that timeless quality stamped all over it.<br /><br />First of, two of the most well known Beatles singles feature here - \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\". The latter is disposable, at least in my opinion, but the former sounds more spacious here, with the production done just right. Personal favorites include \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" (a quintessential Beatles track, if ever), and of course the highly experimental \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", which brought the Indian aspects of the Beatles' extra-curricular activities to the fore. Its a meditative, almost trance-like song that is stupendous in its execution.<br /><br />But despite those darker, more philosophical meditations upon life, the album also includes a few typical Beatles tracks that have no special purpose except to sing along to - prime amongst this is \\"And your Bird can Sing\\", and the infectious \\"Taxman\\". The 13-track disc has a short running time (like all Beatles albums except 'The White Album'), but feels fleshed out and very comprehensive.<br /><br />The Remastered version is certainly where its at, and proves that despite some of their better work yet to come (\\"Peppers\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" in particular), the Beatles were well on their way toward attaining musical supremacy, something they eventually did. \\"Revolver\\" marks an important step in that path.

I don't mean early 2000s or even 1990s.  I mean late 1980s!  There is nothing fresh here. This would have been an average 80s album for her (not as good as some she produced though).  I know this is a comeback effort and that's what makes it so painful to listen to.  She should have worked harder to get her voice back into shape.  She should have chosen a more \\"up-to-date\\" producer and maybe even hung out with the neo-soul crowd a bit before parachuting back into the music scene.  Instead what we're left with is 80s mediocrity at best, delivered in 2009.<br />Whitney, you had a great voice back then.  I'm sure you still do.  Rather than focusing on songs lamenting your tribulations, get back to the days before your mistakes and sing like you used to about dreams you used to have.  That's what you need to do to win us back.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|Unlike some other reviewers here, I'm not going to get into the debate regarding remixes vs. remasters. They weren't remixed, and they weren't advertised that way. So don't expect it.     The not so good: Many of the titles (Revolver for instance) sound too loud overall compared to the '87 issues. I'm sure this is due to the \\"loudness wars\\" (compression). You can make the comparison yourself if you have the old ones, or look at the files using Sound Forge or something like that. Also, Revolver and Rubber Soul sound really bright to me (for probably the same reason). I have several vinyl copies that sound much more balanced. Most of those were cut from the analog masters, so that's not a surprise.    The better: Abbey Road sounds great. Whatever they did on this one, they got it right. I've heard the same about the White Album (I've not listened to that one yet). Magical Mystery Tour sounded pretty decent as well. The other ones I have heard didn't do much for me compared to vinyl or the '87 issues. I just don't see this as that much of an improvement. Yeah, I'm sure there is more detail but it's all there at the same time (see \\"compression\\" above).    I have heard a good chunk of the mono box - superior. I would buy the mono box and skip this one. Maybe pick up a few stereo CDs individually (Abbey Road) if the mood strikes, but the whole set is a waste in my opinion. Once again, EMI misses the subway.
B001AQT11M|5.0|I'm so thrilled they're releasing this again! I missed it when they released the platinum edition, and I am not one to want to buy used DVD's. I'll be buying this when it comes out in November.
B000FC10MU|1.0|With no bearing on reality, a novel had better have some kind of redeeming aspect in terms of story, or insight, or perhaps morality, or... something. This novel has no redeeming aspects at all. It reads like an undergaduate's night-before-deadline stream-of-consciousness brain vomit. Utter garbage, and indeed I threw it in the garbage after disembarking from the plane on which it was the only thing I had to read (after reading the in-flight magazine in its entirety, which was much, much better).

B001FBSMF8|3.0|Chris Cornell, world famous grunge-rock god, presents Scream, a collaboration with Timbaland. As trends have shown, rock is falling by the wayside, and hip hop is the modern pop. Thus, Cornell is adapting to modern culture.<br /><br />I can certainly appreciate a man who has been in the industry for decades and is still trying new things. Cornell isn't afraid to step out of his comfort zone and take risks, even those that might not bring a profit. However, there are a few reasons why this step doesn't work for me. The most glaring problem is that Cornell's amazing voice is stifled with this mellow music style. It is ironic that the album is called Scream, because Cornell does none of it here. Don't expect to be blown away by his musical talents.<br /><br />He is practically crooning, a subdued and relaxing vocal method best suited for singers with a limited range and weak control. And if Cornell's intention was to put across powerful lyrics by downplaying his vocals, it is hard to tell with the thumping beat behind every song.<br /><br />Do not expect any standout songs from this CD. It is satisfactory as background music, but will hardly become a favorite.
B002NHBNWW|1.0|Can we say unoriginal? I'm sure a lot of people are going to be suckered into this show because of the vampire craze. This show is not creative, and completely unoriginal. Way to go CW, your shows are terrible. Gossip Girl was great...when it was a book I read lets say...6 years ago. I can't believe someone could get away with a story line entirely too close to this other little book saga, Twilight..I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a great documentary about John Adams and a great peek into our country's past.  It is well acted especially the title role.
B002NHBNWW|2.0|Too many similarities to the Twilight Saga. Good vampire/Bad vampire; friend that can see the future; jealous blonde girl; struggles with resisting vampire nature... The actors are really too old looking for high school. The scene where the brother is drinking a beer right in front of a policeman is ridiculous and the continuity suffers when Elena suddenly loses the red undershirt she was wearing at the beginning of the party. The fog is too much over the top. They don't need it to create a sinister mood.... The show will probably have a cult following but they really need to pay more attention to details and be a little more original.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|For a 2009 R&B album, \\"I Look to You\\" works remarkably well. The vocals are good, the production is good, and the songs are decent. The album very much sounds like something we'd get from Mary J. Blige, and it is not at all surprising to me that it is shooting up the charts. However, it didn't completely meet my expectations.<br /><br />Judging by the cover of the album, one would expect it to be a full-fledged comeback with unique tracks and phenomenal vocals. Had this been any other R&B artist of today, the album would be near flawless. However, the songs are very much like anything else you would hear on the radio today from any number of R&B artists. This is not a timeless album. The style of these tracks is very \\"2009\\", and I can't imagine many of them being well received 20 years from now, unlike some of Whitney's previous hits. That said, the ballads \\"I Look to You\\" and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" are somewhat reminiscent of the \\"classic\\" Whitney ballads we all love, and \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" and \\"For the Lovers\\" are great dance tracks. Whitney's collaboration with Akon, \\"Like I Never Left\\", is also quite impressive, having gone through some additional mixing and polishing from the demo that leaked last year. Akon also produced the track \\"I Got You\\" which is one of my personal favorites, due to a unique beat and some good vocals from Whitney. The only tracks I usually skip are \\"Call You Tonight\\", \\"A Song for You\\", and \\"Worth It\\".<br /><br />Whitney's vocals are good, but they are certainly not what they were in the early 90s. Her voice is a little deeper and hoarser than it once was, but is still surprisingly quite strong and well-controlled, which is what will continue to set her apart from other popular artists today. She doesn't sound strained, however, because it appears that these songs were better crafted to Whitney's more limited range.<br /><br />Considering that this is the first we've heard from Whitney in some time, I expected something a little more glamorous for her big comeback. But all in all, it is still quite a good album that many will enjoy.big comeback. But all in all, it is still quite a good album that many will enjoy.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|The Michael Jackson CD, \\"Number Ones\\", is a great CD of the songs that we all have heard and continue to hear, whether on the dance floor, at a party, or when you just want something to pick you up and start dancing.  These tunes are the songs that always come to mind when think of Michael Jackson and his special talent that he shared with all us.

0312944098|4.0|Archer's A Prisoner of Birth certainly will hold your interest from page one. He's good at that. It's a problem solving book which also provides background on the British legal and court system. Don't look for any deep understanding of the human condition. Archer is not a philosopher just a good story teller. Archer also comes up with a plausible ending which many current popular writers cannot do.

B000GGSM7G|4.0|I don't understand the reviews for this album. This album is a close cousin to The Head on the Door. I don't find the album to be as off the wall as some critics have made it out to be as matter of fact despite Robert Smith's almost Od-ing during the making of this album the final product is  cohesive and accessible,providing you like The Cure. I like it more now than I did 24 years ago and the remastering and packaging are wonderful. The liner notes are extensive and gives you a new appreciation and insight to this lovely and eclectic album.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|HBO's miniseries of John Adams are absolutely mesmerizing!  You don't need to be a history buff to enjoy this DVD. Beautiful cinematography, costumes, and fine acting by Paul Giamatti (I want to watch Sideways again!) and equally talented Laura Linney, the series will take you back in time to our founding fathers' struggle to create a new nation.  Directed by Tom Hooper (Elizabeth I), along with the music score by Joseph Vitarelli and Robert Lane, the series will take you on a amazing, magical journey. Now, I don't know how accurate the movie is to the actual event.  For that I will read David McCullough's book --- all 651 pages of it!  As far as the DVD goes, however, this one is a keeper.  Thanks, Amazon.com!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Are these reviews helping you decide whether to purchase the box set?<br /><br />Are these mostly hysterical posts from people who--for the most part--either don't own the item being reviewed, or are rendering snap judgments based on listening to three or four songs . . . are they guiding you toward a more informed purchasing decision?<br /><br />Avoid this semi-literate free-for-all and seek out reviews from online magazines and newspapers like Rolling Stone, NME, the WSJ and the LA times. There are several good blogs out there, too.<br /><br />The entire review thread for this box set should be deleted (along with the ridiculous thread for the mono set). Amazon's review system is very democratic, but there's too much noise to actually evaluate the critical climate surrounding these remasters. Open it up for reviews after a few weeks, when the hand-wringing and fist-shaking and genuflecting has calmed a bit.<br /><br />After a mere few hours, is anyone capable of a genuinely helpful appraisal of more than 200 songs over 13 albums?<br /><br />Not to me.
B001FSC0UY|5.0|The `Original' Ziggy Stardust and the Spider From Mars album has been completely remastered and developed into 5.1 surround sound.  The clarity is impeccable and every guitar, every keyboard and every vocal is separated naturally to give you the feeling that you are there in the studio.  Its fresh!  This rare SACD/DSD is a hybrid, so you can play it on a stereo CD player, but you'll be missing that total enveloping sound.  More photos and liner notes are included than in previous reissues and the jewel box is extra strong in structure.<br /><br />But the main thing is the music.  This was Bowie at his best in the early seventies and Rolling Stone magazine has called this album one of the best rock albums of all time.  Standout cuts are, \\"Moonage Daydream\\" for Mick Ronson's guitar solo, \\"Hang On To Yourself\\" for pure manic rock and roll and, of course, the classic \\"Suffragette City\\" with its famous bridge of, \\"Wham bam, thank you, m'am\\".  Don't forget, that like the original album, this SACD states, \\"To Be Played At Maximum Volume\\".  And you should!
B0025KVLTC|5.0|There's no reason to review the content of Revolver, which by almost all accounts is excellent. I have always considered it be one of the best in The Beatles' catalog. The songs speak for themselves and, on this newly remastered disc, they REALLY do speak. The best way to describe the difference between the 2009 version and the 1987 version is depth. The earlier version is quite flat, with very little detail in the low or high end. The remaster is full spectrum of sound, revealing many details in the vocals and instrumentals that have been lost since the days when vinyl ruled.     I wanted to make sure so I did a direct comparison of the 1987 version and the new one. I hate to say it because I don't want to feel like I need to buy this music again, but there is no comparison. Even those who listen to music primarily in MP3 format will hear a noticeable difference from the 1987 version, assuming a reasonable bit rate is used in the creation of the MP3s. It makes sense. We know far more about digital these days. In creating these Beatles remasters, the engineers used techniques that did not exist even as a whim in the 80s. The result is remarkable.    I will say, as have others, that the packaging is weak. There is really nothing special about the included booklet. And the short mini-doc, Quick Time presentation on the CD is barely worth the time spent watching it. The only reason to buy this CD is if you want better quality sound. Hearing the remastered Revolver reminds me of what the vinyl album sounded like on a good stereo back in the day. Good stuff!
0307341569|2.0|I have to say this was a very dark book. I finished it because I wanted to find out a few things (and was trying something new outside of book club), but, all in all - I would not recommend it.  My mom tried to read it and walked away from it about 100 pages into it - said it was not for her, it was dark and disturbing for her (she loves murder mysteries too).  It's not a great murder mystery book, it's just weird and dark - not a chick book at all - or an \\"on the edge of your seat murder mystery book\\".     Thumbs down on this one.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|For anyone who has not seen Lost, my advice is run, don't walk, to Amazon.com and order the whole series!! This series has more twists and turns than a mountain highway and they all leave you begging for more! The series is extremely well written and the actors are all superb. And if you have already watched Lost on TV, let me tell you that watching it from a boxed set is well worth your time. I am on my third time watching and every time I see and hear things that I didn't catch the first time. Also, you can rest assured that if you order from Amazon you will get a first rate product!!

0470477237|5.0|It took about ten years for Brick-and-Mortars to figure out how they could best exist within the Web 1.0. They will have far less time to understand that marketing is turning into a completely new social and linguistic genre. Erik Qualman's book, Socialnomics: How social media transforms the way we live and do business is an effective wake-up call for corporations and marketers, and is written by a sincere and authentic practitioner.    Amazon, Qualman reminds us, did a stellar job when it introduced the concept of affinity marketing, but as efficient as it was, it had its shortcomings, especially if buying My Little Pony for your niece was a one-time thing. Going a step further, Amazon started to showcase other books that people who bought the same book as the one you are looking at, also bought. The social media approach is a next era and shows that in the \\"people-driven economy,\\" effective affinity marketing is a contagious recommendation process operating within affinity groups. Instead of being told what people in general are interested in, we want to know what people in our network, people we appreciate, would advise based on their experience - an experience to which we tend to pay attention because we generally trust our friends.  \\"People referring products and services via social media are the new king. It is the world's largest referral program in history.\\" This is a new world that Qualman calls \\"the world of socialnomics.\\"    A few years ago, the very notion of \\"socialnomics\\" would have sounded like an odd linguistic construct, and, in the end, simply meant \\"management/rules of what is social,\\" just as economics originally designates the management/rules of a household. In many respects, the term \\"socionomics,\\" coined by Prechter in 1999, could have also been used, as it is the \\"study of social mood and its results in social actions.\\" However, through the word \\"socialnomics,\\" Qualman wants to emphasize the idea of an economy governed - I should say \\"mediated\\" -- by social media as it leads to the creation of innumerable communities and tribes. This \\"social-media mediation\\" is perceived by individuals as a form of disintermediation and deliverance, shielding them from the marketing litanies imposed upon them by impersonal marketing machines. What we hear in our social media world comes from people we have chosen to listen to. The intermediaries are not mercenary message-carriers (or so we hope), they are peers of sorts and therefore, are not perceived as middlemen (even when there can be a bit of a sandwich man about them). This is why the world of \\"socialnomics\\" is not felt as yet another form of social pressure. We have the freedom to select the circles to which we belong, ensure that they mirror our needs and tastes, exchange points of views and ask questions with the hope of getting a candid response.    The eight chapters of the books analyze the new challenges and opportunities that the social media re-segmentation and restructuring of the market will present to businesses. Are customers going to reduce their reliance on the results they get from search engines? It is most likely. \\"I care more about what my neighbor thinks than what Google thinks,\\" if I want to buy a baby seat. It is also obvious that customers expect companies to converse with them in \\"open, two-way conversations\\" and that customer \\"services\\" are poised to become the customers' voice and, consequently, a central part of marketing departments. Therefore, \\"businesses need to fully transform to properly address the impact and demands of social media.\\" And companies that fear to venture into the open, display their customers in the social media fora, will atrophy much faster than they think. Installed bases are joining the \\"Glass House Generation\\" at a fast pace, and follow its lifestyle -- hang out anywhere and at all times in public view. Qualman indicates that \\"by 2012, eMarketer projects that more than 800 million users worldwide will participate in social networks via their mobile device, up from 82 million in 2007.\\" Meeting these new challenges as well as leveraging these new opportunities will definitely require new skills and new tools!
B0025KVLT2|2.0|So, What happened, last night ,I listened to the engineers talking about how they decide it was time to do a more modern digital transfer, since the first CDs were transferred in 1986, this is a good arguement, I have heard some CDs from the Eighties that sounded pretty bad, but they blamed it on the analog source, not the poor digital transfer and quality of DACs and so on. So, without being able to sample any of \\"Rubber Soul\\", I bought it, like an idiot, took it home and played it, (I am spoiled, a Grateful Dead fan, who release very hi end CDs , even of seventies 2 track live stuff. I started listening to this and it sounded dull and lifeless without any good tonal qualities. I have 2 CD players, one a very good multi disc player with 24 bit DACs, I tried it in my cheaper one and it sounded worse. I ended up listening to it thru my nice Sennheiser phones and it was very stringent sounding, and the bass was pounding in on my left ear. So, I started reading the liner notes and found that this was made from a 1987 George Martin stereo mix, not from the new digital transfer which took 4 years, it really made me mad, I mean, this sounded like something that had been recorded on a 4 track cassette recorder and put on CD with bouncing tracks and stuff.<br />  So, why was I lied to, I listened to this 17 minute blurb with the creators and then you don't even get what they were talking about??? That is insane. The Beatles should sound better than this. I listened to some older CDs of the Beatles while I was in the store where I bought this and they sounded real good, especially the \\"Love\\" album with lots of greatest hits. You could not preview these on the stores machine though. I am very disappointed and will sell this mix, what a real digital ripoff.<br />  I did notice a huge increase in quality on the last couple of songs, but looked and I don't think they were on the original \\"Rubber Soul\\". It did not have 14 songs.

1593083807|2.0|If you're a fan of Austen's other works like I am, you'll probably read this book regardless of any detracting review... so this is more for me to vent than anything else!<br /><br />The last time I read this was as a teen, and it didn't leave much of an impression then. I've just finished reading it again after having watched both film adaptations.<br /><br />The story itself is engaging and interesting. It is a satire of gothic novels, and that aspect of it is very entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud at quite a few lines. But I could only enjoy it on that level, because I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters themselves. They seem to be written on purpose to be either unlikeable or uninteresting.<br /><br />The main character, Catherine, is a complete simpleton. I kept finding myself rolling my eyes and inwardly saying, \\"Oh, please,\\" in regards to her outlandishly wrong opinions and conjectures about people. The fact that she's 17 doesn't excuse this extreme naivet&eacute; and lack of judgment. I was a better judge of character at 17, and I was about as naive as it gets!<br /><br />Henry Tilney, who is supposed to be such a gentleman (especially when compared with one of the novel's \\"villains,\\" John Thorpe) seems to me to be as rude as John Thorpe but just in a different way. Until the very end of the book, Henry almost never says anything that is not sarcastic or joking. And usually his conversations are based on something he finds amusing about the other person that he wants to play off of, but so subtly that the person he is addressing doesn't realize that he is making fun of them. He does this even with Catherine, who is his love interest. I can't for the life of me figure out what attracts him to her (or vice versa)--other than the fact that he enjoys having someone always around whom he can feel superior towards. (Austen even alludes to this in Ch. 14: \\"a good-looking girl with an affectionate heart, and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever young man.\\") He even calls his sister \\"stupid\\" in one of these sarcastic speeches, after which his sister assures Catherine that \\"he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say... an unkind [thing] of me.\\" Sorry, sis, he just did! Whether or not he meant it, it was still unkind.<br /><br />The Allens, the Morlands, and Miss Tilney are all nice but dull, and everyone else surrounding Catherine is positively obnoxious. Maybe this was on purpose and Austen's intent was that the characters and not just the plot be satirical. If so, then she succeeded. But personally, I prefer novels in which I can care about and like the heroines and heroes, as I do in her other books.<br /><br />If this were all I knew of Austen's writing, I wouldn't be inclined to read any of her other works! Fortunately her others are much better than this one. P&P is one of my favorite books of all time and I've read it countless times. Next in order of preference would be Emma, S&S, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion. But this one I could do without.

B0013MYNYI|4.0|Gone are the comedy antics of Alistair Sim and Joyce Grenfell, and in their place are poppers, Youtube and emo's.  This modern update on the familiar \\"St. Trinian's\\" characters (which is actually based on the first movie from the original series, 1954's \\"The Belles of St. Trinian's\\") is just as delightful and irreverent as the beloved movies which inspired it.<br /><br />When Annabelle (Talulah Riley) is enrolled at St. Trinian's girls school, run by her aunt, Amelia Fritton (Rupert Everett), she has no idea of the \\"education\\" that will follow.  The future of the school is threatened, however, when the Minister of Education (Colin Firth)--who also happens to be one of Miss Fritton's former flames--announces plans to re-form the establishment; meanwhile, the bank managers are threatening to foreclose.  The girls hatch a daring plan to steal \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" from a London art gallery and demand a ransom...but they'll need all their cunning to pull off the grand heist...<br /><br />Rupert Everett rises to the task of playing Miss Fritton (along with her brother, Carnaby) and delivers a strong comedy performance, matched step-for-step by Colin Firth who pokes good naturedly at his old \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" persona in one hilarious scene.  Russell Brand is the new incarnation of Flash Harry, and Gemma Arterton (\\"Lost in Austen\\") is the head girl, Kelly.<br /><br />It's never going to be in the same league or level of public adoration as the original film series, but ST. TRINIAN'S is a bold, colourful comedy romp that can be heartily enjoyed even if you haven't seen the previous titles.  The Blu-ray release (which is only encoded for Region B playback) includes behind-the-scenes footage, bloopers, music video for \\"Girls Aloud\\", and the trailer.  Recommended.
B00127RAJY|3.0|First of all, the workout is great ... when you get to it. The way they made the DVD is such that you have to watch a commercial for Biggest Loser show, then a warning and some other stuff before the workout every time! There's no fast forwarding right to the workouts! I found this highly flawed and annoying... especially when I do the workout every day.    The actual workouts were tough, yet simple. No choreography to learn. For some this may get boring, but if you want a quick, tough, no frills workout... this is great.
B00062ZE44|5.0|This was an amazing CD, I love every song on here! Can't go wrong with this one if you love Within Temptation.

I have both the earlier 1996 Abkco release and this one the 2002 DSD Remaster..This one is defiantly cleaner and more crisp, the older version however sounds more like the original vinyl with all its flaws and slower running time...I definitely prefer this one in the car because it is much easier to understand the words and hear the individual instruments, also the sound is more uplifting.
B002GJU54E|5.0|We got this book on audio, and listened to it on a major trip.  We laughed so hard we had to pull over and find a rest area.  Even our two sons (ages 12 and 9) stopped goofing off and were listening.  Whenever we stopped, they couldn't wait to get going and start the story again.   *    I have read other reviews, and I cannot believe that anyone would give this book less than five stars.  Yes, the story can be ridiculous at times; but that's what makes it fun.  What a great read!    *     Janet Evanovich has a wonderful sense of humor, and we get most of her books and take them on long drives simply because we cannot stand to stop the stories.
076790592X|5.0|My mom was passing away in February of 2009 and I began to read this to her even as she lay comatose.  After reading the first couple of pages to her, I had to put it down even though I know it's a book she would have loved.  The emotion of the time with her and the emotion involved with the book was too much for me.  She left us on February 21 and it wasn't until early April that I was able to pick this book up again and really read it.  It was a quick read and it really made me think about things.  I was so impressed with the book and the lessons that I learned from it that I bought my sons copies of their own.  My boys are 6 and 7 and this book is too advanced for them at the moment but when they get older, it's going to be required reading.  Not by their teachers but by their mother.  This is a book that was passed onto me by my aunt, my mom's sister, and I passed it on to someone else. Get yourself a cup of tea and a box of Kleenex and have a good read.
B001ICFE1E|5.0|I love this story! London below is Neverwhere and the storyline is so unique that I am sure I will read it again. The characters are so colorful and if you have ever been to London it is even more fun to read. This is a great fantasy, unlike anything I have read before.

1400079276|1.0|If you're a member of Gen-Y who thinks that the trippier and more nonsensical a piece of writing is the more profound its contents, then this book will be for you.   This book was the biggest single waste of time I've ever encountered in my life. The only points a person with an eye for decent literature can gauge from reading this massive, steaming pile of crap is that you'll \\"sound\\" really hip if you say you've read it.     I will say that from about page 100 on the plot became quite fascinating. (That is, if you can stomach the excruciating description of any and every minute detail of the protagonist's emo-tastic existence.) The fact that the story actually became interesting after that point is what angered me so much about the book. The author essentially used a bait and switch tactic to get you to believe that the plot was really going somewhere and then nothing. Dead stop. I wouldn't even call the ending an anti-climax. The reader is left with absolutely no idea of what happened or what will happen to the characters.     From what I gathered from a Wikipedia article, Murakami himself admits the story was written as a riddle with the possibility of several different endings based on the reader's interpretation. But even then he seemed to imply that there is no solid solution. In my strong opinion, Kafka on the Shore was nothing but the author's 400+ page masturbatory obsession with his own writing.
B0017R5UA0|5.0|First off the album is simply wonderful. It's laid back, tight harmonies, and flows smoothly song to song. What I didn't expect from the record was it also came with the Sun Giant EP which is more great music. Then even better it came with the mp3 download. I'm not sure if every album would come this way but if they do this is the album to buy.

B000ZI8E5K|1.0|I thought this was going to be a great book that was abridged from the great book \\"The power of the subconscious mind\\". However I was very disappointed. It was read so fast and it was done in less then 60 minutes. Everything is a list 1 thur 10. He doesn't even explain the most important things that the book is about. I have read the book twice and brought the book my self. I didn't buy this CD, the library brought it for me. I feel like I wasted there money on it. I don't suggest anybody waste $19.99 on a CD that you will get nothing out of it. If you want to read this great book, which I believe is very useful. You can buy the new book for $4.99 and from reading the preview it looks like it is the original version that the author Joseph Murphy wrote. I am amazed that they are selling it for a little amount of money. I know this is a very bad review, I am just looking out for everybody interest and I believe in being very honest. I know everybody works hard for their money and $4.99 is the best value and the most helpful in your life.

B00001SIES|3.0|Needless to say I like Muse a lot, they're my 3rd favorite band, and I had only 2 albums, Black Holes and Absolution, before buying this. Anyways, I picked this up the other day, because I was curious to hear Muse's debut. It's not a bad album... it's not much of an album really, it's more of a taste of things to come than anything. I like \\"Muscle Museum\\", \\"Unintended\\", \\"Hate This and I'll Love You\\" and \\"Sober\\". The rest is all... ehhh to me. That said I can excuse that. This was their first album and they were still searching for that sound. Needless to say, Origin of Symmetry is a better album and has their best track, \\"New Born\\", which was used at the end of \\"Haute Tension\\".

B001AQTWF2|5.0|I always admired Whitney's vocal strength and power.  Have you ever heard her her sing The Star Bangled Banner?  I don't think anyone has EVER sung it more impressively.  But I have to say that even though I admired her technical skill and vocal prowess, her music would come off as cold and technical to me.  A perfect tonal instrument, like a trumpet, but not much else.  The story is very different now.  Different voice, and a  different person behind it.  There is one thing that hard living will do for you if you survive it, and that is to give you a depth and maturity beyond superficialities.  Does she have the range anymore? Nope.  But I'll tell you what she finally does have....  she finally has soul.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|The beginning of the movie is not so interesting, but once you get past that part it is a good movie. Quite fascinating ACtually.

B00021R7CG|5.0|If you grew up during the \\"Cold War\\" period with the USSR, this movie is a great reminder of the feeling one carried back then that something just around the corner could go wrong.  I think the actors convey those feelings, especially the air crew on the B-52 that gets its orders to take the \\"grand tour.\\"  Just a great film, and as an added bonus, seeing Darren McGavin as the Secretary of the Interior going full-out Alexander Haig (\\"I'm in charge now\\" when Prez Reagan was shot in 1981, remember?) is really great.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|This was an excellent movie with a surprise sad ending. It held my interest the whole way through. There were funny parts also. Just an enjoyable movie
B002NHIK1E|4.0|For a cast of somewhat unknowns, the acting and direction is good. The cinematography has a nice look and the show doesn't appear low budget at all. While the books are based what is classified as a young adult series, I think this tries to expand the demographics. So far so good, I would say check it out, heck amazon it letting people watch it for free for now.
B000NJVWTQ|5.0|I'm not sure how I missed this recording the first time around. Remastered it's genius. Even my cockatiels are dancing along to the music.  There are just too many good songs to mention them all, but La Sagrada Familia, Standing on Higher Ground, and Closer to Heaven are all pristine. If you're going to buy one AP recording, this is certainly one to consider.
031236198X|4.0|Okay, maybe not, but change agent John Kotter sure does.  His acclaimed change agent book uses an easy to read fable to illustrate the timely and sensitive topic. Using a penguin colony faced with news that their iceberg is melting, he demonstrates the team struggle and creates scenarios similar to the ones us non-penguins encounter daily in our quest or resistance to change and shows how a collective, driven and organized process can bring results.    How individuals manage and respond to change is the difference between success and disruption. Most literature on change deals with a logical process, in Kotter's case: setting the stage, deciding what to do, making it happen and making it stick.  Read by itself, the effect on the reader is minimal.  Read through the lens of a heroic story makes it easy for the educated mind to drop its analytical reasoning and put change in the context of the human element.      Whether or not you have a melting iceberg, the roadblocks the colony faces and triumph of innovative thinking creates a story that we all want to be a part of as we navigate our organizational changes.  If penguins can be successful in change, why can't we?    Review by Brandy Gonsoulin, Account Executive at Stinson Brand Innovation

B002O5M4SA|4.0|I watched this years ago and recently revisited it again. Natalie Portman's coming out was gang-busters. This was a hard act for her to follow. She played a girl trying to survive in a dangerous world that didn't give a damn. It was a powerful role that she did so well. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it. Jean Reno was a combination of vulnerable and dangerous. He was a highly effective assassin but illiterate and was cheated by his \\"friend\\" who lined up his jobs for him and kept his money. It was wonderful to see him snared by Portman's character and his slowly becoming absolutely dedicated to her. I own this movie from which I became a Jean Reno fan. I don't think either one has played a better movie.
B001JNNE64|5.0|This is a Warner Bros type phenomenon in a sense that they always seem to have these digipack releases, in this case Amadeus. Doesn't come in the usual blu ray plastic case, Another version will be released soon without these included items, this version includes a hardcover book with the first cover having the blu ray as soon as you open it , in the middle you have 36 pages of words and pictures about the movie and the end cover of the book has a 'special cd compilation' with 8 tracks on it done by Sir Neville Marriner, Academy of St. Martin-in-the-fields. The price isn't too bad either. Get it now before it gets deleted!
B00003CXB2|5.0|This movie is a classic.  I own very few DVD's, but this is one that I consider a must-have for any collection.  It is a long movie, so not something you can sit down and watch quickly.  However, it is a fantastic story with great acting by all involved.        Peter O'Toole is great in the role of Lawrence.  I can't imagine the part being played by someone else.  Alec Guinness (no lightsaber) is his usual great self as well.       My wife even likes this movie and she hates war movies!       If you have not seen this film you cannot call yourself a movie buff.  Guarantee that it makes your list of top 50 movies once you've seen it.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Those that have waited as I have for SO long for this second edition...you won't be disappointed at all.    The guitar riffs are even better this time.  I was so happy to hear real drums and real string noises.  This isn't computerized, and it's not over edited.  I enjoyed hearing Chris Daughtry doing his own harmony.  My CD is in the car-- so GO GET YOUR OWN!!
0393312836|5.0|Hello me droogies. I was intrigued by the movie and finally read the book.  Very strange look at the future of crime, punishment, rehabilitation and all the ultra-violence.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I've been a big Beatles fan for years, ever since I got the One collection from the library in middle school so I could finally hear what the fuss was about.  Then I picked up the Love mixes.  But being a Beatles lover and a History buff, I really wanted to know what it was like in the Beatles days with release after release coming.  Well, it is impossible for me to experience that as the fab four changed music forever.  But this collection is the closest I will ever get.  I ultimately went with Mono over the Stereo set because of the record sleeves and the \\"truer\\" sound.<br /><br />So I finally received the set, and I am not disappointed.  It's like discovering the Beatles all over again.  This is worth the price just because It it is all the Beatles music minus three albums, and they're the best they've ever sounded.  It's as close to perfect as it will ever be. I LOVe it.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Regarding the first four CDs, the solution to the remasterd 2009 mono versus stereo controversy is simple: rip the first four CDs to PCM 16 bit stereo wav files. Save each of the files as 16 bit mono wavs, rip to CD, tadaa! You have remastered Beatles music in glorious mono. I tried this today: it worked flawlessly and sounds great! And... it saved me a few bucks, too. I use Goldwave sound editor to rip and save the tracks. It supports multiple formats and is reasonably priced.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Sicko is a must see movie.  If you think you have good insurance and suddenly find that you are denied treatment by an insurance company bureaucrat,this is your story.  This movie is not about the uninsured, it's about those who have insurance but are at the peril of being denied needed treatment because their insurance company, for one reason or another, denies their claims.  This movie spells out one of the two most important reasons that this country needs health care reform now.  The other reason, of course, is that so many people cannot afford, or cannot obtain,[[ASIN:B000UNYJXQ Sicko (Special Edition)]] needed insurance coverage.  Three cheers for the working man's director, the man with a scruffy beard and blue jeans, who produces the very best documentaries that I have ever seen.

0307454541|5.0|His work would probably look a lot like this.<br /><br />Believe the hype - the late Stieg Larsson's \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is that rare best seller that is well written and intelligent while complex and threaded with multiple themes without sacrificing readability.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter and principal in a boutique Stockholm financial periodical, is trapped in a libel suit against a rich and powerful industrialist.  In order to protect the identity of his source, he mounts only a feeble defense, costing him a short prison term, his job, and his reputation.  While in forced a exile aimed at figuring out where to take his wrecked life, he is contracted by the retired business scion Henrik Vanger, an octogenarian tormented for half of his life by the unsolved disappearance and apparent murder of his grand niece Harriet.  Vanger offers Blomkvist the lucrative opportunity to chronicle the Vanger family history as a ruse for investigating Harriet's demise.  Enter Lisbeth Salander, an anorexic twenty-something pierced and tattooed social recluse, but a personal investigator enigma of idiot savant-like capabilities.<br /><br />This is a multi-layered novel that delivers across increasingly deepening strata.  On the surface, it is simply a terrific mystery - a well spun yarn of a four-decades old murder, the classic \\"murder in a locked room\\" set on an island made inescapable due to a wrecked tanker blocking the bridge, a game of \\"Clue\\" played on an epic scale.<br /><br />One level lower, it is a pleasantly twisted love story that only works given Sweden's casual morality and sexual freedom.  Larsson's romance angle fits deftly into the storyline, never distracting the reader from the primary dark path along which the author leads, but building sexual tension that complements the sinister storyline.  Which says a lot about Larsson's well-drawn and likeable characters, from the affable Blomkvist to the aggressive and infinitely more interesting Salander, a disturbed and dangerous young woman with open surface hostilities masking and protecting a more sensitive inside.  Salander is the latest - and best - of strong renegade punk female protagonists, a trend that goes back at least as far as Cae Hardin in Boston Teran's cult crime classic \\"God is a Bullet\\", and more recently in Joe Hill's \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" or Derek Nikitas' gripping but undiscovered \\"Pyres\\".<br /><br />On a deeper level, Stieg Larsson's Scandinavian backdrop is the perfect setting for this story that, like Sweden's seasons and culture, turns unexpectedly brutal despite the pastoral and friendly setting and genteel society.  Socialist Larsson takes multiple swipes at capitalism and those who practice it, but thankfully he stays far enough away from the soapbox to preserve the strength of his story and his cast.<br /><br />Larsson may be at the top of a recent flood of fine Scandinavian crime fiction translated for US readers.  While still capturing that classic fatalism of northern European lit, Larsson stops a few shades light of Arnaldur Indridason's Stygian black but gripping Icelandic crime novels featuring the morose Inspector Erlander Sveinsson.  And if his prose falls short of Karin Fossum's beautifully written Norwegian mysteries, Larsson is, if not more readable, at least more commercially attractive.  Or Jo Nesbo, whose Oslo settings may be the closest match to Larsson's page-turning drama and riveting action.<br /><br />In short, a true blockbuster that had me stopping by Amazon half way through to pick up the sequel, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"  It's a shame that Larsson won't be around to keep this intriguing series going, so make sure to savor these.nd dangerous young woman with open surface hostilities masking and protecting a more sensitive inside.

B000FDECGA|3.0|Ok so here goes to put this simply they, have taken 2 movies and made one, as this is actually parts of the two \\"Lone Wolf and Cub\\" films. They cut and edited them to create another title so you are basically getting a condensed version. All in all it was still entertaining.. I would recommend that you by the original 2 films however.
155297944X|5.0|I had seen this book several years ago and cried when I first read it. I have wanted to own it since that time. It's a wonderful, meaningful story that will stay with children and adults alike. It shows the unconditional love that exists between a parent and a child that time cannot shake.     This is a book that should be in every child's [or adult's] library.
0440244870|4.0|This book kept me pretty interested, it's fun and clever.  Most of all I could identify w/ the character, her debt and silliness! The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 was because the characters lying got on my nerves after a while, it just got really annoying.  Also the book isn't anything that draws you in, I couldn't read it in 1 day.  You just have to go into it knowing it's a light, comedic book and take it for what it is.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|And this is a great film. Christian Bale is amazing as well. Highly recommend it!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I am completely satisfied that I purchased this! What a great collection of some of the best from Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5. When I have kids this will be one that we will enjoy together!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I heard about this workout DVD through another blog and decided to give it a shot. Boy am I glad that I did. It is quite possibly the best thing I've bought in a long time. Jillian is no joke and she really pushes you. In order for it to pay off though, you have to push yourself. Every morning I religiously get up and go at it again. It's tough, but amazing. BUY IT!
B001041JLE|5.0|What can I say but Michael Jackson is the greatest! This album was definitely one for record books. If you cannot find a song on here that you don't like then I feel sorry for you. R.I.P. to one of the greatest recording artists of our time.
0634022296|4.0|This book won't help you if you don't already know how a song sounds, since it doesn't contain any musical notation. And, sometimes the chord selections seem a little odd, especially at first. But in reality, they are admirably accurate the vast majority of the time (I was humbled a couple of times when I listened back to the recording and realized the book was right, and I was wrong), and overall this book manages to balance simplicity with enough color to give a real sense of the songs. That means that more than any other book I've encountered, you can pick this up and dive right into playing the Beatles in a way that is really satisfying. Great for sing-alongs, except it doesn't stay open real well.
0316066524|4.0|i think i may have a record here....i started reading \\"infinite jest\\" 3 months after my 72nd birthday, in may 2008...that's 16 months ago if you can believe it, and today i finished it.  along the way, everyone i know who had asked me what book i was reading would get my answer and the time spent on it at that juncture. i snuck in 3 or 4 current novels in between, but i stayed with \\"infinite jest\\" too.  what do i think? well, as dave eggers states in his foreward, it is brilliant, transforming, difficult etc. etc.....but, my overall reaction is that it is ironic above all else.  no writer is \\"entertaining\\" you by repeating scatalogical references ad nauseum (literally as well as figuratively), going into \\"infinite details\\" about drug dealers. drug usage, and drug and alcohol abuse...no more \\"entertaining\\" than himself's recording called \\"infinite jest\\", which if actually viewed could kill you or drive you mad (ref. horatio and the gravedigger in hamlet, decribing yorick as a man of infinite jest).   many, many pages were hard to read (not hard to understand though) and here, for me, is the ultimate irony......my belief is that david foster wallace purposely wanted to sicken you, piss you off, get you as angry as he is about \\"entertaining\\" you...meaning all of us. i think he is so annoyed at our pleasure-driven, pleasure-seeking society that he purposely wants you to feel put upon, annoyed, frustrated at reading his novel.  do i still recommend it? yes

0783229364|4.0|THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS literally reeks of the Eighties, from the fashions to the hair to the syrupy soundtrack.  Yet this light-as-a-feather Michael J. Fox comedy is still worth a gander, if only for the ribald humor dripping with double entendres--and some slapstick thrown in for good measure.  Fox pulls all of it off without breaking a sweat, and he's the motor that makes this comedy go.<br /><br />Playing a Kansas hayseed wanting to make a name for himself in the Big Apple, Fox's character gets hired by his egomaniacal uncle (Richard Jordan) to work in the mailroom of uncle's Fortune 500 corporation--a corporation fighting off a hostile takeover.  Dissatisfied with his lowly mailroom status, Fox takes up residence in a deserted office and pretends to be an executive (a \\"suit\\"), causing a sensation in the upper echelons of the corporate hierarchy, and garnering the affections of a certain young female executive (Helen Slater)--who also happens to be having an affair with the uncle.  There are several other layers to the plot, but suffice it to say there is a bedroom-swapping \\"Gotcha!\\" moment, followed by an over-the-top feel good ending.  And the limo rides off into the sunset.<br /><br />Again, Fox is at his forte here, but this movie really gels because of its supporting cast, including a hysterical Margaret Whitton playing Fox's man-hungry aunt, Jordan himself, and Gerry Bamman as a brown-nosing \\"yes\\" man.  Unfortunately, Slater is the weak link, but Fred Gwynne makes a strong cameo as a ruthless corporate raider.  It may be lame Eighties through and through, yet THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS is still comedy gold.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

B002BSHWUU|3.0|I've heard a lot of this because my sister-in-law bought it. I'll wait for the mono box and get that. When I first heard about the new releases, I was hoping for remixed stereo too. No such luck, so I'll save my bucks. The Beatles' music is of course timeless - and that's part of why this is not worthy of them. I have all of the original Beatle CDs from the 80s and was even suckered into buying the later \\"anniversary\\" White Album, which was supposed to be remastered then, but was not. It sounds exactly like the first edition. Beatle fans have had to wait 22 years for new upgraded CDs, and this was four years in the making so they say, and they don't even bother remixing the albums. Unbelievable - especially when you hear how fantastic releases like \\"Yellow Submarine Songbook\\" and \\"Love\\" sound remixed. The producers of these new editions claim they are looking with these releases and the big promotion to bring the Beatles to the new generation - the IPod generation. I got news for them - many of the young people who are used to modern stereo mixes with proper balance et who are hearing these Beatle albums with their original wack stereo mixes on their headphones will be even more turned off than I've been for decades. Many of the Beatle stereo mixes simply sound atrocious, and \\"headphones\\" expose this blatantly.     And there were plenty of good rock stereo mixes in the 1960s in general - even early 60s, (see Elvis, Roy Orbison et) so the \\"stereo was still new in the 60s\\" crap is crap. Some of the stereo Beatle songs I flat out cannot listen to on headphones because they are so bad and so annoying. The ping-pong sound - extreme separation between channels - no proper bottom end/rhythm section balance - drums way off far to one side and back in the mix, the rest of the band on the other, and the vocals on one end or the other, with some stupid tambourine mixed louder than the goddamn drums on some of the mid-period tracks - and empty space galore in the center. Ridiculous. Many of the early/middle period stereo mixes suffer this badly in one form or another, and even worse, some of the most killer later Beatle rockers - Revolution, Paperback Writer, Taxman et should be illegal, the stereo mixes are so horrible and hurt those tracks so badly - the mono mixes are far better and far more punchier, heavier and badass sounding. At least everything is centered there, which is why they sound far better than the poor, unbalanced stereo versions. You can even find these tracks on YouTube in either mono or remix -- put on your headphones and listen to them, then to the official stereo versions. The official versions stink.     Compare the official track of \\"I'm Down\\" with the Anthology version and mix. No comparison, the original stinks, and the further they go, the further Ringo disappears. Even on \\"The End\\" from Abbey Road, once Ringo's solo is past and they start jammin, his drums immediately fall back in the mix and off to one side once again - even on a jam like that. Ludicrous. With today's equipment and technology, as has already been proven, the Beatles' tracks can and should be remixed properly without hurting the original atmosphere and integrity of the songs at all. I bought the \\"Capitol\\" box sets for one reason - to get the far better mono versions of many songs from those albums that sound like crap in stereo, including \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" et. I won't be flim-flammed again. I love the Beatles as much as anybody, and the \\"YSS\\" and \\"Love\\" CDs sound beautiful, warm, spacious and balanced - but I'll wait for the new mono box set to buy all of their stuff again. There ain't enough difference to me to merit laying down 200 clams for \\"louder\\" and slightly cleaned up versions of tracks with the same old lousy stereo mixes. For a body of work as timeless and important as The Beatles, this is criminal. And as somebody else said, will we see remixes a few years down the road after they milk Beatle fans yet again with this? I'll wait.

0783229526|5.0|I'd read the book - not because I'm interested in drug use or Las Vegas or even Hunter Thompson as person, but because I'm interested in experimental writing and experimental it certainly was.    As stories go, this wasn't really my cup of tea, though I liked the fact/fiction, stream-of-consiousness and the blending of literary symbolism with fact-based events. To me, these were really the only redeeming qualities of the book. Naturally I wondered how a book so heavily reliant on literary devices would translate to film - I had some serious doubts....    ...and they were proven to be dubious. The movie was just the same as the book, practically word for word except the actor's interpretations of the characters made them more (IMHO)likable. In the movie I was better able to understand their motivations, their fears and why things that for me fell flat in the book were hilarious on film.    The one and only thing I would have done differently would have been to add the scene where they are asking the woman at the taco stand where to find the American Dream. This part of the book had me cracking up and I was surprised to find it absent from the movie.    Final thoughts: If you get this disc be sure to check out the deleted scenes. Some important elements of the overall subtext wound up on the cutting room floor. Also, if you can only see this film as the story of two drug addled psychos and their shennanigans (and that bothers you), then skip it, but if you can bear in mind that this is really a story about the state of American cultural consciousness in the 70s then you'll probably find quite a few things to like about this film. I'd also recommend reading a little about Hunter Thompson to gain a better perspective of why he wrote it and futher appreciation for how spot-freakin-on Depp's performance is.
B0013FSL0C|4.0|it is a great series as everybody else already stated. it feels so real and gabriel byrne is so GREAT as a therapist.  unfortunately, the episodes are too short. i wish there was a bit more to see around the therapy talks.    otherwise its great - sometimes painfully real (especially the story around amy and her husband).
B001AKTZPK|5.0|...there was CCR's Willy and the Poor Boys in 1969.  The Stones's Exile (1972) is probably my favorite rock n roll album, but this gem by CCR -- easily their best -- makes my top 10.  I always found it interesting how Exile has been heaped with praise over the years for being the ultimate expression of American roots music, and the work of foreigners no less!  Well, the fact is that these good ol' boys from northern California were laying down all sorts of American genres (blues, folk, rock, gospel) well before the Stones starting tooling around Alabamy.  You want an album chock full of Americana with a coherent, dirty, bluesy, grimy, unbridled rock n roll sound to which you can swig bourbon and party into the wee hours on a Saturday night?  Look no further than Willy and the Poor Boys.  I don't mean to disparage the Rolling Stones, not one bit, but CCR doesn't get their just due for doing Exile way before the Mick and Keith got around to it in the south of France.  Just listen to \\"It Came Out of the Sky.\\"  That crunchy guitar sound with its relentless rhythmic strokes perfectly captures the very same sound that made Exile On Main St legendary.  Gotta give John Fogerty and his gang their due.  They were the first 60s rock n rollers to trod this turf, and the first of any race or creed to make an album like this.
B000002U94|4.0|This is an excellent album as far as a good sampler of Bob's music at the time, and his great abilities as a live artist.<br /><br />My only problem is with the editing of the original release for cd.  In my opinion, the best performance on the original album was \\"Brave Strangers\\" and it's not even here.  And why edit the last cut on the disc?  Yes, it was on \\"Live Bullet\\" and was better there, but still...  Why not put out the complete album as originally released and add a few bonus tracks to fill out a 2nd cd?  Believe me, Bob's got enough fans that would buy it immediately--just look at the clamoring for his back catalog of classics to be released.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This set of DVDs is amoung my favorite. I actually watched the entire series twice; a thing I rarely do. Well worth the investment.
0307269981|5.0|I didn't think he could top the first book but \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire' goes far beyond 'Dragon Tattoo' in almost every realm, particularly suspense. It has been a long time since I stayed up until 4:30 AM to finish a book but at a certain point in this terrific novel, you simply cannot stop until you get to the end. Maddening, surprising, wonderful twists and turns abound, with a few set piece 'action scenes' that could not be better drawn. Read the first, terrific in its own right, to get the most out of Volume 2. I cannot wait for the final novel in the series.
0553450530|1.0|After reading the book, I've got to commend Hollywood for taking a totally lame piece of material and making it good on the screen.  The book is utterly unbelievable -- Jason Bourne is rendered into an utter wimp, girlfriend Marie's attraction to him makes NO SENSE AT ALL (and she is just plain annoying in the book!).  Further, Jason's success pivots on people who do the unbelievable -- taxi drivers who obey his very unusual orders without second thought, spy enemies who are all too willing to spill their beans for no apparent reason, an ultra top secret hideout that is penetrated by a group of guys posing as movers, completely lame.    Frankly, if I didn't like the Bourne movies, I would never have made it through the book.  I'm reading the Bourne Supremacy with the hope that Ludlum can redeem himself (about 100 pages in, it's not looking so good).  If the 2nd is no better than the 1st, then the whole thing goes down in flames in my book.      Anyone who has read Tom Clancy will be in for a huge disappointment with Ludlum.    P.S.  I didn't listen to the audio book, I actually read the book.  Somehow I must've ended up on the audiocassette review.
B00026YO36|5.0|I love this record. I thought i was the only 'real' Lanegan fan until I heard \\"One hundred days\\" on Rescue Me a few episodes ago. It was a perfect fit on the show. I want to hear more Lanegan on the show. It works! One of my favorite songs on the album is \\"Morning Glory Wine\\". You either get it or you don't.    Buy this if you like Lanegan at all! You must get this.
B001TK3XPE|5.0|Great book that captures the humor and the pathos of hearing loss. Some of the narrator's observations made me believe that he had witnessed conversations between my husband and myself! Every character, with the possible exception of the graduate student Alex, seemed real. Everyday situations made me laugh, and a few made me cry. The visit to Auschwitz about 3/4 of the way through the novel was exceptionally vivid and emotionally powerful. In addition, Desmond (the narrator) is dealing with an aging father, a wife whose career has just begun to take off as his own has ended, and a world in which it is increasingly difficult for him to find meaning.  And yet, he does.  Lots of food for thought, many opportunities for discussion.
0307245306|5.0|My children (8 1/2 year-old boy and 13 year-old girl) both agree this story CD is great. They're currently listening to it for the 3rd time. If we're in the car for more than 3 minutes they beg to listen (and to keep going around the block when we get home). Great story to please all ages (well 7 and up, I'd say) and genders for a long car trip!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|My 3-yr old son loves this movie so much; when he got a hold of our previous copy and scratched it up, we needed another one but dreaded trying to find a copy in the middle of summer as well as paying full price. Found it on Amazon, new, for about $5. Problems solved! And it arrived quickly on top of it all! Thanks for a perfect transaction!
0061537969|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. Mr Stein will change the way you think about dogs, race cars and life.
0452286751|4.0|Well, I have to say that I was expecting more philosophizing and less drama here.  But in the end, The Fountainhead is a drama.  A drama with a message, but a drama nonetheless.  This drama features characters unlike any I've ever met before, so I'm not sure that such personalities exist here in the real world.  Perhaps the characters are meant to represent hypothetical extremes of pesonalities.  But characters that I cannot relate to unfortunately make the message more difficult to relate to as well.    Because it's a drama, the ~700 pages actually read fairly quickly.  The language and style are quite pedestrian; a 5th grader should be able to get through the novel quite easily though the \\"message\\" would likely not be fully appreciated by one so young.  The story is gripping and becomes a struggle of good against evil.  Good is represented by the egoists, evil by the mundane and mediocre whose agenda is to stifle genius and promote collectivism.  A bizarre love story is intertwined through the greater plot.  The novel is set in early 20th century New York, which was the most modern city in the world at the time, so even now in the 21st century there's nothing really outdated about it.  And the New York setting lends greater dynamism and pace to the plot.    This is not, as you may often hear, a story about the field of architecture.  It just so happens that the main characters work in that field, but the story (and message) could have been nearly the same if written about any other field.  In fact, when reading the many architectural discussions throughout the book it became painfully obvious to me that Rand did not have an architectural background, and I'm not even an architect.  Some of those discussions should have been omitted as they didn't really add value to the story or the message.    The message seems to basically be that only people with great ambition for personal success or perfection generally advance technology or the arts and thereby our standard of living.  By nurturing such \\"egoists\\" and not obstructing their way, we allow the fruits of their work to be integrated into our culture, and this ultimately betters society as a whole.  The implication is that humanity would be much farther along after, say, 500 years of nurturing egoism than after 500 years of stifling it.    It's a compelling theory and I will not speculate on the long-term benefits to society, but I seem to see an obvious and major downside to the theory: Because an egoist could easily be a power hungry madman with no good intentions, short-term trauma on a massive scale could be a possible outcome.  Is theoretically faster progress worth that pain?    I don't think it's as simple as Rand makes it out to be.  Throughout history, egoists have arguably led the advance of technology and the arts.  However, they have also started wars resulting in appalling levels of bloodshed, sponsored attempts at genocide, stolen peoples' retirement nest eggs through corporate crime & scandal, etc.  The problem is, egoism does not necessarily connote genius and good intentions.  Egoism could just as easily come with cunning and a thirst for money & power without regard for who is injured as a consequence.    A good read.  I would not call it brilliant as many have.  In fact I did not find it particularly well written from the standpoint of style.  However, I can see that if the message were to ring true for someone then the book could be seen as brilliant.
0312567448|4.0|I really don't understand the people who are negatively reviewing this book. It makes absolutely no sense to me. What were they expecting? An exact replica of the one from the film Sex & the City? Are they willing to cough up $100 like J.K. Rowling asked when she replicated the Tales of the Beedle Bard?...didn't think so.<br /><br />I have this book, I read it and I LOVED it. I found it in a bookstore actually and had no idea it was even a real book until I accidentally came across it. I'm really glad that I did.<br /><br />Before you get to the real letters, the page before gives you a historical background on the person who wrote it, who they wrote it too and their life. It's very short, to the point and very sweet.<br /><br />This book is an easy and enjoyable read. It's not meant to be life changing or drama infested. It is what it is and if you are someone who could appreciate that, then all the more power to you.<br /><br />So basically, if you want an enjoyable, easy and historical romantic read -- here you go. This is the book for you.<br />Take it or leave it. I bought it, it's a keeper and I hope you enjoy it too :)
0545123267|5.0|Loved this book. I know for teen readers, but what a fantastic read. If you loved twilight you will love this. I could not put it down and did not want to.

B0025KVLUG|3.0|Six Beatles songs, four of which appear exclusively on this album, accompany seven tracks of the original score for the titular animated film composed by the group's long-time producer George Martin. Martin's orchestrations match the whimsical spirit of the film but don't call out for an independent listen as much as the songs featured on this disc. The psychedelic \\"Only a Northern Song\\" and \\"It's All Too Much\\" are written by George Harrison. Paul McCartney's childlike \\"All Together Now\\" is one of the band's most upbeat and John Lennon's rocker \\"Hey Bulldog\\" pulsates with a driving bass. The song \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is borrowed from the album Revolver and \\"All You Need is Love\\" is available on Magical Mystery Tour, so owning those LPs reduces the value of this CD. Although the Yellow Submarine album has previously been presented in artificial stero enhancement, this remaster presents the music in mono as it was originally mixed. The embedded mini-documentary is made up of footage from the movie and audio clips of the four Beatles talking about album.
B001QOGY72|3.0|I actually went to the theatre to see this (something I loathe with all the popcorn eaters and cell phones ringing). . . it was entertaining.  Not as funny as depicted in the trailers - but interesting.  I don't want to own it, but I could say I don't regret seeing it. Let me put it this way, I wasn't irritated or angry when I left the theatre. . . but I wasn't elated or joyful either.
B001F0RA4S|5.0|An Astounding peice of writing that can change the way you think abt life....My Favorite so Far

0061478784|5.0|This is an excellent book!  The story is fantastic.  The book itself is sturdy and well printed.
B001AVCFJM|4.0|I went to the theatre to see this movie only because a friend wanted me to go with them.  I've always enjoyed Star Trek (and the subsequent series and movies), but I have to admit that the idea of \\"going back to the beginning\\"  - with a completely new cast - had me skeptical, especially in this day and age when remakes and sequels seem to be a substitute for originality and creativity.  After seeing the movie, I was pleasantly surprised.  While this new movie is very different from what Star Trek fans are used to, it is a great reinvention of the classic series.<br /><br />One of the strong points of the movie is the acting.  Chris Pine plays the role of Kirk with some of the personality of a young William Shatner, but he adds his own spark to the character as well.  I was also impressed by Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban in their respective roles as Spock and McCoy.<br /><br />The cinematography of the film is generally good, although it does have some weaknesses.  One weak point I noticed was during the fight scenes (the camera is in so close and cuts back and forth so frequently that the scenes can be hard to follow - an unfortunate trend, especially in newer movies).<br /><br />The writing/directing was good as well.  Without giving any spoilers, I'll say that the movie is written in such a way that audiences can take nothing from the TV series for granted.  Again, the plot got a little confusing at points, but never terribly bad.  It should probably be noted, however, that people who are not already fans of Star Trek will have difficulty understanding everything.<br /><br />One thing that really stood out was Michael Giacchino's fantastic musical score for the movie.  It really added good emotion, suspense, and oveall depth to the scenes.<br /><br />My advice to any Trek fan is to give this a chance.
B000002U9L|5.0|Love both the film and the soundtrack.  You have a dozen songs equally divided between David Bowie and Trevor Jones. Bowie's voicing Jareth is the lodestone of his work--he's the perfect goblin king.  Trevor Jones's instrumentals also have an electric eerie sound that's still viable today.  The sound quality is great on the recording and the music is enjoyable outside of the film. You could use this CD to audition speakers--particularly the instrumentals like \\"Into the Labyrinth.\\"     Rebecca Kyle, September 2009
