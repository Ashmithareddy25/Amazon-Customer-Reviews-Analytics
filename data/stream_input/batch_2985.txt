0345536886|5.0|I like John Grisham's style although I'm not always thrilled with some of the ways he manages to get his characters into trouble - but overall, he manages to carry the story.<br /><br />While this one starts off on a bit of a corny note - an attorney bailing a high-pressure, high-income job by diving into an elevator and cowering in a corner, then hiding out in a local bar until he is smashed enough to head home, it really does develop into a novel where you come to care for David Zinc and the unconventional partnership he ends up with.<br /><br />I think this one hit home because it is a bit farcical in places but it really does emphasize something important - sometimes the only way out of a situation is through the situation. So David's foray into the world of being a street lawyer teaches him all of the things that he never learned at Harvard, and as he wets his feet for the first time in court he gets a bit overwhelmed, but somehow finds his way through the experience.<br /><br />Unlike some of his other books, I found this particular novel to be FUN rather than intense.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|OK - I'm a 53 year old conservative republican Banker - but when Ian Hunter says in the song \\"when I'm President, I'm gonna lean on the 1%\\" - I really don't mind and I sing along.  This guy has passion.  Later in the song he references how everyone changes \\"when they become president\\".  I've been a fan forever, saw him for the first time a few year ago, and I have 75% of his recorded material on my IPOD, but this album truly blew me away - the same way David Bowie's latest album did.  Ian's Shrunken Heads and Man Overboard are solid records - but this is over the top.  A GREAT rock and roll record - which there aren't many of lately.  Some Rock, Some blues, Some Ballads - GREAT lyrics and a stronger voice than recent records - and a kick ass band.  Roll down the windows, crank it up, and be an embarrassing gray haired 53 year old rocking and pounding his steering wheel on the drive home.  I am - and I LOVE IT.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|After over two years of waiting and hoping, we finally set course. Gravity tells a story about survival, loneliness, with a grieving character (Ryan Stone). The film focuses on the pleasures of space but also the fear that it can bring. Some may say the film lacks in story and instead is big on visuals, I disagree. The visuals themselves are used as characters and emotions. Bullock was phenomenal and if she were not to get a nomination for an Oscar I would be surprised, though I would not be surprised if she won. Clooney to does an excellent job being the spirit that guides Bullock (Stone) in her journey through the silence and uncertainty of space. All in all this film is breathtaking from many areas, visually and emotionally. This is a film that will stand in time as the best \\"space\\" film created to date and will also be beloved by audiences of all generations. In short, an instant classic.
B004XKVPG6|5.0|This blu ray is super cheap, came quickly(for me at least), looks stunning in HD, and has five commentaries. Even if you've already seen Se7en, I'd recommend this just for the commentaries(one even has Brad Pitt David Fincher, and Morgan Freeman talking about the film).
B006T5FDLG|3.0|The tunes are decent, but the right songs made it to the proper album. The rough production takes away from the four cuts on this E.P.
1476727651|4.0|I bought and read Dr. Sleep the day it came out, and it was a good book.  I loved the fact that in the beginning we got our little time-warp back to Danny's post-Outlook life and learned a little of what had happened after he and his mother survived their ordeal that was so very chillingly recounted in The Shining.<br /><br />I love Danny.  He's one of my all-time favorite characters.  But the place in his life where we meet up with him makes him pretty difficult to love - and most of us would dismiss him as the hero of the story if we weren't so aware of his unique past.<br /><br />I don't want to throw out too many spoilers, but I have to say that the True Knot wasn't the kind of villain that really makes you lose sleep - at least in the context of their prey turned nemeses they were clearly not up to snuff.  They just weren't that scary or threatening, IMO.<br /><br />And the story came together a little too easily.  It just flowed a little bit too smoothly for a King novel.<br /><br />And that brings me to my biggest gripe about the whole book.  While it was a good novel and I read it in one setting and it was satisfying, it seemed to lack the depth that I have come to expect from Stephen King's work.  It seemed as though it was missing so much of the detail and dimension that have made his novels so unique and unforgettable.  I think back to The Tommyknockers, where I could visualize every character, every tree, every street, every house and compare it to Dr. Sleep and I feel kind of short-changed.  I didn't have time to develop connections to people or places in the story in the manner  that I usually do when I read a Stephen King novel.  I kinda felt short changed.<br /><br />That is all.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|An amazing way to tell a story.<br />Very intricate and complicated to those who do not pay attention.<br /><br />The story telling is extremely good and the puzzles arent too complicated, but do require quite a bit of thinking outside the box sometimes.<br />The way the answers and questions all intersect for every route you take gives the player a &#34;Wow&#34; and &#34;Aha&#34; plus &#34;No WAY!&#34; moments. Going through the different endings can be addicting. The search for answers just keep getting more and more obsessive.<br /><br />Who is ZERO? What are the connections? Why are we here? Who can I trust?<br /><br />Those who have enjoyed Professor Layton, Lux Pain, and other visual novels and puzzles might like this game.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Captivating and not overly descriptive, I have problems reading books that spend pages discribing a scene. Hence I haven't lasted through many classic novels. This series really draws you in ,enjoy.
B007DQ8P5Q|5.0|*Note: This set is retired and while MSRP was 70, prices have subsequently risen. You can check the going rate of retired Lego sets at Bricklink.com*<br /><br />I know, all Lego sets are worth five stars. I love Lego too, but please hear me out.<br /><br />This is Lego's second house from the Creator line for 2011, the first being the Log Cabin (5766) and the third being the Lighthouse (5770). I like just about all the Creator sets because they avoid specialized pieces, often use ingenious building techniques, have multiple build directions, and usually come with a very useful assortment of bricks. Creator sets are closer to how Lego was when I was a kid.<br /><br />This is a two story white house with gray trim, a red roof, beige windows and a blue front door. This set is called the Hillside House because the house and yard are raised one brick (as if on a hill). The house has a lot going on: an electronic sound brick for the doorbell/dog bark, a blue car, carport, cool french doors, solar panel, mini-figure, dog, BBQ, etc. There are three builds, all of them feature a lift-off top for access to the lower floor. The first design also has a hinged roof portion while the second and third designs have a swinging wall that allows for additional access. I like the second design best; Lego calls it a Holiday home but it has nice modern lines and the solar panels have been turned into a small pool.<br /><br />I'm not as keen on this set as the other Creator house sets for 2011. Part of the reason is value. Though this set features an electronic brick and has some interior features, the set shows significant price inflation. Compare, for example with Lego 4954 from 2007, which was at the same price point but featured 1174 bricks versus the Hillside House's 714. The Apple Tree House (5891) from last year is still widely available, is of similar proportions (though no car or sound brick) and is 35% less. Compared to the 2011 sets, I think you get just as much playability, ifnot more, from the lower priced Log Cabin or Lighthouse (this latter one also includes an electronic light brick).<br /><br />Another reason I recommend the other sets is they are more unique. I believe the 2011 Lighthouse is the first dedicated lighthouse they've offered. The Log Cabin is also an unusual design. By comparison, Lego often has a suburban style home in their lineup. Similarly the other sets have more rare colors and shapes. White bricks and red roof tiles are classic Lego, but they are fairly common. The Log Cabin's rust roof tiles, the Lighthouse's curved corner bricks, and the Apple Tree House's blue roof tiles are more difficult to find and are very useful in making your own unique designs.<br /><br />This is still a great house with many fun features. I just don't think it stacks up as well against Lego's other offerings. And if you are a parent who tires easily of repetitive electronic toy sounds, you will want to hide the doorbell brick.
B008Y212PI|5.0|this is a fun pizzle to do &amp; is fast to fill in. I like being able to fill in the blocks faster than another app that is similar. can be challenging to do.
B004OT2QLO|5.0|**Update early 2013: this set is now discontinued and the price is rising. For value, I recommend the [[ASIN:B004478GGK Lego Log Cabin]] while supplies last. There are three Creator structures slated for 2013, a small cottage, a treehouse, and a family house.**<br /><br />I think this is one of the best sets of 2011. This is a creative, original design that is fun to build and play with.<br /><br />-This is, as far as I can tell, Lego's first dedicated lighthouse. There have been other lighthouse-like structures (e.g. the Coast Guard command tower from a few years ago). And there is a small polybag set, #30023, that just came out; but that is really a mini-version of this large one. So 5770 really is an original and unusual set. I wouldn't necessarily call it a collectors item, but I wouldn't expect another lighthouse for quite a few years.<br /><br />-Being from the Creator line, this set is made primarily out of general-use bricks and comes with instructions for three different builds. This is closer to how Lego was when I was a child, and it encourages kids to rebuild the structures either as the other designs or their own. The Creator sets, however, use more ingenious building techniques than what Lego offered decades ago. These are really marvels of miniature design. The other two designs are a sea-side restaurant (with a dock and a hinged side-wall for access), and a boat house with a launching ramp.<br /><br />-This set is on the expensive side for some people, but it is still a good value. All of these bricks are very useful in making your own designs, especially the red and white curved bricks and the slopes. And Amazon often goes below MSRP on these sets, so keep a look out (no pun intended).<br /><br />-This set has great playability. In fact, of the three Creator structures that came out this year (the others being 5771 and 5766) this one is the most fun. It has a light brick that you can spin with a crank that sticks out of the side of the tower (actually, the light brick remains still while you spin a reflector). One must push down on the top of the lighthouse in order to keep the light shining. Kids will either be taking the model into a closet, or insisting that you turn off all the lights so that they can play with this feature. In addition to the front door of the model, a portion of the side of the tower swings open to reveal a ladder. And there is the boat, mini-figure, smartly designed sea-birds, BBQ and fish. The other two models are very good as well.<br /><br />-The set is great for both boys and girls. It makes a great gift as well because if you don't like the design, you can still build it into something else.<br /><br />-If you find this set is on the expensive side for you, but you want some of the same design advantages that it has, check out the set #5766, the Log Cabin, which arrived in early 2011. Both are great sets.

B006ZS4QEM|5.0|I am the nut-job parent that you'll see in some of the other Lego reviews. I grew up with Lego and returned to it when I had kids. Obviously I am terribly partial to Lego, but I'll give you the best review I can so that you can make the decision that is right for your kids. I do not receive free sets or compensation for my Lego reviews.<br /><br />This set arrived in June of 2012 and is part of Lego's wonderful Creator line (more on that below). MSRP is 49.99 (always wise to cross-check with the Lego site). The last time Lego did a beach-themed house was 2008 with set #4996. This year's set is a vast improvement, and though there has been significant price appreciation, the design is much better and it includes a far more interesting selection of hard-to-find bricks, especially the many light-blue bricks. The main build for this set is a modest two-story house with a red roof, stairway, upstairs deck, and plenty of doors and windows. What sets this design apart are the many small details. The beach has a sand castle and breaking waves. The side of the house has an outdoor shower with a hanging towel. There is the obligatory BBQ. The palm tree is all brick built. The second build is what might be called a two-story beach cabana with a little wooden pier. The last design includes two unattached buildings separated by a watercourse and footbridge. One of the buildings looks like a seaside drink/snack stand. All of the designs include the ability to remove roofs in order to gain access to the interior. Except for the seaside stand, none of the buildings have interior features. There is one mini-figure included, along with a surfboard.<br /><br />Play-wise, this set works well with a wide range of Lego's other themes, especially the City and Friends lines (though my kids have no trouble placing Princess Leia and Harry Potter in a Creator house). It is mini-figure size, unlike some of the other Creator sets. And the set makes a great gift because if the child does not like it, they have the ability to make a wide range of other structures. At the very least, it is a good collection of very useful bricks.<br /><br />So far, this is Lego's only Creator house for 2012. Lego had three Creator structures in 2011, two of which I still strongly recommend: 5766 Log Cabin and 5770 Lighthouse. Creator sets are made primarily out of general-use bricks and come with instructions for multiple builds. This is closer to how Lego was when I was a child, and it encourages kids to rebuild the structures either as the other designs or their own. The Creator sets, however, use more ingenious building techniques than what Lego offered decades ago. These are really marvels of miniature design.<br /><br />Finally, at the risk of sounding like a shill for Lego, the Creator section of the Lego website has a nice collection of short videos that feature their own designers explaining advanced building techniques. These videos mesh nicely with this set.<br /><br />Cheers

It also needs place/acoustics.<br /><br />Documentaries like this remind us of these truths. A very worthwhile watch.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book provides a great ending to the Valentine story line and is a solid follow up to City of Ashes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever plz totally download now it is awsome. It is so life like and is really fun. Keeps me so occupied during car trips
B00E7SFAAG|1.0|I hate this game they always let the bad guy win so it sucks cause you never get to  win and I am very very good at video games
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept my interest.  I liked how the stories came together. I have and would recommend reading it.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|Pretty much, a POS.<br />You get what you pay for and this seemed like a good portable sharpener to throw in the saddlebag. I guess if you worked at it long enough, you could get a knife sharp enough to be dangerous.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Like others, I bought this mic because it was inexpensive and read the reviews that it was a good mic for the price.  Well add my review to the rest!  So far, I am very satisfied with its performance.  I'm kind of novice when it comes to singing, so I know I'm not the best person to say what is an excellent mic and what isn't, all I know is that I used to sing in a Shure mic and this one sounds just as good.....
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game however it does randomly crash sometimes. my 5 year can play the game as well and she loves it.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This movie was amazing with its beautiful music that has lasted decades, and lovely scenery that captures the true essence of the setting. It's a movie for ages 8 and up, with its vast use of everyday situations. No violence or profanity.
B009PMEEY2|1.0|Two or three screens and it shuts down! Im glad this was free! Its a pretty good time waster if not for the glitch.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Wow, what a great book. I love Stephen King but many of his more recent book have lost that edge, like Duma Key and Bag of Bones. This book really takes me back to the early King books that I loved. I am so glad King seems to have found his edge again, hope he writes many more. Great Read.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Interesting but a bit slowish at the start.<br />Give a real idea of what jobs was all about. Very well written
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I've watched it a few times and will watch it more. GREAT special effects and a great story line.  ENJOY
1439102449|5.0|This one kept me guessing most of the way through. I was very interested in the information about the mining. Everything was wrapped up nicely.
B007YYLQ6C|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies about the human soul I have seen. I loved it when I first saw it and have watched it several time since then. The acting, even among the children, is excellent. All the major characters learn valuable lessons and it is a very satisfying movie that proclaims good will eventually triumph. I would recommend it to everyone.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I would like to have the tides, pollen counts and other information back. I don't like the New version. I would like a link back to the main web site
B006O5XYWG|4.0|This ties in with 'Planet of the Apes' in such unexpected and enlightening ways. I found myself having great empathy for Caesar because they showed his feelings so well through his face and body language. I thought it was well acted and entertaining. I certainly would recommend it anyone who loved 'Planet of the Apes'.
B00DU7BDXS|2.0|I read this after much prodding from friends who stated they loved it; I hate to say it, but I just didn't like it. The premise was great, and it started wonderfully, but the point of view didn't truly change..yeah, the person being interviewed was supposedly different in each chapter, and had had different experiences, lived in different countries, had differing roles, however the voice was totally the same throughout!  All of the references from historical events from the 1970's were a bit odd as well.  Made it seem as if they were all the same age, and had the same lens on the world. Again, the author didn't truly change the voice of the various speakers.<br />I wanted to enjoy it, but I just can't give even 3 stars; I simply didn't enjoy it.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I love this show! The characters, the story, the drama!  I never get tired of watching it!  It gets better with every episode!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It played perfectly on my kindle 8.9.  It was challenging enough to make it a satisfying game experience.  Great graphics.  All the Artifex Mundi titles have been terrific.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|It was surprisingly better then I thought it would be. I thought Brad Pitt did a good job in his roll. I would definitely recommend this movie to others.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|A swirling dizzying hallucinogenic meditation on the very nature of being.  Technically science fiction but it transcends the genre.  Also a well-constructed tale with moments of suspense and wonder.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Goofy silly ridiculous time waster, good to play while on the thrown and forgot your newspaper or magazine for the haul!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I wanted a informative, easy to use weather app for my kindle fire, and this has been the best one for my needs.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. Like to play. Expansions are reasonable. Dont have to beg friends for items.  Can get as creative as you want.
B00DYVU9K8|1.0|It's as if the teenage girls of Facebook wrote, directed, and starred in their own movie.  No substance.  The script and dialogue is gibberish.  The entire movie could have been ad libbed for all we know.  Don't waste your time with this one unless you're under 18, female, and have no life.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Entertaining.Probably one of the best freebies I have ever got. Played it on easy first and change levels every time.It's a keeper
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it! I'm 9 and this is the best! you must get it. it never gets old! this has so many activitys like. BANANAS! !!!!!!!!!! I love it!!!
0802473156|5.0|This book really opened my eyes on how to be a better partner, not just to my boyfriend, but also in friendships and with my family. Everyone should read this book.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|There are no negative attributes to this wonderful classic. As an adult in my 50s it takes me back to my childhood. I own most of the classic Disney films and view them often. This should be in everyone's collection, not just for children but for adults as well. It's like a wonderful comfort meal.
B0063M22QO|4.0|A fun game of matching tiles, everything you'd expect from this sort of game with plenty of whizbangs to keep it interesting.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|this app is amazing. I love it so much the object of the game is to get the apples and go to the next level and the controls handle very well on my kindle fire.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I love Brad Pitt and I love Zombies, but sorry I could not finish watching this. It was boring and no plotline and he called in his performance. Wow I could have done it better myself with about 150 million less dollars.Don't bother, it just isn't watchable.
0525478817|5.0|I bought this book for my 13 year old grand daughter for her to do a book report at school and she said it was a great book. She loved it. and wants another John Green book...............so that's on the list for Christmas.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Better than temple run. Better than any other run game awesome game  so get it now!!!!!!!.And plus it's free what better than free.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was one of my top ten books I have ever read. The characters were developed so well that I found myself thinking about them throughout my day. I will be looking for more books by this author.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|awesome cool mini word @share your opinion the reason I'm doing this just to rate twitter awesome fool nine strough
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It was not your run of the mill who dun it but had a really good plot that kept you guessing.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I can't log in....I use kick on my iphone and I have no problems with it but on my kindle fire it doesn't work
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|This movie was BEYOND boring in the first 20 minutes!!!!!!! It got a little better, but the ending was garbage! Ignorance is bliss and it should have ended right after the rescue...........
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|I did not understand that Kindle already had an email, but I have used Gmail on my telephone, and it's OKay
B00338QENI|5.0|Amazing how medicine and its staff and beauracarcy took advantage of a woman.  The arrogance of those who treated her is amazing. I k ow it was  different time, but I work in a,hospital and the we know best attitude is still strong.  Consents are more informed but what happens to your removed body part is rarely mentioned. The toll the unknowing took on her family is tragic.  Opened my eyes!  Well written, informative.  Definitely a must read
B008PU8SR4|4.0|This is not an easy book to read, if you try to put yourself in Christopher shoes and see the world as he sees it; and may be we are all a little like him.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I was captured by the lifeboat sequence in Life of Pi, and appreciated the religious/somewhat philosophical beginning...but I found the ending disappointing.  I wanted to be captured again, in Pi's later life somehow.  But I wasn't.  Overall, well written in a descriptive sense.  I was right there with Pi all along.  But the story seemed to dissolve, and dropped in my lap.  Thus 4 stars.  Add a few chapters about Pi's later life and how this played into the religious aspect, and I'd have given it 5.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This is a fun game at first, but you get bored after a while, and its way to expensive for a game. I suggest getting survivalcraft, it has texture packs, you can go on other people's worlds, and you can change from creative to survival. I'm sure many Minecrafters would disagree, but Survivalcraft is half the price of minecraft pc, and its much better.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|This is more a drama than a sports movie, but it does both exceptionally well. If your family had or still has some serious issues, you'll relate, reflect on your own experiences, and maybe learn a little.
B00DCP0082|5.0|Another great Annilator release.  The bonus disc is awesome as well.<br />The artwork is also excellent.  If you haven't already got this one, I highly recommend as an Annihilator fan.  You won't be disappointed.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Very comfortable band.  Watch keeps excellent time.  This self winding watch is perfect for everyday wear and it looks good too.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Well worth the read. Flynn draws you in to a gripping conclusion. Will definitely read another of this author's books.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I have 3 kids - 2 girls,1 boy - and they all love the Percy Jackson books. They agreed that while the movie strays quite a bit from the book, they enjoyed  it very much anyhow.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to use the random deal, but game allows you to choose from several different types of deals (such as winning deal or multi player). Easy to use and even the ads  are not bad in the free version.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|sometimes I play this kindle but the rest I'm playing football but the game is great its really creative like my ideas for winning football so its kind of a learning game but awesome
B004UID2LC|5.0|it sometimes takes a bit of time to download things as an mp3, but its fast, and the only thing that i can find that can download straight from youtube.
B008Y212PI|4.0|this is very fun and addictive<br />I am glad it was the free app of the day.  will buy more from flip pix

B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this. So addicting and beautiful pictures. The best one I've found so far. Can not wait for more to come out.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|A great continuing sequel to the new crew of the Enterprise!  Bringing back Khan is a great idea. Now we need stories about Romulans and time travel.
0375869026|5.0|I purchased this book for my eight year old and we both enjoyed it. It will change your perspective on your own life and the lives of others, epically school aged children.
B00FEN000S|2.0|I can't believe this was so highly rated which lead me to believe it was a good movie. It played out like an episode of dragonball z. None of the characters were like-able in fact I think the robot 'jaegers' had slightly better acting range than the lead actor. And top that off with terrible Australian accents - I basically purchased a bad night in for me and my friends... Sorry guys...
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|I wish I could give my son the gift of a 200M budget movie to try an launch his career.<br />hollywood lives in a different world than middle america.
159463176X|4.0|I am still reading it.  I admit to being old, but I find it hard to follow the several story lines.  The Kite Runner it is not.
B008Y212PI|5.0|My kids and I love these puzzles and the pictures are a nice reward. Addiction and fighting over my kindle are the only drawbacks.
B009D0LBRO|4.0|u should be able to turn around its the second best mobile rayman after rayman 3d he for apple<br />so ya Its ok
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Tracy Chevalier has brought to life the works and the working experiences of Vermeer. It is not difficult to lose oneself to the point of feeling one were there, on the scene, as these events are happening, actually feeling present in Vermeer's life and all that surrounds him in his day, even things that he cannot actually observe himself. Yet at times I feel that I am observing this life through the servant girl who was present in Vermeer's life.<br /><br />Never mind scholarship. This woman obviously knows much about Vermeer. Did she study specifically for this book? I don't think so. I think that she was not making an effort to be scholarly. The book is not about scholarship - it is an inside view of Vermeer's life.<br /><br />As a former writing tutor I developed a keen eye for those draft papers that I was editing for students. I cannot help but bring that lifetime of experience into my reading of this novel. The important thing is that I was not left fussing over any small details of style or grammar or anything of the sort. I could let go of all that and just be passively dazzled to the point that I was in the book and in these lives.<br /><br />Anyone who would like to share this experience is heartily recommended to purchase a copy, and what better place to do that than on Amazon?
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Enjoyed most of the songs on this album. I don't watch American Idol and I was surprised to learn that's where he came from. Good voice, good song selection.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|GREAT DVD !! SOUNDS AMAZING!!! That band really knows how to entertain,I was surprised by the great sound quality, thanks
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I was amazed at how deep this film was, especially with such minimal dialogue there is. I find it soothing - and so beautifully shot. Reminds me of Brokeback Mountain in the sense that it's haunting, and beautiful, and heartbreaking, and that it stays with you after the fact. One of my favorite films!
B003MC5N28|5.0|It is inspiring and touching I turkey won't find anything like this book for a while that's how good itis
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I love his voice and I LOVE a handful of the songs on here! Very much surprised by how well done this was.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is so fun I love it.Sure it takes a while to get stuff when your a high level but this is awesome
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|This author lost me on the Alby Einstein experiment.  Her instructions for the experiment are grossly lacking. Maybe a technical writer might help here.  Being an optimist, although her description of what you would end up with made absolutely no sense (a coat hanger when straightened is in excess of 12 inches, wire cutters are required for this) I proceeded and when I realized that I either absolutely couldn't follow instruction or was correct in my assumptions, she lost me.  I will finish the book, as I do know the Law exists, and am curious about the rest of the book.  It is light and fluffy.  Glad I did not spend more than I did. This book is an excellent example of what can happen with good marketing, especially when Hay House likes it!!!
B003HARV4S|5.0|IT IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES.  IT IS ESPECIALLY GREAT ON BLU RAY.  NOTHING ELSE COULD BE SAID.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|never used this guide i don't have the game .  will get the game in the future. i will continue to use amazon in the future.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I was blown away by this album!!  The sound is fresh and new,  while they still rock just as hard as ever.  Of course, I had to get the bonus track (digital download), &#34;St. James&#34;, as well, and that one just added more texture to the whole album.  Shadows' voice is better than ever, and Arin's drumming is superb!!  Rest in Peace &#34;St. James&#34;, you will always be loved and remembered, ... and rest easy; Arin and your brothers are keeping your spirit alive beautifully.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing this game. Moves along quickly, not to mention it's a fun game.<br />I find myself picking up my Kindle just to play this game.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This was a great sci-fi movie. I was still pondering it in the days following.  Very thought provoking.  A fun movie.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|It's worth viewing if only for the special effects.  Fun plot. Great casting.  Loved the Mandarin--so silly.  Iron Man rules!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Liane Moriarty has evolved as a writer over time, and when she wrote &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; and &#34;The Hypnotist's Love Story,&#34; I was sure something clicked for her because they were much better than the previous ones. (I LOVED those books!)  I gave both of them five stars because they hooked me from page one, the editing was superb, the storyline tight (no rambling), and the pacing was excellent. Although I didn't give &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; five stars, I would definitely recommend it. Moriarty has a deep understanding of people's inner thoughts and feelings, and her character development was great. Once I got past a certain point in the book, I couldn't put it down. If I were just rating that factor alone, I would have given it five stars.<br /><br />There were a few reasons, however, that I couldn't. First, the hook wasn't as strong as her previous novels. To her credit, though, I know she's an excellent writer, so I had faith she would pull through later (she did!). Yes, we know at the start that the wife finds a sealed letter, but I didn't quite get the feel that this letter would be all-consuming and life-changing for so many of the characters. It would have helped if she let us know that right from the beginning, but instead she took the approach that it could be anything, and maybe even something insignificant.<br /><br />Unlike in her two previous novels, Moriarty introduces multiple characters right up front, which I found confusing. When authors do this, we know they will somehow all come together, so my &#34;criticism&#34; may have more to do with my own frustration with the technique. It requires a certain degree of reader memory and patience, which I don't have. I preferred the more linear plot of her previous two books.<br /><br />The main issues with this book really occurred early, but were later resolved. For example, Moriarty seemed to struggle with point of view, with a number of &#34;violations&#34; that made me wonder who was thinking what. She would start a chapter inside the thoughts and feelings of one character, then shift randomly into another character's head for a sentence or two. I suspect she didn't have this problem in her previous two books because there were far fewer characters, or she had a different editor.<br /><br />In addition to point of view issues, there are a few other problems an editor normally picks up. Spelling and typos aside (there were only about five), there was a chapter I kept going back to because it completely threw me off. It was from the point of view of the daughter who died at seventeen, and it sounded like she was committing suicide. I am not giving anything away here by saying that she was not suicidal. I never could figure out why the author included that chapter, unless she was trying to mislead us intentionally. It's also possible I misunderstood why the girl took a pill in the first place (because I'm not familiar with pill colors?), but regardless, it didn't work. The book would have been a lot better if she'd merely thrown that chapter out.<br /><br />All the glitches aside, I have to say that this book is definitely worth reading. I am picky, and I was spoiled by her previous two novels, but I would still highly recommend it.thinking what.

B005J0VPNC|5.0|Creates interesting pictures, has worked well so far with no problems, novelty wears off after a bit, but nice app that works as advertised
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is good to play when you want to relax or pass the time as it has no timer. Just wish there we more puzzles.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use and fun!  I love searching Pinterest and I like how I can easily go back to where I was if I look into a Pin more.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A fun app to play. I haven't played the 15x15 grid yet but the 10x10 grid can be challenging enough by itself. it's worth getting

B00BDAP66E|1.0|Goggle will not recognize my device...does not work with kindle. very disappointing .here are seven more stupid words what a PITA
B009NX61JY|4.0|I like it. It was funny with characters that were well developed.  A good comedy to watch and discuss afterwards.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My daughters 5th grade class is reading it, and she loved it. Wanted to read ahead so I purchased it. She finished it in 2 days. She has told me everything about it, so I'm going to read it!! She gives it a 5 star

B001FSDOZO|5.0|I paid 1 penny for this used CD... came in mail faster than expected, was in great shape.... I am a HUGE Nickelback fan and love the sound of this album.....
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|It created a visceral tension, was well paced and entirely drew me in.  Each character was recognizable as one you would know in a small community.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I have spent a lot of time attempting to get this app to work, but so far it has not. I installEd it on my  ipad correctly, put in  all the necessary info, but never received the email with the code the app requires to work with my printer. I found my exact printer on the HP list of printers, but.......nothing. It has never once worked & I would love to be able to print from my ipad.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Great graphics.  Some of the fighters are capable of acceleration in climbs and turns in the real world but not in this game. Makes it hard to climb up to the altitude the enemy likes to fly at. They circle above like vultures and its hard to get up there. All in all a great game.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|My son is building his collection of Disney movies for his future children.  I'm happy to help.  Arrived on time and good condition.  Thanks so much.
B004UPANAI|3.0|Special effects were well done; however, it was a bit too graphic for my taste in adventure movies. Interesting story-line. Definitely set up for its sequels.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|I used on the S4 with the &#34;NFC Task Launcher&#34; app. 1/2 the cost of ordering directly from Samsung too!
B002PA1HHI|5.0|A chilling yet funny performance by Christian Bale in this must watch slasher flick. A yuppie serial killer with an inner monologue throughout the movie that usually focuses on ridiculous reasons for murder or 80s music. the idea for this film is genius
B000AYELVA|4.0|Liked the DVD jacket.  Nice mix of characters for this film.  Liked the approach to the plot!<br /><br />Will recommend to all of my sci-fi friends.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It was beautiful, haunting, and had complex layers revealed by beautiful writing.  As soon as I (reluctantly) finished the book, I wanted to read more from the author!
B00008OE4W|5.0|Big fan of RRedford, esp. given his directing.<br /><br />Strong cast for this film, really enjoyed what the film had to offer.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I didn't know which way this book would twist or turn next, and I kept wanting to read more.  The author created layers and wove characters in and out with skill
B00000ITOY|4.0|There is nothing fancy about this toy but it is educational. My granddaughter is 20 months old and is able to put the pieces back fairly easily. Wish I would have found this sooner. It does keep her attention.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was confusing but I kept on reading all ways why am I reading this book. I found myself a little curious, so I kept on reading then it hit me what was going on as I read page after page then I knew why I was confused this had many ups and downs you have to just wait, don't think this book is boring you have to read to the end. You won't be sorry you did...
B005XQLBU4|4.0|love it this game is great I play it all the time its so much fun everyone should play this game
0770437400|4.0|Not what I thought it would be...My preconceived notion was that this would be about a bunch of zombies attacking ordinary people and the usual descriptions of terror and maiming. Pleasantly surprised that this was written in a journalist interview style. Although this method at times seems somewhat disjointed (various people at locations throughout the world), Max Brooks does a superb job of providing an overview of the war while also giving specific details the technology and methods of combating the undead. 10-2013
1423113497|5.0|A great set of books that our daughter's classroom would enjoy.  As soon as they arrived, took them to her classroom and there is a waiting list for the kids to get to read them.

But the number of apps are limited and I kept finding that what I really want is for it to mirror the entire display so I can do things like email.  If they allow a future version where you also have the choice to mirror the display this would be perfect.<br /><br />One note to be aware of, if the display doesn't have a USB port to power it you will need to plug in to an outlet.  But the USB port is pretty convenient if the display or TV supports it.

Not since the stained-glass knight of 'Young Sherlock Holmes,' has audiences seen digital visual effects used so effectively in a live-action film. By today's standards, the visuals of this fantastically entertaining sci-fi adventure do, admittedly, seem a bit quaint, but twenty years later, it's surprising to see they have actually held up rather splendidly, still delivering that same sense of wonder.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is also at his best in building suspense and anticipation, making audiences wait until just the right moment to reveal the colossal, prehistoric creatures. Even as doctors Dr. Alan Grant [Sam Neill], Dr. Ellie Sattler [Laura Dern] and Dr. Ian Malcolm [Jeff  Goldblum] finally arrive at John Hammond's Sir Richard  Attenborough] island, the narrative takes its time, showing first the huge electrical fences that hint at something dangerous being caged. Later, we see the reactions of three characters, before we're finally allowed to see the once extinct animals for ourselves. The way in which the camera slowly pans to look up at the Brachiosaurus remains just as inspiring and jaw-dropping as ever. Then, we move to a long shot of dinosaurs by a lake which tops it all off.<br /><br />The story itself is actually rather ordinary, even the inclusion of the two obnoxious children Alexis &#34;Lex&#34; Murphy [Ariana Richards] and Timothy &#34;Tim&#34; Murphy [Joseph Mazzello] seems intended to attract younger viewers. But it must be said, the film intentionally places more emphasis on a sense of adventure and excitement than on the science or the possibilities. Steven Spielberg and company utilised the best available CGI technology of the time and smartly balanced that with the amazing, lifelike animatronics of Stan Winston and his team. The plot is just engaging enough to maintain our attention while being overwhelmed by the visionary and spectacular visuals. 'Jurassic Park' continues to capture our imagination and serves as proof of what Hollywood magic can truly deliver.<br /><br />Now in its twentieth year since it originally released, Steve Spielberg's epic fantasy adventure remains the grand spectacle of childhood wonder and endless imagination. Even if I wasn't fortunate enough to enjoy this film as a little boy, the now-legendary director of such splendid classics as 'JAWS,' 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' the 'Indiana Jones' adventures and 'E.T.' was truly at the height of his game because he made feel like a child again. Even more amazing is the fact that this sci-fi classic continues to work its magic not only on me but also younger generations. And somehow, I'm sure it will continue to do so for many future moviegoers as well. It's a terrific and splendid film with the now added enjoyment of 3D, which an amazing transformation and I wonder if future old 2D Hollywood Blockbusters will be turned into 3D, I hope so, as I love these 2D films brought to life in 3D,and I wish more old 2D Blu-ray disc Titles could be released again in this format, as it is totally brilliant.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality ' Universal Studios brings 'Jurassic Park' to 3D Blu-ray in a three-disc combo pack with a code for a Digital Copy and ULTRAVIOLET viewing. The first two discs are Region Free, with the second being an identical copy from the previous release and accompanied by a DVD 9 copy. All three are housed inside the standard blue keep case with a glossy and lightly beautiful embossed slipcover. At start-up, the 3D Blu-ray is a little slow to boot, but it goes straight to a 3D main menu screen with full-motion clips and music, which puts you in the mood for a totally adventurous exhilarating rollercoaster ride. Setting aside the fact that this is simply another completely unnecessary conversion of an already great-looking film, I'm happy to report that 'Jurassic Park' arrives with a rather surprisingly satisfying 1080p encoded image. While I wouldn't suggest this an improvement over the previous Blu-ray release, the extra dimension does add another layer to the story's sense of adventure and provides a substantially immersive effect to its enjoyment. Overall, however, the 1.85:1 image offers a wealth of 3D goodness. The transfer was made by the same folks who worked on the 'Titanic 3D' conversion, which I have viewed and is a totally disgusting sham and should not have been released and should of only been made available in 2D, whereas `Jurassic Park' 3D is a hundred time more superior, as is the awesome`Predator' 3D Blu-ray and so the results of `Jurassic Park' 3D are consistently great with some really fantastic moments which take advantage of Dean Cundey's original Cinematography. Separation between foreground and background objects is distinct and crystal-clear, often generating some amazing visual delights that penetrate deep into the backdrop. When dinosaurs stand directly in front of the camera, turning their heads from one side to the other, the snouts poke through the screen amusingly, to make you think they are going to enter your viewing area and so make the 3D so much more realistic. Generally, contrast is spot-on and crisp, but there are times when it slightly falls flat. Again, this mostly happens when CGI effects come into play. Black levels are accurate and deep with admirable shadow delineation. The transfer also comes with a thin layer of grain throughout, which tends to be more prominent in poorly-lit interiors, providing the movie with a splendid film-like appearance that fans should love.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality ' As would be expected, the audio for 'Jurassic Park' 3D offers a truly awesome aural experience which those fans will not soon forget. The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio conveys a consistent wall of sound that's highly engaging and movement across the soundstage that seems fluid and effortless. Conversations between characters are well-prioritized amongst the film's many action sequences, and dynamic range is wonderfully extensive, providing a rich, sharply-detailed image that listeners can savour. The low-end is authoritative and complex, delivering deep, omnidirectional frequencies that make walls rattle unexpectedly. Some of the best moments are, of course, when the T-Rex stomps its way onto the screen, but viewers can also feel the rumbling snarls of dinosaurs. Rear activity is also at a constant with a sound field full of exotic wildlife, the roars of the T-Rex and John Williams's memorable score. The surround mix for this modern classic is terrifically immersive, one that will give systems a great workout.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Special Feature: The World of Jurassic Park 3D [1080p] [9:00] Presented in 3D, this is a recent interview with Steven Spielberg suggesting how he subconsciously envisioned the film with a 3D style in mind. The rest of the documentary is a discussion on the process of converting the film to the new format with interviews of those who participated.<br /><br />Special Feature: Return to Jurassic Park: Dawn of a New Era [1080p] [25:00] The first in a six-part documentary series discusses not only the making of the film but also gives viewers an inside look at the original direction filmmakers were going to take before realising CGI was the way to go. Cast and Crew interviews are mostly recollections on working with Stan Winston's special effects, surviving a real-life hurricane, and working with Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Special Feature: Return to Jurassic Park: Making Prehistory [1080p] [20:00] The second part takes a much closer at the filming itself, particularly the special effects and acting with the animatronics. Viewers gain a better knowledge of the extensive work that went into creating the scenes which feature the film's villains: the T-Rex and the Velociraptors. Of great interest is learning where the sounds of the dinosaurs originate, seeing some of the animatronics, and observing how Winston's team made the dinosaurs come alive.<br /><br />Special Feature: Return to Jurassic Park: The Next Step in Evolution [1080p] [15:00] As one would suspect by the title, the third segment of the exhaustive documentary gives fans a great discussion on the computer-generated images and the digital composites created by Industrial Light & Magic. Very interesting is listening to Steven Spielberg share his thoughts on giving creators his input while in the middle of filming 'Schindler's List.' There is also some talk on the awesome sound effects and the soundtrack. It's a great watch for fans.<br /><br />Special Feature: Archival Documentary [480i] [66:00] Here you have Four Original Documentaries from the original 2000 DVD release.<br /><br />Archival Feature: The Making of 'Jurassic Park' [480i] [49:39] This is actually a pretty comprehensive account on the making of the first film, compiled not by Laurent Bouzereau but by John Schultz and narrated onscreen by James Earl Jones. The date on the credits at this feature's end is 1995, indicating this must have been used or intended for something earlier than the DVD where I can first locate it. Some of the footage here is recycled in the more recent Laurent Bouzereau features.<br /><br />Archival Feature: Original Documentary on the Making of the Film [480i] [4:50] This is a brief promo piece that probably ran as a quasi-trailer theatrically to promote the film at the time of its release in 1993.<br /><br />Archival Feature: Steven Spielberg Directs 'Jurassic Park' [480i] [9:07] This is a very brief and interesting look at the director on set and on location.<br /><br />Archival Feature: Hurricane in Kauai [480i] [2:09] This quick feature covers the attack of Hurricane Iniki while the filming company was on the island, including videotape of the cast and crew huddled in the entrance of the hotel and then holed up in the main ballroom waiting for the storm to pass.<br /><br />Archival Feature: Behind the Scenes [480i] [26:00] 1.

Other than the obvious nods to various dinosaurs and movie moments, this featurette is notable to me for its inclusion of Dr. Kevin Padian, who taught a dinosaur class I attended while in school some years ago.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer [480i] [1:00] The film's original full-length trailer is presented here in standard definition. If anything, the trailer is a good barometer for the work done on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Finally, 'Jurassic Park' is a fun, exciting thrill-ride that imagines an amusement park run amok when its prehistoric live attractions break free. Twenty years later, the sci-fi/fantasy adventure remains an imaginative motion picture of childhood wonder and visceral thrills. Arriving in a new format, the 3D Blu-ray features great video, which adds to the experience by adding a wonderful sense of immersion, and a demo-worthy audio presentation. Supplements may be the same as before, but they're a great collection with one brand new bonus, making the overall package a highly recommended purchase for fans of the third dimension. The new video presentation resolves many of the issues that afflicted the 2011 transfer, but brings with it several additional problems, obvious noise reduction chief among them. The main draw turns out to be something of a toss-up; some will prefer the 2011 transfer, some will prefer the 2013 transfer. You'll have to see both for yourself to make whatever decision is best for you. Thankfully, the 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio remix will blow you away. It's as monstrous as its 2011 counterpart, and has a few welcome tricks up its sleeve. All in all, `Jurassic Park' 3D is a well worth the purchase, as if you do not, you will miss out on a most unbelievable experience, that any comments I make, does not portray what you will view with your 3D glasses and again it is another Steven Spielberg film I am honoured to add to my Blu-ray Collection.

B008602KQI|3.0|When I first purchased this DVD, the disc did not work (so Amazon gladly replaced it, free of charge).  The movie itself is a decent film.  Although I have to say, you really have to read the books in order to fully understand what is happening in the film.  The film caters more to the fan base than to creating a fan base through the film.  The beginning of the film has very shaky camera movements, and although I do not mind this style of filming, it was almost too shaky and 'real'.  It was kind of distracting.  The relationships between the characters in the film were either rushed or non-existant (the books offer much more insight into the feelings and relationships between all of the characters).  Despite all that, it was a fun film to watch and a nice visual for fans of the books.

B00EC6VA98|4.0|\\"[It] approximate[s] the sound of snow falling on a disused chapel while a solitary candle burns inside - with a spider scuttling across the keys\\"<br />-Kitty Empire (The Observer) on 'Aventine'<br />--------------------------<br /><br />The photo of Agnes Obel that expands across the cover of 'Aventine' illuminates and shadows in equal measure. It's precisely and sharply structured but one that offers few specific details; it's bound by coherence and subverted by the imagination. Indeed, one is not even confident that it is, in fact, Ms. Obel on the cover at all. Ask, does it matter? I appreciated art that distracts me from the routine of the day and drives me to ask questions. That's an apt description of my relationship to this entire LP's.<br /><br />Ms. Obel's 'Aventine' does not encourage heavy handed analysis. That clumsy practice would only soil the grace and spectacle of the field where this art stands. What 'Aventine' does inspire is over indulgencing metaphor. These eleven tracks are fragments of a deeply hushed speech. They patiently express pensive piano, string, and vocal arrangements that represent the imaginative eruptions that flow and surge from within this unassuming artist's mind's eye. They are nameless and formless things that Ms. Obel, through some alchemy and volition, gives minimally sufficient cohesion. The lyrics shares the aforementioned photograph's disinterest in explicating internality. While much more legible and relatable than her last LP, with its more pronounced penchant to expound with the imagery of nature, 'Aventine's' representations are often just beyond intelligibility and everyday practicality -the \\"stream of consciousness\\" quality remains. The whole experience is akin to watching a cat arch its back and rub up against the furniture in sensual consummation. You have no idea why the cat is doing it, but you know that the cat has complete confidence that it does.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Not OMG, but OH....MY....GOD!!!! This book was so hard to put down. I loved the reference to NOS4R2 and the villains in this book were very villainous, couldn't wait for the main bad guy to get it.  My only regret about reading this book was that I finished it too soon. I didn't just read this book I STEAMED it. Thank you so very much Mr. King for one helluva read. This is why you are called the master, for you truly are
B001MSMULG|5.0|For me, this story was all -around fulfilling. It was adventurous accompanied by inner thoughts of the characters. It had romance and moral dilemmas. It has travel and history of foreign places and art. Most importantly it has characters I care about and want to follow.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is the second in line but it is so much better! I guess the saying first the worst and second the best just came true!<br />I also love how you get to choose who you want to use if you earn them.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have now used this on a few knives. I guess I haven't quite got the hang of it yet, because I haven't gotten the knives as sharp as I hoped.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love to  read my books in the Kindle.  It allows to change fonts, colors, size of the letters etc., with ease. For me it has been a delight to download the app in my tablet and utilize its various modes to my reading convenience
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The only aspect missing to setting the stage of this historical period is influence of world religions. My sense through readings of other historians is that trade routes allowed the mixing of even eastern religions. Romans and Greeks weren't the only foreigners around. Egyptian, Hindu, Buddhist and etc travelers abounded. It is strongly possible that Jesus philosophized with many. Just my intuition of it all.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Doctor Who is the best scifi show ever made. I have yet to see an episode I did not like, even among the new series. Christopher Eccleston is great as the Doctor, Rose his companion played by Billie Piper is his perfect complement, as she is able to keep up with him and is not afraid of the adventure.<br />Doctor Who is literally and figuratively a &#34;timeless&#34; show, it appeals to viewers of all ages and draws you in until you can not stop watching and find yourself quoting him or one of his many varied enemies.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I anxiously awaited this remix/remaster.  There are several great songs on Vapor Trails but the original is so hard to listen to because of the bad sound quality, especially at high volume.<br /><br />While this remix did not fix everything (some of the problems were in the original recording and will never be fixed) it is a vast improvement.<br /><br />I was expecting a straight remaster, similar to the one that they did on 2112 last year.  I didn't realize until I started listening to the CD that it is a true remix, with new harmonies and extended instrumentals.  Being a purist and already liking a lot of the Vapor Trail songs it will take a bit of getting used to; however, it is a definite improvement both sonicly and musically.<br /><br />I think the most noticeable change is Peaceable Kingdom, it sounds like the most \\"remixed\\" song on the album to me.<br /><br />A worthy addition the the Rush catalog and any Rush collection.<br /><br />Well worth the wait.

I don't mind paying for and receiving expired film if i know thats what i am paying for, but to buy what i thought was new fresh film and it be 3 months expired... well, that is upsetting. this specific film was bought for use at my little boys first bday party and 12 month pics. well, every pic processed so dark that i cant even tell what its a pic of. Some of the film processed with bits of the picture missing from the corners bc it was old. geez! wish i would have looked at the expiry date before opening. not that i had time to send it back in time for his birthday. i have taken a polaroid of him every month since birth with my polaroid and this month was meant to round out that adventure of babys first year growing with polaroid.<br /><br />i love that this film is tempermental, and u never know what you are going to get, but fresh film is a must or you might just end up with a bad batch of dark pics.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|I have a teenager who LOVES dragons. She has other \\"toys\\" that are dragons that she displays around her room so I got this to see if it would measure up to the others she has. This is of very nice quality and has tons of detail to it. It looks fantastic displayed with her other dragons. I am very pleased with this item and even though I'm not reviewing it as a toy, but a display piece, I am sure there are others that will be doing the same. I was really surprised at how nice this item actually is. Would love to get her some more.

Not just for fans.

0071636080|5.0|There are three reasons I rated the book highly.<br />First, it not only presents the &#34;secrets&#34; but provided plenty of examples from Jobs most high profile presentations. Second, it gives clear guidance on how to improve YOUR presentations. Third, it demonstrates that what appears to babe been unscripted, casual, relaxed presentations are the result of a lot of preparation and hard work-- there are no shortcuts to a powerful presentation.

B0014NDXGA|5.0|I finally paid for quality.  I tried to save a few dollars by buying a generic online. After two lemons, one returned, and it's<br />failed replacement now in it's box on the shelf, I returned to Bushnell.  I own, and was using one of their old yardage pro 800<br />models. bought new for $400 years (10?) ago  Without Pin Seeker technology, it's effective range was diminished. It too is in<br />it's original box on the same shelf. in a proud position, still in excellent working order !<br /><br />The tour V2 Standard is a double click: one &#34;on&#34; - one &#34;press and scan&#34;.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I like the Chromecast I use it daily. The best feature is cloud streaming, that means I dont have to have my device on to be streaming, as the content is being downloaded on demand to the device itself as the video plays. I also like the backgrounds the Chromecast displays meanwhile nothing is being casted to the device itself. The idea behind it is great, but the app support now is not the best as right now (October 5, 2013) only Netflix and Youtube are supported. All in all the Chromecast is a definite buy for anyone interested in the device!

B008G3N71W|5.0|This was a fantastic and entertaining book to read, which is always a wonderful plus when reading books in this genre.  Chloe Thurlow is an excellent descriptive writer who is not afraid to take the reader into vividly sexual scenarios and yet still leave them entertained and interested in the characters and the storyline.<br /><br />Greta May is the kind of girl we all were, once upon a time, and when we encounter her, life is a little less than what she'd hoped it would be.  Then things change in a dramatic and very, VERY sensual way for her when she meets Richard on the Tube, and decides to go along to his flat, just for the fun of it - although not without a little trepidation!  So starts a wild, erotic series of encounters and experiences on the BDSM side of life that will leave you jealous with envy - even if you're not into the BDSM lifestyle!<br /><br />But the best thing about this romp is that it is WRITTEN SO WELL! And that is such a plus for this genre. Chloe has succeeded in creating true erotic literature, where the sexuality is so tied up with the plot and the narrative, that they all compliment each other perfectly, and nothing seems incongruous, out of place, or over the top!<br /><br />A thoroughly worthwhile read!

B00FGFVMGA|5.0|It's so nice to have an adventure game without the creepy story line! Fire Maple has another winner. Although not as long or complex as The Lost City (but then again nothing is - Lost City will be hard to beat) it is a million times better at 99 cents then others that charge $3, $4, and even $5 each. The graphics are wonderful. You instantly feel like you've been whisked away to a magic land complete with helpful animals, secret rooms and transforming landscapes. The puzzles and navigation are not the most challenging, but are fun and interesting without being frustrating. I easily went from one place to another and through all mini games without a glitch. They have obviously taken the time to create a superior product. I was able to finish in one night but I enjoyed that night thoroughly! I eagerly await their next game!!

1907360727|5.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is not just A Christmas story, but one of THE Christmas stories -- not only is it instantly recognizable by pretty much everybody, but it's relentlessly copied and spoofed in countless Christmas specials. But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.<br /><br />Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.<br /><br />And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.<br /><br />So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.<br /><br />You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.<br /><br />Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.<br /><br />He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, who is first established as the nasty, greedy, coldly uncaring rich man who cares nothing for the feelings behind Christmas. Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge completely, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.<br /><br />Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all.

1607109468|5.0|&#34;Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition&#34; is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While &#34;Emma&#34; is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the &#34;natural daughter of somebody.&#34; Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, &#34;Emma&#34; is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (&#34;Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way&#34;) and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (&#34;If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me&#34;).<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />&#34;Emma&#34; is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight.guidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles.

B001EC2ISA|5.0|I love this movie. It has a great mixture of comedy and horror elements. I think this movie is one of a kind. Very different perception of life after death and beyond. Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice is just so funny.<br />Each character is unique whether they are ghosts or human. So many memorable lines from this movie that I still quote today. A must have for anyone who loves movies that are very different and unique.<br />Great music in this movie too.
160710945X|5.0|Everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... or at least the Hollywood version, with green skin, boxy head and bolts in his neck.<br /><br />But the original creature is quite different in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" which starts off rather slow but builds into a tragic, darkly hypnotic tale about tampering in God's domain, and the terrible consequences that come from it. Also: if you create a new creature out of dead body parts, don't disown him or he'll kill your family.<br /><br />During a trip across the Arctic, a ship picks up a starved, half-frozen man named Victor Frankenstein. As he recovers, Frankenstein tells them his life story -- especially about how he became fascinated with science, and developed a process to reanimate dead tissue. Eventually he constructs a new creature out of dead body parts, and brings him to life.<br /><br />But while the creature is intelligent and articulate, he's also hideously ugly. Horrified that he's not beautiful, Frankenstein flees... and has a nervous breakdown. Wimp.<br /><br />But months later, the murder of his little brother brings Victor back to his home, where he figures out that the creature was involved. And to his horror, the creature now wants a mate. But the loathing between them -- caused by Frankenstein's disgust and the creature's increasing bitterness -- leads to even more tragedy...<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those rare novels that is almost beyond classification -- it's gothic horror, it's sci-fi, it's a tragedy about scientific ambition that goes where it shouldn't go. Mary Shelley was only eighteen years old when she began writing this book, but she interwove religion, science and a fiercely intelligent knowledge of human nature into it.<br /><br />Her writing is a bit stuffy at times (\\"All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own\\"), but that's because it was written in the early 1800s. Despite this, Shelley's writing skills shine in the more horrific moments of the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work. Victor is actually a pretty horrible person -- while he's a tragic figure whose unnatural ambitions end up destroying his wife, brother and father, he's also incredibly cruel and callous to the creature because... he's ugly.<br /><br />The creature, on the other hand, instantly gets our sympathy. He's intelligent and childlike at first, but his ugliness causes everyone to immediately hate and fear him. When him becomes embittered and eventually murderous, you still feel sorry for him.<br /><br />Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those few, rare horror books -- it adds a little more of that scientific gothic atmosphere to a classic tale of horror, slime and sorrow.the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|My husband and I just watched this for the second time, and it is...WOW!! JJ Abrams does not disappoint. If you're a fan of the original series, the twists in the plot from what happened in the '60's will blow you away. Brilliant writing, direction, acting... I don't want to spoil the surprises, so I won't disclose any details of the plot here. All I can say is, get it! You'll love it!! (P.S. Watch the \\"Making of...\\" details afterwards. As Mr. Spock would say, \\"Fascinating!\\")<br /><br />Update: We loaned the 3-D disc to our friend who has a 3-D projection TV and Blu-Ray player. He can't stop watching this in 3-D! I think he's seen it 3 or 4 times now. We can't wait to go to his house and watch it this way!
B005URRCUY|5.0|I heard my college son playing this album and bought it for myself. I can listen to it over and over again.
B00483ATL0|5.0|i only knew 2 of nek's songs when i decided to buy this CD but they were so good i decided to risk it and i just wanted to improve my italian anyway so expectations were low. eros ramazotti is usually my guy if i want to listen to italian music but i felt i needed a new sound. GOD, HOW I LOVE NEK NOW! I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS CD! yes, he's probably very dramatic for the american public but give him a chance. you'll love his voice, the music arrangements and his interpretations. my favorites are cielo e terra (about a couple on the day they separate), sei grande (an ode to a great woman), laura non c'e (about a guy not wanting to use a girl when he's in love with another one), semplici emozioni (about the simple joys of life), and ci sei tu (about a love unrequited). a winner!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|What can I say? I am addicted to the series, and just had to pre-order season 2. This box set contains some additional info that helps with the sometimes-complicated plot.
0770437400|5.0|Let me start this review by saying that I don't like Zombies.  I don't like to read about them, I don't like to hear about them, or even think about them.  Then I went to the movies one day and saw a preview for the soon to be released Brad Pitt movie, World War Z.  I was intrigued.  It has been years since Brad Pitt has made a movie that I want to see.  I went home, looked up some information and found out that the movie was based on a book.  Well I don't see movies that were based on books if I haven't read the book.  So I bit the bullet and sat down to read the book.  HOLY CRAP!  Why didn't I do this sooner?  This book is amazing and well worth me getting over my aversion to all things related to Zombies.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but when I think of Zombie's, I think of blood, guts and gore.  Maybe that's why I have stayed away from anything to do with Zombie's until now.  I was so happy that this wasn't the case with World War Z.  I mean don't get me wrong, the Zombies and the descriptions of them were gross.  That is to be expected.  But the book was about much more than the Zombies themselves.  It was about the reaction of the rest of the world and seeing just how civilization would deal with something like the Zombie apocalypse.<br /><br /> World War Z was to me about human nature when confronted with something we never expected or prepared for.  It was about getting to heart of the matter, chipping away all of the political correctness and demonstrating that at the centre of it all human nature is not always a very pretty or nice thing.  I would like to think that in the event of a global catastrophe that we as human beings wouldn't act the way people did in the book.  The sad fact is that I think that we are more like the survivors of World War Z than any of us would comfortably admit.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Carcass is alive?  That doesn't make any sense but yes they are back after a long vacation and I am glad. Heartwork and Swan Song are two of my all time favorite albums and more recently Arch Enemy has been my favorite band. I wasn't totally convinced when I first listened to Surgical Steel but after a few listens I was quite pleased, it's got the heavy riffs that you would expect, melodic hooks and plenty of tastefully expressive guitar solos. I am a metal guitar myself and I was impressed.
006178480X|5.0|Allow me to introduce you to the epic win that is James Rollins.  Or more specifically, his latest novel in the Sigma Force Series, The Eye of God.  What?  What's that you say?  You have never read any of James Rollins' work?  Excuse me while I weep for you and clutch my pearls to my chest in shock and horror.  I'm sorry, does it seem like I'm judging you for never having read something by James Rollins?  Well, I am actually, but never fear you can correct your horrible faux pas by picking up the first book in Sigma Force series, The Map of Bones now.  Go ahead, it's o.k.; I'll wait for you to finish. Trust me, you won't be disappointed and you will thank me.<br /><br />.....<br /><br />Good, you're back.  And now that you've read some of his work, you should pause to bask in the greatness of what you have just experienced.  I know you're sad that the book is over, but never fear there is more.  8 more to be exact, and yes, they are all amazing.  As a matter of fact, they get better with each one you read.  Trust me I know, I've read them all multiple times.  In fact, I've even read the soon-to-be-published The Eye of God twice now just so I can fully appreciate the epic win that it is.<br /><br />Yeah, I know that I'm humming the mission impossible theme, but I can't help it.  Trust me, it will all make sense once you read The Eye of God.<br /><br />Looming world ending catastrophe<br />Race against time and foes<br />Kick-ass fights, near death escapes, etc.<br /><br />Yeah, I told you humming the mission impossible theme was totally appropriate.  *Note to self, the MacGyver theme would work as well.*<br /><br />I'm telling you, if my history or science teachers made their lessons even half as interesting as James Rollins does in The Eye of God, and in all of his books, my grades would have been way higher.  Oh, did I fail to mention that all of your favourite characters are back?  That's right, the band is back together.  Don't even get me started on the awesome relationship developments going on.<br /><br />All fun and games aside, The Eye of God is a fabulous book and one that you need to read.  The blend of historical fiction and complicated scientific concepts are so well developed and executed, that you will have a hard time separating fact from fiction.  I once again have to salute the awesomeness that is James Rollins and his writing.  Any author that can not only get me to love their work but then to also want actually research the stuff talked about in their books is tops in my view!<br /><br />What are you still doing here?  The rest of the books in the Sigma Force series aren't just going to read themselves you know!relationship developments going on.<br /><br />All fun and games aside, The Eye of God is a fabulous book and one that you need to read.

B00BSBR9N6|5.0|A lonely man with Asperger's tries to find a mate.<br /><br />Lovable Don is all kinds of different. A genetics professor, he's socially inept and brilliant. His life is rigidly structured. He doesn't feel empathy--or any emotion--the way most people do. Is it possible for him to find and win a wife? He's determined to try. Only Rosie, the woman he finds himself spending time with, and with whom he has more fun than he's ever had, doesn't meet his critical standards.<br /><br />I loved Don's analytical mind. He's gorgeous, he's successful, and he's forthright. He's also too strange to appeal as a potential boyfriend, so he has his work cut out for him. I actually laughed out loud, which is a rarity for me while reading. The ending tied everything up in a satisfying way. I'd recommend this book to anyone. It's different and it's just a feel-good book. One of the best books I've read this year.
B0094LTWDM|5.0|Loved this movie -- Merryl Streep gives a wonderful performance, and Amy Adams shows the frustrations of being a new cook very well! One of my all-time favorite movies to watch on a Sunday afternoon!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love interest just so everyone is clear but this app does not work. While trying to view pins about two minutes in it says interest has stopped and asks to wait or quit. It freezes and you can't do anything with it! Please fix it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is worth every word. Much better than the movie. Although, I highly recommend seeing it (after reading the book, of course). After finishing the , don't be surprised if you want to jump straight into the next one.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for myself for my 13th birthday and its gone with me everywhere. This is definitely for the major doctor who fans. the buttons are not the most durable (my top one is being attached by tape) but it's an awesome pen. I would definitely tell my friends to get it for their enjoyment and to make everything more \\"sonic\\".
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just don't let your grandma  read it because then you'll know she read  it and worse...she'll know you  read it.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love love ! The little Dragon is so cute! Out of all the bubble pops I enjoy this one the best! I wish there was more like this one!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Fun for everyone! Make sure you have plenty of room on your device. It takes up a LOT of room, though.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Brendan Fraser is fast becoming one of my favorite Comedians!  His movies contain a combination of comedy and a hint of seriousness! Blast from the Past, is one of those movies.  The whole story line is totally refreshing in its honesty and simplicity!  I would recommend it to anyone who desires to see a truly &#34;clean&#34; movie!
B00CATSONE|2.0|I am not aware of the historical facts but it almost seemed to have been written by a relative in the sense that it seemed less factual and more promotional.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|These animated puzzles are fantastic. They teach kids about letters and animals and still keep them entertained. They love learning with this app!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this although I did find the story a little predictable. The bad guys did get it in the end, and that was fun.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|But brings a closure to the story. I did enjoy the surprises towards the end. I didn't like the number of things that went unanswered.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I think that Yours Truly was 'truly' amazing, it was the best step for Ariana's first album and you'll never regret getting it. It's worth every penny.
B000050HTO|5.0|Always liked Bob Dylan, but never purchased any albums or CDs. This CD has the songs I want. To me these are essential.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I like the choices of sounds. I have even played it during work on stressful times. I put a few sound together.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|my 9 yr old son loves Angry Birds, and he said he loves this game more than the first Angry Bird Star Wars!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is a must watch. I love the characters and the writing is amazing. I highly recommend this show for anyone who like law based television but also a great mix of humor, romance, and of course, backstabbing. Great, great, great.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|great game but it would be better if you got more rubies for money<br />but overall as good game I would recommend it
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show. While there are plenty of dramatic themes throughout, the show is witty, charming, and hilarious. I am absolutely obsessed with the characters and can easily marathon this for hours. Harvey, Mike, Rachel, Donna, Louis...all amazing. I am law student and I appreciate the honesty about the reality of the corporate law world. Highly recommend.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another fantastic book by my favorite author.  It takes a while to figure out where the book is heading, but once it gets moving you're in for an awesome treat!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I like it slightly but again I still recommend it for a younger age group.<br />Sooooooo sorry but I only like it not love it if you know what I mean....<br />(written by my 10 year old son...)
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed the story. It had great characters and awesome action.<br />Can't wait for the next. There were awesome powers and strategies in the story.
B000050HTO|5.0|While Dylan publicly denied speaking for a generation he did. Using his own words, cleverly cobbled melodies, and his uniquely raspy voice he spoke reams for social justice, the human condition and ending the Vietnam war. Many became more aware of what needed to be made right and changed because of his art.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Happy with the new graphics, just have to get used to new look. Not always easy to find what I want but I'll get adjust.
B00111NDRE|5.0|These boots rock. I never leave reviews, but damn these boots are so freaking comfortable. Top quality too, very very nice.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Fascinating glimpse into a bit of history most of us never knew happened.  The author also did a great job contrasting the life of an orphan today against a similar experience a generation ago.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game very addictive and I love the funny voices from the different countries I don't talk on the chat much but it's interesting reading what people are saying
B009AOFNU4|5.0|The general theme of reviews here are \\"Great device, but gee whiz, doesn't work with many android or ios games.  I impulsively spent $80 without doing any application research......\\"  Really guys?  That's why you bought this thing?  Of course it didn't work well for that. But that's the device's fault? Hello McFly! Noogie noogie!<br /><br />I am here to tell you that the Free is the holy grail of bluetooth gamepads.  Price-drop to $60 makes it hard to pass up, IMHO.<br /><br />I am a retro gaming & console emulation enthusiast for 20 years that's exactly the application I use this controller for 90% of the time.  Pretty much all console emulators on all OS platforms have joystick support, and I made my purchase being aware of that. (android & W7 PC here) I have NEVER have problems with latency even with cheap class-2 usb bluetooth adapters.  All the stuff about superb build quality, being ergonomic, having good buttons, great D-pad, and sweet analog nubs are true, this thing is superb. Yes, Xbox controllers & dualshocks are neat, but would you fly with one?  I'm 6'3\\" and wear size 12 gloves and it's comfy in the hand for hours.  Had this for almost a year now & would buy another if lost/broken, it's the absolute very best on the market.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|In a lifetime of watching horror films, I've only found two- Phantasm and the original Invaders From Mars- that manage to perfectly capture the look, feel, and emotional power of a nightmare. Like a nightmare, there is just no way to do this movie justice in the retelling so I'll simple say, watch it at night, alone, and get ready to have an experience.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addictive game can not stop playing.the only thing is should be able to buy more energy with the coins not just the diamond's.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|It is Grease. I mean. . . .You're just not an American if you don't give it 5 stars. a classic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Gfeedddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd<br />Gymnastics the best way to get a good thing for the rest is to I exchange, the Bretton woods and r
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Game is a blast. I am fighting my kids for control of the kindle since this was downloaded.  Graphics are really good and gameplay is smooyg
B005F3XV62|1.0|This won't play,  Now it is too late to return it.  Very unhappy!  Now the review is making me type 7 more words.
0385528787|5.0|The final volume in Margaret Atwood's trilogy about a dystopian future is very satisfying.  I can't help but see the trilogy, itself, as a lesson for us to learn for our own future.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I have lookout demos on my fire 7 so when I brought my alarm would tell beware app is considered malware. Now what seemed like a good idea before lookout has me worried. I have lookout on my note 2 and trust it. Confused right now bc I I have the free version and it seemed ok. Ugh....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game seems to be a good time for all ages. Lots of fun so far of what I have played.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|My entire family loved this movie....so I thought...why not buy the soundtrack.  I think it actually is a very entertaining movie...Maybe not as good as Saturday night fever soundtrack...which is a Beegee's timeliness movie soundtrack (movie was lame and disturbing).<br /><br />Pitch Perfect Movie is great and you should rent or stream it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|omg fuuuunnnnnnnn like I said In the other thing its kinnda hard and stuff like I said if you need help just use youtube
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I started reading this series a couple years ago and  I totally love them!!!!!! If you're a fan of Greek mythology get this!!!! I've read every riordan book there is! Love this and love him. GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Over all a great app.It has great graphics and as far as I can tell there isn't any bugs for me.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I think this app is a good idea for a app. I recommend this app for everyone who love's the weather or just wants it I recommend accuweather platinum or just accuweather. I say thank you and godless you accuweather the app is a good idea for kindle  iPhone iPad and smart phone. I just have to say  to those of accuweather you people are the best people.
0316548189|5.0|First, I will talk about myself:<br /><br />As I was 17 years old, I suddently had a dream (a goal in life) which made people believe I was crazy. Even I believed I was crazy if I started to think about which were my odds.<br /><br />But because I was blind enough to ignore people`s opinion, and also to ignore my rational mind, I got my dream done 3 years after!<br /><br />And now everybody admires me for that.<br /><br />So, reading Nelson mandela was a reminder of this procedure for me.<br /><br />If you fight for your dreams, three things can come out:<br />-Either you will be remembered as the crazy guy<br />-You wont be remembered at all<br />-You will become a hero<br /><br />Nelson Mandela had this \\"hallucination\\" that black people were not worst than white people.<br /><br />How can he dare to say that? He must had been under heavy drugs to think of that!<br /><br />As in the case of my dream when I was 17 years old, I recognize this important behaviour:<br /><br />Be BLIND ENOUGH to BELIEVE our dreams<br />Be BLIND ENOUGH to REPLACE the experience of the \\"real\\" world with your dreams<br />BE BLIND ENOUGH to ACT ON PEOPLE as if your dreams were already reality and token for granted by all mankind.<br /><br />You will face much resistance for that, you might even die for it.<br /><br />But one day it will become true. If not in this life, in the next one.<br /><br />And you will see that you were not crazy after all.<br />People will stop thinking of you as a retarded, and they will call you \\"hero\\".<br /><br />This is why I love this book! So inspiring for me. We can all create a better world! It might take many decades, 10, 40 years, but at some point it will be worth all that.<br /><br />Thanks Mandela for this \\"Remember your dreams\\" note!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Got this for a really great price. Love the game in general. Good to play with friends. Can be addictive and the tides turn really quickly so pay attention!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Simple, it just works.  Plugged it in to my Windows 8 laptop and was programming my two way radios in no time.  Many radios, ESPECIALLY Motorola are very finicky about the USB to Serial converter chipsets and quality, but this one works fine.
B00E981K1W|5.0|Great techniques to learn note taking visually. You must read this book and practice the techniques to visually take notes. It is a great reference for the graphic facilitators
B0055MBQOM|5.0|The product works simply and effectively.<br /><br />It is reassuring to know that the photographic prints I produce, now match the colours on my screen.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|My husband and I enjoy playing this together. It is a strategy game. My only real complaint has to do with how you progress. Thus far I am at rank 16 &amp; have yet to use real money. I think it is dishonest to create a game where the only real way to win is either spend money or long long periods of game time.<br /><br />We shall see how this works out for us.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I started this book a little under 6 hours ago and just finished it. Just amazing. Gillian Flynn is one of the best writers of this generation.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I enjoy this game, especially the way they mixed a tower defense with an RPG. The challenge level is just right IMO.
B00ENV1HPY|2.0|I have been listening to Mazzy Star since I first saw them open up for the Cocteau Twins in 1990.  I was just as excited as everyone else when I learned that they were getting back together to do another album even though Hope Sandoval's last album with the Warm Inventions, \\"Through the Devil Softly,\\" is in my opinion one of her best, if not her very best, album ever.  The new Mazzy Star album is, at best, mediocre and uninspired.  I don't know why Hope did not stick with the Warm Inventions where she was working with a much better guitar player and the songs had much more depth and feeling.  Hopefully she will get back with them and do a follow-up to her masterpiece, \\"Through the Devil Softly.\\"
B00F91FRTO|2.0|From the preview I had high expectations for this one, but it turned out to be disappointing.<br />I would not recommend it.
0399534601|5.0|this book gets me excited to read and fill and I never know what it might asl me next. wonderfull book and I recomend it to everyone
B004LWZW24|5.0|We received our movie in perfect shape & in a reasonable amount of time.  Great creepy movie to add to the collection!
B007RTAR64|4.0|For me the doll was great i just have one concern it was the pin in the pictures they make it look like its metal but its plastic
0783229526|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, one of my favorites!  We received it in great condition & promptly.  The price was good too.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|liked the story line and acting was very good, the only thing I thought the movie didn't need  was the foul language of the boys.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Outstanding mouse.  Works well with my iMac.  I have been using it for 2 months with no issues. It makes your reaction times faster than using a keyboard.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|When you click the option for video: 1080p, it will say camera has stopped, then you can't take a video ever again! When you go back to  the record video, it will keep saying it has stopped. I had to delete this then download it again just to record video! Not saying this is a bad app, just warning you not to do that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. And to think it was free, the graphics are wonderful. I work with kids &amp; they just love to see the intro over&amp; over. When I downloaded the app I stayed up all night, needless to say this is a must have. Get it.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a life changing book, if you take to heart its message. Most of our emotional and mental angst we feel in dealing with life situations and with relationships is of our own making. This book teaches you four agreements you can make with yourself that free you from negative reacting and give you tools to live life constructively.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is sooo much fun. Everytime you reach a certain score, you earn a new cute little character. I highly recomend this app. The best part is the little video when you reach a certain high score.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I own this, two Roku boxes and a WDTV Live.<br /><br />This is a great concept, but, as of right now, it doesn't do much. It's about a third the price of a Roku, but it does probably less than a third of what a Roku does. Only really supports Netflix and YouTube. Yes, you can send anything that Chrome plays to your TV, but the quality of that image is nothing you want to watch for any kind of extended period.<br /><br />When it supports more stuff (hulu plus, HBO GO), it will be a better option, but for now, get a Roku and resist the price tag. You get what you pay for.<br /><br />Update (1/2/14) - Okay, so now the thing is great. Casting a tab running a video still isn't great, but now that Hulu and HBO Go work with it, it's pretty cool. I honestly feel like Google set the price too low when you compare it to Apple TV or a Roku box, but I am okay with paying less.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I got this app because i had almost no storage space left on my kindle. This cleared more the 2.5 gigs of memory. Thanks Clean Master
B004SBULWE|5.0|It works the way it's supposed to.  It kills all of the tasks I have opened, which is why I got it.  You can pick which tasks you want closed, though usually I kill them all.  That helps with aggression issues.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I know some have mentioned that there are other versions of Harry Potter Movie collections out there.  If you are looking for many extras, bonus discs and the rest, that this is not what you want.<br /><br />If, however, you want the movies in a high quality format, this set is perfect.  The images and sound are wonderful.<br /><br />Lower the lights, grab some popcorn and be transported back through the magic of this series.

159562015X|1.0|this book contains an assessment that must be done online. The book is to contain an assessment code for each user, which I was not aware of when I purchased this book. The access code in the book had already been used, which rendered the book useless for me. I was therefore not able to attend a StrengthFinders class that I had purchased this book prior to attending. This was VERY disappointing to me, and it was too late to order a new book after finding this out, as my used book was delivered the day before the class. VERY disappointing, and will obviously cause me not to use Amazon in the future
B00CL151G4|5.0|I'm not good at watching shows for the entire season.  Plus, I have a habit of making new shows get cancelled.  So was scared to start watching.  We DVR'd these until CBS picked it up for a 2nd season.  Then we watched.  And wow, was this good.  I'm looking forward to the 2nd season.
1455576387|5.0|A very exciting book that had me not want to put it down!!  Kept me interested every page that was turned.
B00D6QUMWG|5.0|The greatest soprano of our time sings some of the greatest opera music ever composed. What's not to love?<br /><br />Yes, Netrebko's voice has changed since 10 years ago. It has changed for the better: it has matured. She has grown into parts such as Lady MacBeth.<br /><br />Irritating though it can be, sometimes aging is a good thing.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This was the first album I heard by Nickelback and I've been in love with their music every since.  I was never really much of a heavy metal or hard rock person but these guys are awesome!!

0385743564|4.0|When David was just eight years old, his father was murdered right in front of him by a powerful man named Steelheart. This was after Calamity--a bright red comet--shot through the sky and changed the world as we know it. Steelheart was not the only individual with powers to emerge. No one was certain who these people with powers--Epics, as they came to be known--had come from. Where they aliens? A new step forward in the evolution of mankind? Each of the Epics has a different power, a moniker, and the ability to strike fear in the hearts of the average human.<br /><br />David has made it his life's work to find out all that he can about the Epics, and especially Steelheart. Before his father died, David watched him wound Steelheart. Knowing Steelheart was not invincible, David vowed to take him down one day for good. At the age of eighteen, David tries to get noticed by a group of rebels called the Reckoners. He has followed their work from city to city, envying their gadgets and their bravery as they permanently put to rest lower Epics. After lending a hand during a battle, the Reckoners take David into their fold and a new plan is born: go for Steelheart and take back the city once known as Chicago.<br /><br />As I read Steelheart, I could hear the movie soundtrack playing in my ears, I could vividly picture the scenes, and I wanted desperately to just set the book aside so I could watch the movie. Not the reaction I had been hoping for in an author that is spoken so highly of. Parts of Steelheart read very slow to me; lots of dialogue, planning, and guessing what was really going on in Newcago. I'd been anticipating more action, excitement, and witty dialogue. That's not to say there isn't any--because there is. David and Megan have some fun back and forth between one another, and I grew fond of Prof, the leader of the Reckoners. The rest of the team was not very distinguishable to me, even though there weren't that many more of them. There are some great battlescenes near the end in which both Prof and David will keep many readers on the edge of their seats. But for me personally, I think this is the type of story I would much rather watch than read.<br /><br />It wasn't until near the end that I slowly began to see the careful planning and plotting of Steelheart. All of the hints are there--it will just take a more clever reader than me to figure them all out. Thankfully, Sanderson does not go too into depth on explaining all of the twists through David's narrative or dialogue between characters. Even still, everything neatly clicked into place and made me wish the second book was available right now. I'm definitely sticking with this series, and in the meantime I may finally make the time to read Sanderson's back list and finally get caught up.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Still in the midst  of watching this season and it's fantastic. Huge Damian Lewis and Mandy Patinkin fan !  Claire Danes is still remarkable. I'm hanging on every show and don't want it to end...I know it'll take a while to get the third season and don't want to wait that long.
B004EAQNO4|5.0|Awesome! Not your typical horror flick, throughout the movie you will find a reason to think everyone is the killer in the elevator. Great six degrees of separation twist and loved the spiritual message of God and the Devil. Dark movie, def worth the money.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Great. The DVD was fine and played like a brand new one. Packaging was fine as well.  The DVD had  no problems. We bought it from Amazon because it was not available in stores at the present time.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!  It captured me at page one and I was engrossed until the very end.  It has been quite some time since I have read such a fantastic book.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A very good start to what I hope is an excellent series.  Howey describes a world that I want to know more about.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Getting into a series kinda stinks when you finally catch up to it. This season blew my mind! Could they have left me dangling anymore? I think not! Cannot wait for Season 9! Not only did they figure out a way to bring back Bobby, they found a way to cure demons! One of the greatest story lines yet. Still LOVE Sam and Dean!!!!!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this set of Maj Kong games.  It has patterns I have never seen and they are really challenging.  This is abgreat Amazon app. Thanks.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Takes maybe 3-4 hours to complete. After that you can go revisit levels you didn't finish within expert time limit. Has some kind of survival mode I didn't try yet. Mainly only problem is how randomness takes skill out of it but guess every match game has that flaw.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun game for puzzle lovers! If you need to kill time, this is a great game to do it with.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Great show! Great price! I own all the seasons and the best price is on amazon. I am very happy to own the whole show on DVD.
B009C7JS14|4.0|Read the reviews and found them mixed, but figured since its free, I had nothing to loose. And, I'm very pleased. The app gives a lovely and simple display of time and weather. Glad I got it.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Honestly, I don't like Mariah Carey. I don't know why, I just do. However, this gal puts out a banging Christmas album!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a realy entertaining game for me I love getting new records, which improves my skill I recommend any Custer to purchase this app, plus its free.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is on my daughters Kindle fire, and it has held up really well.  She is 10 years old, and it is easy to clean and it protects her Kindle.
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|The summer of 2013 marked an all-time low in motion picture releases, reception, and audience taste.<br />Incomprehensible visual and narrative junk such as the Avengers, that were spit out of computer hard drives covered the screen, and people were charged up to 14-15 dollars to see them via scams such as extreme digital or 3-d (yikes!!!). I think 2013 also marked the stylistic dead-end of the roller coaster ride special effects movies that were initiated in the late 1970s by the first Star Wars movie (especially its final starfighter battle scene). That movie was the first to be admitted to the realm of seriously fun cinematic product because its action was carried by a story and a some sort of pop-philosophy. Now, with this \\"Avengers\\", which is full of jerky digital camera movements, extreme close-ups, superfast cuts, larger-than-life plot holes--a movie incomprehensible in plot and action done with a smoke-and-mirrors conception and production that I should be refunded my 6 dollars paid for on demand viewing--we have hopefully reached the end of this historic low in holywood action film-making. Notwithstanding the virtual *aping of a beloved Jack Kirby-Stan Lee pop-art creation of the late 60s, the Avengers movie is a monument to everything that has gone wrong in tinseltown in the early 21st century. I will stick to the joy of the original Marvel comics, during when Avengers had a half-a-million monthly circulation, and great stories, not the bizarre and marginal publication it has become today.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|When you can get 3 blurays for $25 when they are close to $40-50 in store why wouldnt you get them if they are movies you enjoy.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Spider-man 2 in 2004 and Iron Man in 2008 were the only superhero movies that gave me the feeling of \\"superhero exhilaration\\" since the first two Superman movies of 1978 ans 1980. Iron Man is solid. Jon Favreau, whose Elf was a sort-of comic bookish masterpiece, did his homework for Iron Man and created a story of technological evolution interwoven with the marketplace of tech, its true battleground, and its protagonist : Tony Stark. The movie captures the magic of the early 80s marvel comic run \\"Demon in a Bottle,\\" that was a contribution to the comic book renaissance. And, like the movie Superman, it brings vividly detailed story elements that bring additional depth to the Iron man phenom as translated onto the silver screen. The creative team is also having fun all along, just like all great Marvel comics characters did, along their fantastic journeys.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|As many people may know this set in stores is over $100 i intially saw it on here for $66 but didnt order in time. It went up to $80 when i got it. Still cant complain especially when it comes with 3 bonus discs that are documentaries and making of the movies.
0802798225|5.0|I've read this book a few times now and ordered this one as a gift for a friend (she also loved it).  Highly recommended to teens and young adults.  The second and third books in the series are also great.
B0089LOG02|4.0|What a wonderful story.  I loved every minute of reading it.  The characters real, the plot carefully woven together, and the requisite happy ending .  One of the best.

B00COO2D6O|5.0|great game that's worth paying for cant wait to see what there going to come up with next.<br />Fun and addictive
B008RXYOKY|4.0|As my new computer had only Thouderbolt ports and I had several firewire drives I could not hook them up.  This did the job just fine.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|so fun! recommend to everyone!  the puzzles and patterns really make you think. can you escape is fun to play with a friend too.
078689136X|5.0|You will like this book if you are someone that watches Castle on tv. It was a good price and a good book to read.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What I LOVED most about this book was the choices made by its characters.  I kept putting myself in their place and trying  to make a decision.  Great book.
B008PZZYB2|5.0|This movie is so educational. It really shows what we can all accomplish if we look good doing it. If you don't read good I am sorry for writing this review.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Having read other reviews of this book, I expected to like it.  I absolutely loved it!  The writing is beautiful.  It was easy to &#34;feel&#34; what it must have been like, living during that time in our history; what it was like to be a woman, what it was like to own slaves - and what it must have been like to be a slave; to be 'owned'.  I grew to love many of the characters that are portrayed so nicely.  I've been sitting here just now, remembering the first few pages of this book, when the &#34;captain&#34; bought little Lavinia; just off the boat from Ireland;  six yrs. old, skinny, sickly, and frightened.  It was kindness that prompted him to buy her.  Upon his return to the plantation, he gave Lavinia to Belle, a beautiful young black slave who worked in the kitchen house.  And there begins a journey; a long, interesting, sometimes painful....very painful, journey.  Emotions run deep in Ms. Grissom's superbly written book.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|this is a great app I highly recommend this. it is a must have. you can do levels, or make your own world. it is absolutely worth the 99&cent;.<br />&copy;2013 by Scribblenauts Fan
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This has been one of the best games I've ever downloaded. I could play it all day! I could (and have) play it all day.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|SPOILER ALERT: BEWARE<br /><br />This movie was incredibly realistic. I am not intelligent or brave enough to ever be an astronaut. This movie hit me hard in my imagination, heart and gut all at once. The Polish astronaut was so manly, handsome, clever, brave he reminded me of an Irish rogue. I would have given him the medal of honor posthumously for what he did. 'Man has no greater love than to lay down his life for his fellow man.' This is what sci-fi movies should be about. They should be imaginative, didactic even. If they made sci-fi movie like this I would watch them all over and over and over again.
B008XX6J4C|3.0|Didn't enjoy as much on this cd.  The live performance I saw on tv was more enjoyable.  Past this on to my daughter to see if she'd like it.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Generic fantasy with unbelievable characters. Every other page the main character is meeting someone who is his new best friend that he feels closer to than his own family despite only having just meet. It might get better in later books but I don't think I will read them to find out. That said the book is free so you can read it yourself and only be out the time.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This show grabs your attention - and keeps it.  The characters are people that you care about.  The plot varies, allowing the characters to develop in alternative situations.  I do not like the drug use, that allows the genius character to feel godlike, but it fits into the storyline and other characters don't share in the drug use.  I am glad to have found this series, and highly recommend it.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This is more than just a well-thought-out guide to writing concise prose and self-editing, although it is indeed that. It's also about the magic of writing. I can't possibly describe that magic more eloquently than Mr. King, so I strongly (adverb justified) recommend you read the book. Then start writing, already.
B000NY17J6|4.0|Generic Linda Ronstadt ,,,great voice ,,old tunes,,,memory lane of the hippie era ,,,happy I own this CD,,,She is a Lovely Singer
B0019UGYK0|5.0|For any Paul Newman fan this is a must, you will recognize many stars and after all of these years younger fans will recognize iconic catch phrases such as &#34;what we have here is a failure to communicate.&#34; Mr. Newman's movies are in a genre all to themselves (my opinion only) and this is a must have for any collection.
B000002LAC|5.0|A fun album,,,I love all the group,,,Dolly was wonderful as always and really was the driving force,,,Linda and Emmy lou are great as always too
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love how there is so much detail and excitement in it!!! I love it! I read all four of Percy Jackson one more to go!!!
B009AY04A8|4.0|A very engaging game - hard to put down. I agree with other reviews that the dialog moves too slowly. This is easily fixed by touching the screen to bring the dialog up to your reading speed. Beware of double taps though, as this moves the dialog ahead, and there is no way that I have found to move backwards through the dialogues to see what you have missed.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Kik is a good app, but suddenly it's broken for Kindle fire hd`s and maybe more. I downloaded this before it was broken so nice works fine, however my brother cannot get it now. Please fix this app.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|The Nikon SB-700 in perfect condition all modes and buttons work like new, Gels and flash diffuser are without damage or scratches. Everything was as described.<br /><br />The Only thing I would consider is shipping. The Nikon SB-700 wasn't packaged right, electronics should be bubble rap.<br /><br />But other then that I'm enjoying this purchased !
B00DKY4LBW|3.0|Part of the amazing sound of Arctic Monkeys was always the rawness and eclectic nature of the music.  This album feels like the wildness has been replaced with a nice suburban lifestyle with a brown-bag lunch and a full-time desk job.  If I ever wondered what Arctic Monkey music would sound like if they were sitting outside on chaise lounges sipping lemonade in the summer sun while playing, I guess I now have my answer.
B00E9P957Q|3.0|I received this box set yesterday in the mail and I was really disappointed when I saw how each CD was packaged.  It is not the quality of the previous box sets recently released.  I had expected each album to essentially like the original CDs with the inserts, photography, etc.  Oh well.  I hope the re-mastered recordings makes up for it.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have been using this on my computer for years, so when I bought my new smart phone, I installed it on there immediately.  Great software and it's free!  I recommend it to all my smart phone friends!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a wonderful, heartbreaking, enjoyable book. The characters were amazingly written and I hated when it ended. Will definitely be reading more books by this author.
0312944926|1.0|Wooden characters running thru a backdrop of Digital Nonsense. Shortly into book Brown describes origin of computer bug as a problem caused by by a bug getting fried on a chip. True origin was when Grace Hopper was working on a early computer and a her associates found a moth stuck in a mechanical relay. Moth was removed and computer was \\"debugged.\\" This was just one of dozens of howlers, technical and non. Silencers on revolvers, no backup lighting in billion dollar computer center, 3 million cpus in one computer, sys tech soldering a chip into computer(come on Dan, you replace card or board), going north from Maryland to get to Great Smokey Mountains, etc., etc..<br /><br />I did finish book as an exercise in dark humor. As a former computer programmer with extensive experience in security and encryption I was intrigued by what a mishmash of pseudo technical details you can cobble together and get 4 and 5 star reviews.

B00D2I8E46|4.0|This is the best Elvis Costello album since the under-rated [[ASIN:B000063526 When I Was Cruel]] from 2002 (see my five-star review).  The sound produced by Costello with Ahmir \\"?uestlove\\" Thompson, the Roots, and producer Steven Mandel is unique.  Costello, Thompson & Mandel share both songwriting and production credits.<br /><br />The best song is \\"Cinco Minutos Con Vos,\\" featuring the beautiful guest female vocals of La Marisoul along with Costello.  One of five songs featuring the Brent Fischer Orchestra, it reminds me of the fantastic David Byrne album [[ASIN:B000002LIV Rei Momo]] from 1989.  Other stand-out tracks include \\"Wake Me Up,\\" with an insistent funky groove, \\"Come the Meantimes,\\" \\"Wise Up Ghost,\\" and the poignant ballad \\"If I Could Believe,\\" which is stripped back to just Costello's voice with a piano trio.  Two of the three bonus tracks on the Deluxe version are also among the best -- \\"My New Haunt\\" and \\"Can You Hear Me?\\" -- so definitely pick it up rather than the standard version.<br /><br />If the quotient of strong tracks was a little higher WISE UP GHOST would attain five-star greatness, but as it is too much of the album is at the level of mood and texture lacking powerful hooks and melodies.  Costello's lyrics are cryptic and suggestively dark -- \\"Tripwire,\\" for instance evoking the endless sequence of acts of U.S. military aggression around the world -- and are included in the booklet, which is designed to look like the City Lights Pocket Poets series, which famously included Alan Ginsberg's \\"Howl.\\"  (There is no jewel case -- the CD is slipped into the back cover of the book.)  I've named the review from a line in the title track that suggests working people rising up against their capitalist overlords -- suggests, but only cryptically.<br /><br />Starting with [[ASIN:B0002VEPL2 The Delivery Man]], (see my three-star review), Costello was focusing on country-inflected styles for several years, and I felt that it was an uninspired period.  WISE UP GHOST is much better.  It grows on me with repeated listening.  If I had reviewed it a couple of weeks sooner I might have given it only three stars, rounding down from 3.5.  Now I have to round down a bit from closer to 4.5.<br /><br />?uestlove and the Roots prove to be excellent collaborators, and the music is rich and complex, revealing more and more with repeated spins.<br /><br />(Review #24)SE UP GHOST is much better.

0062255657|5.0|I love it when I've just finished reading a book and I feel my heart and soul stirring with things I do not know yet how to name, but I know that the book has changed me and I'm not the same person I was when I started reading it. Or maybe it has made me remember who I really am when I didn't even know I had forgotten in the first place.<br /><br />Not many books manage to achieve this for me but The Ocean at the End of the Lane did. I cannot tell you what made me pick this book up but it's like it called to me and I had to respond, not knowing what the story was about, I just knew I wanted to read it.<br /><br />I won't tell you what it is about for that reason. I came to it without any preconceived notions, not even having read Neil Gaiman before, and I plunged into it. It is a scary, disturbing, beautiful and what feels like an ancient story, full of heartbreaking truths of what it means to be human, about childhood and adulthood, and what lies beyond what we call reality.<br /><br />The characters are brilliant, especially the Hempstock women. I loved them and I love how this book was written and it makes me want to go write myself.<br /><br />Read it if you can. I hope it will touch you like it touched me.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|If used with an android phone you're (stock) limited to Netflix, Hulu, and the Google Suite. Hopefully Google will integrate full device mirroring as a dual screen setup which would make this perfect.<br /><br />Laptops are easier as Chrome will let you broadcast directly to Chromecast and have a pseudo dual screen setup. (Also beats out many of the other $100+ products out there like Samsung's AllShare)
1600108512|5.0|Perfection is the only word to describe this comic. It is the most wonderful adaptation I could ever have hoped for for a book as magical as The Last Unicorn. It captures the spirit and essence of the novel; all the important parts are in there, along with all its magic and emotions, its love and tragedy. Of course there were characters and scenes that have to be left out, but that doesn't take one bit away from this comic.<br /><br />The art is absolutely stunning. It is one of the most beautiful things I have ever had the pleasure of seeing; it does justice and more to the original novel and, with all do respect to the ones who love the movie adaptation, the art of the comic is ten million times more superb than the silly animation of the movie.<br /><br />The comic is so perfectly done and so deeply moving that I have to confess that a couple of pages (maybe even more than that) brought tears to my eyes. This book was one of those things that actually made me feel grateful for the opportunity of even holding it in my hands and have a peek at its wonders...<br /><br />So, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
B008LODRT8|1.0|Sorry, not a fan.... book one had potential...book two was long/painful and book three was predictable. I had such high hopes when i first started reading!....actually mad at myself for buying the entire series. Waste of both time and money. Glad others enjoyed it though. If you have actually heard the term bdsm before do not bother.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is do much fun, and it is free! It is so good I wouldn't mind paying for it.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It definitely deserves 5 stars. I would recommend it to anyone with a heart. James Dashner is an author I will read for a long time.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I was on a 5-hour flight from Maui to Los Angeles and had nothing better to do, and this was one of the two movies, so I watched it since I've been a fan of Star Trek since the original series which came out when I was 14. I'm no movie expert, but I've seen every Star Trek movie and this might be the best one yet. It's certainly the most intense, since once the action gets going there's no let up until the final climax. I like all the new actors too, especially Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban, but the whole cast is excellent. The new Kahn (can't recall his name) was also good and he gives the role an equally intense interpretation that recalls the great Ricardo Montalban and his memorable roles in the original Star Trek episode and also The Wrath of Kahn movie. The new Kahn just doesn't quote as much Milton. LOL. Anyway, I say go see it and decide for yourself since I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00CY9AA6E|5.0|makes me want to think and I didn't think my mind was as good as it is.  I really enjoy this.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|It is definitely an affordable alternative of other big name brands. It worth every penny. If you are an entry level audiophile, this might be something for you the play with.
1476734941|3.0|not what I thought it would be. It's fast alright, there's really nothing in the book so it's real fast.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|It took me two days to watch this complete season after it came in the mail. I enjoy watching the episodes as they appear each week but am always amazed at what I miss compared to being able to do a marathon session. If you are a fan of the big bang theory then I do not need to say more. If you are not, I cannot recommend strong enough you giving the show a try. It will only take one episode (extreme cases maybe two) before you are hooked.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I really enjoyed Eleanor and Park, which is what led me to read more from Rainbow Rowell. This story was just as great.
1616550414|5.0|This book is very nice. The size and quality of this book for the price is unbelievable. It is a large book with very high quality paper. The hard cover is of great strength with nice gold leaf inlaid lettering. My son is very happy with the way the book is written and the detail the pictures show. If I saw this book in person at Barn and Nobles I would expect it to have a $40 - $50 price tag.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Well what can I say it's Hitchcock... I confess It's not my favorite AH movie.. my fav. would probably be a toss up between Dial M for murder, Rear Window and The Lady vanishes ...<br />But this movie is a classic, the acting wonderful, it's has some very genuinely creepy moments.. the scene where she's leaving town and her boss sees her, the freaky cop that is following her.. the infamous shower scene..Arbogast... well just a genuinely scary, creepy movie...I love the black and white.. I do not think this movie would be anywhere near as effective in color....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am not usually a fan of sequels. They rarely (if ever) are as good as the original. This was every bit as good as The Shining. That being said, don't go in expecting it to be just like The Shining. This story is told in a different style than The Shining. It's not the same \\"in your face scary\\", but it is definitely gripping, scary and a great story.<br />This is the story of Dan Torrence, the young boy in The Shining. He has inherited some of his father's bad habits (and, it appears, his bad genes), but along the line he eventually learns to control them rather than them controlling him.<br />This is a book I plan to read again. In fact, I will reread The Shining, then follow it with Dr Sleep, so I can get the full effect!<br />If you are a fan of SK you will enjoy this book. If you're not, give it a try anyway. It's worth it.
B00AYB16EO|2.0|Not funny at all, kindda disgusting actually.  I wonder why there were 3 sequels to this gross, distasteful, cheap flick
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book really kept me on the edge of my seat, thank you for this gift to the world Orsan Scott Card
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really like this one.  There are a lot of puzzles and hidden object scenes.  I like that you can get rewards for solving puzzles.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This story is a mystery that kept me guessing. It also made me think about decisions we make and how they affect not only us but other people.
B000NVI1IO|5.0|I liked this album when I got it...Years later,I still like it,but now love it. I usually keep this out with Black Ice & Powerage. In the liner notes Brian Johnson mentions \\"Can't Stand Still\\" being a great song. He is damn right!SUL has a good mix of bluesy & upbeat songs,and once you get familiar with this album,it just grows on you. This is another AC/DC album that came out at a time when good rock n roll was frowned upon and you had to be \\"alternative\\"...They have a knack for coming out to play when the other bands are buzz kills.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I actually prefer this app over using e-Bay on a personal computer.  I love to shop from my bed!  Great little app for all your shopping and selling!!
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|When this was first released,it was only available at Wal-Mart. That was something I was not cool with. Thankfully that's not the case these days. Having said that,this is a good,thick & loud AC/DC album. It could have been about 3 songs shorter but it's great. The question is though,could this be their last studio album? Don't take Black Ice for granted!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|If you love Big Bang, you will find this entertaining as always! I can't get enough of the talented cast and excellent writing. Does not disappoint.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Its not perfect, but its enjoyable. Just felt like watching something, but felt like somethings should have been done differently.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Just bought this app and it will not me make an account. Very upset. Will now be taking it off and use your competitors app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome for adults I read it and I'm only nine<br />No matter how old you are this book is a great read
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I have had this book for awhile but never read it till this weekend. All I can say is what a great book. I got so lost in it that I barely slept. Dean Holder and Linden Sky Davis have a hell of a story. From LOVE to lost to sadness to hate to scared and numb. They come out together and strong with each other.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I don't really like the pictures that is on this app but I do like the challenge of the game. You can select easy, medium or hard by their grids.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas Present for my son. I know he'll be very happy with it. The little lego figures are awesome!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book supports my biases--years ago there was an NPR series called &#34;From Jesus to the Christ&#34;.  It was for the church's perceived need that Jesus became part of the god head (with the Father and Holy Spirit ).  Perhaps we are better off thinking of Jesus as a man blessed by God, rather than the son of God, and perhaps there are others blessed by God in the same way, who are living the message as we understand it.  Jesus's life was intended to brace the faith of the Jewish community, to believe and do what it thought God wanted,  Aslan provides support for that view.<br /><br />This is the second of his books I've read, the one on Islam is also very good. Both Christianity and Islam grew out of social movements, Aslan is able to de clutter the landscape of both religions very well.<br /><br />It would have been helpful to more fully understand the &#34;lens&#34; through which has developed his understanding.  From Muslim Iranian, to immigrant Evangelical Christian American and subsequently Muslim with its belief in God and the major prophet, Mohammed, it is natural that Aslan might understand Jesus as a major prophet, and nothing more.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|I'm a child of the 80's so I totally got ALL the references to songs, movie, quotes and arcade games. I loved the whole concept of a game within a game in a futuristic world where virtual reality takes over from actual reality. The characters were well written and you cared about them (the good guys anyway) fairly quickly.  The twists and turns, the plot development, the 80's.......sigh........a completely enjoyable, fun book. I was sad to get to the end of it and wish there was a second. A great entertaining sci fi, fantasy, thriller with enough geeky references to keep even the most nerdy of us happy in our mums basement (where's my D & D manual)........
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very thought provoking, cyberspace spying on the rise everywhere. Certainly a timely story, Clancey ahead of his time. Will read new one
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast paced, exciting vividly detailed with a focus on good in the face of evil.  Up all night for the first time in years.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show. Good acting and plots. Legal and political system are more likely at work at the same time in practical way and this show captured it.
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|Where do i begin? What can I say? Nothing because this movie was nothing like the book. It's like they defaced the book for there own monetary gain.<br /><br />Did they read the book or just read the synopsis of the book and decide to go with that. I was expecting a condense version of the book in movie format. Instead, what i got was a totally butchered version.<br /><br />I'm am so upset. I want my $4.99 I paid for rental back from Amazon.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|.<br />.<br />Who doesn't want to be a Zombie out for Brains?<br /><br />My Kids love the theme and LOVE THIS GAME.  We even printed, laminated and cut out little brain tokens for scoring our games.<br /><br />It's a roll and press your luck dice game.  There inst much strategy but it's Pure Fun!!!<br /><br />PARENTAL NOTE:  It's a Bottom of the Purse Game.<br />Meaning it travels great there or in glove box of the car or put it in the diaper bag for the older kids.  IF you are stuck waiting anywhere -RESTAURANTS, the Doctor's office, Dentist, airport, for the bus/train, in a Long Line or even if you go camping-- you have a small quick fun game to distract yourself and the kiddo's while you wait.<br /><br />I love this game, and Martian Dice, for that reason.  Martian Dice, for me ranks a little above Zombie Dice for me, as it offers a little more in choices and risk.  Zombie Dice does play differently enough though that it is not the same game with a different theme.<br /><br />Educational??  only if one was to study the mathematical statistics of the game, and even more so if you compared it with Martian Dice.  The game alone, well there isn't any educational value to the game, it's just fun to play.<br /><br />From 1 Parent to Another!  Get the game, and keep it handy for outings.<br /><br />Great little Gift, for kids and grandkids.........Adults, TOO!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I am not a student of theology nor have I read other accounts of the life of Jesus.  I found this book extremely interesting.  Other critics have mentioned that Mr. Asian failed to use footnotes and therefore, I suppose, suspect much of what he write is his opinion.  However, Mr. Asian, throughout the book sites numerous scriptures to support his thesis on the life of Jesus of Nazareth.  In addition, he takes the time to include those individuals who have influenced his thinking at the end of the book.  What this book has done for me is instill an interest to read more.  I was unaware of the influence of the ancient Jews on formation of Christianity.  A great read and highly recommended.
B002SAS26E|4.0|This is not a heavy game.  Yes there is more luck then strategy but it's a Great Filler Game.  A fun way to pass the time with kids while you wait at restaurant. Sometimes it's just fun to sit down with a game light game and talk while playing, adult or child or teen.  It give you and excuse to get together and socialize.<br /><br />It's a fun Game!  My six year old loves it and so do my friends.<br /><br />It easy to learn.  We watched a YouTube video done by the \\"Watch It: Played\\" network on YouTube.  Side Note: read the rules and watching a YouTube Video is a great way to see how the game is played.<br /><br />It's about a 20-30 min game.  We pull it out almost daily since we've gotten it and I'd rather play this light game then watch some of the brain numbing television out there.  If we want a meatier game we also have several of those type of games as well.<br /><br />It depends on who you are playing with and the situation on what type of game you play.  I think that this game would be a great addition to anyone's game collection, especially those with families.<br /><br />It's different then most of the games sold at Walmart or Target or Toys R Us and therefore for makes a great gift for families who like games and the casual gamer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|In every chapter there was something special . Something strong that made me keep reading . This is emotional & beautiful . I felt like I was in the book . I love it .
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun, but coins should build more quickly, whether online or offline! And, more coins should be issued for prizes that I get to the finish line.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I found this to be a very good read, I was very excited to follow Dans life after the Overlook. I also read the Authors note. I did not find this story to be creepy or scary well except for the peeking. Having someone checking in on your most personal thoughts is both creepy and scary. On the Authors note, sorry Mr. King but Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson brought The Shining home.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|The music captures the excitement and tension of the film very well. I love soundtracks because they are like mini-symphonies. This one is no exception. If you loved the movie, you love the score!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a best game for me. Its cool and lets u participate with friends. Its got lots of charecters, boards. You get trophies and prizes in this game. And its totally free. I just love it and enjoy it.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I love this game it's great! All the different play able people and the different scenery and challenging levels. I LOVE IT! And here's a tip you can hit the robber with your cane when he gets close to you.
0786956291|3.0|I wouldnt recomend buying this because the only thing you really need from this box is the dice the rest of the information can be found on the internet. However if your new to Roll playing games this can be a great start.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I ordered this book, I had not read anything about it.  I just ordered it like all Stephen King books.  As soon as I started it, I couldn't put it down.  This one is added to the list of favorites.  It might be because I adore Danny as an adult or it might be because it took me back to the shining, whichever the reason, loved this one.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I got this for my little brother who loves superheros and when he saw this he went berserk. He plays this game non stop 24-7

B004MPI5SS|5.0|Good movie. The quality was good. Definitelly i will recommend to everyone to rent movies in amazon instant. I love to have subtitles as well.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|Another stellar effort. The album flows from one track to another creating a sense of, just that a theater presentation. Some memorable tracks, especially Illumination Theory. I know some don't care for the orchestral portion but I loved it, gave the track a sense of inclusion for me.<br /><br />I fell victim though and got the 16BIT FLAC version which sounds pretty pathetic. Waiting on my vinyl and checking out the HDtracks version, which I hear is a night and day difference.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This book is good, but it's quite confusing. You never really know when it's telling the truth or in a different reality. It really makes you think about what's real and what's fake in you own life. It is well written though so no complaints there.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Great item, was a great price would definitely recommend to other buyers and would definitely use this seer again for similar purchases

B001V7UXG2|5.0|This series has truly captured the spirit of P.G. Wodehouse's charming stories and amazing characters.  A treat for the eyes and ears as well as the heart.  Gussy and his newts.  Aunt Agatha's bidding.  Jesse's connections.  I loved these books as a teenager and now share the fun with my video-oriented family.  This is truly family entertainment at its best.

0345509617|4.0|From the sounds of things, reading many other troubling reviews, I am not the only one to have this amazing book damaged by UPS workers.<br /><br />They DUMPED my package on its corner over the fence! I heard it drop from inside my apartment, it was dunked with THAT MUCH FORCE. I went outside, immediately opened the package, begging fate to be kind- and every page on that corner was sharply dented inwards. This is a big book, it took a lot of (careless) force to dent EVERY SINGLE PAGE OF THE BOOK. The UPS truck was gone before I even reached the damaged package, so I couldn't flag him/her down.<br /><br />I wish I could say this great book could make me forget the frustrating delivery damage, but being on the lower right corner, it is hard to forget as my fingers tried to straighten the page with every turn. And for its price, the book's binding is concerningly weak. I feel like I have to baby a monolith when I read it! It's obvious many corners were cut to make this as cheap as a published book of its size could be- the paper quality is too thin for all the ink it has saturated in it. Sometimes dark pictures on the (dented) corner rub off on my fingers!<br /><br />All in all, the damage to my purchase wasn't catastrophic, and design flaws didn't help it sustain the beating it got. BUT these deliveries need to be carried out with more care! No package, especially one so expensive and unexpectedly fragile, should be SLAM DUNKED, MICHAEL JORDAN-STYLE, INTO CONCRETE, OVER AN IRON BAR FENCE. The bars were WIDE enough for even this big book to slide harmlessly through. I am VERY disappointed with Amazon's choice of delivery service, and have been wary of ordering more books from this site because of this rotten experience.<br /><br />Oh, and the gate was open.
B0030B624E|3.0|It's alright but I probably should have rented this over buying it. For some reason I remembered it being a much better movie

B0041KKYCY|4.0|Sometimes revenge is just sweet even when it's overboard.  For all the women we've known, read about or heard about, especially those in developing countries who are frequently powerless against male assault even in public places, this movie is gratifying revenge for all of you - even if it's only make believe.  Pay attention you mother f-----s out there!

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Awesome read for anyone in IT leadership. It applies to any industry where IT is involved and will benefit anyone.
0920668372|5.0|I once read this book when I was younger.  One day my son drew me a picture.  When he gave it to me I wasn't sure who it was because the man (or himself, who is 7 years old) was so big compared to the lady (who was of course me).  He told me as he sang and spun around... &#34;it's me mommy, because one day I'll be bigger than you and you'll still love me and I'll still love you!&#34;  I smiled and instantly I remembered this story...and had to find this book for him.  When it came, I hid it until the perfect time to read it to him.  A few days later when it was raining outside, I called him into my room.  We got onto my bed, cuddled under the covers and I read him the book.  We both cried and held onto one another for quite some time.  I wrote a note inside the book to him and promised him I would keep it safe for him and when he was ready, I'd give it to him to take with him as a man.  This is a MUST HAVE BOOK for all parents who have that very special relationship with their child.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book is a great mystery. Margo goes missing and its up to the main character to find her. It has a fair amount of cussing, but thats how teens talk.

B004GTKP3S|5.0|How can you not love Cranford and its bevy of stock characters so beautifully represented by the BBC's best troupe of actors. Set in the quintessential English village on the verge of being thrust into the Industrial Age, Dame Judi leads  the town toward what's true and good about small communities where very often judgement comes before compassion. In Cranford, tho, that doesn't happen often. A really charming series that's very well produced.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Very poorly functioning app, I was unable to even go through the sign in page. First, it was informing me that somebody else registered to my account - but without a possibility to say that it was really me. Secondly, it wanted me to create a channel, but I already have a channel, so was going in circles.... As a result, I could not use it.
B00H83EUL2|5.0|\\"Gravity,\\" directed and co-written by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, stars Sandra Bullock as Mission Specialist Ryan Stone, George Clooney as Mission Commander Matt Kowalski, and an army of visual effects wizards. Stone and Kowalski run into a huge dose of bad luck when a communications satellite explodes and bombards their space shuttle with dangerous shrapnel. Stone and Kowalski lose contact with their controllers in Houston and are left to their own devices. Both of them know that their chances for survival are slim. Nothing further of the plot can be revealed, lest the movie be spoiled for potential viewers.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock delivers a gutsy and poignant performance as a brilliant but lonely scientist who has little motivation to fight against overwhelming odds. After all, she believes that no one on earth will mourn her passing. Clooney, as usual, plays a self-deprecating and wisecracking hunk, who teases Stone and prods her to hang on, no matter what.<br /><br />Much of the film is driven by amazing stunts, mind-boggling computer graphics, the gorgeous cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, and constant doses of peril from fire, loss of oxygen, and that pesky space junk hurtling towards our heroes. Steven Price's pulse-pounding musical score serves as a fitting backdrop for this adrenaline-fueled film. The brief running time, a mere hour and a half, is sufficient to tell a story that is more visual than intellectual. Those who lack an advanced degree in astrophysics will have no idea if what we are seeing bears any resemblance to reality. Still, even if Cuar&oacute;n's facts are way off-base, he is a genius at eliciting a strong emotional response. We cannot help but root for Stone as she vacillates between hope and despair; her courage and vulnerability keep us enthralled. \\"Gravity\\" is an electrifying thrill-ride that should garner a wide and appreciative audience.

B00DT99BX6|4.0|PAWN OF INNOCENCE by Chameleon is an exciting romantic thriller, full of twists and turns, racing from one dangerous locale to another.<br /><br />Young heiress Camille chafes under the restrictions of her closely-guarded life. Always in the company of bodyguards, she feels smothered by her overprotective father. Determined to escape the bars of her gilded cage, Camille flits away to Alanya, Turkey, where she meets a handsome, charismatic man on the beach and is immediately smitten. Unaware, however, of the true dangers of her situation, she runs full-tilt into a tangled web of peril and deceit. Is the man from Alanya her guardian angel? Or is he a terrorist operative determined to destroy Camille and her father?<br /><br />After a rather slow, though not uninteresting start, PAWN picks up the pace and races along to its conclusion with twists and turns along the way. The plot is strong and entertaining. As the story is told primarily from Camille's point of view, the reader is as apprehensive and caught by surprise as she is, which heightens the suspense. Although a few of the twists are not as unforeseen as they might have been, most are very well done. Scenes where Camille overhears portions of conversations and immediately jumps to conclusions are quite clever, as she doesn't always jump to the wrong conclusion. Sometimes she does, however, so her turmoil and uncertainty are well-founded.<br /><br />On the whole, I very much enjoyed this story. It would have benefitted, though, by a more professional editing. One of my pet grammar peeves is confusion with the verbs \\"lie\\" and \\"lay.\\" Unfortunately, they are misused frequently and consistently throughout the story. It's one thing if a character is speaking - and yes, people misspeak these words all the time - but they should be used properly in the narrative. Every time Camille \\"laid\\" on her bed, I wondered if she'd perhaps laid an egg.  Another frequent glitch was the use of \\"could care less\\" instead of \\"couldn'tcare less.\\" Apparently, Camille ran into some mildly caring terrorists. Again, these mistakes shouldn't be in the narrative at all, and certainly not often.<br /><br />Nevertheless, PAWN's characters are well-developed and enjoyably free of stereotypes. It was a little hard to watch Camille make the same mistakes over and over, but that was consistent with her desperation and immaturity. Armand is a noble and conflicted hero - my favorite kind! The secondary characters were also appealing and believeable.<br /><br />If you enjoy romantic suspense with some intriguing and off-the-beaten-track settings, you'll enjoy PAWN OF INNOCENCE.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|A story told by a man that sits somewhere on the autism spectrum. He likes order and precision but with the help of his 2 friends he begins to learn to read emotion and learns some life skills and then he meets Rosie.<br />I won't give away the story line but I loved this book, it is quirky, funny and at times sad. It gave me a glimpse into the mind of a person with aspect he's and how they learn to cope in a human work.

0345803450|4.0|Sweet Tooth was a return to the kind of novel that got me interested in the work of Ian McEwan in the first place: subtle, clever, involving and literate. His plot of a young British girl who becomes a low-level operative in MI5 during a low point in Britain's post war political scene drew me in with the uniqueness of its unfamiliar setting (both in place and in time), the reality of its characters and the originality of its story.<br /><br />Young Serena, by virtue of her romantic involvement with an older MI5 agent, finds herself with a job as an entry-level worker in Britain's internal security organization. Her prospects for advancement in a male dominated profession in pre-feminist London are dim--that is until she's recruited to play a part in an odd scheme to fund young authors who have the \\"right\\" political outlook. Her superior's calculation is that in a war of ideologies, the government has a role to play in secretly supporting intellectuals who have the power to influence people who might be on the fence about Communism. Serena's role is to play the role of an agent of a literary foundation that has decided to fund struggling author Tom Haley. MI5 plotters think that Haley will churn out the kind of novels that make Western democratic capitalism seem like the best alternative to Communism. It's a stretch but far stranger plots were certainly hatched by the American CIA during the Cold War. Serena inevitably become romantically involved with her unwitting dupe with a series of interesting consequences.<br /><br />This is a good novel. The plot allows Serena to explore themes of passion (in her emotional support for her young author/lover), loyalty (to her MI5 superiors and colleagues) and betrayal (in her inability to tell Tom who's really funding him and why).<br /><br />There's a big BUT here, however. There's a significant twist that comes in the closing pages of Sweet Tooth. A twist that had I never seen it used before would have been stunning, providing a satisfying end to the novel. There's just one problem: it's a twist that McEwan has famously used before! For a novel that was so on track up to that point, I was amazed both that McEwan would use it again and that his editors would allow it. I can't say much more than that without ruining it for others, but I admit to feeling let down. Then again, for those who aren't familiar with this particular plot twist from one of his most notable earlier novels, it probably will serve as a satisfying ending. For those of us who have seen it before, I felt just a little cheated. Having said all of that, I can only take one star off for what was otherwise a very enjoyable book.ng a satisfying end to the novel.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Several friends told me about the book and what I read was pretty much what I expected. The story line was a little slow and the book didn't have quite the dramatic climax I anticipated (no pun intended).
B0026772N8|5.0|I used to use this book as a 'text' in a college course on Modern  European Intellectual Thought.  The 'trip' the narrator takes with his  12 year-old sone is both metaphorical and real as he battles his internal alter ego, Phaedrus, for control of his body and his relationship with his son throughout their motorcycle trip to the Pacific on a battlefield of ideas, bombs lobbed by Plato, Hume (and British empiricism), Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche and more..  It's an exciting and ultimately satisfying ride

1475143389|5.0|Before read this book I feel a little lost.<br />I don't know how to eat, how to train, what kind of exercise to do, how to split them during the week, how to warm up, how many reps to do, how many set, I don't know nothing about time resting etc...<br />This book, in a coincise and effective manner, answer at every question a bodybuilder can ask when he starts the training.<br />The answer came from the experience of author who suggest his training formula with no drug and with the support of a lot of university research.<br />I like too much also the section &#34;the 6 biggest muscle building myth and mistake&#34;.<br />I think every bodybuilder should read this.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|I have not seen this movie anywhere for re-runs so I decided that I had to purchase it in order to see it again -  one of my favorite Steve McQueen movies.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors. I always enjoy his books.  This is no exception. I will probably add more of his books to my Kindle.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|As an Amazon Prime customer I was very excited when I saw the advertisements for the Google Chromecast device.  I bought it and received it today and immediately hooked it up and tried to watch an episode of \\"The Good Wife\\" which is an Amazon Instant Video (AIV) TV series.  Needless to say I was very disappointed when I received the message that the AIV format wasn't currently supported. I bought this device specifically to watch AIV's on my HDTV. Hopefully, Google and/or Amazon will develop this capability in the near future.
B0049VZ222|5.0|My friend kept bugging me to watch. She's right- it's really good. The blood and violence was a bit much at first, but then I realized that this is the only show I watched recently with blood and gore that is not based on cases in the headlines. I actually had stopped watching Criminal Minds and the CSI shows because it was just too real and too disturbing what humans are capable of doing to each other. This show- totally fake, not realistic, but a well written fantasy story with characters I love or hate, so somehow it works. I still look away sometimes, but it really is one of my favorites now.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|Beverly Hills, 90210: The First Season is my favorite 90s show of all time behind my Miami vice 80s<br />show. The movie had arrived in good condition and I have no complaints. I would recommend the<br />seller to anyone who is a 90210 fan.
B001HN6922|2.0|The movie freezes.  It is not unwatchable.  It freezes in the first part of the movie but with fast forwarding you can get past it but what a pain.  The movie itself is very cute.  I bought it for my 2 year old grandson
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This game starts simply but them becomes harder without discouraging the player. I also like that you don't need to buy coins or points or whatever to keep playing.

B008OOYALE|4.0|great app. a little tedious but other wise a pretty cool app to pass the time. there are too many missions at one time and the dragon breeding is way too random. you candy have a mission requesting a dragon that you can never breed.
3836538725|5.0|I bought 2 books as presents and I received enthusiastic thank you's. I could agree that the editing could be improved and the description of the photos could be more thorough, but I do not think that you could buy a better large hardcover photography catalogue for a better price. I highly reccomend it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I had to buy this for school, but after reading it I think I would have bought it anyway! It's so interesting; I am thinking about habits in an entirely different way now. I would recommend this to anyone interested in how people form habits and how to change bad ones.

B001LYD2JU|5.0|As a life-long fan of Michael Schenker, I don't know if my review will hold much merit but...here goes.<br /><br />I could go on and on singing the praises of Michael Schenker's fretwork and this album in particular; however, I will try to keep it concise.<br /><br />First, for those unfamiliar with this album and/or Michael Schenker's work in general, do yourself a favor and purchase this album. This is quite possibly the best overall guitar album of it's era. Michael Schenker is an incredibly technical yet emotive guitar player who, quite simply, takes the art of rock guitar playing to unknown heights. This album, his first solo effort after leaving the highly acclaimed band, UFO, displays a wide range of songs. The supporting musicians are all very accomplished, especially the rhythm section of Mo Foster and Simon Phillips of Jeff Beck fame. The singer, Gary Barden, more than holds his own on his album debut. In fact, his range and style remind one a bit of Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson who was at the time of this release, not yet known to the world. The uniform thread and central force behind this recording is, of course, Michael Schenker and his virtuosity. There are no filler tracks, each having it's own personality. This edition of the original album is made even more enjoyable by the improved remastering and the addition of several nice bonus tracks.<br /><br />Second, for those familiar with Schenker's work but not with this particular release, believe a long-time fan,...<br />this edition is worth the price. The bonus tracks allow for an insight into the early recordings leading up to the first Schenker solo record. One can see (or rather, hear) the process of tweaking some of the songs into the format we all came to know and love. The remastering itself is very well-done and makes for an even more enjoyable listening experience.<br /><br />Purchase and enjoy!
1781162646|4.0|First off, I love the cover! Great homage to thriller paperbacks of decades past and a pretty clever tie-in. Another love is the genre-busting story that King has produced. It flirts with you and deliberately makes you guess where it is heading. This is so engaging that that when the novel resolves itself you are left wanting. It is like stepping up to a substantial buffet of Chinese food, gorging, and a few hours later craving a cheeseburger. All of this is forgiven because he is just so enjoyable a storyteller. The characters are appealing, the mystery suitably mysterious and the background richly set. The only real detractor was the deep immersion in carny and amusement park culture. I normally love learning about the nooks and crannies of our weird and wonderful world but this was overly involved.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading Bared to You and Reflected in You I absolutely could not wait for Entwined to You to be released. But I have to say I didn't read it immediately upon release due to quite a few reviews expressing  disappointment in the story line. I was satisfied with the ending of the second book but really wanted more of Gideon and Eva!!!!! So I decided to read Entwined with You and hope for the best!  Well I am here to tell you this book did not disappoint me at all and I do believe it was the best book yet!!! So happy to see Eva finally trusting Gideon and Gideon finally opening up to Eva. I titled this review as I did because WOW the sex is that good!!! I simply love these two characters and I can't wait for more!!! Thanks Sylvia for yet another great book!!!!!
B00D3LA71K|4.0|I have always liked the good bad guy movie and this is a good one.  Kind of a cross between Stand by Me and No Place For Old Men.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Our view of so many things is warped by the astigmatism of our culture; this allows us to say things like \\"the only thing that can stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun\\" and have half of us nod along like drowsy parrots. (Other things that can stop a bad man with a gun: another bad man with a different gun, a croquet mallet,a net,a heart attack, a puddle of oil, a swarm of bees, an attack of conscience, the voices in his head saying something different,etc.) Mr Gladwell gets the lenses out and corrects our vision once again.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Just when you think you have it figured out you find out you almost did. Great cast and good plot.  I the public and the critics don't rave then it has a 50 50 chance of being a good movie.
B0071AKB38|5.0|Fine quality and cool looks. It sounds Amazing for a small speaker of this size. Authentic X-mini from the seller. Bought a Kai, a few X-mini2 and also a few knock-off X-mini2 from ebay.  The knock-off mini2 actually plays louder than the real X-mini2, but with noticeable higher noise (sound distortion). The sound quality of the knock-off is much poorer than the real one. The best way to use a X-mini2 is Bluetoothing a Kai and daisy chain it with more mini2's. You get the best yield on sound - Stereo sound tho. A real X-mini2 costs 4-6 bucks more in average than a knockoff. I still think it is worth the money to get a real one.  Haven't tested the microphone feature.
0375869026|5.0|This is a beautiful story about a character who is different from all his classmates. The subtle humor is wonderful and my students have made many connections and generated many great classroom discussions about this book. We are going as a class to see the author in January. My students are excited to meet the author of their favorite book.

B00001NTXN|5.0|Cunning and forward thinking required for this game! Great for all ages. Competitive, strategic and fun.<br />Acceptable quality looks durable and attractive.
B0053O89KG|1.0|Season Four heralds a major dumbing down of the series. This season looks like a bad sitcom. The Castle character, for the most part has been such an incompetent buffoon you wonder how he could possibly be of any help solving murder cases for the NYPD. If you dislike bad cringe comedy, you probably don't want to watch any more episodes of Castle.
B001NHNG64|5.0|A real page turner.  Love the Reacher series, each one is entertaining and I love seeing how Jack is going to get out if this sticky situation.  Can't wait for the next one!

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works well but ONLY streams (to Samsung HDTV) what is seen \\"live\\" by (MacBook Pro) laptop in a Google Chrome browser window.  E.g., if laptop is tuned to show a YouTube using Chrome, that's what TV shows.  So far I have found no way to show anything brought up in another bowser, nor without browser at all (such as a DVD playing in the DVD slot).  If you're subscribed to a service playable in Chrome, then that will appear on your HDTV. In essence, the device mirrors merely what Chrome shows, period.<br /><br />The setup is much more complicated than the ads and box suggest: A download is needed, and other steps are involved which are tactically not mentioned until they are required.  But it all worked, as far as setup goes.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|My kids are very pleased.  Two copies is great!  One Blu Ray and the other for a regular DVD player.  A little more money but well worth it!

B00DL47RQ2|5.0|I bought a ticket to this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it, and almost immediately as it began I knew I was watching a Woody Allen movie.<br /><br />I cannot say exactly why this is so.  Perhaps it was the richness of the character study, and the fact that Allen writes so excellently for female characters.  In any event, Cate Blanchett's character, and her brilliant performance of this down on her luck former socialite married to a conman husband played by Alec Baldwin, may be the best female character performance you will see on a movie screen this year, and Blanchett's performance is probably the most Oscar worthy I have seen so far.<br /><br />Set in San Francisco in the present day it unfolds the complex relationship of two sisters, one upper class but fallen on hard times, and her working class sister who makes working class choices.  Because it unfolds in a non linear fashion it appears to dip randomly into different events over a period of about 15 years or so, and we understand why the sister is working class.<br /><br />One of the themes of the movie is honesty, and facing reality, and Jasmine makes choices that seem oblivious to it. She fibs and tells little lies, at one level self deceptive, and at another deceptive of others.  We may not like her for this, but if you're like me, I felt tremendous compassion for her, even loved her in spite of everything, which is not often I feel that way about a character.  She suffers from severe anxiety, and the events she has to undergo take a toll on her.  One particular choice she makes has particularly severe repercussions, yet in the moment we fully understand it.<br /><br />I think it is fair to say moving to Europe and making films there has been wonderful for Woody Allen.  In an interview he said that his previous movies were critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful. Now he has made a series of outstanding movies, and written brilliant roles particularly for women.<br /><br />I cannot claim to love all of them, but [[ASIN:B001SKB1Y0 Vicky Cristina Barcelona]] was excellent and Penelope Cruz won an Oscar for her performance. [[ASIN:B000EQHXNW Match Point]] is probably my personal favorite starring Scarlet Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, about an upwardly mobile ambitious tennis coach, and what may be a perfect murder.  [[ASIN:B006AN78XS Midnight in Paris]] was dreamy and sentimental, and won an Oscar for best screenplay.  Woody Allen has been nominated a staggering 23 times for an Academy Award winning four times, three times for Best Original Screenplay, and once for Best Director of Annie Hall.<br /><br />Actors who worked with him have also won Oscars.  Remember Mira Sorvino for Mighty Aphrodite, and Michael Caine for Hannah and Sisters.<br /><br />As someone who lives in San Francisco, I can say that he makes it look almost better than the reality, and a beige BMW can do wonders to enliven the surroundings.<br /><br />It seems to me that like a good wine, Woody just gets better with age, and easily maintains his excellence with this movie.<br /><br />I think  most people will enjoy this movie, and I hope this was helpful.to love all of them, but [[ASIN:B001SKB1Y0 Vicky Cristina Barcelona]] was excellent and Penelope Cruz won an Oscar for her performance.

B000MM079U|5.0|This is one of those movies worth re-watching. All the things you expect from the British when they are captured by the Japanese and forced to build a bridge.<br /><br />This movie was shot in Sri Lanka as it best fit the story. However the real river was not the Kwai. That just happened to be a better name for the river.  And the real bridge was not wooden.<br /><br />My favorite character was William Holden as Shears, The only pragmatic charter in the movie. Shears did not have to keep a stiff upper lip or save face or any of that sort of stuff. Where as Alec Guinness as Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as Colonel Saito, had to go face to face with each other's interpretation of honor.<br /><br />This is best depicted in one statement from Shears:<br /><br />&#34;You make me sick with your heroics. There's a stench of death about you. You carry it in your pack like the plague. Explosives and L-pills -- they go well together, don't they? And with you it's just one thing or the other: destroy a bridge or destroy yourself. This is just a game, this war! You and Colonel Nicholson, you're two of a kind, crazy with courage. For what? How to die like a gentleman... how to die by the rules... when the only important thing is how to live like a human being.&#34;<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006ADD5 Lawrence of Arabia (Single Disc Edition)]]
B0012QRPU4|5.0|The show had me hooked immediately.  Great writing, dark comedy, interesting characters, I can't watch this series fast enough.  Makes me want to take a vacation just to watch it all.
B0018QPPXW|5.0|The parents are away and Joel Goodsen (Tom Cruise) is left to his own devices. He has fun running around in his father's car and sort of dispatches it. Wondering what action to take, he finds something useful and profitable with the help of a new found friend Lana.<br /><br />His business sense is recognized by the university he is applying for. Will this help?<br /><br />The fun is in the detail. And we all remember the train scene. Amtrak should use this as a promotional ad.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I recommend this book for all Lee Child fans. Good story line, fast read, and as always, Jack Reacher doesn't disappoint!
B009K916ZK|5.0|I've used this to connect my MacBook Air to an external monitor and projector, and it works immediately and without errors or artifacts. My only complaint is that Apple sets the price too high.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|If you want action which attempts to create a semblance of a meaningful relationship, here between a brother and sister and then a hunting student and comely white witch, this is it.
B0012DT9VK|3.0|Okay, the first thing you have to consider is that this is the trio of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Tim Burton. You go into it knowing that it's going to be quirky and some what dark. If you can handle that, you should be fine with the rest.<br /><br />The first thing that jumped out to me about this movie is the fake teeth! LOL Willie Wonka and Charlie's mom's teeth are crazy distracting. It's funny and it ties into the story... kinda... but that's just another weird thing about being in a Tim Burton film, I guess. Actually it is a big part of Wonka's backstory. It gives him a reason for how he is and how he transforms. It makes the weirdness work.<br /><br />The story has a good family message... if you can get it. The kids I watched it with missed all that. They just thought Wonka was mean and weird. Maybe kids that are older than 8 or more worldly will like it better. They thought the Oompa Loompas were real, so A+ for creativity and realism.
B00CBRH4YU|4.0|It's definitely not &#34;The Tree of Life,&#34; and I'm not sure Ben Affleck was the person to cast as the lover, reluctant as he tried at times to make himself seem; he still seemed like Ben Affleck. The women are lovely.

B009LDD1X0|5.0|I really enjoyed the big bang theory!!! Every episode makes me laugh :-] just wish there were more episodes to watch good thing the new season started already.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|This movie was okay. DiCaprio and McGuire were good, but the surreal photography was sort of distracting. I was hoping for more of an epic movie. The music was modern, however definitely not true to the period.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|I was always fond of Liberace and when I learned he died from aids, I was very sorry.  I had never (at that time in my life) wondered if he was gay. In fact, I'd read his autobiography and believed he had just not &#34;found the right woman&#34;.  I was naive but the times were naive....In any case, when I heard about Scot Thorsen and his claims about Liberace, I thought he was lying. It was beyond anything I could accept.  But now I BELIEVE this story. And the acting abilities of these two great actors also made me not think of it as a story of love between two men, but truly a story of two people who loved each other. At least for a time.
B008Y212PI|4.0|The game is fun and addicting. The game could use higher difficulty settings but not bad for free app of day
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Megan has given up on love existing but wants a baby of her own.  Connor refuses to give in to love but wants a wife.  Could they be exactly what they are both looking for?  Really enjoyable story about two people afraid of love for different reasons.  The story is filled with great interactions between the characters.

B005LAIIGW|4.0|Most movies set in space show humanity effortlessly sailing through the void as would-be conquerors of the universe.  It's rarer for a film to show how dangerous space is, and how easily it can kill us, and no film in recent memory has done so as memorably as Gravity.<br /><br />On a routine mission to work on the Hubble telescope, Dr. Ryan Stone and her companions come under assault from space rubble, and in the aftermath, the stranded survivors, cut off from help, must find a way to get down to Earth before running out of air...if other hazards don't kill them first.<br /><br />Gravity's greatest strength is its visual spectacle, which is perfect in almost every way.  The visual effects are spectacular, the camerawork is flawless (including some very impressive shots that go on for several minutes without a single cut), and the depiction of how disasters in space might play out is both terrifying and awe-inspiring, with characters struggling with zero-g disorientation, and scrambling to grab onto things in a weightless environment, and how destructive debris can be while shooting around at hundreds of miles an hour.  As a visual and visceral experience, Gravity is without peer.<br /><br />But while the film has perfect visuals, it's surprising how light the story is.  In fact, it almost feels non-existent due to how simple it is, with a lack of twists, bad guys, and conspiracies that other films feature.  And while there's no harm in having a straightforward story, I wished there was more to aside from \\"Let's get back to Earth.\\"  More moral decisions and difficult choices would have helped greatly (there's one choice early on, but because we haven't had time to truly know the characters, it has little impact), and the characters are equally simplistic, with very little time given to know them and their motivations beyond wanting to survive.  While Sandra Bullock does a fine job, I didn't feel connected to her on an emotional level.  The some goes for George Clooney, who doesn't even get a backstory or characteristics besides being the confident, take-charge commander type.  The two are likeable enough; I just wish there was a lot more to them then what we're given.<br /><br />While Gravity technically falls into the category of \\"Visually spectacular but weak plot\\", I decided to nudge it up to four stars based sorely on how good a job it does when focusing on spectacle and the struggle of its characters to survive.  It falters when it tries to develop those characters, but there is no denying that Gravity is a fantastically gripping survival film that sets a new standard for the \\"Disaster in Space\\" genre.

0062255657|4.0|In keeping with the sentiments of a significant number of reviewers, I feel that YA readers would have been better served by this novel.  The adult scenes feel like they were inserted to allow the book to be marketed to adults.  It would have been a much scarier and more memorable read when I was 11 or 12, and less familiar with the tropes - the ancient evil, the angelic powers, portals between worlds, etc.  (For quite a slim book, it also carried a hefty price tag in hardcover.)  That being said, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is still a rich and engaging read, perhaps because in the two years since I read it the first time I have tempered my expectations and events in my life have conspired to allow me to appreciate the themes more, especially the nature of memory and identity and the experience of childhood.  Gaiman's multifaceted and thematically complex works have a way of shaping themselves to fit the reader's personality and whatever inner or outer struggles they may be dealing with.

B005D7ECMM|5.0|I know this movie by heart and so I appreciate this edition of it.  I particularly enjoyed the interviews with the stars as well as the making of it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Seriously?  I have to explain why this movie is so awesome?  It's Star Trek!  Great story line, terrific action scenes, and always a bit of droll humor.  I love it!  It makes a great holiday gift.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I saw this before on HBO and I am so glad to have it for my own.  I learn something new each time I see it.  The acting is exceptional---one of best historical dramas I have ever seen!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I thought it looked interesting... it wasn't. I desperately wanted it to get better... it didn't. I hoped it would come together at the end... no luck. Don't waste your time on this. The few dollars lost was the least of my worries. Three hours, yes three hours, a total waste. I will never regain those back and to think I could have actually learned/accomplished/slept during that time. This movie has inspired me to go back to reading. If I wanted to think of something complex I'll turn to a great piece of art or read an awesome book. H.B. and T.H. are great actors the screenplay was lacking to say the least.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Arrived promptly and very well made and compact.  Have used a variety of car rechargers.  I carry this recharger with me as I travel and can recharge both my iPhone (while using it as a GPS) and my iPad or my passenger's iPhone at the same time.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Loved this. Hope all actors are back for season 2. Kept me interested whole series.<br />Love rekindled for bbca crime shows.
1781162646|5.0|Excellent. The reader feels to be a part of the story. Mr. King has a way of not only developing his characters, but breathing life into them as well. They become animated. All the time the reader feels to be an observer, watching from a short distance.<br /><br />Joyland, taking place in the summer of '73, has large parts in which most everyone can identify with at some point in their lives.<br />Basically touted as a murder mystery, I found the book much more than that. It's a great human interest story with a good thriller attached to it.<br /><br />It has basically 3 main protagonists. A 21 year old college student with a summer job at an amusement park, and a young woman with a 10 year old boy confined to a wheelchair. These three main characters, and a host of others, each have their uniqueness told in a way that will keep you turning pages.<br />The book isn't long; a bit less than 300 pages. In that short time, the characters and story are so well told that when the end comes it packs a very bittersweet punch. Life is not fair; it just is. Please, don't miss this book.
B00915G6SU|5.0|We love this series! Great cast and great stories. We have enjoyed watching all 8 seasons. Can't wait for season 9.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game teaches while it entertains.  Love it. The graphics are lifelike.  I like all the various activities. included in the game.
0307887898|4.0|This is a great place to get a good understanding of the origins and rationale for Lean Startup. The book wanders a bit, but I didn't mind because the anecdotes were interesting and relevant. I'd like to see an entire book on building and designing continuous deployment from Eric Ries.<br /><br />This book belongs on the phone of every startup founder.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|a some app it is really fun and great for passing time like on road trip too should get it is really fun
1449305172|5.0|I've read most of the leading books in Lean Startup and while they all have good insights, this one is the best single book to get everything you need to get started. I bought ten copies and handed them out to anyone I knew even considering a startup.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My three year old son loved it, watches it on repeat. Very convenient to rent instantly and have for 24 hrs!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Bubble Blaze is a fun match 3 game.....just not a lot of challenges. Maybe good game for the smaller kids....adults will play but become bored quickly. Younger kids will enjoy the Dragon coming out.
1439190976|1.0|Nothing new in this book, if you've kept up with this stellar firm.  Any &#34;updated&#34; information was in the news a while back,
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was an all around good book. Read it, and gain your own opinion. That is all I have to say.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|This simple Arkanoid clone sports cool power-ups with as many as 4+ balls at once, but on my phone I sadly found the graphics too large; the space felt so cramped that it was the number one reason prompting me to uninstall it. It would also be good if the developer allowed control of the bar by setting one's finger under the bar, not only on it directly, so one could physically see the top of the bar for precise timing. If the playing field was increased, I'd go back to playing the game, which had great 3D graphics. By the way, the annoying whistle sound signaling every new level is endurable. Barely.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|I think it's a fine movie, but my expectations were too high since it had the same name as the original Evil Dead, I was hoping there would be some element of humor or entertainment beyond the norm, but it failed me there.
B00003CX8U|5.0|The DVD I ordered was supposed to &#34;used&#34;. Imagine my surprise when I opened<br />the package to find it sealed and shrink wrapped, looking brand new. It plays<br />beautifully and I am encouraged, one again, to buy from Amazon.
B00ENYKBD0|5.0|I've loved this movie for years and recently watched it again and still just love it.  It's a beautiful, true story that if you haven't seen it, you should watch it once.  It's not an *action-packed* movie, so get ready to just sit back, relax, and enjoy a quality film.
B00DNO3HXC|5.0|I had seen this several years ago and wanted to watch it again but never saw it on tv. It is such a unique story and so well made I just love it. I think Holly Hunter was so expressive with just the looks she had to show her feelings that I didn't need her to speak to understand. I thought Harvey Keitel was so convincing that he loved this woman, I cried. Then with the beautiful music added, it is one of my favorite movies. I actually watched it again the next day. Love it.
B00DU74U74|1.0|The whole voice-over effect (if that is the right thing to call it) really ruined the possibility of enjoying this movie for me. I was excited to get it, but then didn't find any redeeming qualities to speak of.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|He is really into Minecraft and Legos so I figured this would be a great birthday present for him. I'm looking forward to giving it to him!
B00130UFY2|5.0|All of the Bourne movies (with a slight exception regarding the most recent that has a different actor as the lead character and a storyline that doesn't mesh) are awesome!  The Bourne Ultimatum is definitely a great movie!
B00F1OHD3M|5.0|He is really into Minecraft and Legos so I figured this would be a great birthday present for him. I'm looking forward to giving it to him!
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|What else could I have expected but cheesy?  It's enjoyable enough to watch for sure.  You probably will get what you expect to get considering the lead actors involved, whose movies I always watch... Some are better than others and I'm not sorry I watched any of them, including this one.  Just basically predictable and okay.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|He is really into Minecraft and Legos so I figured this would be a great birthday present for him. I'm looking forward to giving it to him!
B000YHG72E|5.0|If you haven't seen Elf, you need to just stop what you are doing and rent or purchase Elf and watch it.  Especially if it is around Christmas because it's a classic and fun Christmas movie.  Very cute.  Very funny.  You need to watch Elf.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|\\"House of Cards\\" is a powerful, entertaining, and well-produced series.<br /><br />I \\"tried it out\\" using our Netflix streaming account. I very much liked the first two shows, but the picture quality just wasn't that great. Then I bought an episode on Amazon Instant View, and that wasn't noticeably better (usually Amazon streaming is the best!). Next I rented it on DVD. Not much, if any, improvement over streaming, and the English subtitles (I like to use when available) were distracting.<br /><br />So a sprung for the Blu-Ray set. The picture is much better, but still not as sharp as I expected--except for the title sequence, which looks like what you would expect with Blu-Ray. I finally decided that the filming was done in a way that doesn't render the usual clarity I've become used to in Blu-Rays of late. Perhaps that's by design? Oh, and the subtitles on Blu-Ray are easy-to-read and not big or distracting.<br /><br />Next comment is about the packaging of the Blu-Ray set. The inner box fits so tightly into the outer on that it's very hard to get out. And, what's worse, is that the individual discs are so tightly contained in their sleeves that, at a minimum, you get finger smudges on the discs (wash your hands first!) and, if you're not careful, you may break a disc on removing it.<br /><br />Despite the comments above, I recommend buying the Blu-Ray set of \\"House of Cards.\\" It is so much more enjoyable to watch that by streaming or DVD. I'm rating it five stars because it is just so good that I can mostly overlook the other issues.<br /><br />I'm writing this review for those of you who are a little persnickety (like me) about the issues I brought up, to save you the time and money of trying out the other formats, so you can just invest in the Blu-Ray set and be done with it!<br /><br />PS - I grew up near Gaffney, SC, so can really appreciate this story line, especially as it relates to the main character's home district. Love that Peachoid!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I thought this was the best of the iron man movies in terms of action and stuff actually happening. I recommend it to the other geeks like me...
0385349947|5.0|I listened to the audio version and then ended up buying the print version as a gift. I enjoyed Sheryl's perspective and leadership insights. Worth reading. There are a few points that are geared towards women with small children but for the most part there are learnings for most women in the workforce.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|I've just always loved all of the Bourne books and movies, so there's not much more to say than that.  If you like relatively intelligent action flicks you should watch all of the Bourne movies.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've really gotten a lot out of this book. What he does is present info that's easily digestible and directly actionable. I actually got the book to tweak my current workout routine (and I did get that info from the book), but I unexpectedly got the most benefit from the chapters on nutrition. I discovered I'd previously really been crippling my gains by under eating. I've increased my intake to what he's suggested and I'm already noticing a difference. Oh, and I sent him a question via email and he got back to me right away. Was pretty impressed by that. Helpful dude. Buy the book.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|If you are curious at all, this is one of those movies you just definitely have to have watched at least once. It's definitely, definitely worth it to watch this movie.  It's funny.  Watch it from beginning to end....
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|The acting in this movie was really great.  They both deserved an award for this movie.  Movie not what I expected though.  Was hoping for a lot more music in this movie and sorry to say so little.  The ending was just what you expected from him.
B0060D16VI|5.0|I basically just love everything about this movie. It's a great movie for children and adults alike.  The art is lovely, the characters are entertaining/pleasant to watch, and the story line is fun.  If you can get over the idea of a rat touching food being incredibly disgusting, then give it a try!
B003TTKB5I|5.0|This is a great series.  The show has you  on the edge of your set. Hope everyone checks it out
B0053O89KG|5.0|What can you say about Castle?  To watch him is to love him.  Getting the 5th season soon. Do have a little trouble viewing it on my computer, never had problems with other TV shows.  May be my computer but just saying.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Mr King has done it again. Captured me and for the hours not reading it, I was wishing I was...
B009D0LBRO|1.0|I paid for this app yet there are ads? What? !  Why are there ads in an app that I paid for?  Zero stars until ads are removed.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!  It was so visual from beginning to end when I finished I felt like I had seen it at the movies.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was written so differently than most books i have read. At first it was confusing to me until I realized what was going on.  I got hooked and could not put it down.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The cast of this series mesh so well together! I'm so glad we started watching this. Season six was priced very well through Amazon.
B00EL8I8IS|1.0|Holy bejeezus is this a spectacularly bad film. I don't even know where to begin. My wife and I just sat there in comically stunned disbelief at the end of the film. Horrible in every way a movie can be.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|You should read this book!!!!It is a very good book!!!!!!!!!I love this movie too!It is very good movie as well!!!!!!!!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This was a Christmas gift from my husband. He loves to shop Amazon to avoid the crowds and get exactly what I want. We used the wish list on this website to help with our gift giving. It is so nice and much less stressful than fighting the crowds.

1451608659|5.0|This was a great &#34;read&#34;, but it was a real eye-opener as to the life of what young athletes endure.
0062202081|5.0|I love it! The condition it's in is amazing. It seems brand new. I would recommend this to any fans or beliebers.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for one of my children. He absolutely LOVES it. The blue ray makes the quality great
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider is fast and fun to play.  The Replay option allows the player to improve scores and aim higher and higher.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Here's another bootleg record shows that Dylan's rejects are better than most other's hits.  I got the CD only due to reviews.of the DVD and the cost.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My little guy that I babysit loves this game. Loves, Loves, Loves it.  Keeps him busy for hours and keeps him away from the TV which in my opinion, is ridiculous for kids these days.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I got tho for free. I love it to pass time. there are free veriobs and each flip pix games are different. my 8 yr old loves it too
B000FBJF7I|5.0|I love Alexander McCall Smith's writing.  His characters are gentle and considerate, the culture of Botswana is well portrayed, and there is a gentle humor throughout.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game and makes u think. Good to play when you want the time to pass quickly. Fun to play
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I was not particularly excited by this book - it was ok as a fantastic story, but reading any great truths into was beyond my appreciation of it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this gave and don't listen to the ppl that say it is a bad cause its one of the best games ever
B000VSAEYI|5.0|For the price, you cant beat it.  I set this up a couple of times over the summer.  It survived kids running and jumping into it.  The slide is pretty worthless put the kids dont mind and still have fun with it.  The blow up toys that come with it were a hit too.  All in all a great buy.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game! It's such a fun game and the video that goes with it is pretty funny. You have to get this game!
1250027624|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and this book provided extra details and &#34;inside&#34; information that helped my understanding of the times and characters.  It added a lot of depth.
1619691884|4.0|Hitchens emphasizes writing as if it's told to you personally. He succeeds here, and so does Simon Prebble on this audio rendition. Despite 347 previous reviews, nobody has mentioned Simon Prebble's audiobook version, so I wanted to give credit to him as well as Hitchens, Grayson Carter (the Vanity Fair editor who offers the introduction) and to Carol Blue, the author's widow, who reads her afterword as the \\"last word,\\" fittingly and with dignity. I liked Prebble's delivery of Orwell's \\"1984\\" when I heard it last year: he captured not only Winston Smith's torment but O'Brien's power unforgettably. He made that familiar classic new, and similarly, with \\"Mortality,\\" it's as if Prebble channels Christopher Hitchens' combination of affable hesitation as he crafts his perfectly chosen phrases and firm conviction as he stares back at the Grim Reaper.<br /><br />Prebble's British tones, engaging yet erudite, fit Hitchens' persona precisely. I admit never having heard Hitch speak aloud except once, maybe 15-20 years ago when he tried to host a cable-tv show starring himself as the on-air pundit. He looked as embarrassed as he sounded, although I reckon this was an uncommon sight for one so eager and experienced in holding his own in print and in public. His wife ruefully alludes to his habit of eight-hour dinners at their home where he'd hold forth in typical fashion.<br /><br />Again typically, the chapters here, while inevitably suffering from the veracity of the titular topic by remaining those of an unfinished collection, represent Hitchens holding forth on cancer etiquette, of the regression to childlike responses, the poignantly lost sense of speech, and above all, his delight in weighing in on himself as a wired-in experiment that updates Pascal's Wager. Hard to sum up, but he loves finding himself the target of so much prayer and so much venom by true believers, one must admit. I can't think of a stance assumed in any other book I've read: the voice now beyond the grave telling us all what it's like in the home stretch, either the uphill battle or downhill slide.<br /><br />The fact it ends without proper resolution boosts its verisimilitude. Still, with Carter and Blue's testimonials appended to Prebble's masterful recital, it's only two hours, and barely over a hundred pages however generously provided. One cannot fault Hitchens, of course, but the cost of these columns and tributes does seem to not demand the price asked for, compared to Hitchens' memoir or collected essays, for instance. Yet it's telling that I want to read both of these (I've long followed his book reviews in The Atlantic and reviewed as did thousands \\"god Is Not Great\\" and fewer perhaps \\"Letters to a Young Contrarian\\") now, having appreciated once more the delight of Hitchens' persuasion.rave telling us all what it's like in the home stretch, either the uphill battle or downhill slide.<br /><br />The fact it ends without proper resolution boosts its verisimilitude.

1250006341|5.0|Loved each and every page.  The photographs are breathtaking and the text was enlightening.  Love, love, love!!  Highly recommend to fans of Downton Abbey.  Looking forward to another one!
B00E9P957Q|5.0|I bought this collection reluctantly because most of these seemed o.k. to me in the last remastered form; however, the definition and clarity of Presto in this set is striking; Counterparts has noticeably better separation, and Vapor Trails Remixed makes this collection an unbelievable bargain.<br /><br />Vapor Trails as originally released suffered from a lousy mix/production which only hinted at the terrific songs buried in the loud murky wall of noise. [Unfortunately Rush has 3 albums - IMHO - which as originally released have objectionable -muddy- sound: Signals, Vapor Trails, and Clockwork Angels.  The worst was, of course, VT because it sounded like jet engines were in the recording room eliminating the dynamics within each song.]<br /><br />Thankfully, Vapor Trails is now available with a significantly better remix.  It's the difference between VHS video and  Blu-ray.<br /><br />My only problem with this set is that while the remasters are all better, the artwork is not reproduced faithfully;  e.g. Feedback loses it's gatefold and notes, Snakes and Arrows loses it's gatefold, none of the photographic foldouts are included, and information regarding the technical details about the remastered versions are not to be found in this box set.  The booklet is strictly the lyrics.  Each album is simply a reproduction of the front and back covers.<br /><br />Bottom line is the packaging docks a full 5 star rating to 4 1/2.
B000O5B4C4|1.0|Even though it's the correct region, and even though it's a brand new disc, and even though my blu-ray player's firmware is 100% up to date, this blu-ray disc will not play.  Huge waste of money just for the case and artwork; I want to see the film.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm worried that young women of this generation will find &#34;it OK&#34; to be a sub, when it's totally &#34;not OK&#34; I fought long and hard for women's rights from the 1970's to present. My generation where sub's not by choice but by men who demanded it to be so in the home and work place. I thought we had moved on from the uglyness of female submission, I guess not.<br />I really enjoyed the good parts of their relationship in this book but too much energy was spent in getting there and the book really became boring at times.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Fun game.  This game is great if you love search games  I wish it was longer.<br />I would definately get the sequel.,
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Game is a lot of fun.  Very addictive as I have a hard time putting it down.  Great way to take a break.
B0047T86G0|1.0|The OED is already the default dictionary for the Kindl ap, and the ebook will not download to my Ipad, so why spend so much? I am waiting to see if Amazon will remedy this $60 rip off.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|With this app, if you leave your Kindle Fire on overnight, it will get very hot. So hot, that I don't intend to use the app ever again. Scary.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|As a teenager I have enjoyed this book.  The view point of 3 characters adds detention to the story.  Excellent novel to get lost in your own world.  Lives up to the series.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I purchased this for my Acer iconia.  For this device the wireless connection in my home office was spotty although great everywhere in the house.  I purchased this to connect to a static ip I have in my home office and it has resolved the problem.

B008K6HN8I|4.0|ES Mobile gives me a quick and easy method for viewing all files on my Kindle Fire HD. I would recommend it to anyone.
0399255370|5.0|From the first page I cried laughing. This book is so funny that it's a shame. All of the children in my daughter's class laughed at this book while we were reading it. I can't believe that anyone would give it less than 4 stars. Lighten up people. If crayons had feelings they probably would feel this way.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is amazing! FYI it has in the settings it has a option to turn off the flying one if it doesn't work on your system. My kindle Fire did not work and I discovered it. It was a great choice to get it. I wont regret it  at all!!!!!!!!
0061655554|4.0|Dollars and egos make for interesting history in this book.  A bit difficult to keep up with the cast of characters but very entertaining.
0385528787|5.0|If you haven't read Oryx and Crake or The Year of the Flood, you should do so before reading this book, or this little review, as it may contain spoilers.<br /><br />A small group of humans and \\"Crakers\\", genetically modified humanoid beings created by Crake, have survived the devastating plague that has wiped out much of humanity. This book picks up right where The Year of the Flood left off and deftly weaves together the stories from those two books into one cohesive, fascinating whole.<br /><br />I didn't read Oryx and Crake when it first came out; I actually only read it because I got The Year of the Flood as a review copy. But I've been entranced throughout by the way that Atwood has constructed this particular post-apocalyptic world. I admired the world-building in the first book and the characterization of the second; MaddAddam combines these two aspects. These few remaining people are creating a new reality and new myths to support that reality. The past is important, but which elements of the past get remembered? It's a key question in this novel as we watch what the characters to do to pass on those myths to future generations.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend all three of these books; I actually suspect they'd be best read together in one go, which I didn't manage to do. But however you read them, make sure you don't miss this excellent trilogy.
1451695195|1.0|This book would be interesting if one had been through a NDE.  Otherwise, it seems like one of my son's Anime books.
B0012GMWCU|4.0|Loved this collection of Willie's classic songs. Willie has been a favorite of mine for a long time. My only wish is that the accompanying musicians were listed.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Time goes by very fast when doing these puzzles.  You think you have all the boxes filled in right<br /> then you enter and no you are so wrong.<br />Hope they keep making these for us to find and do.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|this is such a great game.  I have been waiting for them to introduce more levels.  it would be worth buying.  you really have to think and explore.  better have a pen handy to keep notes because you will have to refer to colds and numbers else where.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I almost didn't read this book because of its description. I'm not a fan of murderous children, so to speak, but I'd heard good things about it so I tried it. From beginning to end, it's keeps you craving more. The characters are likable and, more importantly, believable. I've read this book more times than I can count, along with its successors, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. The Hunger Games will make you rethink almost everything in your life, the history of everything and, more importantly, the future of everything. This book moved me more than any book has in years. It's enrapturing, powerful, witty, and romantic without being disingenuous. In case you can't tell, I adore this book. And I recommend it to everyone that can read.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|so far I am only a couple levels into it but I am having fun.  I like these kind of games where you have to think vs. games where you race through levels jumping.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This story got me interested right away, and had me speculating along with Cecelia about what her husband's secret could possibly be. When she does find out, the moral dilemma begins for her. This is also the story of Rachel and Tess, whose lives are intertwined with Cecelia's, and who are facing their own inner turmoil and moral dilemmas. A fascinating study of complicated relationships between friends and relatives that had me turning the pages. The epilogue was revealing and thought provoking.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great show for the family to watch together. Or to watch alone. Definitely, check it out. Season three is off to a great start.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like the app overall, trust me, but it crashed mid-game, and now I can't turn it back on. It sucks, too cause I really like to play this game!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable fictional version of very true historical events. Educational regarding historical events, educational regarding human reactions and responses to situations in all stations of life.

B006BFK5DK|5.0|This album is an absolute MUST buy. No too often rehashed classics. This is a no skip cd and I have enjoyed every second of it. Good spread between upbeat and relaxing tunes. If you buy it, you will not regret it that is a guarantee.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig probably best James Bond ever. If you're into James Bond this is a must have. Really good movie.
0061950726|5.0|Interesting topic, seemed well-researched, and is an area of my own professional focus.  Plus, I grew up in Bangor, Maine, and identified with the coast and the setting.  Would rate this the best of Christina Baker Kline's novels, but feel all her books are well-written.  Thank you!
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|love the music, she can sing anything the cd was outstanding for her first country album. Hope she goes back to r n r thoshe has an amazing voice.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|5 Stars is not enough.  Amazon mp3 purchases are the way to go.  On your device or in the cloud.  Great pricing.
1781162646|5.0|This book reminds me of his earlier books.  It is a lot of fun.  I would highly recommend it for anyone.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this game - very fun and addictive!  I love the sound effects, graphics, and simplicity.  Entertaining and my go to game when I need to pass some time.
B000002L61|5.0|It was in great shape and I love the music, play it all the time. And what a great price on this item.
1609611543|5.0|I checked this book out at my local library 5 times and decided it was time to purchase my own copy. I've shared this amazingly eye opening book with several friends and even strangers on occasion. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn facts about the wheat we consume and the dangers it poses in our lives. I love knowing that I can go without consuming wheat, which before reading this book I didn't see how that could be possible. Even my children's wheat consumption has decreased. Their lunch boxes are nearly wheat free and they don't seem to notice. I thought this would be the most difficult area, but that wasn't the case.
B000002KET|5.0|It was in great shape and I love the music, play it all the time. And what a great price on this item.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|This is definitely more of an adult artsy version than the original. Good adaptation though. Great visual effects. Mila Kunis stole the show...
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|It was in great shape and I love the music, play it all the time. And what a great price on this item.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was on a roller coaster of feelings of sadness, hope, joy, adventure and inward fear. Definitely a work to be remembered.!
B001EOOQEM|5.0|It was in great shape and I love the music, play it all the time. And what a great price on this item.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|&#34;What is this shit,&#34; someone said many years ago, but not for me<br />this reissue has something magical in his notes in his music,<br />I think the next volume 11 already and I think it is time that the Nobel prize<br />for literature can one day be his.<br />(Charlie Buckaroo)
B001AUKUTU|5.0|It was in great shape and I love the music, play it all the time. And what a great price on this item.

B000O78KW4|5.0|this is a great movie i could watch this movie every day i really love it thank you so much
B00911UQAS|4.0|Wonderful build, Went togeather really well and had a blast doing it. The only parts i had trouble in the build was the feet prongs/claws. The rest was like building a dream, was great building the leg with actual pistons inside and out, the cockpit, was fun. I never had much luck model painting so i left it its basic gray with no camo. After i was finished i brewed up some hot Tea (Came in the shipping box with the model, compliments in the package from wonderful Asians) and just marveled.
B000M4RG42|5.0|this is a great movie i could eatch this movie every day i really love it thank you so much
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The changing boards and three star ratings for each board add a challange to the game. I do wish there was an option to chose what boards you play.
1401937519|5.0|This woman has a body loaded with tumors, goes into coma, visits &#34;Heaven&#34; and finds out why she has cancer. She realizes the way to be healed and returns and her cancer disappears.  She learned a lot about &#34;life&#34; in Heaven and explains it.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The show is great comedy.  It is one of the few things that actually makes me laugh.<br />The shows have a calming effect on me.<br />I guess being an electrical engineer may have something to do with it.
B000FC13E0|5.0|Yet another masterpiece, dangerous - I virtually \\"swallowed\\" the book within 24 hours. Intelligent, new topic, reading the book is like watching one of the best thrillers on TV. Don't miss this book
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Very good read.  Bit dark in places but otherwise enjoyable.  I would highly recommend this book if you enjoyed Gone Girl.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|Great album!! John Legend has done it again. Well worth the wait. I recommend this album to all fans of r&b and neosoul.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|As always with Fire Maple a great game.  Far too short for even a 0.99 price though.  I completed the game in about a half hour.  Graphics spectacular as always.  F.M -- I would rather pay more and have a longer game than feel shortchanged.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Exactly as described and received earlier than expected.
0307276902|5.0|This was an incredible book, very breathtaking. I have known about it for a while, heard about all the controversy concerning the authors embellishments and how The Smoking Gun called him out about stretching the facts and for real I had no intentions of ever reading it. It didn't seem to be my cup of tea, a little too mainstream for my tastes, but how wrong I was. I am an Alcoholic and a Drug Addict and a Criminal, for me this refrain in the book really holds true. I am at the end of a 25 year mandatory minimum sentence for a first-time nonviolent drug offense and I must say this book was very impactful. I laughed with James Frey, I cried with James Frey, I hated with James Frey and I loved with James Frey. His self-analysis and story made me look deep inside myself and confront my own fury that has been with me forever. By reading this book I have gained true insight into myself and why I am the way I am. And the thing is if I didn't recently go to the hole or solitary confinement as people might call it in the world, I never would have read this book. Snatched off the compound and put in the hole I was angry and distraught at finding myself in this situation and lo and behold I find this book. If not out of complete and utter boredom (and it being the only book I had) I would have never read it, but after reading it I can honestly say it's been a life changing event. Thank you James Frey, keep writing, keep embellishing if that is what it takes, because it the story that counts. No one ever called Hunter S. Thompson on his facts and he is one of the most celebrated writers ever. I think The Smoking Gun needs to lighten up. Incredible story by a great author. This book is a classic.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Exactly as described and received earlier than expected.
039334505X|5.0|Irvine Welsh is one of my favorite authors and his latest novel is definitely a page turner. Skagboys goes back in time and is actually the prequel to Welsh's most infamous writing, Trainspotting. The whole Trainspotting crew is revisited in their earlier years and we see how they became junkies and how smack hit Scotland hard right as AIDS came on the scene and sharing needles became risky. All the characters like Begbie, Rents, Sick Boy and the others are portrayed and more history on their relationships and how they grew up are given. The book is written in Irvine Welsh classic style and flows like a juxtaposition between Hunter S. Thompson and Black Flag. I look forward to more work from Irvine Welsh and he continues to be one of my favorite authors. Seth Ferranti, author of Prison Stories and Gorilla Conivct: The Prison Writings of Seth Ferranti, gorillaconvict.com
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. I can't believe this woman's determination to walk this trail. In fact, I wasn't even aware of the PCT. A book like this only comes along once in a while and this one is worth your time to read it. Whether you're lost, or a friend, or family member or if you just want to read about the true grit, camaraderie and spunk....this book is for you!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved everything about this book. I felt like Vivian could have been my mother, or sister, or aunt. She captured my heart and kept me wanting to know more about her life.  And Molly learned so much about herself through their friendship. Excellent Read!
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|Someone forgot to tell me that the quests don't last . I've played the game for two days and I'm out of quests . Lovely &gt;_&gt;
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I simply couldn't put it down! Mr. Mattel has a brilliant imagination, and a seemingly wide knowledge about animals and the sea. His writing is perfection, so beautifully descriptive, his characters so vivid that it's hard to believe that it is fiction. This is certainly in my top ten favorite books!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun. To play first time I played i would not stop u should get  this app so much fun,
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love breeding and hatching new awesome dragons! Its a must have app!<br />My whole family loves Dragon Story! This app never gives us any pop ups or bugs either!
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|I love Gossip Girl & was so excited to receive this to complete my collection! It was delivered super fast & in excellent brand new condition
B00F91G5BS|4.0|I watched \\"World War Z\\" on Amazon Instant video. And I have to say it was better then I thought it would be. All though it didn't have all the blood and gore that you would expected in a zombie movie, it still had parts that where intense. Even the sounds of the zombies that where used, made it feel creepy. I think I like the fast moving zombies, over the slow ones. There's is no way to escape a fast moving mob of the undead. It would be like trying to run from Bull Dog ants, which are extremely aggressive and shows little fear of human beings. I haven't read all of the book yet, just the beginning. And what I've read, they sure went a different way with the story. I guess I'll have to get the book on my Kindle and finish it. So on a scale of 1 thru 10 I'll give \\"World War Z\\" a 7 for its action and its intensity.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Me and  my dad play its really fun he have fun it's  like real minecraft it's the best ever for on long road trips
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awesomeness game<br />It is one of the best game I ever played<br />I can chat and even voice chat<br />Again I say awesome
B00526ZKYS|2.0|I have to say, I was rather... disappointed by this book. I'm usually a very tolerant reader and steadily read a book until I finish it, but for Delirium, I kept feeling like I was somehow wasting my time. Maybe I just set my expectations a bit too high, but after hearing about all the \\"Lauren Oliver was clearly born to write!\\" and the \\"Delirium is at the top of all dystopian novels\\", it just didn't provide for me the usual satisfaction I get after I read something.<br /><br />Delirium is about a futuristic dystopian world where love is considered a dangerous disease. To rid the mind of affection and love, everyone, upon reaching their 16th birthday, must undergo a brain procedure known as \\"the cure\\". They will then be paired with a spouse chosen by the government. Lena Haloway is an outcast because of this procedure. Her mother illegally kept the ability to love within herself, and chose to jump off a cliff instead of letting scientists take away that gift. Feeling like her actions would compensate for her mother's disgraceful act, Lena cannot wait for her procedure to arrive. But that was before she did the unacceptable: she fell in love. Now she must decide: will she live the rest of her life in a unloving oblivion? Or will she run?<br /><br />First of all, the world Oliver has set up is... relatively believable, at the least. But how it progresses from there is just simply uninteresting. The story is un-fast paced, and all the characters seem to be made with the same material. Some seem like they're supposed to be rebellious and others aren't, but instead they all seem... plain. Lena and Alex (the male protagonist) are about as interesting as a rock. (And about as sensible, too.)<br /><br />Additionally, this book is simply extremely depressing. No, it's not sad, it's depressing. Sad is when your favorite character in a book dies, leaving you touched and teary. Depressed is when it brings down your mood, leaving you cranky. Delirium left me cranky.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't waste your time. If you're a fan of dystopia, I suggest trying Divergent by Veronica Roth. Frankly, Lauren Oliver is not really such a bad writer.  Her children novels are quite delightful and enjoyable, but for me, this young adult concoction just didn't cut it.ttom line: Don't waste your time.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|My five year old loves this game. I have played it a few times myself and it kelp my interest.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I popped Cher's new CD \\"Closer to the Truth\\" into my changer.  Three spins later I pried it out to listen to the new Elton John!  The music was addictive!  \\"Woman's World\\" explodes out of the speakers with a driving beat and that boxing match of a chorus that punches back fiercely, \\"Turn up, busted, taken apart, I've been down, left with a broken heart, but I'm stronger.\\"  This is followed by the sleek \\"Take It Like a Man\\" with Cher's voice pulsing through electronic filters as she throws down the romantic gauntlet, \\"Boy if you want my heart, you got to take it like a man.\\"  Recorded in London, \\"Dressed to Kill\\" pumps magically as Cher's voice pulses with emotion, \\"Another lover struggles, but it's all in vain, You'll wear the scars, the lipstick stains you can't even see.\\"  \\"Red\\" is another standout with a driving up-tempo track and Cher's voice soaring on the chorus and nailing the excellent lyric, \\"Sirens thru my head, everything you said, Floating, lost at sea, The sharks around our bed.\\"  I also really love \\"Favorite Scars\\" with Cher's voice filled with emotion as she lists a series of love metaphors & similies, \\"Love covers you up in a landslide, Love pulls you under like a riptide, Love's when you crash trying to hang glide.\\"  Cher slows the tempo a tad on \\"My Love\\" & \\"I Hope You Find It,\\" but mostly this set rips and rocks.  It's breathtakingly good!  Brava!
B001E45XT4|4.0|Going off to college I needed some headphones that could cut down on noise, had a good mic, good sounds quality, and yet were in a price range that was something I could afford.<br /><br />These fit the bill.  My only complaint is that they feel to have been designed for smaller heads because no matter how I adjust their is always pressure on the bottom of the speakers, around my jaw.  After a while you don't notice it, but it can be a turn off for some.
B008Y212PI|4.0|interesting way to keep you on your toes. Makes you think in a creative Sudoku-like puzzle that's aesthetic and a lot of fun.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This was a &#34;must have&#34; for me because I am now a die-hard fan.  The series is a pleasure for me because it is hard to find things to watch that are not full of foul language and extreme violence.
1476734941|5.0|Originally I had read a review that the book was a waste of time so I didn't buy it.  However, after watching the PBS documentary I decided to buy it anyway.  I'm finding it very interesting and if I'm struggling with my fast day, I pick up the book and do some reading.  I'm just really finding it interesting.
0143122916|5.0|It was a hard book to read because of the facts.  What a terrible secret North Korea has kept for so long.  &#34;Escape from Camp 14&#34; was amazing and showed how little I knew about the Koreas.<br />Would recommend that everyone read - knowledge is power.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Enjoy this game! I wish that I could pass more levels without help from other friends as I am about to surpass my friends. Thank you for making it available for free on my Kindle Fire HD.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie was great for me. I have watch it so many times I had to order<br />another one , I'm not kidding . but that just me .
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This app has been a joy to quickly find out what is goin  on in the world of my interests.  The different layout options allow for customization an  simplicity to see what you want when you want.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Star trekie from way back. Good to see a actio packed, old fashion movie.  Great casting for the roles.  No one can replace the first cast,  but this is close.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When my friend said that I should read this book I really wasn't sure . After I read it I cried so hard because it  put a lot of things in perspective for me.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|One of the better movies in recent years especially for a sequel. Good acting by a great cast and a good script. The soundtrack is also quite good.
055358202X|4.0|I am engrossed in this series, and had I written reviews for the previous 3 books I would have given each 5 stars.  A Feast For Crows (book 4) does not have the tempo of its predecessors.  However, there is much to be learned and gained from reading this book, and I disagree strongly with reviews that suggest skipping this book entirely.  What is lacking in shock and awe is present in rich character development.  Yes, much of the book is dedicated to Cersei, Jaime and Brienne.  And through their eyes and minds we learn their motivations and relations to circumstances and other characters we have come to know so well (and yes, miss, in this book).  AFFC has allowed me to rally harder for the characters I like, and at least come to understand the characters I dislike.<br /><br />At the end of the book, the author himself notes \\"This one was a b****.\\"  My appreciation for the characters of Westeros and lands beyond is richer for AFFC.  Just think of it as the somewhat level part of the roller coaster...it can't all be breathtaking corkscrews and descents!
0061122416|4.0|When I was a child I was hooked on the Grimm Brothers fairy tales. When I read these tales I was transported to a land that was buried deep in the recesses of my soul and I felt like I was coming home to where I belonged. I felt very much the same when I read The Alchemist. It is a grand fairy tale that will appeal to our inner child. The Alchemist does not need to be a high literary work. Actually if it were that kind of book it would detract from its childlike simplicty.<br /><br />One of the criticisms leveled at The Alchemist is that it advocates materialism but I disagree with this. If the characters pursue materialism that does not mean that the book's theme is one of praising materialism. One has to dig deeper into the story and analyze the spiritual impact that the pursuit of materialism has on the characters. This kind of analysis is very personal and I can't dictate to the readers what their conclusion should be.<br /><br />When I read the Alchemist I felt a liberty from the minutae of everyday life and a desire to pursue a higher calling. I'm glad I read it.<br /><br />Nissim Levy, author of [[ASIN:B00EN6ECFG Shards Of Divinities]]
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A wonderfully sad story. Couldn't put the book down. Cannot wait to see the movie; especially how they plan to end the movie.
1451695195|5.0|I have never read a better, more understandable experience of spirituality than this story. It truly made me feel like I have a better understanding of what I have tried to formulate in my mind. I absolutely loved it, recommend it, and plan to read it again and again!
0194325385|5.0|Do not hesite about buying this amazing book. It is very didatic, what makes this book very useful for english students!
0345803485|1.0|This book made women look like idiots, I really did  not like that, even for fiction.  Definitely not a &#34;Sidney Sheldon&#34; novel!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so great I can't stop playing it.  me and my friend. deep on trying to beat the game that's what makes it so much fun it is endless game
B00006AFF5|5.0|My 6 yr old gndson loves everything Christmas & sings/hums Jingle Bells till we want to scream.  When we read this story & I told him there's a movie of it he just had to have it. I came quickly & is in great condition. Kurtis already watched it & loved it. I'm sure he'll watch it again & again before Christmas.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game lots of fun. I loved playing it. I've seen both the movies and this game incorporates it all. I do it when i'm board and have nothing to do. You don't have to wait for things to get done  like other game. Cute costumes for the minion to run in as well.
B000SXOI66|5.0|What can I say about one of the all-time great albums not only of the '70s, but from any other decade :) I haven't heard it mentioned much, if at all, in other reviews, but groups like Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones were smart to use female backing vocalist on their songs. What would the songs \\"Brain Damage/Eclipse\\" and the Rolling Stones' \\"Gimme Shelter\\" be without the women singing in the background? Perhaps still great, but much different :) Besides the other great albums I have from the '70s on CD (What's Going On, Super Fly and Songs In The Key of Life), I like to listen to this album also because they all contain great singing and songwriting.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|The story line was good as well as the graphics.  Loved searching for the different objects.  Children of all ages would enjoy this app.  Of course, their eyes are better than mine and it wouldn't take them a half hour to find some of them. Truly enjoyable!!!  I did say any age,however, I should have said age 12 and above.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|Thoroughly brilliant, from the package design of the CD and case, to the liner notes and pictures, to the wonderful music. The mix of styles in the music represent Doctor Who really well, and Murray Gold's little commentary on each song in the liner notes offers really interesting insight. Part of the reason the soundtrack is so good is because he himself is a passionate fan of the show! Many of the songs can bring about the same emotions as when you watch the show, because you can picture so clearly the scenes in which the songs were used. Especially &#34;Doomsday.&#34; That episode and the accompanying song are an absolute tear-fest!! Very much worth it, however. Would highly recommend this CD to any fan of the newer Doctor Who series, especially Russel T. Davies-era.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A true story of valor & human kindness in the face of the most horrific war in the history of our small planet - WW2
B0087JTAKW|4.0|as for the title of my review, i am an atheist and it did make me wonder but the other side of things. .lol. it did not 'convert me' to be a believer but did make me 'huh' many times.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Sparks always delivers with well developed characters and a great story plot.  So very well written. Makes me want to see the  movie now.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Spoiler Alert....... From an unhappy reader.<br /><br />WTF - this book was terribly unrealistic which I never say cause (eye roll) I like books about vampires .lol. But this was just .... I don't know.<br /><br />The teenagers vocabulary was beyond any normal college graduate. I started off googling the words - always looking to broaden my horizons :*} but it just got to the point that I just assumed what it ment and pretty much skipped over it all.<br /><br />I did like the characters but the way they spoke was just to far fetched. I know poetic ppl are dramatic when they want to make a statement but this was just to a point of being silly , a lot of eye rolls & line skipping.<br /><br />Here's the SPOILER -<br /><br />The book is about two teens feeling disappointed by the ending of a book they both loved - leaving many many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Well when I got to the end of this book I was terribly pissed that that is the same damn thing this book did - it stopped. there was no closure.<br /><br />It never told us how much longer the main girl lived to be. It simply stopped after the boy died. Well I liked her too so I wanted (still want) to know her story till HER ending.<br /><br />But fear not author .lol. I will not write you many letters or email you with my questions. But what I will do is NEVER read one of your books again.
B008602KQI|2.0|not my cup of tea....TOO DARK and HOPELESS!!!! Where is God in all of this???  Everything we live for, plan for, and HOPE for is empty without the promise of a SAVIOR!  That is what we can look forward to without Him!
B004V9MU86|4.0|This book took me completely by surprise, so different to anything I have previously read.  Disturbing at times, but compelling reading.  Could not put it down.  Was mesmerised, had to read to the very end.  And the Narrator's note was coup de tas.  I have to read more by this Author.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|...but the rest of the book was quite predictable. It is a fun and entertaining book, a page-turner, with engaging characters. Quick, easy read. I give it a B-.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Loved this game on Facebook.  It's just as fun on my kindle, but was disappointed when I uninstalled for awhile that I lost all my progress.  Otherwise is a great game.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Found her on Youtube. After listening to several of her songs over a couple months, and even getting a few friends to listen to her, I bought her album. Listen to it weekly. It's uplifting and makes me feel better on those long days at work.<br /><br />  I can't wait for her next album. The end.
B00DKY4LBW|4.0|I kinda wanted it to blow beyond my expectation but it didn't. It's not a disappointment tho, Arctic Monkeys is still my favourite band. This is just not my favourite album from them.
193355021X|5.0|A concise and logical explanation of the current economic condition of our nation and the world. Though the book was writen decades ago, the lesson is still true.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved it!  What a ride......twist and turns ! The writing is good....the author really gets into the psyche of the characters. If you liked Gone Girl , which I did then you will like this one too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its so awsome but please have new update and check out youtube [...] but still good game cause the pigs and sheep and cows
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Been a fan of these guys since the first album. The Dio era was good,but nothing can compare to the original lineup. Allways felt that they should have changed their name after Ozzy departed.Anyways, Rick Rubin deserves to be commended. This cd is Sabbath's masterpiece. All the tracks are great. Yes,no Bill Ward,I know. But this cd is soooo awesome that it makes me say,who cares? And to think,that when they were recording this album Iommi was and still is being treated for a life threatening illness! The man is a god. I saw Sabbath live several times;the sabbath bloody sabbath tour,technical extasy,never say die,and even the first renuion tour in 1999. I just saw them this past august in nj and they sounded better than they ever did.Geezer and Iommi were incredible.The tour drummer,who's playing gave the sabs an extra heavy edge,was awesome. But thing that I was most impressed with was Ozzy's voice.It was not the voice of a guy on in years. It was not the voice of a guy who has done a lot of unhealthy living. His voice was powerful and commanding. Anyway,if you don't own this cd yet and you're a fan,GET IT NOW! You won't be sorry.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book was too much like the first edition, the turn in their relationship was foreseen and the relationship with his past was without question. The ending the book was predictable.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Great to see a new Joss Whedon TV series.  Now he'll get to play in the Marvel Universe which opens up all kinds of potential for interesting stories.  Looks like a good cast (nice to see Ron Glass again!) and the dialog is fun.  I'm looking forward to watching this series.
034580404X|5.0|Loved it!!! Reading all the books over again. It was an amazing story. I'm sad its all over for me.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Amazing concept for a book. Great twists and turns kept me interested all through this book. Highly recommend it to all.
0060555661|4.0|Excellent and insightful commentary.  Good and relevant perspective.  Useful addition to my reference library.  Timeless comments on the emotional framework required and necessary for both successful investing and trading.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I put this book on my Ipad because it's been one of my favorite books for many years.  Well written, a delightfully surprise ending, challenges and drama within a believable set of childhood experiences.  Engaging characters, especially Ender.  Fascinating story and just a lot of fun to read.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I loved the movie.  Great action, emotion and tense scenes.<br />I bought the combo pack as family members have Blu-ray too.<br />Since I'm one of the few people left in the world who has not bought a Blu-ray player yet, I wish the DVD copy would show me the extra features instead of only allowing the owners of Blu-ray.<br />So the movie is a five, the purchase is a four.
B005LAIIGW|1.0|Gravity is hollow. Beautiful, but hollow. A $100 million dollar film with a shell of a story, Gravity begins in media res with three astronauts orbiting a small satellite of sorts, making small talk, and repairing a broken component part. After say ten minutes, some space debris sends the astronauts, at least one, whirling end over end into the abyss. The camera goes with them, topsy-turvy, spinning and spinning with so much force it'll make you dizzy. And don't expect this to let up. Throughout the film, the camera roams around, in and out of helmets, through debris, and along the heavenly expanse of space. It all looks weirdly fuzzy though, lacking the pristine sheen one might have expected (or seen in a similarly staged film like Sunshine). The film itself is boring. The story, such as it is, is pure survival, with little to no subtext or emotional weight (save a crappy tacked-on backstory about loss that feels about as personal as the gaping suck-hole around it) and probably the worst performance of George Clooney's career. The man has shown an amazing depth in movies like Syriana. Here he plays George Clooney: hammy, reliable and unrelentingly dull. Sandra Bullock is a bit better, but is really only around to hyperventilate and occasionally strip down to her undergarments when the paper-thin script asks her to. Speaking of the script, the film is less a story than it is an amalgam of clunky plot devices: space debris, inexplicable fires, and of course, the threat of losing oxygen. Sure the film feels weightless and the CGI hardly looks fake. But compared to Cuaron's daring, satirical and multi-layered Children of Men, the film feels about as interesting as a space opera drummed up by a third grader. Worth seeing only for nauseating camera-angle enthusiasts and anyone interested in how a lot of money can be used to create a thing of frigid beauty, zero heart, and a lack of lasting impact.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Love the show!  I have followed it since the first episode aired nine years ago, so always look forward to the release of the disc set.  I just wish the blooper reel was longer.
159562015X|4.0|I enjoyed this book and am continuing to learn from it and apply what I have learned. The only drawback was that I purchased a used copy. I was not aware that this book is supplemental to a website and that there is a one use code included in the back of the book. Mine was already used. It was about $10.00 to purchase a new code from the website. The website was also somewhat difficult to navigate once I had the code. Eventually I managed to take the 117 question test and I am quite pleased with the conclusions. It was more of an effort to gain the information I was looking for than I had anticipated but the results were worth it.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|love this angry birds adventure - nothing but fun and challenge....some of the levels are hard to get three stars, still working on trying to earn the three
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoy this whole story. I can usually read books and guess straight away what the end is going to be or what tragedies will befall characters but this book kept me guessing. This storyline would make an awesome tv series with endless possibilities. Thanks for a great read!
B00BESM14U|2.0|Rather boring. Quite slow action. Actors are OK but will certainly not get academy awards at least for this movie
B00448SE4S|1.0|sophomoric - disjoined - video  game parody.  too weird for words.  I would pass on this one.  Can't understand the great ratings!
B009DKFSUA|4.0|What can I say about Pitbull. He is an excellent artist. Had been looking and checking out his other CD's but I really enjoyed this one.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I got the first one it was awsome . I got this one it was to. I really like this app.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved seeing how little Danny's life turned out. Think I will revisit The Shining. Have to read something until SK comes out with another one!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This was a wonderful movie which is what happens to young songwriters and singers and the record companies , but thru it all he just loved to sing and what an awesome singer songwriter he is . I am so glad I bought this movie.
B00ENYKBD0|5.0|Thought provoking and very sensitive representation of mental health and its effects.  Family and social effects with a person in school and work environment
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Much awaited sequel to the first movie a must in everyones collection - crisp movie and packaged well bought extra for a christmas present.
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|How great to hear Paul's first band live! Much different sound quality back in 1976 and very raw and untouched. Great trip down memory lane.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|One for all My Little Pony fans to buy was bought for a 11th day present and has been played many times.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|very good read  the story seems to mesh with what her expressioon in the painting tells me. very ambigous expression on her face matches rhe events in the book
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Wow! Just wow!  I have just finished this book and I have no words to adequately describe it.  This story is simply brilliant.  I am amazed at how intricate a web Nalini Singh weaves.  I am a big fan of the psy-changeling series.  I am used to the changeling side of the story and love it. This psy side wakes me up to a whole new way of reading.  The series in itself is amazing.  The thought process is astounding. To come up with a story line so inventive, so different, so distinguishing is beyond me.<br /><br />Kaleb and Sahara's story is breathtaking.  Their strength and love is enough to guide them through their personal tragedies and lead them into a new era. This is a must read!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Glad I rented it! It was really good! Want to watch it again. Fast moving ! I didnt figure it out till the very end.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Each level seems to be A fresh change of pace, includes aspects of many other games ,but does not get bogged down in any one type of puzzle or search. Constantly<br />varying types of play keeps the game fresh and interesting.
B008Y212PI|4.0|good game. for keeping your brain. thinking.  great way to engage. your kids or self in logical thinking. while playing a game.
B004HD61KE|2.0|I don't appreciate purchasing a book described as an exciting adventure novel and finding that it is also a vehicle for proselytizing the Mormon religion. The author makes his descriptions of Native American origins, anthropology of historic settlements and population shifts sound like science, but instead ignores science and explains his theories in terms of Mormon religious beliefs.<br /><br />The author has a vivid imagination and the adventures are there all right, hopping back and forth between small groups of characters as they make spectacular escapes from bad guys and explosive changes in the geography underfoot. After a while I lost track of who was doing what with whom and where (I gave up on the why), but knew that somehow the pickle they were in would be solved by some miraculous event. I never did figure out how humanity weaseled out of being wiped out and the planet escaped being et up (sic) by hordes of invisible electrons, but actually it didn't seem to matter as long as the dog was OK.<br /><br />If you don't mind the Sunday school lessons and don't get confused easily, you might enjoy this book, but I can't give it more than two stars.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Very enjoyable. Makes you think it's going to be so easy, but wait for it! Puts your brain to work!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great page turner. However it is very long and the HBO series is so good! If you are the type that prefers book over movie/series, get the books! They are great! But if you are looking for a quick read, skip to HBO because these books are long, long, long!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|really cool game and I hope for new guns to come for the app like the mg42 German machine gun
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Adding this to my collection.  The world needs a few &#34;real life&#34; dexters to clear out the underbrush of society.  Not saying he is the best answer but a definate answer to problems.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|I actually had a lot of fun with the tweaks to the comic book versions of The Mandarin & the slyly slipped in Fin Fang Foom.  I won't spoil it for any who haven't seen it yet but the only part I really didn't like is toward the end after the main battle has wrapped up.  I got why, I just couldn't get behind it.  But, the closing scene was a winner so even with the part I didn't like, it still ended on a high not for me.  I'd say better than #2, just below #1.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|My daughter  loved it but got bored quickly. She likes games like Temple run but this one does not have the same dynamic.
B00AYB0YFQ|1.0|There are plenty of good parodies out there, this isn't one of them.  It was so inane that I stopped watching after less than 30 mins in.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think that my 5 year old loves this game the most of all of us in the family. She always says Bingo when she gets the high score in a level. I would recommend this game to one and all!!
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Just purchased this for a cheap samba file server, works perfect. Way faster than the core 2 duo that it replaced and very low power consumption. I would say I am very satisfied, of course the stock hs/fan could be better and I HATE the pins being on the mobo. Otherwise, perfect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game. its fun and easy to catch on. I just don't like the long load time. other than that its q real fun game that I would recommend to anyone
B00125WAWS|5.0|I have loved the movie since the first I seen it. Would recommend to anyone. One of Denzel's best films
B005544V6A|4.0|This show is fresh, stylish, humorous and smart.  I was hooked right away. There is plenty of eye candy and romantic frustration to keep you interested even if the last place you want to be is in the courtroom.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|Excellent movie for twists ,Betrayal & totally full of action ,Great story line. I highly recommend this Movie to anyone ,Who likes action thrillers !
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great game, starts out easy then gets more difficult<br /> My kids love it.. I love playing it on my kindle.<br />.
B004LWZW24|2.0|Sorry just not My type of movie, I bought it , Because My daughter said it was good. I guess if You're the type of person to get scared by a movie ,It might be something You'd like. Personally I thought it was a waste of time & film.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|You won't be disappointed.  There is a scene I use to show off the surround sound where they discover the personnel carriers being targeted by the drones.  Pretty awesome.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This is an absolutely intriguing novel to teach the value of life. Absolutely one you should try not to miss.
B00AO686MY|5.0|One of the purest and clearest Blu Ray transfers out there. With it this pristine you know that Jessica Rabbit isn't bad...she's just drawn that way. Plus all the extras are all her including the Pig head scene. And before and after scenes complete with the shorts 1989's Tummy Trouble shown before Honey I Shrank the Kids (Shrunk is grammatically incorrect) Roller Coaster Rabbit shown prior to Dick Tracy in 90 and Trail Mix-Up (prior to the boring) A Far Off Place in 91.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|Enjoyed both of them. Thanks Forget me reviewing next items don't have a that many words needed for these things
B0060MYM7O|5.0|For fans of the series this will help you catch up on all the excitement until the third series is released and you'll see the brutal  and much maligned Red Wedding episode. Basically its a recap top keep the series fresh in your mind including the Blackwater episode which won the Hugo award for Best Dramatic presentation short form.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Like all of his writings, Stephen King's 'The Shining' sequel 'Doctor Sleep' did not disappoint. This book contains lovely language, descriptions that sing out, story building as true as the Colorado Mountains and characters as real as you own friends and family. Danny's story is continued - not prettied up like a present, but shown with truth and compassion. In Doctor Sleep, Danny's life journey continues, and it ain't a storybook ending. Like many children of alcoholics, Danny has become one himself. Of course, I was sad to learn of Danny's life after 'The Shining' - don't we all want good things for our heroes? But with compassion and understanding, ( and without lecturing) Stephen King presented the reality of alcoholism, along with a rip-roaring good story complete with new people to care about and be afraid of, and an ending satisfying enough for any Danny Torrence fan. I loved every minute of this book - and as always - practically lathered myself in the characters. Awesome!!<br />I love finding myself in a Stephen King made up world - it's like coming home to a good friend and pulling up a chair for the duration. I miss it already.......
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This was a beautifully written book about the pull of family ties and human nature. The story spans time and space and speaks to deep human truths that apply equally to different cultures and different generations. Hosseini is an excellent storyteller. The lives of the characters captured my emotions and imagination through all the quiet details. It was not an action packed book but I didn't want to put it down.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Not bad, really liked all of the look &amp; finds, wish it would have been longer though cause it was just getting good
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What a gem of a novel. This slim book packs much beauty, lyricism, and aching emotion into its pages. Gaiman  has done it again, he has crafted a magical, mesmerizing work. A must read for anyone who loves an engrossing read, and particularly fans of magical realism, fantasy, scifi, dystopian fiction, or plain good storytelling.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Fantastic debut album. XM was giving airplay to not 1, not 2, but 3 of the songs on the album before it was even released. And for good reason. Hauntingly beautiful voice. Not your standard chick singer. More along the lines of MIA meets Matt & Kim meets Bastille. Get it. Listen to it. Put it on repeat.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun game wish it didn't freeze so much. I play daily even though it freezes. love the minions and mini games
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This movie could be greater in two or three ways.<br /><br />1. It's a sci fi and it needed more visual appeal as a Sci-fi should have. The only futuristic thing in this movie is the bike, his ship, the drones, his gun, the alien mothership, and the facility he lived in. I wanted to see more explosions, more scenery, and more technology. This brings to my next point. If he's in the future and he's flying an alien technological ship, why would lightning affect its system? Here's another question, where in the hell did Kara the alien triangle come from?<br /><br />2. It lacked action. If you're going to create a movie where it's mostly story, make it worth watching from beginning to end and I wouldn't care about action. BUT, because this has more story then action it is obvious that it needed to deliver more ACTION. (Hope that makes sense)<br /><br />Anyhow my review doesn't mean that the movie was bad, but it could have done a lot more for my buck. If you're wondering if it's worth watching, I say yes.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.This game is really addicting.I played it for more than twenty minutes without stoping.You should get this game also and see how addicting it is.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Still learning the in's and out's of twitter but its an ok social media. Will use it to stay connected with family and friends.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This is a different story from Brandon.  Different in setting, but similar in tone and easy reading.  It's also brings his typical unique vision of the super powered beings.  The book is approachable, entertaining, and fun.  There are twists, some of which I anticipated, others of which I was surprised by.  A very good book.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The acting, writing, and music are all superb.  Of course they must have the obligatory female character who is smarter than the males that one finds in film and TV these days, but otherwise excellent.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|Some reviewers tag this great movie as Sci-Fi. Forget it. Sci-Fi is defined as future tech. Look it up. Here we're set in the obsolete long-gone space shuttle, doing a so-twenty-years-ago Hubble repair. That's obviously not Sci-Fi. So here we have an adventure movie with some of the best effects ever done. How the heck do they create that weightlessness? Unbelievable. Great story (has some plot holes, though). Please treat yourself and see this movie.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Oh yes. This is the same director as SAW, James Wan. He has been paying his dues, and with The Conjuring, he has struck wicked, menacing, spine-chilling, demon-breathing-down-your-neck gold.<br /><br />From open to close, the silences and the suspense are filmed so well, you can't help but be immersed, and actually feel the scares up close and personal.<br /><br />Based on true events, this tells the story of a New England family who encounters spirits in their farmhouse, and then call in paranormal experts, who help them do battle with some wicked-haunting supernatural powers.<br /><br />This is the real deal, suspense horror lovers. Check it out.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Easy to put in bag and carry with me, smaller, easier to carry than a book. Can adjust light for each situation am in or put on head phones and listen.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Decent Sci-Fi Flick. Nice story. Great graphics. Action packed. Akin to latest Star Wars movies. Fun time watching with popcorn.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A book that holds your attention by making you guess what will come on the next page and the next. Didn't want it to end..
B005LAIHPE|2.0|Not a very good movie. Great graphics. That's about all it's worth. Had I known, I would have passed on this one.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|First book by Neil Gaiman that I had read. It is a page turner in some ways and some parts are beautifully written. An easy way to spend a couple of hours. He clearly has a quite extraordinary imagination. The universe he creates is very realistic and believable and I had no trouble in emerging myself completely for the couple of hours it took to read the book.
B0083SBJXS|1.0|DVD does not play in multiple PCs using VLC Player or WMP, multiple DVD players. DVD defective, Will have to wait for Blu-Ray player to see if that will work.
B00F2J2LRE|1.0|don't waste your time, effort and hard earned money on this crappy album.  Cher should be attending AARP meetings instead of putting out so called \\"music.\\"  It's the same bump bump bump throughout the album.  I guess human beings no longer play REAL drums or bass anymore or even guitar!.  Everything on the album was run through computerized, digital gadgetry and humans were dead on arrival in the recording studio.  Each song sounds like she was backed by a zombie band and she sounds like one on this one.  If Sonny Bono was alive he'd be having the last laugh but he just may be doing that right now from his grave.
0307476073|5.0|The book was heartfelt and strong, like the woman that wrote it. I will check out other books by this author very soon.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful, a perfect young adult love story with two brilliant young characters who won my heart.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I believe in the power of our mind and I also know how important it is to keep it positive and focused on what we want.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As always John Green has delivered a perfect book that will stay with me forever. I laughed I cried...I will return to Hazel and Gus again I am sure.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|Despite the torrential bad reviews I took my 5yr old to the movies around Father's Day and he loved it!! So much that he was able to resell the plot of the movie to his Mom and I later that evening.<br />From a kids point of view this is an entertaining movie and quite frankly MUCH BETTER than the smush they watch constantly on Disney channel and some of the blockbuster animated movies. I bought the DVD because it was not just me but  all my kids friends liked the movie too so it warned a place in our collection.<br />Respect, courage, dealing with fear, forgiveness and nature/the wild are some of the themes the movie deals with in a way that kids understand. Forget the haters and movie snobs.<br /><br />As an adult movie it's not Bad Boys, Men in Black or Signs but as a dad and son movie it rocks!<br /><br />BTW what's with all the soci-politico- nepotism commentary isn't it bizarre that a movie about a spaceship crashing on an alternate earth reality generated all this?
1583334386|5.0|Currently listening to the audiobook and it is fantastic. The author gives lots of great research to back up her claims about how the brain works and how targeted advertising seeks to break your willpower.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr. I think this movie hits all the right notes and lets us see Tony Stark as what he really is, vulnerable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy this app it is a great thing to do when you are bored. I will always recommend this app.
B00EXVZZE8|5.0|I love this game! Its soooooo addicting and you can waste so many hours with it! I suggest you buy it!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a good read!  It is nteresting & unpredictable.  Highly recommend  this book to anyone looking for something different.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I will never feel the same about that little bird. I finally have a feeling of affection for designers, hairdressers and all those who have the art of creating an illusion on a living canvas. Too much to say about the fulfillment of the Hunger Games trilogy.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought this for my son who has been a big fan of Minecraft video game. Its very creative and keeps your mind thinking every time you build it. Its basically based on the actual game. It took my son to create it in a bit under an hour. So he had loads of fun putting it together. A must for a minecraft fan
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|Have purchased other Fire Maple Games and was really looking forward to Mosaika. What a big disappointment. You can't even launch it for a java run time error and memory error. It should have no problem running on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Their others work great, so what's the problem? WHEN WILL IT BE FIXED?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works flawlessly! The convenience of running this thing through your computer, tablet or phone can't be beat. A steal @ $35!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have been using kik on my kindle fire for months and now it won't let me login it keeps saying error try later I have been trying for month now,any help?
B001XUPGLY|5.0|Loved it because Kirk is more like the TV show and less his over acting self.  I love when the guy on the bus passes out under a Vulcan death grip.
B008Y212PI|5.0|addicting and challenging.  I like the different levels.  helps the mind especially if you are old like me.  I just love this game.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Awesome product! I hadn't built a lego in over 10 years and this was no let down. I bought it more for the nostalgia that Back to the future brings, it looks great and sits proudly on my desk.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|The extras are awesome (with documentaries, interviews and original trailers) and the restoration in High definition is perfect. Some special effects are better then before (they used new technologies). I recommend this pack to every star trek fan. It is a must have.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Ordered first  and second season.  I Love this...almost done catching  up with series.  It is very exciting and well acted.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|The extras are awesome (with documentaries, interviews and original trailers) and the restoration in High definition is perfect.  I recommend this blu-ray to every science fiction fan. It is a must have. It is THE classic.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|What a spectacular ride! The story starts off strong as the reader experiences one of Nathan's outviews, where he is forced to endure different horrible deaths. As the book moves along, we learn about Nathan's troubled home life. His father died, and his brother was locked up in a mental institution. Now Nathan fears he is losing his mind just like his brother. But then he begins to learn the truth about what has happened to his family and what is happening to himself. And he discovers more about the world than he ever thought possible.<br /><br />I am a skeptic, one of those people who can only believe in what can be seen. Yet, as I read this, I found myself beginning to wonder and believe. What if there is more to the physical world than what we realize? I was captivated by all of the concepts, particularly reincarnation. That is an idea that has always fascinated me, even though I doubt that it is anything more than just a theory.<br /><br />I loved the cast of characters, especially Nathan's loyal friends, who continue to help him even when it becomes very dangerous for them. The writing was fluid, and the imagery was beautiful and vividly depicted. I was easily pulled into the story, and each page kept me wanting to read more. It was addictive and compelling.<br /><br />This is a highly imaginative and unique book. I look forward to reading the next one!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|The extras are awesome (with documentaries, interviews and original trailers) and the restoration in High definition is perfect. Some special effects are better then before (they used new technologies). I recommend this pack to every star trek fan. It is a must have.
098555780X|4.0|As a veteran knot tyer I enjoy a book that has a few new things and presents the material in an easy to read format.  This book does a nice job and allows the user to learn more easily than Ashley's or similar references.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|The extras are awesome (with documentaries, interviews and original trailers) and the restoration in High definition is perfect. Some special effects are better then before (they used new technologies). I recommend this pack to every star trek fan. It is a must have.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|I usually don't write reviews but I wanted to write one for this to warn potential buyers of issues. Throughout the movie, I had to adjust the volume because the movie would either be way too quiet or way too loud. Yes, it's only a minor annoyance, but when you pay $5 for a movie you shouldn't have to deal with the issue.<br /><br />I've watched plenty of movies on Amazon and have never had any problems before this one.<br /><br /> I will be complaining tomorrow to hopefully get a refund. Hopefully Amazon can fix this problem
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The new King book starts with a good plot. However he seems more interested in shocking the reader rather than really following through with the story. With each shock he gives he tends to lie back and say there that<br />should please everyone. He has written some good books in the past and I believe he is a master of horror but this book seems more to play to his following. I for one would like Mr King to write a concise story line that maybe even was in another genre. As you can gather I did not enjoy this book but I can still wish Mr King would go back and write for himself.
0517543052|5.0|Gave this to my nephew going through hard times. He LOVED it & is repeating back to me what he is practicing out of this...BEing here NOW. Syncronicity began from the start. This is a book filled with blessings that changes lives. Thank you Ram Dass. Thank you Baba.
B002C949AE|5.0|I loved this book. I could not put it down. I have never put any thought into what &#34;super models&#34; go through to get where they are. I have a new appreciation for them all but especially Ms Dirie. She never really seems angry about her family or how she was raised. Really makes you appreciate what you have and to live in America.
B00DE76PM8|2.0|product is not easy to use. needs more help instructions on how to use .Was only able to save one map at a time. would hate to be out of town and only had this app to depend on.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My granddaughter has watched the movie many times and enjoys it each time like it was her first.  She loves and music and dancing.
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|The story line was so weak. The acting and special effects were as if they were trying to hard. If you are a horror fan this is definitely more like a comedy.
B00F2362IE|5.0|I really don't know what yall are talkin' about, but this game is da bomb!  Great game play, great graphics and really challenging.  I would recommend this to all TMNT fans!  It's worth $3.99.  Trust me!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|The story is fantastic! It is visually epic. I love the way they shot the movie. It was so colorfully and the music is great. If you love moulin rouge and Romeo and Juliet, you'll love this movie.
B0041KYLAU|1.0|I was shocked to  find that the Mary Poppins I ordered was in Italian!  Couldn't even play the DVD if I wanted to.  What a disappointment to my family.  It was not clearly marked as &#34;Italian&#34;
B002BWP49C|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but felt the books were much more interesting.  You must have all the movies to get the best enjoyment.
B00F35BV64|4.0|If you are an action guru, then this movie is for you. It has great special effects, and the storyline is not at all boring.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I wanted a book I could get into ,this was it.I have read everything ,this had me guessing and knowing at the same time.<br />I read at night,in bed to fall asleep,this one had me going to bed earlier,and not wanting to fall asleep.Sad I am done with it,can't wait to read another of her books,wonderful writer.Read any good books lately,?,well not unless you've read<br />The Husband's Secert.

B00F88U4J6|5.0|Not sure why the previous reviewer said the free version doesn't allow you to bookmark - it does. Perhaps they just didn't find the feature. Just tap the bookmark icon, and choose \\"Add new bookmark\\".<br />I love the ability to choose different colors for highlighting and underlining - it suits my study style. Also love being able to add notes - fantastic.<br />I REALLY want this made available for my kids' Kindle Fires.

B006LSZECO|5.0|From the start this book had me entangled in its twisting, jagged plot. My mind tried to race ahead of the characters to find the next thought from both the protagonist and antagonist (although it's very hard to tell who is what) and right when I felt like I knew the next step, I came up short.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was quite skeptical of this after reading the synopsis. &#34;What? A sequel?&#34; I was wrong. This is great King and thats probably all you need to know.
B000XI3TNO|5.0|I first listened to this piece of music from a classical radio station.  I usually listen to non commercial radio while I am at work.  I got so taken by Spheres that I even stopped working so I would not miss the title of the piece.  As soon as I heard it was by Mike Oldfield I was totally surprised.  I love the piece.  I could hear hints of Tubular Bells here and there and kind of reminded me of the way Philip Glass writes his music.  I don't know much about writing music, but I can hear certain parts repeated in a different tone or something like that.  Spheres is just lovely.  I love the introduction of the &#34;chants&#34; like that for a moment I thought it was Thomas Tallis or someone like him.  The more I listen to it the more nuances I discover.  I think it is just a great piece of music.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Not a big fan of American History,but this was a good honest read, well written,loved it.I will be reading more of this Author
0156027321|5.0|I like the fact that I can turn to any page of this book and be intrigued. Some parts read as informative essays while others read like an adventure novel. One of my top five favorite books.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00FFRP45Y The Legender (Arkosaegen)]]

1582406723|5.0|I am a big fan of the television series and was curious about the graphic novels.  I noticed right away amazons' prices were far superior to anywhere else I looked.  When I received the novel I could not put it down.  Robert Kirkman held my attention from beginning to end. I have been reading and collecting the walking dead series graphic novels ever since.  These novels are a must have for walking dead fans dive into them and you will NOT be disappointed.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|An interesting look into the world of a women's prison and the experiences of the main character and her ability to cope.
3836538725|5.0|I knew Sebastiao Salgado's work from books an exhibitions I attended to. His photos showed the drama of human toil and travails. Sometimes they were not easy to look at. Always in black and white, always excellent.<br />It surprised me when I knew of Salgado's exhibition in the Natural History Museum in London by a friend who attended. I googled it and saw these amazing photos in the screen of my laptop and decided right there to buy the book.<br />Nature photograph in black and white is not common nowadays but, as usual, it brings to the fore the photographers use of light and composition. It brings out all of Salgado's genius.<br />A great book, not just a great nature photograph book.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I used to have a complete library of Jack London’s books from the south sea tales to the Alaska stories and the books were all destroyed while I was overseas. I have looked for copies of them to no avail, and when I did find them they were hard to read because the print was so small. I like this version not only because it is free; the print size is adjustable to see it better right on my computer.
0345803485|1.0|I resisted this book but finally gave in and read it. The characters are unreal and the writing is dreadful. Yes, it's sexy but plenty of other authors have also written sexy books that are actually well-written. Readers might try Nabokov, Salter and even Lawrence.
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|What a journey the main character goes through. Jimmy is an addict, and because of this, he puts himself in stupid situations without thinking long term of the consequences. He finds himself teaming up with a Jason, and the pair of them begins selling drugs to make money. However, the story is much more than that, with the emotions and thoughts of Jimmy becoming clear as the book goes on, giving us an understanding as to why he is how he is. There is plenty of excitement in this novel and overall, it is a gripping read.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This addictive game is great for long or short journeys. It can be quite challenging and it makes you think.
B009M1QRM8|2.0|This review is kind of hard to write.  I am a fan of Preston and Child and have read all the Pendergast novels as well as most of their solo novels.  However I was really disappointed with this novel.  I will address my three smaller concerns initially.  First, why \\"Two Graves\\"? What was the second grave? Second, the 2 sub stories were entertaining, but irrelevant to the main story. I wish they could have been made relevant.  Third, since Relic Pendergast has morphed into a kind of \\"superhero\\" with special mental abilities etc., which I feel is leading to the\\"Superman\\" quandry.  Improbable extremes are required to find credible foes and resolutions,  A superman requires a super foe.<br /><br />Which leads to my major disappointment.  The book is well written as I've come to expect from Preston and Child. I read for entertainment and it does that until the show down when Pendergast is trapprd by the serial killer between a mob of slaves and their master's army.  Pendergast appears trapped and doomed how will he escape? Why deus ex machina that's how. At that particular moment the slaves, who are not even given names, who are viewed as inferior to their masters in every way, and are regarded as nothing more than bags of organ donors, they revolt.  And the evil army who has been trained to view the slaves as being inferior in every way, discover their kinship with the slaves and refuse to fire on them.  Also the serial killer with his special power cannot see any possible favorable future outcome and runs away.  Voila Pendergast is saved. (and I am left to ponder how Pendergast was able to fox the killer by acting unpredictable.  Are not unforseeable actions foreseeable? By no favorable possible future outcome are they suggesting certain situations are determined?) Io rub it in this cost me close to 8 bucks for the kindle version which is now selling for 3 bucks.<br /><br />I will probably get their next novel  I really hope they come up with more plausible endings.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's like having a giant dragon park that is forever growing by your choice of style. It's also fun to challenge your friends and see who has the best park and the rarest dragons.  There is only one thing bad about the game.....It's almost impossible to get a huge amount of gems without jailbreak or if. you're a millionaire so you can waste your money on things like that.
0452270073|4.0|A psychiatrist treating WW1 patients by getting them to reveal the horrors they have experienced and (largely) repressed, provides an interesting perspective of the Great War. That the characters include of Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen and Robert Graves makes it even more so, although we do not find in this book the tragedy and horror that we find in the poetry of Owen or Sassoon. Despite the nightmares and occasional glimpses of the horrors of the front, the war is surprisingly distant, almost absent, repressed like it is in the minds of many of the patients. Sassoon's golfing and club sessions are almost annoying in their pointlessness and avoidance. It is an absorbing book.nonetheless. Much of the book is dialogue, and it's rare that I've come across such natural and honest dialogue such as this.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|The top \\"clamp\\" part is worthless. It's like something you expect to get in a box of Cracker Jacks. Too narrow for my iPod Touch with a VERY thin protective shell. The spring (rubber band, bubble gum, whatever) broke after the 2nd time I removed my iPod. There's a slot in the side of the base so you can position your cam vertically, but then the whole thing tips over (with no protector). Luckily the clamp section can be screwed off to toss in the nearest trash can. I'm keeping the tripod to possibly use with a different attachment. The legs telescope to extend an additional 2.5 inches. All 3 legs were extremely tight and I was afraid they'd break trying to spread them. A drop of WD-40 fixed that problem. But the legs DO NOT have \\"Non-Slip rubber feet\\" as described. It's just plastic. Note: Standard delivery was faster than estimated - ordered on Sept. 16 and got it Oct. 5. Bottom line: I might get my 3 bucks worth after all, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
0441172717|1.0|This book is about a highly advanced, space-faring civilization which is also highly luddite and totally eschews computers. In order to reconcile these two contradictory concepts, Herbert conjures up a incredible drug called \\"melange\\" or \\"spice\\" which vastly increases the mental prowess of the user and, in effect, gives his brain the same computing powers as a computer. Melange also has other magical properties that get Herbert out of various plot jams. Problem is, having such a deus ex machina function as a fundamental premise of your story detracts greatly from its believability--and that goes double when you're writing sci-fi.<br /><br />Another annoying part of the book was the use of ornithopters, instead of more conventional aircraft like jets or helicopters. I'm not sure what the reason for this was, except as a way for Herbert to communicate to the reader \\"See how much smarter I am than you? I know what an ornithopter is! I bet all you stupid slobs reading my book had to look that word up in the dictionary!\\" (Just for the record, I already knew what an ornithopter was going into this book, but most others probably didn't.)<br /><br />I think the thing that must be understood about this book is that, as other reviewers have noted, it's at least as much fantasy as it is sci-fi. It's basically Lord of the Rings set in space. If you're into that sort of thing, then you'll probably like it, but I'm not and I didn't. Personally, I lost interest in fantasy fiction years ago about the same time I grew my first dick hairs and started noticing girls.<br /><br />Bottom line, I like my sci-fi a lot less flaccid than this, so I wound up giving up on this one after about 100 pages. For now, it's back to [[ASIN:0312878605 The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke]] (an excellent read, BTW) until I can get to the library and check out something a little more realistic than Gandalf and Bilbo Go Space Trekking.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been reading King books for decades.  Years ago Stephen King books gave me nightmares for weeks (It, Salem's Lot and The Shining in particular). Well, Dr. Sleep gave me nightmares too and I'm happy to say that he's gone back to his original style after veering off into fantasy and short stories!!!  King is back with a vengeance in this book.  I loved finding out what happened to Danny after the terrors of the Overlook.  The pace gets more and more frantic as he tries to help a girl with even more \\"shining\\" than he has as a group of psychic vampires tries to find her.  The sub-characters are wonderful and real and Mr. King fleshes them out just enough to give them life but not to overwhelm Dan and the girl.  I've always loved the way Mr. King gives his characters small personal nuances that he uses throughout his novels.  I never realized everyone has those types of behaviors, i.e., licking their lips, rubbing their foreheads, things like that but now I notice that in almost everyone I meet.  Mr. King uses those types of things to give his characters life.  I eagerly anticipated this book and was not disappointed. I can't wait for his next book and hopefully, it will be on track with his other wonderful book which has made him the King of Horror!  Pun intended!!!
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|I almost always, find Stephen Kings' writing, colorful.  This book was delightfully scary.  Had a hard time putting it down.  Thank you once again Stephen King.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|its a little hard to get used to the touch screen controls but once you do then it becomes a lot more fun
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|The book offers an argument against those who say that geography and culture are the main determining factor in a nation's success.  While these factors are important, the authors argue that the nature of economic and political institutions is more important.  They then offer numerous examples to back up their point.  It's a worthy read for anyone interested in international relations.
B008Y212PI|3.0|This game is really fun Hahahaha yeah idk what else to put lol ummm yeah it's a fun game and yeah
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun game.  similar to CrossMe. got this for the faotd but would defitely be worth the 1.99 purchase price.
B00DHHFKE4|3.0|I probably ruined this book a little for myself by watching the TV series first. The TV series is a lot more dramatic and sensational and I guess it is good for Piper and all the other prisoners that the real life story was not like the TV show but at the same time I kept looking out for characters and scenes from the TV series in the book. What I did like about the book however was that it really captured the terror and uncertainty Piper felt when she first entered prison and how she coped with her loss of freedom by building friendships. I would have liked to have heard more of the details from her though, even some of the most mundane things that might have happened, it felt at times like the story was moving too fast. Would also like to have known what happened after her release. This isn't dealt with much in the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The best stories are the ones you never want to end ... all the way through Wool I was hoping that it would never end at all. I can't wait to read more.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Granny Smith is a fun game where you get to guide an old lady in her race against a fat kid in a mask to collect apples.  Granny is no fragile old slow moving lady though.  No, she has roller-skates on, can do flips in the air as you jump over obstacles, or use her cane to loop over power lines so she can fly over cliffs and stuff.  Granny also is rather resilient to landing on her face, smashing through roofs, floors and walls of buildings and other mishaps you're guidance may take her.  A really fun game with cool sound effects!<br /><br />Once downloaded you don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this either, which is something more game developers need to learn is what people with portable devices like the Kindle Fire HD want.  The graphics on this are fun cartoony style.  You make Granny jump by pressing an arrow button on the right bottom of the screen or to grab with her cane by a button in the bottom left.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|Would recommend it to all gamers. Have in a PC game. Love the hidden object games. Will be looking for more.
1451695195|2.0|When I read the book, I loved it, but then researched Alexander online and found that he's been largely debunked.  This really took away the impact of the positive aspects of the book, and its messages of love and caring.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Twists and turns make this one hard to put down!  John Grisham's best work of art yet!  Can't wait to pick up his next one.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I found the book great to read with plenty of action in a well contructed saga. Strongly recommend reading the first in the series before this one.
0767834739|4.0|A lot of fun!  I enjoyed this movie. If you liked any of the Resident evil movies - you must watch this one!
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Extremely entertaining continuation of the Clifton Chronicles. Every character is interesting and an important part of the story, which has a number of threads. One of those books where you make time to read, if only to see what happens next.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Fast-paced, action-packed, interesting characters.  Totally recommend.The world created by Clare is totally believable. I will definitely order the next in the series.
B00006674X|5.0|The DVD arrived on time and I was able to purchase it for a great price - always nice finding an old movie you love!
B00BAWEGPW|5.0|I love The Spiderwick Chronicles, it is just really cool, but this first one is a little boring, the others are much better.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|These books are incredible. The author makes you feel like a character and it pulls you in even more... MUST READS!!!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This film has beautiful production values particularly fabulous and historically accurate costumes and both the principals bring a freshness to the characters that history has somewhat flattened and made banal<br /><br />So if you like historical subjects this is a great treatment of a world famous couple complete with fights quirks and weaknesses  Highly recommend it!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Ive been able to download movie, songs, videos, and episodes from YouTube with this app with virtually no problems. It's great!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is a good app.I think you will like it. I know I did. My only problem is that you need to update it by yourself. I think it should update automatically.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The greatest story in world is the one that makes you feel. I cried, I laughed, I was shocked,I was angry, and I was lost. These are just a few emotions that I went through while reading The Husband's Secret. I could easily put myself in each character's place. It was a quick read. I found myself asking myself could I have been that strong? And I find I done know the answer to my question. I have myself been in a similar situation as on of the characters. To me this book just shows how truly strong women realy are. This story has touched my heart like no other. Maybe it is because I can relate or maybe it is because Liane is one awsome writer. I just finished and I am ready to read it again.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I love this game so much, I got it for app of the day and now I'm hooked!!! I totally recommend it!!!!
B0068FYZIO|4.0|I had seen it years ago and thought it was great then and enjoyed it now.  I also liked the fact that the movie was true to life.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Nice new twist to Khan. Wonder if they put his knowledge to use against their enemies. Do I see a new David?
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Wonderful story.  These actors seem so suited to each other.  Miss Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy do a fabulous job of portraying a love-hate relationship.  I like the other movie of P&P, but this is by far my favorite.  Please give it a try if you have not seen it.
0738212415|4.0|This book teaches you how to draw in 3D in less than 30 days, no matter what your natural ability. If you want to start drawing, start with this book.
B00BE5U7P8|5.0|Learn how to do lot's more with Excel with this book. Written with simple language but has every thing in it I need. I bought the Kindle edition received it in seconds and you can copy scripts and paste them into Excel. I'll be spending a lot of time using this Kindle book. Great service from Amazon.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone Survivor is one of the best books ever written displaying the courage and valor under fire, under pain and injury, even after the death of his incredibly brave comrades.  I am in awe of the Navy Seals and everything they stand for.  They epitomize the standards of selflessness, bravery and duty to their country.  Marcus Lutrell was in this book but he represents the best of the best of the Seals and Special Forces.  I am grateful he made it out alive and could tell his story of the battle of Murphy's Ridge and could discuss the help from his brave tribal village.  God Bless all men and women serving their country and may God Bless the US and keep them safe.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|A magnificent book, by one of the giants of the 20th Century. Reading &#34;Long Walk to Freedom&#34; is like sitting in a room with Nelson Mandela, listening to him tell you his life story. It's a glorious, intimate book, alternately funny, heartbreaking, inspiring, suspenseful, educational, and even entertaining. It is a great book written by a great man, and reading it leaves you so appreciative for the heroic efforts that were beneficial to all humanity by such people as Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr, and Nelson Mandela. Never mind Superman and Batman, These men are the REAL SUPERHEROES. You finish this book feeling ENNOBLED.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|While this medical thriller is probably a bit too ACCURATE (and therefore terrifying!) for people to see, it missed an important element in that of having ANY lethal \\"conatgion\\" virus, that being the period of time an infected person would have left, once symptoms appear (an implied periodof less then 12-24 hours is implied when Gwenyth Paltrow returns home, and then her son dies the next day!). Aside from that, great movie, lots of tension/suspense, and something that will make you want to begin stockpiling survival supplies, and reduce your human contact almost immediately!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|With visually compelling scenery and a captivating storyline, \\"Oblivion\\" is an interested movie with overtures of \\"vanilla sky\\"/things aren't what they seem.  I liked Cruise in this a lot, he does an excellent job of carrying the story with believable acting.  His co-stars added a lot, both the two women and Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />It's a 'big' sci-fi story that's captured in less than two hours, would be interesting to see more backstory from human survivors/'matrix' perspective. Would've definitely liked to have seen more of Morgan Freeman's excellent acting in this, there was undoubtably a lot more that we could have seen had it been in the script.  Overall editing/dp/scriptwriting was compelling, well shot. The lake scene provided perfect green contrast to the white/silver mech home that Cruise's character works from.  Engaging and well done, without a lot of constant explosions and split-second jumpcuts that characterize other modern sci-fi movies, this one's well worth watching. A sci-fi gem that gets you to actually Think (like Vanilla Sky did), in a good way.  Nice work - well filmed, written and acted.<br /><br />-ken
8866137634|5.0|I am an Evernote user since the beginning and also a journal enthusiast (Rhodia, Moleskine, leuchtturm, etc, any notebook/journal/sketchbook actually I doodle and sketch a lot) so when these two things came together I was very excited and I had to get one, and now that I started using this notebook it's been a pleasant experience; I like that you can snap a page from within the Evernote app and mark it up, and it doesn't have to be in order, and even if you don't take your notes to the digital world, it's a Moleskine so there's that, a very reliable notebook.<br /><br />I would like to point out that I take notes on many different types of notebooks and also own a Livescribe pen and plenty of smart journals and compared to that system where you need a smartpen and special paper (which are pricier) this is a good way to get your pages digitized as almost everyone has a smartphone and Evernote is free for the basic level.<br /><br />The price seems on par with other specialty Moleskines and to me at least it's worth the price. If you don't use Evernote but know someone who does, it's a great gift (and comes with a code for 3 months of Evernote premium, even better).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-good quality paper and binding (hard cover).<br />-comes with three months of premium service.<br />-action stickers inside help organize notes and doodles.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-no blank page option, just lined or squared.<br />-might be a bit pricy for some.<br />-need Evernote application for digitizing pages.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for those that are obsessive notetakers, or just casual doodlers.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Even if you aren't a fan of older classic historical films, the grandeur and majesty of this epic production cannot be denied. I was utterly amazed at the beauty and quality of this restoration, and on Blu-ray at 1080p it can now be included among the greatest wonders of the world. Absolutely essential!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really enjoy this game. But I have found that it requires spending more money than I care to. The deeper you get into the game the more you need to buy stuff. It can get pretty expensive after a while.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|I gave it my best shot -- twice -- because it is a Pulitzer prize winner. But I just couldn't get past the third chapter. In a word, boring.
1451626096|4.0|Philippa Gregory writes the best historical novels and the Cousins War series was amazing! This book finishes the story and starts the Tudor dynasty.

B00EOFJAT4|5.0|I discovered this song by listening to the album on YouTube & now I play it at least twice everyday!! Amazing song & album!
B008D28HYS|4.0|I love thus type of \\"Piccross\\" game.  Have tons of them.  This one is definitely  above the rest.  The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because of no restart.  My one and only complaint.  Sure I can go back and take everything off but  want time reset too.  Needs to be a start over option.  Otherwise a great puzzle game!
B00915G6MG|5.0|WHO DOESN'T LOVE THIS SHOW. IF YOU HAVE MISSED EPISODES MAKE SURE TO GET THIS. I FOUND MANY EPISODES I NEVER GOT TO SEE.. WHAT A DELIGHT WITH A WONDERFUL CAST I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO..HEADSLAPS AND ALL....THE BEST SHOW ON T.V.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Finally, I find out what happened to little Danny Torrance.  A thrilling tale, complete with monsters, and finally, an accurate description of life inside AA, with all the real, unromantic cast of characters.  A great read, and some good advice for just living, even if there are no monsters around.  I couldn't put it down.
0985557834|5.0|great book!!
B004H83IM8|1.0|I purchased this in January of 2012, and it was immediately put into a box for my move across the country. I open it about a year and a half later and was not pleased to see it's only 2 discs and only 2 movies. I know that it was a long to to go without checking the quality but I never thought of that as something I should do with every purchase. How often does someone really watch an Austin Powers movie anyways?<br /><br />Sadly there is nothing I can do about it since it's far out of the return policy time, but it really sucks to have 34% of my purchase missing.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|I hope the following review will help:<br /><br />Good things about this book: I loved how \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" sort of tied in with this book. Also, I loved the main character, Miranda. I thought that she was easy going and you just didn't want anything to not go her way. This book is on of those where you can't stop reading. It wasn't that it was all that action packed, its just that it was very detailed, and each chapter ended with a deep thought.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!! (Just for a few sentences after this)<br />Things I did not like about this book: The most insane thing about this book that I hated, was the relationship between Colin and the main character, Miranda. I thought that they were cute and all, but when Colin finally has the nerve to kiss her, and she kisses him back, his name is not even thought about or mentioned for the rest of the book. Also, I didn't like those few really confusing pages where Marcus and Julia were trying to explain time travel. It was too confusing.<br /><br />I don't think a book review is complete without telling what age you should be to read it. I find it really annoying when the reviewer says that it is a good book and that you should read it, but you don't know if it is age appropriate. I think that this is one of those books that you can read at any age, but you might not understand the parts with time travel if you are 9 and under. This book does have some.... sort of violent parts, when someone has been punched, but it is very minor, and that is it. I would recommend reading the book A Wrinkle in Time before reading this book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game thus far. A bit frustrating with having to go back and forth so much
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I must say, the game itself is great. but its VERY hard to progress at your OWN rate without spending real money, potions are gems, and if you don't spend gems for them, ONE potion takes a whole 2 hours to get. If you are not willing to spend money, or at least progress slowly taking your time, its still fun like this, you just cant go through and play however long you like, because dying is a pain, if you've gotten to the end of a dungeon and die, you have to start over. That, as I have just stated pissed me off many times, you're forced to wait 6 hours to get 3 freaking potions, its not that hard to make potions for gold instead of gems, that's a core needed item to even play the game, if we cant quest and play the game without so much frustration and feeling forced to pay to simply play when the game is supposed to be FREE, why should we spend money to buy other  stuff? Other than its f2p p2w freemium style, the game is lots of fun xD just limited by that.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Yep, THE SHINNING scared the bejeebers out of me. So did THE STAND--some of that was because I lived in Niwot! CO and knew the areas Mr. King wrote about.  I often wondered about Danny, how he moved on in life, so, when I heard of this sequel, I was thrilled.<br /><br />The book is good, don't get me wrong. It can pretty much stand on its own as a novel, although reading THE SHINNING helps with the backstory some.  I read it straight through, enjoyed the character development and plot moves so much, I didn't think of looking for character development or plot moves. The scary bits were properly scary, the touching parts properly touching, and the suspense was right there. Still...still...it was good, but, only touched the edges of true scary on occasion.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, however, it won't stay with me, and that makes me sad.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Came in perfect condition before its expected arrival :) Great family movie. Very entertaining, and fun to watch. Enjoy Rio

B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok my son bought this item because he saw the screenshots he bought it now he had played it for 3 years now
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Clearly the foundation for the tv show.  More facts, less soap opera.  Larry makes more sense here.  It's a good read.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My kindle has a Swype issue. When I have used my kindle excessively, the touchscreen begins to bug out and Swype seems to no longer function properly. Clean master is such a useful tool that it even fixes this odd bug. I clean my kindle before every use and it works great. I am very happy with this app because it prevented me from having to send my kindle in.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a beautifully written book whose characters are almost three dimensional. Their stories are well constructed and well detailed.  The reader sits with and shares love , loss, hope, family dismantling and recreating. Mathis was for me, an engrossing read.
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|Fun little time wasting game. Very fun to play. You do eventually get to predict the move of the computer's though. Wish it had online capabilities, then it would really be complete.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|This app includes one game (Missile Command) and provides access to buy 98 additional games from the Atari collection, either individually (.99 cents) or all at once ($10). I like these retro games since these are what I had in my teen years. The app installed and runs perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />The included Missile Command game is fun and the controls are fairly good once you get the hang of them.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B003AYDPYQ|4.0|I don't agree that it's the best show on television. I'm not that much into drama, that's the main reason why. It is pretty good, and I keep watching it to find out what happens next. It's exciting and interesting and unpredictable for the most part, though you can expect each episode to end with a cliffhanger.<br /><br />I highly recommend if you enjoy a good drama show and don't mind drug themes.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I probably would have voted this a four star if I hadn't already gotten hooked on Bingo Bash.  I still use Bingo Blitz (this game) when Bingo Bash locks up on me (which happens a lot, fyi).
B00EP0KYDO|5.0|This is one of the best films I have seen to teach about fear. What fear is and how to remove that fear. Yes live in the now. Good onya Will another great inspiring film and of course your son was pretty great too!!!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|It may be because the screen on my phone is so sensitive, but if I draw a straight line it comes out all squiggly.  Being an artist in my personal and professional life, this is a very unsatisfactory thing to happen.
B001XUH69Y|3.0|Have heard the  movie and a few lines so finally watched it and was pretty good not a great detailed love story but was good.
B00E9P959O|3.0|I'm glad that I purchased this because it is a different take on the release allowing for a \\"different view\\" or \\"angle\\" of the recording. The album has a surreal sound. That's the only way that I can describe it. I can't really use words good enough to explain what I like and don't like about the remix, but I will try. The positive is that Geddy Lee's voice is right in the front, almost \\"in your face\\" if you will. In addition, there are some bass parts that are audible that were not before. Another positive is that on one song, Alex has added a brief solo. Finally, the ending of songs and the transitions between them are clearer and crisp. The negative part of this remix is one, most of Alex's guitar and Neil's drums take a back seat to Lee's vocals. Way too much of a back seat. It sounds like Geddy is real close to the mics and Alex and Neil are as far away as possible from them. It's almost as if they are not even playing in the same room and at the same volume as Lee. As a result, the band is not cohesive. It does not sound like they're playing together like it does on the original recording. The drums are flat and the guitar does not have the intensity or resonance of the original recording. In essence, as a result of spotlighting Lee, the rest of the band's contributions suffer. At times too the bass can be a bit muddled as well. The drum intro of One Little Victory is worse than the original. Overall, while some of the distortion (the bad kind) is gone, the power and punch of the music's heaviness is gone too (the old expression of throwing the baby out with the bathwater applies here). Since the heaviness is gone, what you have is a more 60's psychedelic sound than the heaviness that was great on the original release despite the bad distortion due to recording it at too high a level. I prefer the original recording.
B000JIN3J8|3.0|This is the closest version to the book I have found and is pretty good even though it is an older movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another amazing adventure that grabs you from the first page. Way to go Master King! You never disappoint! Can't wait for the n next adventure!
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is a great gaming headset and I love that it is wireless.  Only bad thing so far (for me at least) is that it sometimes turns off when in wireless even though it was just fully charged.  Otherwise, it is comfy to wear for hours with good sound quality.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Childhood's End begins much like a lot of alien invasion movies including V and Independence Day, but it has a completely different feel and tone. If the alien invaders are here to destroy us, they are surely taking their time doing it. Why are they here? The novel spans about 150 years. There is little continuity between the characters because the story is that of humanity not of individuals. In some of Clarke's other works like the 2001 series and Against the Fall of Night he explores the future of human evolution and questions whether the stars are for us or not. He asks those same questions in this book although with a bleaker, more final, and somewhat more abstract resolution. This is not my favorite Arthur C. Clarke novel, but it is still an excellent book. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys classic SF and wants to read about alien encounters and humanity's future. This is for anyone who enjoys a little bit of mysticism with their hard science fiction, for anyone who appreciates and respects mystery and awe in the midst of science and logic.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This has been a fun game. My husband and toddler both love it. It's a fun game for all ages
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Full disclosure.  I like Tom Crusie and I love the Sci-Fi genre so I am bias in recommending this movie highly.  That being said, the plotline is plausible for the imagination and the CGI work was very good.
0307010856|5.0|My toddler loves loves loves this book. He thinks it's hilarious. I highly recommend it. I had it when I was younger and remember how much I loved it

1444737112|4.0|To be truthful, the story starts out making me wonder why I should be interested in this guy,  But, Bob insists on being adopted by him and gradually both the man's and the cat's lives begin to turn around and become worthwhile.  The book is good reading.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Do not waste your time...most aggravating movie I have ever seen. Blair Witch Project, only worse. Save your money.<br />Watch anything else...trust me, it is for the best.
B009C7JS14|4.0|This app is okay. Hasnt given me issues. For a free app one shoukd download it. Its a clean app according to my virus scanner.
140006922X|3.0|I found this book well worth reading.  The author has clearly done his research into much of the historical context and presents a well written and fairly accurate picture of the times.  There are aspects that grate - he is not really sure if the Romans were utter barbarians or basically reasonable - but much of the context is accurate.  His portrayal of John the Baptist, Peter, Paul and James is historical.  It will offend some literal Christians but it is reasonably correct. Where he goes off the rails is in his portrayal of Jesus.  Was Jesus really just a minor magician, an uncritical follower of John the Baptist, a Zealot before his time?  This sounds to me like someone trying desperately to excuse twenty first century fanatics. His agenda overwrites historical common sense, and most biblical scholars. Others have pulled apart the misrepresentation of Jesus much better than I ever could.  But in modern terms I have a simple parallel, divorced from Christianity.  Would Ghandi have earned so much passion and respect if he had been simply a violent zealot and not a beacon of love and forgiveness?
B00D7JGL36|5.0|a good collection of songs which pay tribute to the Bakersfield sound of Haggard,Owens,et al...Gill and Franklin make it easy to get into this special style of music which gets you going...

B002RKSU3K|5.0|Good book to read<br />I think PollyAnna is an awesome and excellent character<br />The reason why I think PollyAnna is an awesome and excellent character is because she never gives up.
1476727651|5.0|This is the best book, in my opinion, in the last decade by Stephen King. It does a great job following up on what happened to Dan Torrence after the night that saw the destruction of the Overlook Hotel and the death of his father. After four decades of writing King has about arrived at apex of his career. I certainly hope the film adaptation will be worthy of Kubrick and Nicholson's 1980 movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What a great story teller John Grisham is.  Would make a great movie.  Grisham is a great talent and this book is in that tradition
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|If you like alternative, smooth, fun, and music almost anybody else would not mind listening to, I recommend this band. They played at the free concert in Philly put on by radio 104.5 and they were awesome! Ever since I heard them on the radio I have loved them.
0345535421|5.0|If you are reading a review about this book you should hit the back button and type a search for the &#34;Twilight&#34; series.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|The Conjuring came out of nowhere from horror-noir director James Wan. It takes the best of Paranormal Activity, Insidious, Sinister, and Dark Skies, and crams it into a 2-hour long roller coaster ride from hell. A nostalgic throwback story, incredible acting, heart-pounding sound effects, and beautiful cinematography make The Conjuring one the best made horror movies I have ever seen. James Wan dowses this movie with a thick fog of atmosphere and layers on the escalating bass notes when the action peaks. One after another, the scares keep coming like roaring train cars, hurdling along the rails at breakneck speed.<br /><br />Ed and Lorraine Warren are the movie's protagonists. The couple is based on their real-life counterparts, whose paranormal research came into the national spotlight after the infamous Amityville House case. Both actors who play the pair (Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga), look as if they have been plucked from the 70's with their retro outfits, folksy manners, and believable reactions to ongoing events. The beautiful Rhode Island home that is the movie's primary set piece is so overflowing with spectral activity and gothic stylings that it should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor during the 2013 Oscars. It's curse is far-reaching to the point that the Warrens own daughter Judy is attacked by the evil entity in their family home, many miles away from the possessed farmhouse.<br /><br />The family in peril is the Perrons. Roger and Carolyn have five daughters between themselves. Joey King, who plays the curly blond sister, stands out above the rest with her startling performance. The fear ricochets off each daughter and infects the parents, who are forced to seek the Warrens assistance out of sheer terror. Ed and Lorraine set up shop at their country estate, and discover that an evil entity has latched onto the family. Ed is no man of the cloth, and contacts a Catholic Priest to perform an Exorcism. The dumbfounded Clergyman ogles Ed's videotaped evidence, lets out a deep exhale, and informs Ed that the green light would have to come from the Vatican itself. With time running out, Ed takes the demon on mano-a-mano.<br /><br />Months after The Conjuring's theatrical run, James Wan followed up with the lackluster sequel to Insidious. It seems as if he used all of his good ideas on the former, while the latter's rushed feel could have been the result of pressure from studio executives. James Wan recently issued a public statement proclaiming that he would no longer direct movies in the horror genre, and instead wants to focus on other types of films. This is no surprise as this movie is Wan's magnum opus, and cannot be outdone utilizing the director's current idea bank. The Conjuring goes down as the scariest movie since The Exorcist.ed evidence, lets out a deep exhale, and informs Ed that the green light would have to come from the Vatican itself.

B007XIC1GI|5.0|I remember being in high school and my youth leader preached one day that was convinced that Marilyn Manson was indeed the Antichrist this proved we are in The End Times.  That Jesus would be coming back, and I guess that meant that Warner was going to battle Jesus in &#34;The Heavens&#34;.  I'm glad my youth pastor was wrong , I am thrilled Manson wrote this book, and I am inspired by the liberal Manson and the art he continues to make today.  This book will always have a prominent place in my heart, and should be required reading for all ex-christians.

But now that I've put so many new aps on my kindle, it's almost necessary to have the weather right at hand all the time. Anyone who has used the weather channel on any other device will already appreciate all its attributes. Now you can have it on your Kindle too!
