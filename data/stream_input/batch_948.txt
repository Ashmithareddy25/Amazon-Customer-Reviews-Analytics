B000ZN802W|4.0|1.  I read this book many moons ago and frankly found it boring and kind of pointless; but that was a long time ago.<br /><br />2.  I generally hate \\"coming of age\\" movies because I find them overly self-indulgent and pointless as well.<br /><br />3.  And for various other reasons, I was expecting to dislike this movie but since I had it--> I gave it a go and was very very surprised and impressed with all involved in making this film.  It was very well written, the acting was excellent, relationships between the various characters was awesome and most impressively--> the movie was not \\"preachy\\" nor did it have an overt axe to grind, one way or another.  It was just a sad but poignant film about an unique and remarkable young man.<br /><br />4.  Highly recommended, even for the non \\"touchy / feely\\" type folks out there.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|I was a fan of the early Stones, but my interest in them cooled after \\"Let It Bleed\\".  No reflection on them really; they changed, the times changed, and I changed, and moved to New Orleans - a radical relocation.  But I always enjoyed hearing their hits.  Recently, when I realized that I did not have \\"Angie\\" on CD (Thanks, David!), I grabbed this collection REAL quick.  I find it to be very good, through and through.  There are the really great songs that I remember, like \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"It's Only Rock 'N Roll\\", \\"Tumbling Dice\\", \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"B*tch\\".  Then there are those that I remember, foggily but fondly, as being part of the soundtrack of my life, like \\"Start Me Up\\", \\"Miss You\\", \\"Hot Stuff\\", \\"Emotional Rescue\\" and \\"Waiting On A Friend\\".  And finally, there are those that I barely remember, such as \\"Fool To Cry\\", \\"Mixed Emotions\\", \\"Undercover Of The Night\\" and \\"Rock And A Hard Place\\".  I like them all, even \\"Harlem Shuffle\\", which I used to dislike.  The remastered sound is excellent.  And I can tell you for sure that all of the tracks sound sharper now than they ever did in the substance-abusing days and nights passed in French Quarter bars.  So, if you need the same memory gap filled in that I did, here's a good way to do it.

0316069906|4.0|An excellent account of the horrors of factory farming. To balance this approach also read The Vegetarian Myth, by  Lierre Keith.  You may not agree with everything Keith says, but you will understand how the growing of monocrops like wheat and corn (foods which some vegans rely on to a significant degree) also destroys the environment and results in the death of many animals.  Her account  of how a poorly designed vegetarian diet can contribute to poor health is also noteworthy.  [[ASIN:1604860804 The Vegetarian Myth: Food, Justice, and Sustainability]]

B002OR18HQ|5.0|John Fogerty is a national treasure.  Many people do not know this, but Credence Clearwater Revival was the most popular US band between 1968 and 1971 and John Fogerty was their songwriter, producer and, lead singer.  Unfortunately, internal squabbles and a horrible record contract broke them up too soon and put John Fogerty into a fourteen year funk which ended in 1986.  He has been busy since then and his latest release, \\"The Blue Ridge Rangers Ride Again\\" is a companion piece to Fogerty's \\"Blue Ridge Rangers\\" album of 1972.  He covers a wide variety of songs on this new album and it well worth buying.  This concert contains the songs from this new album along with some of his greatest hit from CCR and his solo work.  I recommend this highly.

B002K0WBXW|5.0|As always, Sandra Bullock had a great, clean and funny act.  She has a good quality about her and seems to choose her films with a moral eye.

B001TM1X0O|5.0|Most women told me not to read the book because I would be depressed.  It was the opposite. How could something so insightful be depressing.  It points out the mistakes that women should stop making or anyone in a relationship should stop making when they love someone. I think it is a wonderful book.
B002VECMAO|5.0|For me -- I found this movie far exceeded my hopes for it, which in turn were  much better than the niggling reviews from local movie critics.   Why the difference? Maybe because most people go to movies in order to find help in escaping from reality. They want war movies to be a clash of perfect heroes against perfect evil, or, alternatively, a moral drama of enlightened pacifists confronting the  perfect evil of war. In addressing the sensitive subject of human paranormal  abilities, they want either a total righteous debunking of \\"parapsychology, cold fusion and religion\\" (a curse chant I have heard from cetain folks in the halls of power), or  a kind of morality play of perfect omniscient and omnipotent heroes doing miracles. They approach all of life that way.      This movie actually is relentlessly heroic in its own way -- in trying to chase the truth, in presenting an entertaining and important chapter of reality (both war and paranormal), and in trying to see at least some way thorugh the very challenging maze we are still facing.      My wife (who was well trained to fight in Afghanistan about 15-20 years ago, but never went when folks decided it might remind too many locals of the movie \\"Barbarella\\")  did not like it quite so much, even though she too is a realist. \\"Who could believe this? Especially that part about Barney?\\" So we went to google ... (regular google, on \\"Iraq Barney\\").      I wouldn't really empathize fully with any of the main characters. I really, really do not like or respect the attitude of certain folks regarding LSD. LSD is a disaster in many ways. But the movie had to mention it, to be true to the real-life drama.  LSD did play a decisive role in wiping out the army's activity in this area -- and  that, too, is very clear in the movie, and needs to be remembered.    On the other hand, we really should not be self-righteously dismissive of \\"hippie style thinking.\\" Some of us still remember that Jesus Christ himself engaged in a lot of hippie style thinking -- and some of us believe it would be a huge mistake to  be totally dismissive of his style of thinking and feeling and trying to \\"let the scales fall from your eyes.\\" He who has an ear, let him hear.     The movie concludes with the thought that \\"we really need Jedi.\\" This is worth thinking about. Certainly we have more than our share of Sith Lords in the world today -- from Al Qaida to Cheney. The alternative view is that our situation is already hopeless, as nuclear capabilities proliferate and groups who would misuse them also proliferate, and freedom for individual humans erodes in subtle but decisive ways  all over the world. Still, there are huge challenges in trying to fill this vacuum,  and it would not work to just rerun the imperfect (though important) efforts of the past. The biggest challenge would be how to prevent corruption at the top from screwing it all up as it screws up many other things, such as the eroding capabilities in access to space. The next, of course, is how to insert real science so as to upgrade the best of what can be found from prior history, of which California is only one small part.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Surely we would have called her a spinster, if that word is still in vogue. She sang in her church choir, lived with her cat and loved her mother to whom she made a promise to \\"be someone.\\" The only thing sad about her wondrous story is that her mum apparently never lived to know of the worldwide adoration that Susan Boyle now receives. Gone are the frumpy clothes and bushy eyebrows, but the glorious otherwordly voice remains. This twelve-song CD gets better and better with each listening. It would appear she can sing anything from \\"Wild Horses\\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to Madonna's \\"You'll See,\\" one of my favorites. There are \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"How Great Thou Art\\" and of course \\"I Dreamed A Dream,\\" the first song the world ever heard her sing. (Charles Gibson said on ABC this week that Ms. Boyle on Youtube had the most hits of the year with no one else coming close.)<br /><br />My two other favorites are \\"Up To The Mountain\\" and \\"Who I was Born To Be.\\" In the first composition, supported by a gospel piano accompaniment at first she could be Joan Baez, but not for long, as Ms. Boyle makes this a plaintive gospel anthem full of passion and pain. In the second song, she again soars about the piano arpeggios in lyrics written just for her: \\"And though I may not/Know the answers/I can finally say I'm free/If the questions lead me here, then/I am who I was born to be.\\" This is quite simply a chills-on-the-spine number.<br /><br />The CD was produced by Steve Mac who also plays keyboards, synths (a little bit of which goes a long distance for me but that is a minor quibble) and piano on many of the cuts. There are strings, a Hammond organ and a choir as well on some of the arrangements.<br /><br />Although Ms. Boyle sings only one Christmas song on the CD, \\"Silent Night,\\" this would make a great holiday gift for someone you love.

0385737424|5.0|Every once in a while there comes along a book that is so unique, so awe-inspiring, that you have to immediately rave about it to everyone around who reads books. WHEN YOU REACH ME is such a book. Rebecca Stead's second novel is a middle-grade treasure that people will hopefully stumble upon and love all their lives.<br /><br />My favorite part about this book was, of course, the sci-fi time-travel aspect, which was seamlessly woven into a coming-of-age story set in post-Vietnam War New York City. WHEN YOU REACH ME references Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time heavily, a joy for hardcore fans of Meg and Charles Wallace. It also means that it will appeal to about 95% of readers, though Stead's appeal is less fantasy and more about how seemingly impossible concepts can fit smoothly into our conceptions of our world. It's not often that you get to read a science-y book that blows away all your expectations and predictions.<br /><br />Besides for the sci-fi aspect, WHEN YOU REACH ME is also a charming coming-of-age novel with memorable characters. Miranda deals wonderfully with her family and classmates: she's at that stage where she struggles to figure out who she thought she was in new situations. Perhaps the characters could've been developed slightly more, but readers come out of the experience very much impressed, and will have difficulty finding anything lacking.<br /><br />In short, WHEN YOU REACH ME is 2009's not-to-be-missed middle-grade novel. Its lovely blend of reality and sci-fi makes it truly stand out, and Stead's impeccable writing draws us right into Miranda's world. Be sure to get your hands on a copy of this book in any way possible!

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was never a fan of the Star Trek series. I have seen the previous movies but it was never something that got me head over heels for yet when I saw the preview for the 2009 Star Trek I knew I had to be a witness of such film.<br /><br />Star Trek delivers an exceptional 2 hours full of action, excitement, great acting and superb special effects. The hope for this movie exceeded completely. From start to finish I was hooked and enjoyed every second of it.<br /><br />The special effects are amazing, just like anyone would of assumed obviously upgrading from the tv series and from the previous movies. The plot itself was great for a sci-fi film and was very well written (I am not going to discuss the plot since everybody should know by now what's it about#. The acting is what probably shocked me the most and surpassed any expectations I had. Captain James Kirk and Spock were delivered in such a high performance from Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto (respectively) as they fitted perfectly for their roles, as well with the rest of the cast. No one should have any complaints about the actors interpretation.<br /><br />So indeed, highly recommended film and to be in anyone's possesion that are into sci-fi and most of all action movies. I can see myself playing this on my blu-ray every once in a while.
0307269981|3.0|A good airplane/beach read, but sadly not up to the standards of Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Tattoo was a slow burn to a great climax, filled with textured characters and shifting suspicions. Fire is more of a roller coaster - lots of ups and downs, plenty of cheap thrills but not ultimately memorable. Returning characters have their impressive skills elevated to superhuman levels, requiring another degree of magnitude on the suspension-of-disbelief meter. The villain is more James Bond-ian than Hannibal Lechter-esque and the plot is overstuffed with extraneous characters and the kind of quick thrills that make me wonder whether he had hopes of a movie deal. Others have commented on his obsession with brand names and model numbers, which borders on silliness - he spends an entire page listing the models of IKEA furniture bought to outfit a new apartment. Nonetheless, this is better-written and than a typical pulp mystery, and much of it is simply hard to put down. Only disappointing, really, in comparison to the stronger earlier novel.
B000056HE9|5.0|Noise suppressors have been applied to the default soundtrack with the usual, highly predictable results: clipped, abrupt speech (the noise suppressors accelerate the natural decline in volume of spoken words); loss of low-level audio detail and background ambience; and background sounds which increase and decrease depending on the volume of the foreground. I have described these defects more fully in other reviews and they're all on display in the default soundtrack of this title.    What makes \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" more interesting than the usual classic DVD with damaged audio is that an unaltered original track is included as a choice. In that track, the dynamic range is less, of course, but speech is natural and easy to understand, and normal background sounds are intact and make an effective setting for the foreground action.    The side effects of noise suppressors are glaringly obvious but I suspect many people have the mistaken impression that the problems are in the original soundtracks of classic films because of their age. Not so. Older films had excellent audio despite lacking the dynamic range of modern films. My personal choice is for an intelligible soundtrack presented as the film's creators intended it to be. In this DVD of \\"The Bishop's Wife,\\" those in charge at least had the good sense to provide the original, unmangled soundtrack as an option. I wish this were a feature of every classic film DVD.    As for the film itself, all such comments are subjective and of questionable value but for the record I find this film very enjoyable and one that wears well over time.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|From the first moment I saw this film I loved it. Kiera Knightley is fantastic and so convincing. This version of the Jane Austen classic gives such a fresh view of the story and the music was so lovely and enchanting. This film was the first time I ever heard of Jane Austen. I loved it so much, I became a fan of all of Jane Austen's stories. I can absolutlely say this is my favorite movie of all. It's such a deeply moving love story and I like how it reflects a lot of the things we feel in real life. This film was so visually and audibly beautiful and I never get tired of watching it. The colors, the lighting, the costumes, and the English countryside were lovely. I highly recommend it. It's clean and yet deals with a very adult issue: never judge your true love by his or her cover.
B000068OCS|1.0|Bah! Brainwashing is so 5 minutes ago.<br /><br />I remember as a dull lad at the age of 22 or so, being regaled by the repetitive Phantom of the Opera-gone-vegan slitherings of Philip Glass, fresh off an Earth Day love affair and yearning for a Burning Man that, thankfully, would not suck me in before I grew a pair of anti-fashion blinders. There would be no glowsticks run on banana peel oil in my carbon-copy apartment complex. I would not put tofu pretzels named after yoga masters in my Chinese-manufactured pic-a-nic basket.<br /><br />Slowed-down car horns and alarms set to the comely sights of Mt. Zion vistas and lurid cloud formations, anyone? Is that David Bowie drooling over an underpants-closeup of a sand dune? I remember this from the indoctrination scene in \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" No thanks, New Age-afflicted full head of white hair syndrome, I'm not going to hug the planet in a fetal position today; I am not going to sit on that butte and gyrate in ecstasy while listening to the ravings of the Al Gore Tabernacle Choir.<br /><br />I hate traffic as much as the next guy or gal (or neuter). And you know what? Earth hates it too. We're an annoying festering sore on its posterior. And so we should just stop with this human worship/guilt complex and just find another planet to abuse already instead of making more annoying films to which we offer up awards like so many monkeys hurling feces at the screen.<br /><br />Speaking of which, my freshly baked batch of chocolate cookies are done! Time to go lick a skyscraper!
B000002ITM|3.0|I was in 7th grade when The Ritual was released. Like many of my fellow metalheads at the time, we were just entering our phase of getting into the classic thrash bands (due to the Black Album being released the prior year). The Ritual was my introduction to Testament. Not having heard any of their earlier material, I was still blown away by this album. I of course dove head first into their prior albums shortly after hearing The Ritual. And yes, this album pales in comparison when one hear's the all-out thrashiness Testament was putting out the years before. But, when you look at this album from a metal-standpoint, there is some very solid guitarwork being played here. I still find myself popping this one in the cd player occasionally and having a more matured appreciation for the music these guys did on this underrated album.
B002I6251G|1.0|It's been said that disappointment is an addiction, that there is a feeling of comfort to be had in the negation of all that you hold to be sacred. Hope curdles into deflation. Pipe dreams slide downstream in a real-life Chutes and Ladders, like bags of urine tossed off a cliff. I chipped a tooth on Slip-n-Slide. Carter was president then. I guess you could call him the white Obama.<br /><br />But back to the distorted, overwrought, self-absorbed heir to Joy Division's throne that is the aptly named The Editors. Clinically bleaching out creativity and molding it into a raw, soulless husk. That's what editors do, folks. I know; I are one. But what you might not know is that your prose, those word turds you think soar on the wings of angels, is of no more interest than a retard's death bed quips. The kettle reminds the pot it is the same bland, shadowy hue. Spiders dying in the closet are more erectile.<br /><br />Too bad Ian Curtis made death look so disenchanting. Jump into the void already. The albums are already pretty vacant.
B0018YIFEK|5.0|This is a great novel by Jodi Picoult. I really enjoy her writing style and the crazy twist she throws in at the end of the story. I would definitely recommend this novel for other people to read, especially woman. However, I'm sure men would find this a good read too. The movie for this book is very different, so I would advise you to watch the movie first and then read the book. Or if you read the book first, just don't even watch the movie because it will seem like a total letdown.   The novel is about a girl, Anna, who was born for the soul purpose of helping her sister, Kate, who has leukemia. Ever since Anna was born, she had to have many procedures done in order to save Kate like bone marrow transplants. When Anna is expected to donate her kidney to Kate, it is the last straw. She gets a lawyer to sue her parents, Sara and Brian, for the rights to her own body. Towards the end of the case, Anna tells us that the real reason she is doing this is that Kate asked her to so they wouldn't have to go through all of this anymore. Anna ends up winning the case and in the end of the novel, her lawyer, Campbell, and her are driving in his car and get in a car accident. You'll have to read the book yourself to find out what happens next....It's totally unexpected!!
B001I1D7A0|3.0|This review is for the SHM-CD Japanese pressing of Pet Sounds. The CD was released in Japan on Dec 10, 2008 and is thus listed as a \\"2009\\" product by Amazon.  It is the original mono-only 13 track album.    Japanese companies have always produced higher-quality audio CDs than their US counterparts. The SHM-CD (Super High Material CD) is a recent development that uses higher quality materials (polycarbonate resin) and a tightly controlled manufacturing processes.  The result is an end product that claims improved range, clearness, volume, resolution, and balance over conventional CDs.  [...]    The attention to details is apparent when you feel the weight difference of the CD itself.  The CD label is the best looking traditional Capitol (black background with rainbow outer circle) imprint I have ever seen, and proudly includes the HDCD logo.  Even the jewel case and liner note paper are texturally higher quality than US consumers are used to.  The overall presentation is stunningly beautiful.    So how about the sound?  Unfortunately, the master used for this release of Pet Sounds is the same one used back on the 1996 Pet Sounds Sessions \\"bonus\\" mono-only CD that came in that cheap cardboard LP-style sleeve.  Out of all the different mono Pet Sounds masters I can think of, this is one of the worst ones in my opinion.  It has some of the most tape hiss, flat sound, and noticeable distortion in several places (listen to the very first note of \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\").    The 1993 DCC version is still my favorite because of its pristine, un-tampered-with sound (sounds the most like virgin vinyl to me), followed by the 40th Anniversary Edition, which has the LEAST background tape hiss and overall clearest sound - it sounds like they did the Analog-to-Digital conversion using the original mono master tape and then carefully cleaned it up in digital remastering.  My third choice would have been the master used on the 1999 Pet Sounds release (the first one with Mono & Stereoon the same CD), because even though it has more tape hiss than the 40th Anniversary and is probably another generation out, it is still a sonic improvement over the tired version used here.    I believe that all of these versions of Pet Sounds CDs except for the DCC were remastered using the HDCD 24-bit process.  I wish every CD I owned was an HDCD, but experience has shown that the quality of the master trumps whether HDCD was used or not.  The same principle holds true here: choosing to use a  fairly poor 2nd or 3rd generation master really kills the high hopes I had when I bought this SHM-CD.  While I can notice a physical difference in the CD, I cannot discern any audible difference between this SHM-CD and the Pet Sounds Sessions mono CD - same volume, same bass response, same tape hiss, same clarity, same everything.  I sampled both CDs on a high-end Sony CD player, both with speakers and AKG K240 pro headphones, and even on my Panasonic Blu-Ray player, in case the much shorter, blue laser light might make a difference - and it did not.  If it were a blind test I could not tell these two apart, no matter what they were played on.    That being said, even this version of Pet Sounds would sound great to the average person on the street.  When I'm not nit-picking, it sounds just as good if not better than all the other remastered Beach Boys CDs from '64 - '68.  But the average person on the street is not going to pay extra for the SHM-version of Pet Sounds.    About the liner notes - they are identical to the 40th Anniversary Edition notes, page for page, except this only lists the mono album (so no mention of \\"Hang On To Your Ego\\" or the album repeating in stereo, which this CD does not have).  As an added bonus is a black-and-white Japanese translation of the liner notes, as well as a side-by-side, line-by-line comparison of the lyrics in English (with a few minor errors) and Japanese.    As a gift for a native Japanese-speaker, this would likely be very appreciated due to its high quality, translated liner notes and lyrics, and overall beautiful presentation.  For audiophiles or others like me that already own every conceivable version of Pet Sounds, there is no reason to buy this - simply because it sounds no better than any existing format (except for 8-track and the recent Audio Fidelity gold CD version, which actually sound worse).    5 stars for manufacturing, packaging, liner notes, and presentation; minus 1 star for lackluster sound quality and minus 1 more star for not providing any reason to buy another copy of Pet Sounds.
B001URY5IU|4.0|My son loved some of the pop up features on this lego set.  He also loved the characters that came with it, especially the super cool white lego goggles.  He is an avid Lego player and collector and the Echo Base was a happy addition.
B002MW50KO|3.0|First off you gotta Love Bob Dylan, he is a musical icon but Im sorry this cd is Bad, it hurts to listen to the samples.<br />I give the cd a mercy 3 for effort but thats about it.<br /><br />bottom line , Love ya Bob you keep on truckin.
B001TODCII|5.0|I usually dislike movies with suspense, but this movie rocked!  It helped that you just knew Liam's character was going to kick some butt.  The movie has no dull parts and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Something we have been waiting for, a person like us that can give us a the inspiration to achieve what we can in life.  Such a joy to listen to a treat for all ages!!
B000000WGL|5.0|Keith simply does it all on this album: Stonesy garage rock, Chuck Berry raveups, menacing funk, boozy ballads. Truly shows you who the punk-rock soul and songwriting foundation of the Stones has been for all these years. Riffs everywhere you look, plus swagger and attitude, great arrangements and production, and superb taste in supporting musicians.
B002OOG6RQ|5.0|This Rammstein CD is one of their best.  I love every song on it.  They did not disappoint once again.
B000053VHO|4.0|A good selection of not-your-usual-suspect Zeppelin tunes, including great stuff from Physical Graffiti, plus some great covers, including Shapes of Things (a nod to Jeff Beck). Page gives you the fireworks and a lot of tasteful wah-wah without going overboard, and Chris Robinson handles the vocals without the banshee hysterics. One quibble: No acoutstic numbers like \\"Going to California\\" or \\"Bron Y'Aur.\\" Still, very, very solid and most welcome, considering we don't have a lot of live Zeppelin or Page solo to choose from.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan you have to get this box set. No matter what (as long as you can afford it) as it is the ultimate in Beatles!
B000000WJ2|2.0|There are some good riffs and grooves here, and \\"999\\" is a standout, but overall it sounds more like songs that were either leftover and undeveloped from the first solo record, or were merely written on the fly in the studio. Some of the songs just go on too long. Still, it's never a bad thing to hear Keef play.
B000ZELISO|3.0|I haven't seen this movie yet because I haven't received what I ordered. The description clearly said \\"Bluray/DVD Combo with Digital copy and BD Live.\\" What did I receive? A bluray disk...the end. Where is my DVD version? Where is my digital copy access code? Why is Amazon stealing my money and thinks it is ok? Well, it's not. In my \\"Orders\\" page, it says the Bluray combo is what I purchased...now this page has changed to what I received -- a Bluray disk. I don't care about BD Live options. I want a DVD to watch in my laptop. According to other review the digital copy only works on media players I do not own, so I'm not too upset over that. I just want what I clearly ordered. Is that too much to ask? That's why I purchase directly from Amazon. I want to avoid receiving wrong products, not purposefully get a random movie.<br /><br />I have a feeling that because this was available for pre-order for a few weeks, Amazon ran out and just shipped this version.<br /><br />I still want a DVD version as I paid for one!<br /><br />UPDATE 12/19/09: I received an email from Amazon that stated some customers purchased the Bluray/DVD combo w/ digital copy during a promotional stage and it was never removed from the website. Since I was one of those customers, they are giving me a promo code to buy the DVD for free and get the Amazon digital copy (you can watch it on your computer w/o an internet connection if you download the Amazon Unbox player, which I did -- we'll see how good it is once the movie finishes) so in a sense, I'm getting what I paid for. I'm glad Amazon rectified the situation within 3 days. That was very nice. Thank you!<br /><br />UPDATE 01/02/10: I watched the movie. It was alright. Like others have said, the previous movies were better. It was pretty slow for the majority of the film. You could probably just watch the first 20 minutes and then the last 45 and not miss much. I hope the finally is better. It would be a shame to end the series if the movies are going to be like this.
B0001CNRSE|5.0|This is a movie whose theme is all too familiar:  fight for your dream, even when the odds are stacked against you.  However, being that I love to dance, I watched this film and became familiar not only with Honey (Jessica Alba), but also the young boys she inspires in the film--Benny (Lil Romeo) and his little brother Raymond (Zachary Isaiah Williams).  This film is not just about following your dream; it's about the power of positive reinforcement and believing in yourself, no matter how hard things get.  When things took a turn for the worse for our hero(ine)s, they faltered momentarily, but they never threw in the towel; instead, they saw a vision of a better life for themselves down the road.  I identify with the characters Benny and Raymond, needing a creative, positive outlet for their energy to be channeled--instead of the bleak alternative of succumbing to the negative influences of the neighborhood.
B0029LHW68|5.0|Another amazing album from 30 Seconds to Mars! \\"Stranger in a strange land\\" sent chills down my back the first time I listened to it. Was surprised to hear Kanye West in \\"Hurricane\\" but it's an awesome song.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|To paraphrase Terry Pratchett, \\"Grind up the entire Universe and pass it through the finest sieve: you'll find no trace of respect, or compassion, or honour.\\" Humans made up those lovely ideas; humans live for those ideas; humans die for those ideas.    Magic? Unicorns? Santa Claus? They don't exist in the physical world either. But entertaining the possibility of the 'little' fantasies is the first step in belief of the big fantasies: duty, courage, integrity. Humans need to believe in the big fantasies to become human. On the day that an ape stood beside her mate to chase away a leopard threatening their children, not as a matter of hard-wired instinct but as an altruistic decision to protect her family, that was the day that a human first walked on this planet.    \\"Stardust\\" is a fantastical tale. An ordinary boy, with not-so-ordinary hidden qualities, becomes enmeshed in a situation where he must overcome lifelong assumptions about how the world works. The boy meets the embodiment of a star... a celestial watcher crashed to earth. The rare presence of this beautiful avatar awakens the foul lust of an evil witch who wants to rip out the star's heart and eat it to gain prolonged life. The boy also has a use for the star: she will be a gift to an indifferent village girl who has toyed with the boy.    A parallel story line involves the succession of the ruler of the magical kingdom and the search for a jewel. The fact that the star has the jewel on her person brings the two threads of the story together. The story-arc of callow youth to manhood, good defeating evil, bravery rewarded is ancient. The reason that such a tale is continually retold is simple: we WANT to see ourselves in such a narrative. We want to believe that somewhere inside us is the spark that can kindle to a flame of right-thinking and right actions.    We want to believe that, when the time comes, we will do the right thing.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I have four video versions of Pride and Prejudice - from Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier to Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen - with the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle BBC version as my favorite. So, it's nice to see a different take on the story. It was quite entertaining, and a fun way to spend a weekend afternoon. I always enjoy the creativity (and the stretching of credulity) inspired by time travel stories. There were parts of the story that could have been better explained - but from other reviews I see that the American version is different from the British version (which I now would like to see). The price was good on Amazon, and as I have Prime delivery - it arrived really quickly! If you love Jane Austen (who doesn't?) - this will not disappoint!
1416594787|3.0|I would rate TGSOE five stars if it was a naturalist writing about what he knows.  But does it prove evolution is a fact, which is its implied purpose?  It depends on the criteria you would use to judge that.  Beyond that, Dawkins has an irritating habit in this work of attacking creationists to the point of it being a pointless distraction.    By what criteria shall we judge this book?  If one thinks evolution is a fact or not, does this book succeed in proving it?  No.  He doesn't say so, but there is an implicit notion when he presents his case: What else could it be than proof of evolution?  While the material in book dovetails well with Dawkins theory of evolution, dovetailing is not the same as proof.      He does discuss some amazing phenomena and in that regard this book is delightful. But that doesn't demonstrate his theory to be a fact.    Let's go through some of his points.    Point one is that microbes evolve.  While they indeed evolve, he doesn't specifically seem to say that they change species in their observed evolution.  What he does say is that creationists--the people without whom he would not be well known--are lesser because they ignore such obvious forms of evolution.  Yet many creationists actually hold that micro evolution does take place.  The fact of that moth species whose members were mostly light colored and over generations became dark with their environment when the lighter colored members were picked off by birds, this is well accepted by many creationists.    While we are on the topic of creationists, Dawkins seems to find a breed of creationist who is not overly aware and intellectually capable.  An analogy would be for a top creationist to find people who are below average in curiosity and/or intellect and who also believe in evolution--and hold them up as examples of those who believe in evolution.  This is high school stuff.    Dawkins assures us that life forms can gradually morph from generation to generation resulting eventually in everything we see--apparently from a single ancestor if Dawkins is to be believed.  Though he does mention devolution, he does not hold up the obvious idea that, if his theories are correct, any life form is not precluded from being able to morph into any other life form eventually.  Such as a dogs into cats.  Or humans into Amoeba proteus.    At no point in the major portion of the book that I read does Dawkins state what a species is in a way that makes sense to believe that what he is showing and arguing allows a thread of one species to become another.  Guppies are still called guppies whether they change colors or not.  Dogs are still dogs, whether Great Dane or poodle.    So, if Richard's evidence was effective, it would not just be plausible, it would bring closure.  We have fossil records and some life forms appear at this point in time and similar forms appear later.  So what appears in the record over time is consistent both with different forms of life existing and the theory of evolution of species.  But why move to the evolution as a fact, unless we go with, \\"What else could it be?\\"      Another thing, it is unclear why Dawkins thinks that there are single ancestors and not lots of life forms in parallel.  If life springs from matter, then why might it not happen an infinite number of times?  And are there limits to the number of life forms that may occur?  I don't have a sense of this from Dawkins work here.    And what about sexual reproduction?  How did that come about?  And can we mate in vitro a mouse with an elephant, and why not?  There are lots of whys and what abouts that Richard has left unaddressed.    At one point Dawkins suggests that life forms when dissected show a lack of design.  Has Dawkins looked inside a computer or a radio?   Does he have an alternate design for a living form that is more advanced?  Certainly life forms trump man's designs so far.      So if we take away Richard's unending attacks on those he portrays as creationist fools and just look at the evidence he supplies, it is beautiful information coming from a naturalist.  But there is not closure for those who do critical thinking and aren't bound to be led down Richard's thinking path without drawing back and thinking expansively about things.  The missing links are not in physical creatures or their fossils, the links are in evidence.    Have we been able to orchestrate the origin of a species?    Great news for Richard: he has an opportunity to produce another book and perhaps advance his theories better with better evidence.  Hopefully he will not dilute his work with his gratuitous attacks on creationists and instead focus on the quality of his work and what it takes to bring stronger closure to the idea that evolution is a fact.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Quentin Tarantino likes to create art house/big budget films in traditionally low-budget genres or hybrids. That the films are simultaneously art house and big budget is a testament to his keen sense for what audiences enjoy that they probably didn't realize themselves. A copycat certainly; overrated perhaps; but I have to give the guy credit for his surprising commercial success with films that are essentially about other films. He's not always successful, but sometimes Tarantino hits the right note with his self-referential, genre-bending, absurdist bloodbaths. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is one of those times. The film takes its name and genre from the Italian 1978 \\"macaroni war\\" film whose title is spelled correctly. Who would have thought it possible to make a macaroni war flick (or a parody of one) appeal to modern audiences and make it funny to boot?<br /><br />The setting is German-occupied France in the early 1940s. American Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his team of 8 Jewish soldiers were air-dropped into France with the purpose of scaring the bejesus out of the German army by killing and scalping every Nazi in their sight. Their tactics are sufficiently extravagant to inspire fear in their enemies and furor in the F&uuml;hrer back in Berlin. Meanwhile, Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), a Jewish dairy farmer until her family was murdered by SS \\"Jew Hunter\\" Col. Hans Landa, is hiding in plain sight in Paris, where she operates a cinema under an assumed name. A smitten German soldier, Pvt. Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), campaigns for her theater to host a grand German movie premiere, while the British and the Basterds see the extravaganza as an opportunity to kill a lot of Nazis with one big bang.<br /><br />\\"Inglourious Basterds\\" doesn't take trouble not to offend anyone. The Basterds are not just stereotypical brazen Americans, but sociopaths. The Brits are refined and organized, but effete and ineffectual. The Germans are overbearing, cruel, and quite mad. Shosanna and her lover Marcel (Jacky Ido) are the only sympathetic characters, and their plans are not exactly virtuous. But they're all immensely entertaining. In Tarantino fashion, many scenes do nothing to further the plot. They're filled with the director's signature pop culture banter -World War II style, in three languages. Half the jokes are in subtitles. It works. Those scenes are in turns suspenseful and hilarious. Austrian actor Christoph Waltz deserves the abundant praise he has received for making Col. Landa a pleasant and ruthless bureaucrat. His vicious caricature somehow has great charisma. The plot does nothing more than build to the explosive showdown, but the dialogue is where the real action is.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2009 single disc): Bonus features are 2 extended scenes, 1 alternate scene, 4 trailers (teaser, domestic trailer, international trailer, Japanese trailer), and \\"Nation's Pride Full Feature\\" (6 min), which is the entirety of the Zoller biographical film we see in the film, entitled \\"Stolz der Nation\\" in German. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish, though I'm not certain if all of the dialogue is dubbed. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" characters speak three languages: English, French, and German, so the film is intended to be viewed with subtitles.ver Marcel (Jacky Ido) are the only sympathetic characters, and their plans are not exactly virtuous.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|I just got back from a midnight showing in 3D. The movie was fantastic. I'm very interested in technology and am also an artist so this movie had me very excited for a while leading up to the showing. So it had to meet very high expectations. And it blew them away. From an objective standpoint, the story is solid and good. It is engrossing as well as a well thought out narrative that will emotionally draw you in. It is not however, unpredictable. You can pretty much tell what is going to happen and guess it rather easily. But if a movie is predictable or not doesn't really make a difference in an action drama, as much as say, a suspenseful movie. So this did not really bother me.<br /><br />The movie is a very good representation of struggles of power and culture, and an interesting take on the matter to boot. So without taking into account the visual effects of the movie I would consider it a 5 star film in the acting and emotional response triggered in myself watching this film.<br /><br />When i consider the visual effects, being an artist myself, it blows my mind. Avatar has set a precedent for any CGI film that is going to be made in the future. The faces of computer generated characters are no longer soulless and empty. The eyes are still a window to the soul. As the film states, \\"I see you.\\" As in seeing into you, understanding you. You will feel as if the Navi are living breathing entities. With this new technology and the care that was taken in how this film was made the suspension of disbelief is all but gone. You are presented with something that looks so real, that feels so real watching, that it is not so farfetched to believe.<br /><br />Avatar was a fantastic film for me, I will for sure be showing this to my students when I am teaching art. I hope everyone gives it a chance, if you don't like it thats fine. But every film deserves a chance.

0385342020|4.0|This book continues with Sophie Kinsella's amazing ability to fashion characters who, left in anyone else's hands, would be quite annoying.  Kinsella has an amazing ability to make these women endearing, adorable and likeable.  It works so well here with both Lara, and her Guardian Angel/Ghost/Great Aunt Sadie.  So even if, as in my case, you found the pretext of the story quite silly, you'll stay with it because of the engaging humor and likeability of these two protagonists.<br /><br />Now that Sophie Kinsella has gotten her urge to write a ghost story out of the way, she can get back to true form.  Although I wouldn't mind reading about the continuing adventures of Sophie...
B001IAOEXU|5.0|When you first start using the dual triggers it feels a little strange, especially if you are playing a game that relies heavily on the triggers. It almost feels like you aren't fully pressing the button because you don't have to reach as much. The controller feels more secure in your hands and it doesn't require as much effort to hold which reduces fatigue. I highly recommend buying a pair for every controller you own.

Although Pressfield is an actual writer and so uses the word artist for writers and painters, etc. I would apply the same lessons to those of an entrepreneur.<br /><br />He was briefly a marine in the US Marines. He said it's not necessarily that Marines are any better, but they teach the Marines how to deal with pain and live under adverse circumstances and that's very good life training. Part of success is being able to deal positively with adversity.<br /><br />The gist of his message is we need to be disciplined, we need to recognize that we will have resistance to doing what we need to or should be doing. To get over that resistance we need to develop systems to deal with it. Successful people are able to do things that don't give immediate gratification. I wrote a blog on Delayed Gratification and the Economy last year.<br /><br />It is a good book. He is a writer so it is well written (despite the fact that I listened to it and did not read it).

0545123267|4.0|I picked up \\"Shiver\\" right before a road trip and finished it within 2 days. I am a fan of the supernatural stories, i.e. Twilight and Anita Blake series, so I picked this book up right away. I loved how the novel switches back and forth from Grace's and Sam's perspectives giving a true feeling of how the situation played out and what emotions were being felt! Sam's character really captured my heart and the love story between him and Grace brought me to tears. I describe this novel to friends all the time as Nicholas Sparks meets werewolves - I can't wait to read more for Maggie's novels. I highly recommend it to all readers whom enjoy emotional love stories.
B00003CX9E|4.0|Citizen Kane is certainly a unique film, a visual oddity of a film, with unique camera angles and surreal settings. The film just looks different from other films with its dark geometric interiors and camera shots that actually accentuate all the interior settings. It also is a unique story for it famously follows the life of William Randolph Hearst and is a commentary on that oversized powerhouse ego-maniac. The two female leads in the film, Ruth Warrick, playing first wife Emily Monroe Norton Kane, and Dorothy Comingore, playing second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, were extremely strong performances that were as different from each other as night and day. For Kane is one of those people who do not think the normal consequences of life apply to him. When he runs for public office while attacking his political opponent, he never seems to realize that the fact that he has a mistress will come to light and destroy his marriage and his political career. Kane relentlessly attacks career politician James Gettys, played by Ray Collins. But Gettys is a seasoned street fighter. He gets the goods on Kane and then carefully confronts him in a set up situation where both women are involved. Emily Kane shows tremendous grace in the face of defeat and humiliation. But then a life of hell starts for Susan Alexander Kane for she becomes the project of her husband who pushes her to sing and become an opera star. Susan Kane's speaking voice can peel paint off walls, a penetrating and grating high volume whine. When she and Charles Kane escape to his castle, the film becomes surreal, something out of Camus or Sartre, where people become each other's hell. Susan Kane's fall into alcoholism is tragic and yet totally expected. Joseph Cotton plays Jebediah Leland, Kane's best friend who sinks into alcoholism and obscurity in the shadow of his overpowering friend. Agnes Moorehead plays Mary Kane, the poor puritanical mother who gives up her son so that he might develop the sophistication toenjoy his wealth. I found the film to be very unique, highly entertaining and visually interesting.
B002QUG6X2|3.0|As soon as you hear this disc, it comes acroos instantly catchy and energetic with well written songs and plenty of hooks. The material is mostly vintage Foreigner with a slight influence of modern rock in their sound.     Great rcoekrs like 'Can't slow down' and 'Ready' show the new band really rocks and heart-felt power ballads such as 'Living in a dream' and 'I'll be home tonight' are strong melodic cuts that help add diversity to the album. Some of the tracks, notably 'Lonely' and 'In Pieces' shows the band have a modern sound.     The whole band sounds fresh and energsied and new vocalist \\"Kelly Hansen\\" is a fine replacement for Lou Gramm, although most fans would prefer he was still in the band. Anyway now we have to buy two albums, so more money for the band ;-)    This is the easily best album since 1986's 'Inside Information' and although some fans will be disappointed by Lou Gramm's absence, most will quickly warm to this recording and realise it is a quality product that stays true to the Foreigner sound, while still exapanding on it to keep the sound original. I don't like to hand out big ratings so I'm settling for three stars, and I'd have a liked a couple more 'uptempo' tunes, but still a very solid effort, well worth the purchase.
0385504225|1.0|I'd just like to add one small point that baffled me - apart from the troubling points all raised by my fellow 1 star reviewers - why was Mr Solomon (and doctors and everybody) oblivious to the fact that only a few short hours ago, his hand had been removed by somebody unskilled in surgery, yet he seemed to be in no distress at all? The amputated hand was the first supposed shock revelation, yet after wading through a further 300 pages to find out the condition of it's owner, we find he wasn't too troubled by the loss of this limb. Not only not bothered by this, but also more concerned with entertaining Mr Langdon with more Masonic lore even though you would think he'd be in shock, not only from his physical trauma (including repeated drownings), but having witnessed the return of his son from the dead, his sisters and his friends supposed murder. Oh look, I'm... I'm speechless.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|The first 20 minutes or so of this movie are breathtaking.  Pixar continues to set the bar high for animated film.

0385532458|5.0|I would imagine the difficulty for a \\"novel\\" writer to write short fiction pieces. Grisham pulls it off finely, in a very cozy style. Each of the seven stories develops characters that just ooze sentimentality and charm. For me, each story was like a condensed Grisham novel. I found the stories to feel very intimate in each setting, and engulfing a true southern charm that could surely be found in Ford County, Mississippi.    All in all, if you enjoy Grisham's storytelling, you'll treasure this impressive collection. If you just like short stories, it doesn't get any better than this. If you've never read any of his works, try these \\"condensed stories\\" and then continue on with \\"A Time To Kill\\".

B00004VWAF|5.0|Miles Davis kicked all his critics goodbye with this album. Why is On The Corner so controversial? Miles had already been fully dealing with groove and madness for a few years... so what the hell happened? Well, let's see...    Recorded over three sessions in June/July 1972 and again produced by Teo Macero, Miles employed nothing less than fifteen musicians! John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, Jack DeJonette, Chick Corea, Michael Henderson to name but a few. He also made use of Indian instruments - sitar and tabla - allowing all kinds of sounds come from all over the place in a trance which relied heavily on the incessant beat of the drums and the strength of the bass.     On The Corner is such an original album that many people didn't - and still don't - know what to make of it. Where had everything gone? Where was the logic? The beginning? The end? There was nothing in sight, just this thick mass of sound which made you dead anxious.    Thus this is an album where Miles Davis decided to offer the whole music scene the f word and break his chains with the past once and for all. Truly outstanding and intact to this day. From the advantage point of 2009, one can fully see what he meant: a hard rain is gonna surely fall so we might as well have our fun before it's too late.    Have I answered my initial question? Probably not. Guess I got confused. So, if you are new to it, it's up to you to get it and let its massive weight of sound hit you. Let it fill the air around your room like a tidal wave and be prepared to love it or hate it...

Marcus does a great job sharing life and the lives of those most important to him.<br /><br />He's a George Bush fan, if you're not, then just grin and bear those parts. The chapters are a little long - it would have been nice to break it up more. The picture section is helpful: It puts a face to the names.<br /><br />A great bunch of guys and thanks Marcus for sharing this with us. I hope it was theraputic for you.

B002VPE1AM|1.0|This is the Yahoo Movies synopsis of Avatar (probably supplied by the production company's PR department):<br /><br />\\"AVATAR takes us to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a reluctant hero embarks on an epic adventure, ultimately fighting to save the alien world he has learned to call home. James Cameron, the Oscar-winning director of \\"Titanic,\\" first conceived the film 15 years ago, when the means to realize his vision did not exist yet. Now, after four years of production, AVATAR, a live action film with a new generation of special effects, delivers a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new kind, where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film disappears into the emotion of the characters and the sweep of the story.<br /><br />\\"We enter the alien world through the eyes of Jake Sully, a former Marine confined to a wheelchair. But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart. He is recruited to travel light years to the human outpost on Pandora, where corporations are mining a rare mineral that is the key to solving Earth's energy crisis. Because the atmosphere of Pandora is toxic, they have created the Avatar Program, in which human \\"drivers\\" have their consciousness linked to an avatar, a remotely-controlled biological body that can survive in the lethal air. These avatars are genetically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora... the Na'vi.<br /><br />\\"Reborn in his avatar form, Jake can walk again. He is given a mission to infiltrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore. But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jake's life, and this changes everything. Jake is taken in by her clan, and learns to become one of them, which involves many tests and adventures. As Jake's relationship with his reluctant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them. Soon he will face the ultimate test as he leads them in an epic battle that will decide nothing less than the fate of an entire world.\\"<br /><br />Now, if you believe the above description and want to see this probable-piece of crap movie, I think I have a large bridge to sell you in the Virgin Islands.<br /><br />***UPDATE***:<br /><br />Well, I saw it last night in Seoul, went to see it just out of plain curiosity. I now have very mixed and skeptical feelings about the film.<br /><br />On the one hand, the visual quality of much of the movie is some of the best I've ever seen, and whatever technology James Cameron and his team have developed it is amazingly effective at rendering exquisitely aesthetic moving images. This technology will apparently revolutionize moviemaking for the forseeable future, that much I do agree with.<br /><br />I also have to respect the skill and creativity and talent in developing elements of the Na'vi civilization, customs, rituals and values expressed in the story and the visuals and production design which the writers and artists came up with.<br /><br />However, I view this film to be at least somewhat (or maybe VERY) cynical in the way that it tries to use innocence and purity in the story and motivations of the Na'vi as well as Jake and his human allies while at the same time glossing over the realities of the inherent evil of the military, and the nature of corporations and corporate economic dominance which those characters should have known about. And also while making the Na'vi people seem cluless and naiive to the point of being almost ignorant or moronic.<br /><br />While much of the Na'vi folklore and Pandora's ecology in the film is undeniably beautiful and is morally and spiritually touching and uplifting, I find the overall statement of the film after seeing it rather manipulative on the part of the producers and writers. This film is like a Cinderella fairy tale for five year-old's. But guess what, girls do not turn into princesses in real life when they put on emerald-colored slippers. Avatar has no basis in reality in terms of life as it exists in the real world and the way we human beings, or humanoids for that matter, live and understand our life and our relations with our world and fellow people; yet its premise is, what would happen in a realistic future if corporations and the military teamed up to try and exploit and colonize inter-galactic worlds.<br /><br />We are asked to believe that Jake and his buddies in the corporation and Marine squadron are \\"good guys\\", yet they are employed by the military or the corporation, and at least in terms of the doctor and the scientists, if they are intelligent enough to have doctorates and be some of the brightest scientists in the world, aren't they intelligent and discerning enough to know from the beginning, before they signed their contracts and chose these positions, that they would be asked to exploit people and foreign planets and engage in very morally questionable activities??<br /><br />In the case of the female helicopter pilot, did she only find out recently that the military commanders often have evil intentions and that \\"lighting up\\" the natives and valuable rain forests is wrong??<br /><br />When the Na'vi realize they are about to be destroyed, and decide to fight back, that is kind of like a third world country deciding to fight back against a first world power like the U.S after it has already lost. It just doesn't happen. It doesn't happen for a very good reason -- Countries, or even tribes, generally will not commit mass suicide by challenging an opponent who totally dominates them and can annihilate them at will, they will attempt more intelligent ways to survive, and eventually hope to gain freedom through outsmarting their foe.<br /><br />The Na'vi only have horses and giant birds and arrows; the humans have battleships, helicopters, robot soldiers, machine guns, and also presumably nuclear and chemical weapons. When the Na'vi fight back and actually win the battle in the film, it is more than ridiculous -- it is simply, and totally, implausible. And if the Na'vi had closed the humans' school so long ago, why did they only now decide to mobilize for self-defense and fight back? Why did they allow their Dream Forest to be burned and bulldozed without already being mobilized for defense, since they already knew about and distrusted the humans and knew they were trying to colonize them??<br /><br />Also, why was it only Americans and U.S. Marines who made up the corporation and the military?? In the year Avatar takes place, has the United States taken control of all off-world commerce and colonization? Has the U.S. become the world's sole government? Or was Pandora a U.S. Zone-delineated planet? There was no explanation that I remember why all the human people were American and mostly white or fair-skinned Americans and spoke Americanized English. I didn't see any Asians, Africans, or other types. Maybe only the U.S. and Americans are sinister enough in our present world to portray the evil parts and characters in a story like Avatar?<br /><br />None of it makes any sense, but it sure is beautiful to look at at times. And the Na'vi rituals and rites of passage certainly are emotionally compelling (if you can leave your logic and common sense at the door, that is).<br /><br />However, visual beauty, creative, emotional sentimentality, and high-technology filmmaking advances do not a great film make.<br /><br />And, I also didn't like the epic, ear-shattering Star Wars-type battles that Cameron felt obligated to put in for the climaxes. Must every blockbuster film have loud, over-the-top mega-battles?? I don't even enjoy them, they give me a headache and they're disturbing and uncomfortable to watch most of the time.<br /><br />Avatar has achived some very important technologies for the craft of filmmaking, but it is nowhere near a cohesively written and thought-out film, and its amazing beauty and heart-rending symbolism cannotsupport the house of cards that the story is built on. The story is riddled with fallacies like a large piece of Swiss cheese. This is not a film for thinking people, this is pure escapism and emotionality with some macho action scenes which does not pass the smell test of further consideration.<br /><br />I will not go see this again, all the cinamatographic beauty and elegant turns of phrases and artistic talents in the world can not make up for a story, plot and backstory that are completely illogical, impossible, and make zero sense. The fact that so much of this film is so beautiful and compelling makes it even more frustrating and ultimately irritating to watch.closed the humans' school so long ago, why did they only now decide to mobilize for self-defense and fight back?

0385342020|5.0|I was really impressed with this novel. I loved the shopaholic series and couldn't wait to read other books by sophie. Undomestic goddess was pretty good, loved remember me, but twenties girl was by far the best! It started off kinda slow and the main character Lara kept making a fool out of herself by talking to a ghost(her great aunt sadie) in public, but it just kept getting better and better. Sadie helped Lara to become a better person and Lara was able to show Sadie she really had made an impact on the world and she was loved. It was a really creative, funny story. Definitely a must read!
030738683X|5.0|Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.<br /><br />When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.<br /><br />Unlike all the other books Austen wrote, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a careful balance of two different styles -- a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels (she even lists a bunch of real-life gothic novels!), and it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.<br /><br />And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\"). And while the plot is sprinkled with sinister pseudo-gothic hints, Austen also takes the time to sketch out some romantic deceptions and tangles, as well as some deliciously arch dialogue (\\"I was not thinking of anything.\\" \\"That is artful and deep, to be sure...\\").<br /><br />The only part that falls short is the climactic encounter between Henry and Catherine... which is completely skimmed over, and related only in a distant vague style. \\"I leave it to my reader's sagacity\\" is not a satisfying way to handle that sort of romantically-charged scene.<br /><br />Austen also has fun with Catherine as the unlikely heroine of the piece, especially since she makes it clear that Catherine comes from a very mundane, undramatic background. She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.<br /><br />Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming.

B001QOGY9K|4.0|I think Disney is back in good form with THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, but what it seems to lack is a a more frightening villain and a better quality of songs. The songs are catchy enough but quite forgettable without a single standout to match the musical numbers in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST or THE LITTLE MERMAID.<br /><br />The backgrounds are superior with a good suggestion of New Orleans and the bayou in some gorgeous visuals. The fireflies are effectively used and all of the background art is exceptionally well done. But what the story lacks are characters to really care about and a stronger overall story.<br /><br />Disney fans should enjoy it and I'm sure most of us prefer the hand-drawn aspect of Disney's best films rather than all this computer technology animation so lacking in visual values and imagination.<br /><br />As usual, the voice work is excellent and there are some gags that really make you appreciate the humor injected into many scenes. Still, the lingering feeling is that a better script would have made the brilliant art work more worthwhile.

B000ZOXDFA|1.0|\\"Elizabeth- the Golden Age\\" is a star-studded, well-acted, visually sumptuous cinematic hate crime. Surpassing even the Davinci Code in historical fabrication, coarse stereotypes and anti-Catholic bigotry, \\"Elizabeth\\" has set a new low in the use of film to demonize, mock and slander a group of people. One would have to go back, perhaps, to \\"The Jew Suss\\" to see a film that would equal \\"Elizabeth\\" in religious hatred. Perhaps Shekhar Kapur's next project will be to bring \\"Maria Monk\\" to the screen.<br /><br />From the film's introductory assertion that \\"Philip II, a devout Catholic, has plunged Europe into war\\", educated men will guffaw at the shameless lies this movie tries to have us swallow. The cartoonish, Manichean caricatures that populate this movie are enough to condemn it: weird, cadaverous Spaniards, Jesuit assassins, treasonous Catholics, a creepy Spanish Infanta who plays with an Elizabeth voodoo doll, and a vacant-eyed Philip II who limps about gibbering insanely. On the other hand we have the thoroughly modern Gloriana, the liberated woman and good boss, who indulgently winks at her equally likable subordinates' slip-ups and looks darned saucy in a fabulous wardrobe and a big red wig.<br /><br />But the sins of this movie don't stop at characterizations that would have been thought shallow in the silent film era. Most shameless of all is the portrayal of Elizabeth as an advocate for freedom and religious tolerance. She is indeed famously recorded as having said that she had \\"no desire to make windows into men's souls\\". To be sure, a Catholic under the Elizabethan regime was \\"free\\" to believe whatever he wanted, so long as his faith stayed within the confines of his mind. If he didn't publicly abjure the Pope and the old Faith, worship and live as a Protestant in all externals, and keep his Catholicism completely secret, persecution and death awaited. The fate of St. Edmund Campion discloses, in bloody microcosm, the reality of Catholic life under Elizabeth. Arrested for preaching England's ancient Gospel and administering the Sacraments to England's persecuted Catholic majority, Campion was racked, tortured, hanged to the point of death, disemboweled and castrated while alive, then beheaded and quartered. Such was the vaunted tolerance of Bloody Bess for those who resisted the ersatz, government-issued religion.<br /><br />Perhaps the current decline and collapse of the practically pagan English \\"church\\" is yet another proof of the old saying that the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small. The Anglican compromise was an unnatural and insupportable belief system imposed upon an unwilling people, and like all bad ideas, has produced bad fruit: Deism, indifferentism, innumerable sects, naturalism and ultimately atheism. For hundreds of years, and for some inscrutable purpose of God, this alien system was permitted to flourish in England but now seems to be approaching its end. Whither the English go now, to the Faith of their ancestors or down some other path, God only knows.or preaching England's ancient Gospel and administering the Sacraments to England's persecuted Catholic majority, Campion was racked, tortured, hanged to the point of death, disemboweled and castrated while alive, then beheaded and quartered.

B000RZIGVS|2.0|This is a wonderful series, but unfortunately the packaging for the product severely diminishes the overall value of the product.  The trays are cheap, fall apart easily and don't hold or protect the discs very well.  Best to buy a cd holder for all the discs.  There are no descriptions of the episodes, and the only references are the episode titles which are printed on the discs themselves.  So, if you're looking for a particular episode, you'll have to sift through the entire collection.  It's a very disappointing re-packaging of the television series.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|As the Harry Potter series continued, each story got bigger and bigger. Honestly the first book was a 'juvenile' book, the last book was, well, anything but a juvenile. J.K. Rowling did an wonderful job of 'maturing' the focus and tone of the books as Harry Potter grew up. That is why the series works so well, in my opinion.   But the movies struggled with the 'bigness' of the books all along. The old 'what to leave in, what to leave out' conundrum was evident from the first movie. By 'Goblet', there were solid 'chunks' of the books that were dropped or just touched on - if you had not read the books, it was hard to really follow who and what etc and especially why things were moving the way they were.   The scope of the books was literally staggering, that grandness is not so evident in the movies. Starting with 'Goblet', I would argue that each movie probably could have been much longer or better two movies rather easily - which in fact the approach they are taking with 'Hallows'.  So to review 'Prince', the movie is ok in my opinion - just hard to follow plot-wise especially if you are a big fan of the book. But I think there was just too much left out - really the plot is there, mostly, but no where near as deep and rich as the book. I would like to imagine that there is a 'director's cut' out there somewhere - maybe with 30 or 60 minutes more screen time - which fully displays the true 'magic' of the story itself.   Again, I do not want to be too negative here, this is an epic story and would be a toughie to film, I guess, like LOTR, you have to credit the films for being made in the first place. BY all means, just read the books and then see the films.

B002OB9KPE|4.0|First off, I want to say how much I love The Whirlwind.  It is truly a Progressive Rock Masterpiece, and I can't get enough listening to it.  The musicianship is incredible.  You couldn't ask for a better line-up than Morse, Portnoy, Stolt & Trewavas.  The songwriting is great, and the recording and mixing are top-notch.  I can only imagine how challenging it was just to mix this baby down.  As for the overall subject matter which is loosly based on Neal's Christian beliefs (which I do share on the most part), to me, it's not near as prominent as his solo works have been.  He seems to take more of the C.S. Lewis approach this time around using imagery and symbols, especially on the grand finale, \\"Dancing with Eternal Glory.\\"  In fact, the name of Jesus is not mentioned at all.  However, there is one lyric line that bugs me every time I hear it.  That lyric appears on \\"Lay Down Your Life\\" - \\"Like rain in Spokane.\\"  Now in reading this line, I assume that it's referencing Spokane, Washington which I'm sure it rains a lot there.  But when I hear it, I can't help but think of the musical, My Fair Lady - \\"The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain\\" or in this case \\"The rain in Spokane falls mainly on de plane de plane!\\" (I couldn't resist a little Fantasy Island lingo).  In my opinion, a better word choice would have been hurricane - \\"Like a raging hurricane\\" for example.  After all, the hurricane is featured on the album cover, but the word hurricane isn't mentioned once.  Instead we get \\"Spokane\\" which I'm sure the prog fans in Spokane, Washington are all happy, but it is a lyric line that's just out-of-place and sticks out like a sore thumb.  Other than that, the rest of the 77 minute + epic is just incredible.  I'm very pleased overall, and I hope that I'll get a chance to see them live next year.  As for the bonus disc, the two standouts are \\"Hogweed\\" and \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" where MP takes an extended drum solo that's just Wow!!!  The other songs are just filler whichis okay.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|This review is really about the \\"digital copy\\" which is a device to sell DVDs and make you think you can watch the film on your mobile devices, i.e. iTouch, Zune, Mobile phone, etc. The movie is excellent, great new take on the original 'Star Trek' story.    But the digital copy process (for Windows) downloaded two WMV versions of the film to my computer, one for the computer, and a smaller \\"portable\\" version. But both files are rigged not to copy (it generates a bogus error). So the portable version cannot be copied to my portable device (a Windows Mobile phone). So the whole thing is useless. I don't need to watch a low-res version of the film on my PC. The digital copy was for my smart phone. And it has been DRM'd to death.
0517548232|4.0|This is an edited version of a review that I'd previously removed. People didn't feel the first version was helpful, a fact which I suspect to be due to two possibilities, depending upon the individuals involved. For one thing, it was very long. For another, although it praised Halzitt on many points, it was not an obeisant psalm that accepted without question every single thing he asserted (this was the problem for one highly emotional commentator).<br /><br />So out of sensitivity to the preciousness of readers' time, I offer a shorter version. I am, however, still a skeptic and agnostic when it comes to economic schools of thought, so if you worship at the alter of Smith (or even Marx, Keynes, or indeed, any of the august minds that have turned their hand to this soft science), I'm afraid this review will not be for you.<br /><br />Economics In One Lesson (written in 1946, re-published with some updating in 1978) was intended as a layman's introduction to free-market arguments against the continuation of New Deal policies in the postwar era. Halzitt writes beautifully, always respecting the intelligence of the reader. He neither inundates with professional jargon nor clutters up the pages with tons of tables and graphs. He explains and illustrates thoroughly yet not exhaustively. The result is a highly approachable work that has remained popular for decades.<br /><br />Hazlitt's arguments are cogent and it is easy to find plenty of merit in them. However, they are often strongest where they are obsolete. His descriptions of how credit works are downright touching in their quaintness (think: the Bailey Building and Loan in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"). In EIOL, there is nothing resembling the kinds of byzantine credit shenanigans which have caused so much trouble of late.<br /><br />Another weakness of the book is that many of the claims made in the original were not re-visited in 1978. Halzitt complained in '46, for example, that the GI Bill was extending credit hither and yon without the tough standards necessary to protect the investment. Halzitt failed to add a footnote in the '78 version letting us know how his dire predictions of mass default turned out. Readers are left to speculate that perhaps the catastrophe never materialized.<br /><br />On the fundamental level, Halzitt falls prey to the quintessential free-market fallacy - an unshakable belief in self-interested rationalism on the part of the capital class. But of course contemporary readers know that racism, sexism and other psychological blind spots historically prevented otherwise worthy credit risks from receiving a fair shake and that government interventions of various kinds have been required to address the problem. Halzitt acknowledges none of this.<br /><br />Finally, historical experience has not been kind to Halzitt's view of things. Halzitt recommends deregulation and unqualified tax cuts for corporations and the rich. They will re-invest in the market, we are told, and the economy will grow. New businesses will come into being or old ones will expand. Jobs will appear, production will rise, more money and goods will come into circulation and everyone will be richer. Reaganomics used the term \\"trickle down theory.\\"<br /><br />But under Reagan, things did not go quite as planned (corporations and the rich found other uses for their increased funds) and by the end of George H. Bush's only term, we were deep in recession. Further deregulation under Clinton and Bush II does not seem to have been much help in building economic sustainability.<br /><br />Perhaps this book's greatest strength lies in teaching critical thinking about economic thought itself. While Hazlitt's specific critiques against continuation of the New Deal and the abuses of unionized labor did have some merit, it is his general thesis - that selfish interests will blind people to some aspect of any given policy's total outcome - is unassailably true, with a capital T.<br /><br />Just remember to turn the same critical eye upon Hazlitt, too.
B002NPUCP8|4.0|The problem with this cd is that those of us who have listened to \\"Violet Journey\\" got overcome with aural delight and were cynically afraid that anything, yes, little believers, anything, would fall short of that incredibly brilliant mark.  In that sense this album did exactly that, fell short of the first.  How short is matter of personal speculation.   Yes, there are many outstanding moments on this cd.  However, the first four songs, which for some inexplicable reason preferred increased gain and bass and voice over the guitar dynamics of one of the best young players in the world, should have been condensed to two cuts since they ALL SOUND ALIKE and are too damn loud to allow an accurate showcasing of Orianthi's talent.  Sadly, the formula used is  the SAME ONE used by every other band currently squatting on popularity charts.  Some nice lyrics and gentle riffs, followed by Blitz and Glitz bass, an all volume gain and heightened yelling (possibly singing but who could tell.)  Where, in all of that, is there any room for this girl's amazing guitar talent to be displayed??  Why in the world does that ability have to take a back seat to current pop music trends which are going stale and rigid from all the clones out there blasting away in the same manner?  It is hoped that Orianthi's managers and sound people will go back and catch the depth of artistic and acoustic balance displayed on \\"Violet Journey\\".  It is further wishfully anticipated that her next efforts will give us a blues-only album (electric and acoustic), a form for which she displayed such empathy and kick-ass multi-dimensional sound during an all too brief stint at the Crossroads Guitar Festival of 2007.   The pending tragedy will be if these same decision maker geniuses decide to push the envelope of form over substance for this girl who is anything but a simple visual experience in any sense of the word.  The music world does not need another POP DIVA looking and sounding like Britney Spears who happens to play guitar.  The next album needs to acknowledge that fact in a huge way by emphasizing HER guitar PLAYING, while limiting the bass, gain and volume, thereby letting Orianthi's fully intense riffs speak for themselves.
B002VPE1AM|4.0|The year is 2154. With resources on Earth being at critical levels, human race is looking into space for survival. Pandora, a moon six years of intergalactic travel away from our planet, is one of such places. The moon's crust is rich with a rare mineral, unobtainium; on Earth just one kilo of the mineral brings an astronomical 20 million dollars! The mining however, is hindered by the presence of Na'vi, technologically primitive people, yet spiritually and physically connected to the fauna and flora that surround them. Those ten-feet-tall blue giants mistrust humans or \\"sky people\\" as they call them, and want nothing more then to send the intruders back home. In order to ease the tension, the mining company creates Na'vi looking/human controlled avatars. As the Avatars live and move amongst the Na'vi, they are intended to peacefully influence them into relinquishing the control of the unobtainium rich territories. However, as it often is when you put a heavily armed band of trigger happy mercenaries together with profit hungry but scruples poor business people, a peaceful solution does not look likely for the Na'vi. Enter Jake Sully. He is a marine vet, paralyzed from the waste down with hopes that a stint on Pandora will earn him his legs back. As a last minute replacement for his deceased twin brother, he is ill prepared for the assignment. Still, with an open mind and a pure heart, Jake begins to explore the wondrous world of the Na'vi... Soon, he finds love... then, purpose...<br /><br />I really wanted NOT to like this film. In my mind, its obscene budget of $250,000,000 was a perfect manifestation of what is wrong with the cinema today where budgets often play more important roles then talent. Still, I have become so enchanted with the visual spectacle that is Avatar, I see no other choice but to wholeheartedly, although not unreservedly, recommend it for viewing. I cannot stress this enough: the film MUST be appreciated in 3-D, or else its appeal will be significantly diminished. Avatar's strength is clearly in its astonishing visuals. The story itself is somewhat naive, full of stereotypes, and likely does not make much sense emotionally: boy meets girl; they go off into the sunset; capitalism bad; technology bad; giant blue people good. In order to fully enjoy the show, you must NOT allow yourself to focus on what the story lacks. Instead, allow Cameron's vision of the Pandora World to entertain you. The writer/director had spent close to 15 years bringing Avatar to the screen. During that time over one thousand artists, craftsmen, and scientists had touched this product in some way. The Na'vi had been equipped with a thousand word strong language. An elaborate structure of customs and culture had been created for them. Pandora's eco system had been established in astonishing detail. All of this filmed using new 3-D technology that never, during the two hours and forty minutes of viewing, makes you doubt the reality of the Pandora World. It is an impressive achievement on Cameron's part. I feel I have witnessed the birth of something new in the film industry. How can you say NO to that?! Solid four stars from me (though I am still undecided if this trully felt like a quarter of a billion dollars worth of entertainment; likely not).<br /><br />Enjoy!tly diminished.

B001FB55H6|4.0|In a gritty and alternate 1985 the glory days of costumed vigilantes have been brought to a close by a government crackdown, but after one of the masked veterans is brutally murdered an investigation into the killer is initiated. The reunited heroes set out to prevent their own destruction, but in doing so discover a deeper and far more diabolical plot. The superpowers of the graphic novel are weakened, but Watchmen still packs a wallop. This movie brings the superhero-noir murder mystery very much to life.
0141000198|3.0|My mother is sending me books again (this one and Suzie Sexpert, as if those are my options). I got this one yesterday. I read this instead of eating for the last 24 hours, since it felt fitting. I'm a little younger and already divorced, but the story felt a little painful. I think she knows about the blog.    A woman in her thirties playing a Jane Austen character (what my mom said; I don't know the book) eventually getting something, but the ending felt fake, like Helen Fielding added that because Austen would have done it and spinsters don't sell in any century. One of these days Kilgore is going to come back and find this on my shelf and leave all over again. I can't bring guys I'm dating back to the apartment with Bridget Jone's Diary in here somewhere, the pages rigid with coffee stains.     Maybe Suzie Sexpert was a better option.

B00005JKED|5.0|In a city where streets are overrun by drug dealers, those who have sworn to uphold the law are breaking them to clean up the streets. Denzel Washington plays L.A.P.D detective Alonzo Harris, a veteran narcotics officer whose methods of enforcing the law are questionable, if not corrupt. 'Training Day' follows Harris as he trains rookie Jake Hoyt over a period 24 hours. Ethical dilemmas arise for Hoyt as well as the audience as questions present themselves as to whether or not Harris' methodology for ridding the streets of South Central Los Angeles of drugs is right or wrong. Denzel Washington is exceptional. This movie was extremely exciting and very entertaining. One of the best movies I have ever seen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first heard about the Firefly series, I didn't know what to think. I've always liked Science Fiction in general, but after I watched a few of the episodes I was hooked. The characters are well done, the stories are excellent, and it's a joy to watch. Also, the witty humor is great! There is a strong sense of family and friendship in there while their flying on the frontiers of space. This is one of those gem's that was crushed by the corporation and still to this day has a relatively large and loyal fanbase. Don't believe me? Check out the sales and ratings of this lol.     I'm purchasing this from Amazon in my hope to get it jump-started again. At the bare minimum I'm hoping for a couple direct-to-dvd videos if that's the most I can get.

B001FB4VZS|5.0|*Warning May Contain Spoilers*  Season Review-    Even after seven years, Smallville was surprisingly going strong into its eighth season. After probably the worst season of the series (Season 7), not to mention the exit of show creators Al Gough and Miles Millar as well as long time cast members Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk, everyone pretty much agreed that Smallville's eighth season would be a sad and pathetic end for the series. But Season 8 proved to be one of the best seasons of Smallville in some time, probably the most consistent season in terms of story-telling and character development of the series since Season 3 even. Finally, Clark Kent wasn't just the farm boy from Smallville still unsure about his destiny and what he truly wanted in his life but a Clark Kent closer to his comic book counterpart. Clark gets some of the best story progression and character development in years as Clark is given two impressive storylines: 1)Clark joins Lois down in the basement as the Daily Planet's newest reporter. It's great seeing Clark investigating along side Lois Lane like the comics, especially the irresistible chemistry between the iconic duo. Tom Welling and Erica Durance breath new life into their performances this season with the hilarious banter and witty dialogue between Clark and Lois. 2) Clark decides to become Metropolis' newest hero, quickly getting the attention of the city and being known as \\"the Red Blue Blur.\\" Both storylines are straight out of the comics and the most Superman inspired storylines the series has ever down.     Other great storylines come with the arrival of two new characters: Cassidy Freedman as Tess Mercer, Lex's unofficial replacement/new CEO of Luthorcorp and Sam Witwer as Davis Bloome, a paramedic in Metropolis with a dark secret that not only threatens Clark but the world. Tess Mercer is a mysterious character, who spends most of her time looking for Lex but soon comes into her own as Tess' suspicions of Clark grow stronger, leading her to the truth. But while Tess' storyline is intriguing, it's Davis Bloome aka Doomsday that steals the show. When news broke out that the writers were going to introduce Doomsday to Smallville, many fans and critics thought it couldn't be done, even cringing at the thought. But for the most part, the storyline is probably one of the darkest and most entertaining storylines of the series. Sam Witwer is one of the best actors to grace the series, giving such incredible depth to the man behind the monster that will eventually kill Superman. The new show runners do a fine job of letting the storyline play out naturally, with each episode having a purpose, adding to the overall arc of the season. There are tons of great episodes to be found in this season like the suspense comedy \\"Committed\\", the dark and thrilling \\"Prey\\", the Supergirl send-off \\"Bloodline\\", Doomsday's epic debut in the wedding blockbuster \\"Bride\\", DC comic legend Geoff John's \\"Legion\\", Tori Spelling's return as Linda Lake in the \\"what if\\" episode \\"Infamous\\", the Zattana comedy \\"Hex\\", the twisted origins of Doomsday in \\"Eternal\\" and Lois' hilarious turn as a superhero in \\"Stiletto\\". Also, this is the most DC comics influenced season yet with dozens of comic characters introduced. Not only did we have the Justice League, Doomsday and Brainiac but also Maxima, Plastique, the Legion of Superheroes, the Persuader, Shadow Theif, Toyman, Dan Turpin, Parasite, Livewire, Bruno Mannheim, the Injustice League and more. We also got to see the other characters evolve and go through some of the darkest storylines they've ever been through. Like Allison Mack's Chloe Sullivan who is given the best story arc she's ever gotten as Chloe discovers she has a new power and one she thinks she can use to help Clark even more when it comes to saving the day. But the power is consuming her more and more by the day as she discovers it's really Brainiac gaining control of her body; planning to unleash his deadliestplan yet. This exciting story concludes in a fantastic three episode mini-arc (\\"Abyss\\", \\"Bride\\" and \\"Legion\\") that sees terrifying flashes of Chloe's memories being ripped from her mind, Clark battling Doomsday for the first time and the Legion of Superheroes as well as The Persuader arriving from the future in an action-packed adventure. The only downside is that this is possibly the last decent storyline Chloe will ever get as during the second half of Season 8 (and especially during the current 9th season) the writers seem to not know what else to do with the character and her actions toward other characters have become harsh, even cruel. Justin Hartley's Oliver Queen/Green Arrow goes through a bit of a dark struggle during the beginning of the year but slowly becomes the hero we all love again. Aaron Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen is given a lot more depth this season than the past two as Jimmy is the one who discovers the mysterious saves of the Red Blue Blur and is an integral part of making his presence known to Metropolis. It makes it even sadder to see how ultimately Jimmy's story arc ends, but the beginning of it is some of the best material the character has ever been given. Last but not least, Erica Durance's Lois Lane is more front and center this season than the last few as she and Clark are working side by side as reporters and the character discovers that her feelings for Clark are more serious than she ever imagined. Her finest moments are without a doubt in \\"Stiletto\\", especially when Lois shares a very iconic scene with the future Superman that involves a telephone booth.    But while Season 8 gave us some of Smallville's highest highs, it also gave us some of the series' lowest lows. First, the season starts off with impressive momentum, only for all of it to be abruptly stopped for the return of Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang in the embarrassing Super Lana arc. What makes this arc so lousy and unbearable is that instead of using Lana's final episodes to givethe character a proper farwell, especially her romance with Clark that took up the last 7 years of the series. The writers decided to showcase Lana Lang as a superhero by giving her a super suit and becoming Clark's equal in almost every way. Excuse me...what!? The beyond abysmal \\"Power\\" and ludicrous Lana Lang send-off \\"Requiem\\" are two of the worst episodes the writers have ever written, feeling completely out of place in a season that was damn near superb at that point. Second, the Doomsday arc was such a deep and sometimes powerful storyline that many fans anticipated the final showdown between Clark and Doomsday in the season finale. In the now infamous \\"Doomsday\\", the fight between Clark and Doomsday was lacking in every sense of the word, not to mention, the unforgivable retcon they did to Jimmy Oslen undermined what the character had done since his debut in Season 6. It was hard to believe such a strong season could end on such a weak note. But this time luckily, the good outweighed the bad. All and All, Smallville's eighth season was an excellent return to form for this series for the most part. It's probably the most Superman-eqse season thus far giving us some truly iconic moments we'd never thought we'd see until Clark put on the tights.    Season Rating: 8.5/10    Video and Audio-    All 22 Season 8 episodes look as clear and as sharp as ever in widescreen HD! The sound ain't half bad either.    Video and Audio Rating: 8/10    Extras-    The box set only contains 2 commentaries (\\"Identity\\" and \\"Legion\\") like the previous set which sucks because there are other episodes fans would love to see commentaries for like \\"Abyss\\" and \\"Bride\\". I know I would have loved a commentary for \\"Prey\\" (my personal favorite) Geoff Johns does provide some nice facts for the \\"Legion\\" commentary but it would be nice to hear from actors like Sam Witwer and Tom Welling hasn't done a commentary since Season 2's box set! The two special featurettes are also rather disappointing with Allison Mack's directorial debut documentary. While it's nice to see what went on behind the scenes, \\"Power\\" isn't exactly an episode you want to hear the cast and crew praise. The Doomsday suit documentary was also lacking and it would have been more interesting to hear more about the comic history of Doomsday as well as it's comic book creator Dan Jurgens.  The deleted scenes are passable at best.    Extras Rating: 5.5/10    Overall Score: 7.5/10
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith gives a stinging performance. Very heartfelt and compelling. This is one amazing film. this acting once again is flawless in this movie.
B002VKE0XA|5.0|In terms of a movie accomplishing what it set out to do, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY may be the movie of the year.  There are many, many flaws in it...but its goal is to give the viewer the willies, and it succeeds.  I seldom (and I DO MEAN seldom) notice my heart racing faster and find that I'm leaning forward in my seat when watching a movie.  I've seen it all, I feel like.    PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was a delightful exception.  I found it truly disturbing and agitating.  I actually felt dread.  The kind of feeling little kids get when watching a horror movie...the feeling of  having been shown another world that is really an awful place, and of not quite being able to separate it from reality.  While I never truly believed I was watching a true story...something about the film gave me genuine goosebumps.    In case you don't know, this is one of those \\"found\\" home videos that essentially shows how one couple who are being haunted used their camcorder to document the events.  The key moments come in the night, with the camera set at one end of the couple's bedroom, focused on their bed and the door leading into their room from the upstairs landing and hallway.  That's about it.  Katie & Micah are the couple, and aside from brief appearances by two minor characters, they are IT.  The whole thing was shot in a normal suburban house.  It was made VERY cheaply indeed.  (Yes, it is actually fiction...just like BLAIR WITCH.)      We saw it the night it opened in our city, and I can say that in the packed house, there were genuine screams of fright.  Most times we see a horror movie these days, the theatre is packed with teenagers who scream mostly to try to scare other members of their group or to elicit a laugh from the crowd.  There was some of that early on...but as the film developed a true silence fell over the crowd.  And it was only broken on occasion by screams that were NOT there to illicit laughs...they were genuine bursts of terror.  The experience made me fully realizehow seldom we actually see genuinely scary stuff.    The thing that frustrates me (and is probably the reason I've waited so long to post a review), is that I honestly can't really explain why the movie works.  I seldom lack for an opinion and for support of that opinion...but I must scratch my head here.    The actors, also named Katie and Micah, are not actually all that great.  I assume they improvised much of their dialogue, and it has the feel of almost, but not quite, \\"normal\\" conversation.  Once in awhile, we have to wonder exactly WHY a character is insisting on carrying a camcorder with them...would you worry much about it if  you thought an evil entity was in your attic?  And it feels, on the surface, like a big gimmick.      Is it the fact that we can all relate to an ordinary suburban American house?  It may not look like our homes, but for most of us, it is in the ballpark.  Is it the idea of a ghost (or worse) coming into our bedrooms and crawling into bed with us as we sleep?  (Yes, that IS creepy, but why does it WORK so well in this film?)  Is it the fact that Micah and especially Katie look like real people, not stars (Katie is a perfectly normal woman who in comparison to the movie stars we see, looks positively pudgy)?  I'm simply not sure.  The execution seems far too simple.  It's not as though the director has used gadgetry or tricks.  Perhaps the lack of those tricks we so often see allows us to avoid the arms length feeling we get from glossier films.      I don't know, and I'm frankly tired of trying to figure it out.  I suspect the film will not play as well at home, unless you can get a crowd over and turn out all your lights.  It probably wouldn't hold up too well on repeat viewings, either.  But for me, it was truly, chillingly effective, and thus I have to give it very high marks indeed.
B000AP04EW|5.0|I recommend this movie to all people who want to see a fun, action packed movie. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is smart and sassy, it's a lot of fun. Jolie and Pitt were made for this one.
B002MW50KO|5.0|This is the first Bob Dylan album I have ever bought and a very pleasant surprise. The music is lush, rich and multi-layered and the singing like the title is from the heart. There are a number of songs I have not heard before - I particularly liked \\"must be santa\\". While Bob Dylan's voice is croaky (even more than Rod Stewart's) you can hear all the words, unusual for a modern album. This is something I will play again and again.
B00008EYA5|5.0|This movie is realistic and heartening, the escape plan is exciting. This movie gives excatly what it promises; it's a shoot em' up, high action thriller. Samuel Jackson and Colin Farrell were great as was the rest of the cast.
1597801577|5.0|Bacigalupi takes the ideas and themes from his award-winning short fiction and explores them in greater complexity and depth than ever before.  In The Windup Girl, he creates a post-oil biotech-driven world that contains the same share of oddness, unpredictability, and surprises that greeted those generations who started out in the horse-and-buggy/steam locomotive era but ended up in a world that ran on oil and nuclear power instead.<br /><br />But make no mistake: this is not a story driven by calories or springs.  It is at heart a novel profoundly engaged with the ethics of biotechnology and wealth, and it offers us neither easy answers nor the simple (and all too common) warning to \\"Stop!\\"  Change is coming.  We aren't prepared for it, won't be prepared for it, and maybe can't be prepared for it.  How are we going to respond?  The various characters in the novel -- Anderson Lake, Jaidee, Tan Hock Seng, and Emiko, the Windup Girl -- chase different answers, none of which will or ought to make us feel entirely comfortable.<br /><br />This is an intense and compelling story, a spectacular novel at every level.  You won't see the future the same way ever again.  But you might ultimately be a little less surprised by it.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|A stunning piece of filmmaking. This movie makes you feel for the characters and never lets up with intensity. If a Greeks 200 years ago were to tell a story about the legend of the mighty Spartans, it would probably be something like this.
B001FBIPF0|2.0|In Folie A Deux Fall Out Boy totally changed their sound and IMO became a totally different band.  The CD has a few good songs, but does not come close to albums like \\"Take This to Your Grave\\" and \\"From Under the Cork Tree\\". It's as if they just keep going downhill because they're trying to become more mainstream rather than creating good music. It's sad to see how a major record label has ruined one of the best punk/emo bands of all time.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|When the motorcyclist Johnny Blaze finds that his father Barton Blaze has a terminal cancer, he accepts a pact with the Mephistopheles, giving his soul for the health of his beloved father. But the devil deceives him, and Barton dies in a motorcycle accident during an exhibition. Johnny leaves the carnival, his town, his friends and his girlfriend Roxanne. Years later Johnny Blaze becomes a famous motorcyclist, who risks his life in his shows, and he meets Roxanne again, now a TV reporter. However, Mephistopheles proposes Johnny to release his contract if he become the \\"Ghost Rider\\" and defeat his evil son Blackheart, who wants to possess one thousand evil souls and transform hell on earth. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The previews and spots on TV did not do it proper justice. The story was well writen and moved right along. There was no lagging parts or scenes.
0486450066|4.0|This is a strange book to review for me. I rate it based on its importance in affecting the world, and its strength of writing and cause. I also believe -- as I am a Bible-believing Christian who takes God at his word and believes in Creation -- that any serious Christian should read Darwin. I find far too many are willing to accuse him, deride him, and laugh at him, all the time largely ignorant of what he has actually written.<br /><br />Understanding Darwin well requires you understand two key principles from which he works:<br /><br />1. God is not the Creator of man, woman, and all life, as detailed literally in Genesis 1 and 2 (regardless of whether the days mentioned are 24-hour days or ages/epochs).<br /><br />2. There must be a singular explanation -- complex, but singular -- for all life as currently seen.<br /><br />(It should be noted here that the Biblical view demands that (1) be true and (2) not be. Other than God's glory, the Biblical view does /not/ provide explanation for why a bat's wing and a man's hand have the same structure, nor does it attempt to.)<br /><br />Given (1) and (2), though, Darwin has to be considered simply brilliant. He has taken the impossibly variation of life and constructed a theory that -- albeit with some serious holes that he himself acknowledges -- provides a reasonable explanation for what the world exhibits. Of course, Darwin himself spends much of his time saying he \\"supposes,\\" \\"suspects,\\" and \\"imagines.\\" In other words, he is hypothesizing. A lynch pin of his theory about the geological record, for example, compels him to say, \\"...nor do we know how ignorant we are.\\" He is, then, supposing that he has overcome this ignorance himself. This is a logical problem, to say the least.<br /><br />Ultimately, there are hundreds of important things to be stated about Darwin, but they can be summed up in this: the spirit of God active in the Christian will compel him to ultimately regard Darwin as incorrect, for his premise is one absent of God; and the natural man apart from God will be appealed to as he must justify his unbelief, the world around him, and seek an excuse to disbelieve God. This is Romans 1 and 1 Corinthians 2.<br /><br />The conclusion of the matter? Whether you believe in Jesus Christ or disbelieve, you should read Darwin. He is better speaking for himself then your friends who have also not read him. I say this to the atheist and agnostic as well; so many suppose that Darwin said what he did not, and reveal their ignorance as much as the Christian who ignorantly decries Darwin on the same grounds: ignorance.m God will be appealed to as he must justify his unbelief, the world around him, and seek an excuse to disbelieve God.

B002VECMAY|5.0|Before I was completely numb by the experience, I was afraid of commercial airplanes.  Totally drowning in tears whenever I was provoked to ride one, and [[ASIN:0780631684 the movies]] [[ASIN:B000065V40 I'd seen]] only exacerbated my phobia.  But there are the opposites who are thrilled by the flights, those that can't help but rest in the seats/flotation devices and sink in to the turbulence as they reach their rendezvous in high speeds, living life in the high plane.  For people like Ryan Bingham, travel by flight is THE way of life.  His job has him travel across city by city, doing his business without concern of human interaction while adjusted to the familiar scenery of airports and hotels, carrying light all the way.  Soon, he'll find out his 'bag' is starting to feel a bit heavier.<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman is acclaimed as a promising new director, even moreso for his films than his father's [[ASIN:0783230370 current]] [[ASIN:B000J4QW8Q slumps]], though I had took the notion with a grain of salt.  \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" I liked, but \\"Juno\\" I did not, at least not after the first viewing; I gave \\"Juno\\" some approval out of modesty because of the particular indie angle, but I wasn't into it as every home skillet who has and I grew less interested in it after a few watches.  \\"Up in the Air\\", however, never gave me that feeling; I am warmly and unpretentiously embracing it.  Come to think of it, \\"Up in the Air\\" goes back to certain elements relating to Reitman's first film: having a suave protagonist who makes the job about ruining people's lives look easy, a cunning love interest that provokes promiscuity, the glow of social commentary, and quick d-bag verbalization.  The film also carries a few redeeming values of that Diablo Cody feature like human companionship and coping with unwanted expectations.  Somehow Jason Reitman manage to make this film blend the good parts of \\"Smoking\\" with the good parts of \\"Juno\\", and become a truly magnificent comedy-drama.<br /><br />\\"Up in the Air\\" is about Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney, a professional who makes a living firing people across cities by plane because, as he stated, 'the bosses were too much of a p**** to do it themselves' (already the humor's kicking in).  Back in his working place, he's greeted with a young new employee who she provided a less-costly alternative to layoff people: using webcams.  Not only did she made firing the workers even more heartless than it already is, but she made flight travel unnecessary, which Bingham didn't accept.  The quirky but very calculating new employee teamed up with confrontational Bingham so she can learn the tools of the trade, following his direct method and eventually understanding how cruel the job really is.  Bingham also met Vera Farmiga's character who's a genderswap version of himself, forming an intimate bond that, for him, became something more.<br /><br />First things first, this is hilarious!  Reitman delivered an incredible sharp wit that actually made me laugh; most witty movies tried to be too clever and lose their humorous luster, but this is one of the rare witty movies I've seen that's smart and accessible.  It's the way the characters say their lines with such punchiness and how they responded 'positively' to troubled situations with such irony that made the humor excellent, such as the scene where Bingham explained why getting involved is unneeded to someone who's just been rejected.  Laughs aren't always the focus, there are moments where the cast try to endear themselves with their responsibilities and opportunities.  The cast are all good, but George Clooney's role knocked it out of the sky.  I can't hate Clooney, I can envy him but it's hard to spite him because he's got that charismatic Cary Grant-attitude going on and he showed it here.  His character is level-headed when he's on the job, but he can also have fun and let loose; at times during circumstances, he can be very sweet to others.<br /><br />The film isn't just about a self-efficient job-killer having a change of heart after encountering a few people and in regards to his sister's wedding plan, it's about downsizing.  Besides actors like J.K. Simmons and The Hangover guy playing the parts, there's actual unemployed business workers being used during the firing scenes.  They add some degree of authenticity for these troubled moments, and their responses (whether they're verbatim or improv) range from amusing to depressing.  It's mostly amusing, but at times a few of them can be pretty grim, especially the one that's threatening to jump over a bridge; that one I'm not sure if that's an actor or not, but the response was so mute and to-the-point that it's haunting.  I'm reminded how bad job losses can affect people, and for others like Jason Bateman as Bingham's boss, the companies' losses are their gain.<br /><br />I learned a lot from \\"Up in the Air\\", such as how to efficiently pack to go places, knowing the workings of Bingham's profession, the benefits of travel, and pigeonholing people properly; it's all done in a humorous light, but that doesn't make the film any less thought-provoking.  It kept me enthralled from beginning to the bittersweet end, and boy, was it mundane.  I knew about its certain turnaround and it still left me feeling bad.  From that point on showed Clooney's best performance, because he kept it all inside; he presents despair without actually expressing it, a true testament of acting.  A lot of things have been talked about in this movie, but it's what it showed that meant something, for Bingham to experience the joy of others and to realize the inescapable reality of his way of life.<br /><br />If these parts don't piece together one of the best films of 2009, I don't what is.

B001S33D1G|5.0|Have you ever wish for a different life?  Or have you ever thought life was unfair?  Well, Coraline Jones did.  A young girl named Coraline has a huge imagination, and is bored with her new house and her busy parents.  The only thing that interests her is the mysterious door that is bricked shut.  One night Coraline heard noises and found that the door had opened and the bricks weren't there.  The door leads into a world of excitement with talking animals, delicious food, and other parents.  But is this world to good to be true?    In that life your problems will fade away with nicer, caring parents, delicious food, entertaining toys, and anything you could ever dream of.  Yet in this marvelous world you still miss your other life with your real family and friends and want to go back.  But what would happen if it's too late to return to your true life?  Would you fight to go back or just give up?  In the book Coraline, by Neil Gaiman, Coraline Jones faces these questions and many other problems in hope to go back to her real life and save her parents.    The main plot of the story follows a young girl with a huge imagination named Coraline Jones.  Coraline finds herself bored with her view house and her parents who are too busy to talk to her.  The only thing that interests her is a small, mysterious door that opens to a brick wall.  Then one night Coraline heard noises that lead her to that same door but, it was unlocked and the bricks had disappeared.  The door lead into a world of excitement with talking animals, delicious food, and other parents who talk and care for her unlike her real parents.  Coraline then starts to get scared when her other parents pressure her to stay forever with them by sewing buttons on to her eyes.  When she questions if she should or not the other mother gets angry with her so she steals her real parents and rides them.  In hope of freedom, Coraline offers to play a game to save the lost souls', her parents, and herself.  Will Coraline win or lose the game?  This book is for all ages who love adventure, fantasy and suspense.  It shows adventure when she travels into the other world in search of her parents and when she has to play a game to win them back.  The suspense comes in when the reader wonders if Coraline will get her life and parents back or stay in the other world forever.  This book is very unique and hasn't read anything like it before.  I think that the book Coraline is a lot like many Tim Burton films. I think they are a like because they both give off a creepy, mystical, and interesting vibe.  They are both very bizarre though too.  This book was made into a movie too, which is a Tim Burton film.  If you enjoyed the movie, you will like the book.  The only thing that might disappoint you is you don't get the crazy exciting colorful visuals that the movie gives you.  Something I love about the book, Coraline, is how the author paints a picture for you.  An example of the author's descriptive writing is, \\"It wasn't the kind of rain you could go out in - it was the other kind, the kind that threw itself down the sky and splashed where it landed ... turning the garden into a muddy wet soup.  Also it has a wide range of interesting personalities of the characters.  One of the most interesting characters is the black cat who can talk.  He is mysterious who seems to know everything about the other world.  The only down side to the book is it is a little bizarre and confusing at points.    It's bizarre because you might think the idea of walking through a door going into another world is weird and unrealistic.  It can also be confusing on how Coraline got into a certain place because there is no transition when a character is going place to place.    Overall this book is a great easy read full of adventure.  I really enjoyed it. Read this mystical and exciting book and see for yourself.

0439023491|5.0|Have you ever had to fight for your life? Twice? I don't think so this review is about the book Catching Fire.  This book is filled with twists and turns leaving u guessing at every flip of a page.<br /> This is a continuation of the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. Its about a girl Katniss and a boy Petta and how they face their devastating lives in district 12 (their city) and not knowing what they have in store for them next.  In their district they face people dying of starvation everyday with no solution because the capitol isn't feeding them. Well they haven't seen anything till the quarter quells come up....<br /> This book is mainly for teens around 12 to 16ish and this is a fantasy book about 16 year old boy and girl.<br /> This book is a lot like the Lightening Thief. If you liked that book u will absolutely love this book has many of the same characteristics. Like how there is a lot action and suspense.<br /> I think Suzanne Collins did a really good job in this book on never making u want to put the book down. I also think she did a very good job on the plot because not only was it well written the plot of the book is what made it interesting. This book flew past all my expectations with this. All though the begging was kind of slow once u get past chapter 2 u will love it, and lastly I think the ending was kind of bad it made it sound like my 3rd book wasn't going to be to good.<br /> As you can tell I really liked this book and you should go get it right now and I guarantee you will love it as much as me.

Hugo walked up to the ashes and found the auto man.... I loved this book I read t was the most exciting book I have ever read.      Hugo Carbret is an orphan who has discovered an auto man in his father's attic were he works. Hugo steals little toys from Georges toy shop he bought when he sold all of his art work. Hugo got caught stealing toys from the shop and Georges started to scream for the Station inspector, but he wasn't around. Hugo runs back into the vent and up to the clock shop. Hugo discovers that Melies was a famous magician and the auto man was his trick that left his audience speechless.    The Story of Hugo Carbret doesn't seem similar to any other books I've read. There are four strengths.1 of the strengths is it has pictures the second is it ahs great detail. The third strength is it really expresses the feeling of the author. The final strength is it shows that picture and word books can be fun.         The audience for Hugo Carbret I am reading is for kids with huge imaginations and dreams. The genre of my book is mystery. Also the audience is the ages between 10-13.

0451203933|4.0|BOOK REVIEW          Have you heard about the war on the news? How violent it is or is going to be and how it's going to affect us. Black Hawk Down is like this, it's about the United States going to Africa and trying to capture two warlords. In this attempt their plane was shot down and from there they made desperate acts and had used reckless behavior to save their fellow soldiers and themselves.       I think people 14 and up should read this book because of the language and words in this book. The audience that would probably read this book is people who are into warfare and people who like action because the language it uses is all military terms and also the action in the book is very intense. The author keeps the same audience through out the book because as you get deeper it gets more intense. I feel this book is non-fiction because it actually happened. This book is the same as other war books I've read because they are all non-fiction.        I think black hawk down is like Saving Private Ryan a movie based in World War II. Because the characters form both movies/books make dangerous attempts to save soldiers behind enemy lines.        Black Hawk Down is an intense book and is a book with a great story line. It s just a amazing book with great action.

1933771690|5.0|This is a fascinating book which posits that if we accept the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics at face value, a new and revolutionary understanding of the world is possible.   Lanza marries Physics with Biology to produce a scientifically grounded world-view which he calls Biocentrism. In a nutshell, the theory states that the physical world doesn't exist in actuality until we observe it AND since all observation takes place inside the human brain, reality (even physical reality) is wholly a construct of human consciousness. While this sounds somewhat audacious on the it's face, there is some extremely good science behind Lanza's amazingly understandable argument and the author presents his case in a manner which is accessible to all. Even if you don't have any previous knowledge of quantum weirdness, this book is comprehendible and, if for no other reason, this makes the book useful.   If you ever wanted to understand the basic strangeness of the quantum world but felt daunted by the scope of the task, read this book and it will make sense to you. If you are initiated into such subject matter and you've started to wonder why there's been no fundamental break throughs in our understanding of the world since the first half of the 20th century, read this book. It's possible that science has been speeding down the wrong track for 75 years because scientists refused to accept what physics experiments were telling them at face value.   Whether the theory of Biocentrism is actually right, wrong or somewhere in between, it's a fascinating and thought provoking read.

B000JLQSWE|3.0|The Alan Parsons Project made a serious move towards pop when \\"Vulture Culture\\" made its appearance in 1985. No opening instrumental. No orchestrations. And for the first time in many albums, no hit single. Granted, it may have been the years catching up to them (the APP's 8th album in 10 years), but \\"Vulture Culture\\" also feels a bit lackluster by Parson's own usual high standards.<br /><br />The theme this time is man's general self-centeredness and predatory nature, stated rather bluntly in the opening \\"Let's Talk About Me.\\" But this time, the concept feels more contrived than previous albums that so masterfully fused their ideas (like [[ASIN:B000IOM1YG Pyramid]] or [[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]]). The musicianship and production is newly highlighted in the remaster, and APP's usual team of stalwart musicians and vocalists are on board. Saxophonist Richard Collte in particular adds depth to some of the songs here, especially on the de-rigueur instrumental, \\"Hawkeye.\\"<br /><br />\\"Vulture Culture\\" does have a few highlights. The ballad \\"Days are Numbers (The Traveller)\\" should have been the first single. Graced with a gorgeous chorus and a splendid vocal from Chris Rainbow, it rates with [[ASIN:B000IOM1Z0 \\"Time\\"]] as one of the Project's finest songs. Surprisingly, one of the other high points comes from a bonus track, the previously unreleased \\"No Answers Only Questions.\\" A gentle folk ballad that probes the concept's question of why mankind seems so bent on competing so aggressively against each other.<br /><br />The late Eric Woolfson writes in the liner-notes that, at the time, he and Parsons didn't think the song fit into the overall theme of \\"Vulture Culture.\\" Now featured as a bonus track, \\"No Answers Only Questions\\" strikes a nice coda to the original album and, with the passing of Woolfson in November 2009, posts an additional note on the legacy of what a gifted singer/composer he was. In my opinion, \\"Vulture Culture\\" is on a par with [[ASIN:B000NJVWU0 Eve]] in the canon of APP albums; not bad, but one that could be set aside for better works first.APP albums; not bad, but one that could be set aside for better works first.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|Avatar took me to a new world where I found myself not wanting to leave ever.  It sadden me throughout the movie that eventually the inevitable end would come. The opening seen flying over the forest blew me away, and right there I knew I had just witnessed something I have never seen and this would continue to blow my mind throughout the movie. It was beautiful and more real than life. Like if we could see more detail in our world, this move showed us that.  I love nature and wildlife, and many times I see something and it looks just so beautiful.  This movie is like that but all the time.  It really touched me, just the beauty aspect. The plot was good (thats my opinion), but now that I have read reviews I can see teh dullness.  But most movies have aspects of other great movies, it just matters how you portray them and deliver teh emotion.  It felt weird feeling emotion for these 10' tall blue creatures, but it wasn't hard with their lifelike faces that express so much feelings.  Its amazing what Cameron did with this movie. Avatar has changed my outlook on movies and the capabilities of modern CGI technology.  I have never walked away from a movie and missed it like I did with Avatar. For the short 2 hours and 40 mins I was not just sitting in my seat, but taken on an adventure through the lands you could only imagine. 10/10

0143036556|4.0|After the magnum opus Guns, Germs, and Steel, the Pulitzer Prize winner Jared Diamond releases the follow-up Collapse, in which he uses a comparative analysis to show why some societies collapse while some others succeed. Although the complexity of the issue makes Diamond's analyses not consistently persuasive, still the book is among the most informative in this area, taking into account of its detailed evidence, scientific methodology, and multidisciplinary approaches.      To investigate the collapse of societies, Diamond employs a five-point framework of possible factors: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trade partners, and the society's responses to its environmental problems. He thereafter contrasts past collapsed societies with survived ones. Their different fate is partly attributed to the environmental differences i.e. some environments are more fragile than the others. A highlight here is the statistical analyses between the degree of deforestation on 81 Pacific islands and 9 physical variables. The statistical model predicted that the Easter Island should be among the worst deforested while Tikopia Island should be much more sustainable, which agrees with what actually happened. However, Diamond is not an environmental or geographical determinist. He lays particular emphasis on the societies' types of economy, values, and their response to environmental problems. It is exemplified by the story of Norse and Inuit, who shared the fragile Greenland, but held different values. Their fate was also diverged: the Norse Greenland died while the Inuit are still living in the island.     The collapse of the Norse Greenland illustrates an essential theme of the book: the fate of one society is largely determined by its choice whether to cling to traditional values or to change. The Greenland Norse refused to \\"jettison part of their identity as a European, Christian, pastoral society\\" and as a result, they died. In contrast, Tikopia Islanders survived because they did not cling to their traditional values e.g., they abandoned raising ecologically destructive pigs even though the pigs were important as the only large domestic animal and the principal status symbol.     Diamond's five-point framework to explain the failure or success of past societies is convincing. However, considering his objective is to tell contemporary societies what they should learn from the history and thereafter take favorable measures to achieve success, the crux becomes whether the parallels between the past and the present are appropriate. According to Diamond, their most obvious difference is that much more people are living in our planet today, retaining much more potent technology that impacts the environment. Thus, the risks for us today become higher. In addition, globalization could prompt the risks to become worldwide decline instead of in isolation collapse just like the case of Easter Island. Therefore, Diamond claims that the collapse of past societies is relevant to the modern world, which is in fact at higher risks. However, he overlooks that all of the past societies that he investigated are founded on agriculture, but the present societies are greatly relying on industry. They are entirely different in that agriculture is susceptible to climate change and environmental degradation while industry is relatively insensitive to these conditions. Hence it is debatable to make parallels between the past and the present societies.     Nevertheless, modern societies could learn from the past because environmental problems have been undermining the quality of our life. Furthermore, the choice of values is still important for us to solve the problems and perhaps will influence our fate. An example is about China, which he calls the \\"lurching giant\\" and is besieged by severe environmental problems. Because of China's large population and economy, its environmental problems will not be restricted to domestic issues but will affect the whole world. More importantly, if China finally reaches First World levels, our earth will be definitely overburdened. However, no other countries have a right to prevent its economic development. Thus, the contradiction may ultimately evolve into a political issue. This case favors Diamond's claim that we cannot solve our problems without a change in human values, which agrees with the principle of \\"the Tragedy of the Commons\\".    In the concluding section, Diamond explains why some societies make decisions that appear to be obviously self-destructive. \\"What did the Easter Islander say when he was cutting down the last palm tree in the island?\\" \\"We will find substitutes for wood.\\"? Or: \\"This is my property. I can do whatever I want!\\"? Or: \\"Sorry, but I really need a canoe.\\"? Diamonds prefers answering this with \\"landscape amnesia,\\" which refers to the failure of people to perceive the gradual change surrounding them. \\"No one would have noticed the falling of the last little palm sapling.\\" Failure to perceive a problem, together with failure to anticipate it, failure to solve it, or failure even to try to solve it, comprises the road map of bad decision-making.     Undoubtedly, not everyone agrees with Diamond's viewpoints. Opposition has been directed against some of his foundations. Such oppositions is exemplified by Jennifer Marohasy, who disagreed with his claim that Australian land is unproductive, and it has been irreversibly damaged. In addition, the book is a slightly redundant in some chapters e.g., the story about the Norse Greenland. However it is still an enlightening book. Diamond's broad knowledge and plain writing style should prompt the public to take serious action in response to environmental problems.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|Hi, just came from a midnight showing of James Cameron's Avatar. THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!  If you can afford it pay for the 3D version it is incredible.  This is how animated and real life should be worked.  Reminded me of Star Wars with the alien environment looking believable.  This movie raises the bar like the original Star Wars did when Gorge Lucas came out with a Scifi movie that didn't use rubber suits and pie pans for special effects.  The story line is universal and the story is very engrossing.  If you can afford it take your significant other or go by yourself it is worth seeing on the big screen in 3d.  Oh for the adults out there with kids this movie is too violent for children.  I am one of those people who think that violence depicted on the big screen is more harmful than a pair of naked breasts. That said I would recommend this motion picture to anyone who thinks that 3D movies are for children or lowbrow-ed society.  This is the only 3D movie I have ever gone to that was worth the extra money to see it.  The thing that made this movie for me was the environment and the work that went into making the 3D characters and environment seem real.  My hat is off to Mr. Cameron for this great piece of cinematography melded with 3D.
B002IVLH60|5.0|Each album is not any better or worse than the last one, THEY ARE ALL 100% GREAT, and each are different in their own ways. BACKSPACER is great from start to finish, and the lyrics are just incredible, music too as always, sounds AWESOME on 180 gram vinyl on my turntable cranked up as LOUD as my stereo can handle. I personally recommend, heck, any of the tracks here. I got to see them twice in Seattle in September 2009 (10th and 11th shows for me), and they were having just as much fun playing this new, and their earlier stuff. Great live show, they always play like they're never going to play again, great to be a part of.
067101756X|1.0|Something tells me the author did not write this. It adds further weight to the idea that if anything crashed at Roswell, NM, it was carefully staged. The event would cover the reality of disc aircraft with a layer of an otherworldly origin that would put the UFO into the realm of the unknowable for the public. It cannot be attributed to an accidental leak to the press. An actual craft from another world could potentially change the global balance of power. I suspect even the Russians were laughing at the nonsensical balloon debris explanation.    Anyone who has studied the work of Nikola Tesla would know that the groundwork was laid by this man. I suggest looking up the date and location for the world's first electron microscope. Whoever wrote this book was hoping for a trusting audience who would not look elsewhere, or do their own research. I suggest Flying Saucer Aircraft by Bill Rose as a starting point.
B001FB55YE|3.0|3 of 5 stars to the very odd action movie RocknRolla. The first thing to notice about this movie is the fast crisp style of editing with cut-away scenes that jump around to various story lines. The overall color tones of the photography were kinda like a colorized black and white movie. I think they were going for an old \\"mobster\\" (gang) look and feeling. The next thing is too many characters that are not well defined. I was constantly trying to remember who I was seeing and what they have to do with the story. The background was pulsating and quick paced to match the editing style of the movie. So, I just finished watching the whole movie and yet I'm not sure that I can write a summary other than: Russian mafia meets up with London's biggest crime boss. It is a long movie at 1h54m and felt long as I was constantly lost. This one needs a couple of watchings to get it sorted out.<br /><br />So, I'll give it a marginal recommendation and suggest you be prepared to really focus on the movie with your brain engaged.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I saw it at a midnight 3D screening after a long day, and never once closed my eyes, except when I absolutely had to blink. The movie is absorbing and seamless, and the invented technology and biology interesting and convincing. The plot moves with economy and speed; the action is dynamic and makes sense. Cameron is a disciplined filmmaker being generous with his audience: a rare combination in a blockbuster, most of which are nowadays made by directors who, regardless of talent, have no discipline (Gore Verbinsky, Michael Bay) or have turned stingy (Steven Spielberg.)<br /><br />The protagonist is a fine surrogate, recognizably callow and human, and the actor gives a good performance, but (in another instance of Cameron's generosity,) the movie belongs to two women: the scientist played by Sigourney Weaver, and especially the Na'vi romantic lead. This is Cameron's best since \\"Aliens\\", and a timely reminder that he never merely  replicates a past success, and always (except for \\"True Lies\\") pushes forward and outward not just the technology but the art of popular cinema. Because his movies are experiments, they are not perfect. But I don't see others improving on them, do you?
0441013597|5.0|The year is 1981 and my father is reading Dune aloud to my mother in their bedroom. The door is open, and even though I'm supposed to be in bed, I keep creeping out of my room to hear the story. Since I have just learned how to read, my ambitious father has tried to get me to read the Hobbit--and failed--due to my childish dislike of tea parties. (Don't worry, I will eventually read the Hobbit on my own and love it. I will also eventually love tea parties. The world continues in its course.) Little does Dad know that he is unleashing science fiction with all its transformative ideas on his four year old daughter. I eventually get tired of waiting for my parents to read Dune at night and start sneaking it out during the day. Granted, my first reviews of Dune (exposited to my patient mother) run along extremely limited lines like: \\"And then Paul runs into the desert and lives in the caves and wears a stilsuit and rides giant worms!\\" But with each successive reading the world of Arrakis opened up further and further, with new implications to consider. This was science fiction as I imprinted on it.     Dune is an epic and densely plotted science fiction novel. Herbert was obviously exploring ideas about ecology, evolution, biology, inheritance, colonialism, war, drugs, and most especially, religion, as he tracks the journey of Paul Atreides from promising ducal heir to guerilla fighter to religious figure. We are introduced to Paul and his mother, on the departure from Paul's birthworld, Caladan, a water-rich planet much like Earth. The departure is inevitable, as Paul's father, Duke Leto has been maneuvered into a switch of planetary fiefs for political reasons. Paul, adolescent, on the cusp of early manhood, will be tested by the Bene Gesserit, a religious order founded in eugenics theory, dedicated to providing mankind with their ultimate saviour. They believe Paul has a chance to be that saviour, the Kwisatz Haderach, but are not completely sure. They can not affordto have a potential Messiah haring off to the arse-end of the universe without examining his potential. Paul passes their test, and is declared human, although the Bene Gesserit reserve their judgement on his full potential. They warn him of the political trap set for his family, but more or less, consign he and his mother to the vagaries of fate.     Arrakis, aka Dune, while a desert planet, is not entirely barren. For one thing, it is the sole location in the known universe where spice (the wonder drug of the 11,000s) can be produced via complicated biological processes involving giant sandworms. Space-faring navigators require this drug to perform their role, the wealthy of the galaxy live and die by the production of spice, and the major religions and science/technological orders use spice as well to enhance prescience or mental faculties. The previous rulers of Arrakis, the Harkonnens, are also life-long enemies of Paul's family, the Atreides. The Harkonnen, as one might imagine, are pretty pissed (outwardly) about being forced to give up their motherlode of wealth and power, and have already set in motion plans to seize what they once held and overthrow the Atreides once and for all. (Nifty writer trick that Herbert pulls off here: He doesn't try to conceal the big horrible plan or the main bad guys or the betrayer. He tells you. In the second chapter! And it works, because while we know, the Atreides do not fully know how to evade the trap that is being set for them.)    When the jaws of the Harkonnen trap finally close around the Atreides family, Paul and his mother are forced to take to the harsh desert of Arrakis to escape. It is out in the desert that Paul meets up with the indigenous people of Arrakis, the Fremen. He and Jessica agree to teach the Fremen their Bene Genesserit ways in exchange for the Fremen knowledge about the desert. The Fremen also believe that Paul might be the prophesied Kwisatz Haderach, something which Paul and Jessica duly exploit as Paul grows to adulthood. As he grows in power, he works to overthrow the Harkonnen.    This is pretty much my go-to book for science fiction virtuosity. It sits next to Enders Game and Foundation on my shelves as the classics from my childhood. Frank Herbert does an excellent job of seemingly effortless world building. He doesn't try to clumsily exposit the mythical references upon which the bedrock of Dune's religious ambience is built. (Unlike the clumsily written prequels offered up by his son and Kevin J. Anderson, who decide inexplicably to shuffle half the mythos out and replace with things like \\"feng shui\\" in the Bene Gesserit birthing rooms. Give the prequels a pass, as the two I read made only the most cursory attempt to align with Herbert's original vision.) He doesn't bang you over the head with science, although one character Kynes is prone to philosophical musings about biology. There's a wonderful balance of court intrigue, military politics, ecological concerns, questions of morality, explorations of religion, and Machiavellian ruler-princes deciding how to best run the universe. For the action-starved, tense scenes with killer storms and giant sandworms larger than buildings will keep you turning the pages. Arrakis is rendered with gritty, textured harshness, and the struggle of humans to transform their world and their universe is set in strong relief against this.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I've been a fan of 30 Seconds to Mars for a long time and was so excited when I heard this album. It's very Depeche Mode, U2, Nine Inch Nails and The Cure inspired. It pays homage to those bands but they definitely add their own style with the amazing drumming, loud but sometimes soft vocals and the melodic guitar. It's their best album to date and I've already bought multiple copies to support this awesome band.
B002NUULNG|4.0|Movie:  4.5/5  Video Quality:  4.5/5  Audio Quality:  5/5  Extras:  2.5/5  Overall:  4.1/5 (rounded down in total star ranking)<br /><br />This was the second genuine anime film I ever watched, and even after repeated viewings I've been confused and confounded by it.  It may be short and it may boast some cool action scenes, but for the most part it is a tight, complex, and highly cerebral thriller.  The combination of philosophy, psychology, technology, and politics is often overwhelming in this film.<br /><br />Only recently have I been able to understand the movie's plot and issues, and I must say that it is a very sublime picture with some very deep issues concerning the human soul, technology, and society.  For that matter, each viewing does reveal deeper meaning.  On this basis, the movie not only makes for quintessential anime, but it is also an essential (and influential) piece of cyberpunk sci-fi.<br /><br />The movie's plot and characters may seem muddled, but they have nuances and complexities of their own.  I do find that other features in the \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" series (namely, \\"Innocence,\\" \\"Stand Alone Complex,\\" and \\"Solid State Society\\") offer easier storylines and more understandable characters, but they are not quite as original or distinctive as what's in this film.  The movie is slowly-paced, but has lots of interesting visuals and some brilliant action scenes.  Production design features some very interesting and original sets, props, costumes, vehicles, and weapons.  Music is interesting.<br /><br />For better or for worse, this disc showcases the 2.0 version, which offers enhanced CGI effects to replace certain scenes, as well as an enhanced soundtrack and a new music score.  These changes do offer a different color palette than the theatrical cut, and the image overall looks cleaner, sharper, and more detailed.  Above all, it is visually and conceptually more compatible with other features in the \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" series.<br /><br />This disc offers decent quality.  The video looks very clean, with excellent color and contrast.  It is sharp with plenty of details; textures are strong and pencil lines are thin.  I saw no signs of visual noise, pixilation, or aliasing.  The only issue worth noting is that some scenes may have bright auras, but this is notably less intrusive on Blu-Ray than it is on DVD.  A few scenes showed some slight banding as well.  Sound quality is excellent (DTS-HD MA 6.1, lossless), and you have a choice between English dubbing and the original Japanese, with optional subtitles.  Extras include a making-of feature, character profiles, creator biographies, and a trailer.<br /><br />One of the special features is the original theatrical cut of the movie.  Video quality on the original film in 1080i is notably weaker, for it shows greater pixilation, aliasing, and film artifacts.  Colors are also more washed-out, but some colors are notably different than the 2.0 version (more blues and greens in certain scenes).  Regardless, it is still a sharp and clean image.  Sound quality is good, and it has the same language and subtitle options as the 2.0 feature.oks very clean, with excellent color and contrast.

B000UR9T8C|2.0|The classic sequel formula poured out again: More villains, bigger sets, more special effects, more falling objects, longer time to watch - and of course, it's all superfluous. We've seen Mary Jane saved from a falling death in the last two films. Why does this have to be like this again? It gets really stale after awhile. The parts where Peter turns mean after putting on the Venom suit are unintentionally hilarious. Suddenly Peter's hair is black and Goth, and he scowls a lot, acting more like a real New Yorker would. He then has an urge to dance at a local bar. SP3 gets way off track here. Just more evidence of a fat, overdone flop that leaves us (like Star Wars 3, Matrix 3, et al.) sad and wondering why directors have to screw their own public over and tarnish their original work.    And that's why they're doing Spider Man 4.
0380730405|5.0|Published in 1938, REBECCA was the third major work of novelist Daphne du Maurier (1907-1989), who was previously best known for the 1936 novel JAMACIA INN.  Critical reception was lukewarm.  Some accused the novel of being emotionally overwrought; others pointed out that plot was commonplace; still others described it as little more than a modern reworking of Charotte Bronte's JANE EYRE.  But it was an instance in which the public was far head of the critics: it flew off bookstore shelves and quickly became one of the most popular novels of its era.  It has never been out of print, and over time critical assesment has changed.  REBECCA is now widely considered one of the great English novels of the 20th Century.<br /><br />The story does indeed have roots in the gothic romance novels of the 1800s and most particularly in Bronte's JANE EYRE.  The narrator, whose name is never noted in the novel, is a young and socially inexperienced woman who meets, loves, and marries wealthy aristocrat Maxim de Winter.  But there is an unexpected darkness.  Maxim has been previously married.  His first wife died in a tragic boating accident.  Her name was Rebecca.<br /><br />When the second Mrs. de Winter arrives at Manderley, the great estate of the de Winter family, she finds it maintains a routine specified by Rebecca and enforced by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who was Rebecca's servant.  She senses Rebecca's presence throughout the house.  She begins to compare herself to Rebecca and finds herself sadly lacking.  She wonders why Maxim married her, a woman with no background, breeding, wealth, or beauty.  Her intensifying insecurities not only prey upon her mind, they make her vulnerable to the manipulations of those on the estate, Mrs. Danvers in particular, who regard her as an unworthy outsider.<br /><br />But the second Mrs. de Winter has dangerously misjudged not only her own situation but the truth behind Rebecca's seemingly endless hold upon Maxim, Mrs. Danvers, and the estate.  It has a darker basis than she suspects--and the great grace of the novel, which lifts it from the commonplace to the status of masterpiece, is du Maurier's ability to endow her characters with shockingly plausible life and to communicate the narrator's turn of mind through a delicately crafted yet amazingly powerful poetic narrative.  From first line to last word, Rebecca rises like a ghost from the pages of the novel, as mysterious as the sea mist that so often encroaches on the lawns of the estate, as tangible as a tea tray by the fire--and all without ever once directly appearing in the novel.  It is a remarkable literary feat.<br /><br />The novel, of course, was translated into an equally famous film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine.  Those who come to the book from the film will be surprised: although the film every effectively captures the tone of the book, it follows the story only up to a point, for the book's plot was not acceptable to the film censors of the day.  But regardless of whether you come to the novel from the film or simply come to the novel cold, REBECCA is a brilliant work, and while she wrote a great many other fine works it remains Daphne du Maurier's great accomplishment, and indeed one of the great accomplishments of 20th century fiction.  Strongly recommmended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerate.

B0026P3G12|3.0|I was really disappointed in all the shmaltzy overdone arrangements.  Susan Boyle has a beautiful powerful voice...she doesn't need all that nor does it allow her audience to really hear her.  The volume was in all the orchestration often drowning her out and competing with her beautiful voice.  This is her producers and managers not trusting the audience to get it.  We've all heard her with little more than a piano or just her voice.  This was allowing the mixers way too much input in the final product.  Damn it.  Let her sing!    The lack of variation in tone, type of song, and tempo is a mistake.  If Susan herself made these decisions, then her managers are not advising her well.    In an album of 12 ballads, there should have been at least two other songs to show her range rhythmically and variation in tone quality.    Let's hope her next album or concert lets her get to the depth of her being.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|Cliche this, cliche that, geeze folks, this movie wasn't going for the cutting edge, Oscar winning fairytale.  It is a sweet movie with a sweet message.  Catherine O'Hara is fabulously funny, and Christina Ricci, whose acting I am not fond of, is actually likeable in this movie.  The ideals of beauty (both male and female) step away from the mainstream Megan Foxes and Zac Efrons.  My 2 and 5-year old daughters fell in love with the movie as did I, but I guess watching it through your children's eyes suppresses our own adult cynicism and expectations of entertainment.   I'm always happy to sit down and watch it with them.

I'm a Solutions Engineer for the world's most well known company that creates creative digital tools and services. I do a ton of presentations and demonstrations of our tools yearly. Mr. Gallo's book on the techniques Steve Jobs uses will enhance my presentation/demo skills right way. I rate how many yellow hiligter pens I go through underlining tips, tricks and wisdom in books.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|Norah Jones captivated us and won a Grammy for her first work and then fell short with the next two albums.  She's back! That sultry, sexy voice we loved in the first album is in this but with the bonus of some updated, more complicated instrumentals tossed in. This feels like Norah is just hitting her stride, growing up and taking herself seriously as a musician again. Buy this. You'll like it and will find yourself playing it over and over, discovering nuances each time you listen that you might have missed the first time around.   I honestly hesitated before spending money on this new work after the last two proved such a disappointment but, I'm a die hard fan, took the risk and am not in the least disappointed. Two thumbs up.....

They are all excellent but, none capture my attention like Porcupine Tree.  Their sound is not different, from album to album, and yet, they are not a formula band.  Every album is chock full of interest, surprise, and emotion.  I thought progressive rock was dead.  Boy was I wrong.  Porcupine Tree has resurrected progressive rock like nobody's business.  The Incident is every bit as good as is In Absentia (which I did not like when I first heard it), Stupid Dream, Lightbulb Sun, Signify, and Fear of a Blank Planet (which is the album that really sold me on Porcupine Tree).  Now, after listening to all these albums, and several others, for the last few years, I have come to know just what Porcupine Tree is all about: progressive rock at its finest.  The music of Porcupine Tree may not be the most complicated progressive rock ever produced but, it sure is some of the best.

Even if you have seen the movie, the book is different with the same plot so it is worth the read. Personally, I think the book was better than the movie. The only negative is that it jumps from story to story which is somewhat confusing, but what makes it also so interesting. I would recommend this book to the fans of the movie or if people have not yet seen the movie and want to, they should read the book first.

And, of course, his daughter gets kidnapped.<br /><br />Neeson does a superb job of turning within the course of about fifteen seconds from a concerned father into a walking, barking, unstoppable killing machine.  The reason the film is believable is because of Neeson's blank facial expression, his ability to switch off his emotions in a deadly second, and his ruthlessness.  Whoever trained the actor in whatever martial art/self defense skills did a good job.  And Mills is no angel.  There are scenes in which he way too far.  There is nothing sentimental about it.  He wants his daughter and nothing going to stop him unless it's a very well placed bullet.<br /><br />Though some of this might strike the viewer as a bit far fetched, it is Liam Neeson's performance that makes it worth watching.  A riveting, chilling movie.
0545123267|5.0|I'm not going to waste time going through the plot, as so many reviewers have done that brilliantly already. All I will say is that this book is beautifully and evocatively written. I usually detest books that switch between the perspective of different characters, but the author made everything flow so seamlessly in this book that I was swept into the mood of the story and didn't care about the character change. In fact, I enjoyed hearing both voices (which, as my friends will tell you, is beyond belief lol).    I inhaled this book in one night, but its feel lingers on in my thoughts, with a dream-like quality that I find very refreshing.  Read it, you won't be sorry. It's way more beautiful than I anticipated.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|The opening scene with Aldo Raine stating his mission to his \\"Bastards\\" will be about the last riviting scene you will see until the very end.  Yes, Christoph Waltz is brilliant, but he and the other actors are harmed by Tarentino's overindulgence and his vision of himself as auteur, when here he's ultimately a derivitive hack.  I had high hopes for this one, but the trailer was better edited than the film. A story that's basically a \\"what if\\" fantasy must keep an almost break-neck pace to maintain your suspension of disbelief, but the director failed with scenes running too long and destroying the tension. The clever and supposedly resourceful Raine looks like and idiot when he leaves behind two bodies that can be easily identified and the viewer is left unsatisfied when the character Shoshanna is denied the specific revenge the story needs to be fulfilling. Go head and watch it out of curiosity, but don't expect to care about watching it again. Unless, of course, if you like the blood and gore for it's own sake, but here it's so prosaic and \\"we've seen it all before\\" that I yawned. Maybe you'll enjoy long draggy scenes with card games and little falters as actors reveal that they are acting but I think Tarentino spoiled all the fun. And if you're going to trample all over the war and the vets and victims you better make sure it's fun

B0021L8UPS|1.0|Not sure what the crew were going for with one, but Verma Fermiga and Peter Sarsgaard were completely wasted in this tedious, unbelievable, uninspiring film that hijacks \\"Omen\\" scares so thoroughly one has to wonder if the director watched the box set and then shot the film ad lib.<br /><br />Okay, so an artsy alcoholic wife (Vera Farmiga)and painfully naive, emasculated husband (Peter Sarsgaard) decide to adopt a child after already having two.  One is a deaf little girl.  The other is a boy who likes to shoot paintballs at pigeons.  Don't they have their hands full already?<br /><br />Another great actress, CCH Pounder, does her best to redeem this mess as a Catholic nun who without apparently knowing much about a girl named Esther who has been in her orphanage for four or five years decides to give her to the family.  Voila.  The stage is set for an absurd series of events so ridiculous and beyond belief that Roger Corman might have blushed.<br /><br />How the hell could two people with functioning cerebellums not know that a 9 year old who can paint detailed pictures a la Matisse and NEVER TAKES OFF HER VICTORIAN STYLE MINIATURE SACHE is not a nine year old girl?<br /><br />The gullability of the parents is simply amusing.  It stops being frustrating and starts to get drop dead hilarious.  Maybe Esther learned to play Tchaikovsky when she was 2.  Maybe Esther didn't throw the kid off the playground slide and break his arm even though they had a problem the day before.  Maybe she didn't kill the nun with a hammer even though she disappeared right before leaving their home.  Maybe she didn't try to set the little boy on fire and then run right into the hospital room to finish the job even though the doctor on call noticed the IV was missing and she just left to get a soda.  Even the last line, \\"I'm not your Mommy, b*tch!\\" was plagiarized from another terrible horror movie: The Ring 2.<br /><br />Awful.
B001NY4X46|5.0|I do love a good mystery with many plot twists. In this day and age the plot twists you may see coming, but the performance by the actors is very awesome. It was in this movie that I first came to LOVE Edward Norton, and Edward worth getting all excited about (stupid vamp). The man's talent has only grown with every passing movie. So if you like this genre of movie, I highly recommend it. :)
B002PMV9FG|2.0|I have read all the Harry Potter books and have seen all and own most of the movies.  This one is just the second in a disturbing trend started in The Order of the Phoenix.<br />Some of the best Tom Riddle's best memories are left out of this one.  Harry's inheritance of Sirius Black's home and house elf, an important part of understanding Regulis Black, is also left out.  Voldemort's own maternal and paternal histories, as well of what he thought of his mother has been left out.  There are so many things left out of this movie that made J.K. Rowling's book so good that I think as fans, we should demand a redo!!!<br />The one bright spot in this movie, however, is Alan Rickman (Snape).  In his face you could see his concern for all of the students involved in the inner circles of Voldemort and Dumbledore.
0099583917|1.0|A fearfully dull book in which the author cleverly, no doubt, records the history of very dull people of no interest!
B000P0J0AG|5.0|The scene that precedes Neil & Vincent's first meeting--the audacious tracking and interception of Neil's vehicle on an L.A. freeway to the soundtrack of Moby's 'New Dawn Fades'--is utterly superfluous but pure cinematic art.  This and other flourishes--like when Neil and Eady drive through the bright tunnel symbolizing a cleansing of the past and a new beginning, if for only a brief moment--defines Michael Mann's movies and sets him apart from other action filmmakers.<br /><br />The writing is terrific.  Neil and his close-knit associates bring into their midst a bad seed (Waingro), whose escape from Neil at the truck stop enables Waingro to deliver Trejo to Van Zant, who then tortures Trejo to learn about the bank robbery.  This tip to the police leads to Michael's death in the downtown shootout.  Neil, realizing the damage Waingro has wrought on his friends and their families and his own failure to kill Waingro earlier, makes the fateful detour to the Hotel Marquis, which leads to his own death at the hands of Vincent.<br /><br />My only question, and it's a small one: How did Waingro find Van Zant?  Neil doesn't know who the owner of the stolen securities are until Nate tells him, AFTER Waingro has already escaped.  I guess Waingro just gets a tip off the street, or maybe I've missed something.<br /><br />One of my favorite films that has only gotten better with age.
0439023483|1.0|This book has a special place in my reading life: By page two I so deeply disliked the protagonist that I could not keep reading. It wasn't the brutality (I love the ILIAD which has unmatched scenes of brutal combat) but the narrator was just someone I did not want to listen to anymore. Regardless of what goes on after page two, the author lost me right away. I've put down lots of books because I did not like the writer's style or the story, but never because I immediately disliked the protagonist.<br /><br />PS<br />I gave it another chance after a couple of months and the same thing happened. (How can anyone like a girl who starts out by trying to drown her sister's kitten?)
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful CD.  My wife is wearing it out.  Ms. Boyle's voice is fantastic (of course, we knew that already).  The selection of songs and delivery is marvelous.  Also, the inclusion of the lyrics in written form is a nice addition to the package.  Highly recommend to all.  We will be looking for an encore recording.  Would love to hear some American patriotic pieces, too (i.e. God Bless America, America the Beautiful, The Star Spangled Banner, et al).
0385343248|5.0|This is the review for this particular edition. I bought it from COSTCO when it carried this newest edition of all James Clavell's books. I heard his books for long time, like Shogun, Tai Pan, Noble House, but never read it before. So I decided to pick one, which Shogun was the one that I had the earliest impression. I got hooked into the story instantly. I can only say that James Clavell is a master story teller. The mix of Japanese culture and adventure story of the main character, both bring the thrill of the story, and also the learning of an exotic culture up and close. This is a book that is in the same level as Ken Follet's Pillars of Earth and World without End. All of them are about 1000 pages long, and I would say not even a single page is a waste.<br /><br />I also would like to comment on this edition. The paper quality and publish is excellent. I feel great with its sharp edge, bright paper, and the touch of the soft paper. It's an excellent combination of the choice that created a collectible feeling. I would highly recommend people to consider this edition vs any other edition out there.<br /><br />After I finished this book, I was just sold with all James Clavell's book. I feel regret that I didn't buy all of the books from COSTCO that time. COSTCO does not carry these books any more. So now, I am reading Tai Pan from my kindle, which turns out another great read.<br /><br />When I read a great book, I wish it never ends. I just had this feeling while reading Shogun. I almost feel lost when I reached final pages, and wished that the story to continue is another few hundred pages. It's truly a thousand page of enjoyment. Highly recommend for anyone loves Japanese history and culture.<br /><br />Oh, btw, I also watched the Shogun TV after reading the book. Good adaptation, and very honest to the original book. But some how I feel a lot of detail and person's inner thought cannot be possibly expressed through screen. People may just be lost without reading the book first.
0061537969|5.0|If you read fiction to have fun, enjoy the process, learn something and hopefully become emotionally involved please go ahead and read this wonderful book. On the other hand, if after 20 pages you feel it's going nowhere don't continue as this book is not for you. If you decide to finish it and let yourself go...you will have a whale of time while at the same time learning a lot about yourself, human nature and how life ticks. I have passed this book on to my son, and a couple of friends and all have enjoyed the book thoroughly!
B002TZS5GU|4.0|For what I think the makers of the movie were trying to do - it was great.  It reminded me a bit of \\"Cloverfield,\\" some of \\"I Am Legend,\\" somewhat of \\"The Happening,\\" and a lot of a lesser known Steven King movie \\"The Mist.\\"  This movie just makes you think.  How important is survival really?  Is it more important that being the kind of person you really want to be?  More important that love or compassion or decency or hope?  Also, Chris Pine was excellent.  I really hope we see more and more of him in movies.
0786868724|4.0|Mitch Albom has written a moving, reflective story that is a page-turner. His style of writing is engaging, but I felt a little let down in the end. The approach he uses--he leaves you hanging at the end of a several chapters--calls for some sort of climax, but it never appears. The story is about a journey however, and it is in the journey one understands the power of faith, but also of hope and love. It would have been nice if Mitch had an interaction with someone of the Islamic faith to help provide another perspective on faith related to the same God. I will recommend this book to others as it is a much needed, wonderful testament, during these trying times.

0140120416|4.0|I am very pleased with the product I ordered through Amazon. I received my book 4 days earlier than expected and in very good condition. The only problem was the packaging they shipped it in wasn't good for a book and the back cover and 5 of the pages got bent during shipment. Otherwise I am very happy with the easy ordering and fast delivery.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|This is simply the best interpretation of Mozart's Piano Concertos I've ever heard! I own three different sets and in my humble opinion this is the Holy Grail as far as recordings of Mozart Piano Concertos. Uchida's fingers (touch on the keys) work and finesse the pieces played into a musical tour de force. She truly does bring these pieces of music to life.<br /><br />I have listened to every piece played in this eight cd package and to be blunt: absolutely superb playing. I personally think The English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Jeffery Tate provides just the right canvas for this collage of music to come to artistic fruition. Phillips is recognized around the world for fabulous sound engineering in their recordings - they got all eight cds \\"just right\\".<br /><br />I have reviewed many classical cds on Amazon - This is a set that needs to be on every classical music lovers' shelf. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in this box set. I know that I am never parting with this set! What a great Christmas gift this set would be for a loved one or good friend! If you like piano and orchestra music that is involving, moving, and crystal clear to both ear and mind, order this set! Happy Holidays music lovers!
B00005N6KG|4.0|first off.  i love these headphones.  and i also love amazon especially since i am an amazon prime and amazon visa user.  but for a product like this, i would recommend buying it at a bestbuy and buying the extended warranty there.  so you can just walk in and get replacements.  i run quite often and these headphones can only take so much.  best running headphones IMO.      the nike (made by philips) version of these types of headphones is quite similiar.  but from personal experience (and other people's  experiences), i've had the actual headphones (attached to my iphone) shock me while i'm running.  so i would recommend these over the nike ones.    4 stars only because they are so fragile
B0000029LG|5.0|Anthony Wynn,<br /><br />Your reviews are great...D.S.  That is one heck of a song..  That song is about Thomas Sneddon the idiot that wanted to see him in prison at any cost..  He is truly a jerk!!!  I can't cant stand him!  He is nasty and dirty and probabbly a pedophile!  He tortured our michael and he is dirty!!!  I think that is who Michael was portraying in his song Ghost~Ghost of Jealousy..  Watch it, Michael reaks of pure GENIUS!!!  In that song the mayor wants him out of town lost gone Michael goes away but comes back..  Go watch it...  WOW!!!  The song is powerful and he is just remarkable with his words.  He is saying Dom Sheldon, but I think I know he is really talking about!!!<br /><br />Bad with Shaq....  Seriously, you dont like that?  I do, I love all of the song...  I think that he did a great job rapping, I wanna get up and boogie when I hear it..<br /><br />You are not alone I think Michael Jackson wrote that in fact I am like positive, I think he wrote that for Lisa Marie.  Nope, I know he did!!  Dangit, I wish he'd write a song for me..  HEE-HEE-  He so sexy..<br /><br />This album, you can hear a lot of anger.  He is getting it out, and wow it is so good.  I spent 32.00 for mine, but I am not complaining I'd buy it at that price again...  Michael Jackson is the cats meow!!!
031606792X|1.0|I got into Twilight about a year before the movies came out. I picked up at the Harry Potter midnight release party and read it that fall. I even meet Meyers twice. So I was SUPER excited when this book came out! I even went to what I think was the worst book release party that I have ever been to. So I finally get the book home and start to read it. Little did I know...I was reading the worst book that I have ever read in my life. I am going to break my review down into 2 different parts! Problems and solutions. (SPOILERS)     ***Problems  -the lack of detail. Do you know why everyone says that the wedding went by too fast? Because of NO detail.   -OOC everyone (Out of Character) I'm still trying to figure out who is Jazz?  -Bella's pregnancy. If Meyers could have a found a way that made sense...I would have bought it. But she didn't.  -Edward reaction to Bella's pregnancy. He leaves his wife to find Jacob and tell his that if he could convince Bella to get rid of the baby...he could have sex with his wife! EXCUSE ME??!! Who the hell is Edward to make that kind of deal with his wife's body!  -Jacob's POV. I never liked Jacob...but his POV was...zzzzzzzz  -the prefect vampire Bella. Basically everything Edward loves about her was gone. She became perfect Bella. She also had NO transition time.   -Renesmee and her birth. :(  -imprinting on the baby. When Jacob did that...I thought that Edward would kill him. But he didn't. You daughter has just been sentenced to a life she has no control of. Kill the dame dog!  -The ending- Everyone gets what they want (Except Edward...he's got to deal with Jacob forever) and no one gives up anything. (The bad guys leave...no one dies) Nothing would have shocked me by the ending.     ***solutions  What I think Meyers needed was time. She needed time to work on the book. I don't know if it was the book company putting pressure on her or she just wanted to move on. Maybe she should have put out off working on \\"the host\\" to work on \\"breaking dawn\\". She also needed to think of a better excuse as to why Bella got pregnant. Thanks for reading!!! I will end on a nice note and say somthing that I did like about the book. Leah Clearwater rocks!!
B001NRNQT6|5.0|Although the Saint books are definitely best if read in the right order, most of them &mdash; especially the later ones &mdash; can be read in isolation without great loss.  The present book, the direct sequel to [[ASIN:093033096X The Last Hero]], is the exception.<br /><br />Once again arms-dealer Rayt Marius is plotting to start a war to increase demand for his products, and once again Simon and his friends frustrate his major plan.  But of course, Marius has a second string to his bow, and the climax of &#34;Knight Templar&#34; is the most electrifying in any Saint book (and, incidentally, provides the mechanism whereby Simon is able to continue on through thirty-three more rather than spending the next forty years in gaol).<br /><br />Crown Prince Rudolf, my very favourite villain, who only comes on stage towards the end of the earlier opus, appears early here in the tale of the Desecrated Royal Toothpaste.<br /><br />BTW, the titles of ten of the Saint books were later &mdash; confusingly &mdash; changed, as follows:<br /><br />01: Meet the Tiger -&#62; The Saint Meets the Tiger<br />03: The Last Hero -&#62; The Saint Closes the Case<br />04: Knight Templar -&#62; The Avenging Saint<br />07: She Was A Lady -&#62; The Saint Meets His Match<br />08: The Holy Terror -&#62; The Saint vs. Scotland Yard<br />10: Once More the Saint -&#62; The Saint and Mr. Teal<br />12: The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal -&#62; The Saint in London<br />13: Boodle -&#62; The Saint Intervenes<br />18: Thieves Picnic -&#62; The Saint Bids Diamonds<br />19: Prelude for War -&#62; The Saint Plays With Fire<br /><br />The fatuity of the revised titles is nowhere more evident than with the present book and its antecedent: in &#34;The Last Hero&#34; the Saint does not close the case, and in &#34;Knight Templar&#34; the one thing he does not do is avenge the death of Norman Kent.<br /><br />P.S. For a list of all Charteris's Saint books, look up &#34;Simon Templar&#34; (section &#34;The Saint book series&#34;) on Wikipedia.
B0000VCZKW|4.0|When does a movie ever stay true to a book (other than the BBC version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" ;)    It was a fun movie, and a good incentive to get my daughters to let me read this as our read-aloud book.
B001FB55I0|2.0|Upon learning that Hollywood is about to flog a dead horse, with the help of two amateur 'schmuck' producers, one could not help but be apprehensive. However, with Christian Bale onboard, things got interesting. Fresh from his stunning success of \\"The Dark Knight\\", Bale might infuse credibility into an already exhausted franchise that spanned 25 years.    When McG was announced as the director, one could only reflect on how much McG's body of work pales in comparison to that of James Cameron's. Cameron was smart enough not to touch any further Terminator sequels with a ten-foot pole. He has finished telling his story with T2 and decided to leave it at that. Unfortunately, Arnie had to make T3 as his swansong before his foray into governorship in order to boost his flagging popularity.    Now, we come to this: T4, aka Terminator: Salvation. Since this takes place in the future, it's another portrayal of a bleak future. But this is no \\"Blade Runner\\". McG is no James Cameron or Ridley Scott. Heck, he's not even George Lucas, even in the Star Wars prequel movies. As much as he tries, McG couldn't direct actors. Bale is a fine actor. But not all humans are perfect. All he needs is the right director to point him to the right direction. Christopher Nolan succeeded tremendously in the resurrected Batman movies and the underrated 'The Prestige'. Terence Malick brought out an understated Bale in \\"The New World\\". Michael Mann had him in Elliot Ness style in \\"Public Enemies\\".     Christian Bale basically sleepwalked into his role. He works his usual style: being intense. It works with him as Batman as the character is intense. Here, his intensity comes across as being pretentious. His acting here reminds me of 'Harsh Times'. In both movies, he tries too hard to be intense. He looks constipated, sorry to say that. McG is just interested in action and effects. He should fire his editors, one very badly edited scene was the sole nude scene from Moon Bloodgood and the transition to her fighting a few guys. Very badly edited.    If you have nothing good to say about others, then remain silent. I shall do the same for Hollywood current 'IT' boy: Sam Worthington.     Basically, if you are looking at a lame and mundane Sci-fi movie with the high pretensions of an epic, then this movie is for you. There is however one merit to this Blu-Ray edition. The DTS-HD audio will practically bring down your house. I had to tune my amplifier lower. The opening credits alone gives your speakers and subwoofer a mighty workout. The audio is definitely reference quality. Home cinema enthusiasts should check this disc out. Movie buffs should stay far, far away from this.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is a review for the WB DVD release of SERGEANT YORK (1941) directed by Howard Hawks<br />and starring Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan,Joan Leslie, George Tobias, Stanley Ridges and a<br />great cast of Warner Bros.character actors and  supporting players.<br /><br />Filming the story of WWI hero Alvin York was a dream for producer Jesse Lasky for decades<br />and the chance finally came during the days of the war in Europe in the late thirties.<br />It took a lot of persuading to get Alvin York to agree to allow his biography to be filmed, especially the combat segments, but Mr. York decided that America had to prepare for the inevitable coming of war. Eventually he felt that  a film showing his initial reluctance to fight in WWI and his reasoning for finally joining in would be a good idea for Americans to see in 1941.<br /><br />So SERGEANT YORK was made and released to much controversy until the attack on Pearl Harbor. After that, SERGEANT YORK was rereleased and became a smash hit, and no wonder it was successful.<br /><br />The movie itself is part myth but mostly truthful. the mythical segment lies in the first part about Alvin York's early life in the hills of Tennesse, espcially the manner of<br />his conversion to that old time religion.  It didn't quite happen the way the movie claims but the story is so  fitting and entertaining it's hard to complain much about lack of authenticity. This version of the early part of Mr. York's life is almost like a fairy tale, a Hollywood fairy tale. Don't get me wrong, the basic story is true but certain things were embelished to be a little more entertaining.<br /><br />The second part, York's involvement in the Great War and the incidents that made him<br />a household name war hero is  factual from all the evidence presented and Mr.<br />York declined most offers to capitolize on his war experiences for profit throughout the following years.<br /><br />All in all, SERGEANT YORK is a film classic and I hope will be seen at least once<br />by every  American as well as people across the globe.  Everyone involved in making this film did a wonderful, sometimes inspired job and all the effort shows in every moment of this outstanding picture.<br /><br />This biography of a genuine hero is both fascinating and informative, perfect for the younger viewer as well as veteran film watchers.  WB did a good job putting this two disc set together, the first disc includes both the movie and a commentary track and the second disc has two documentaries about both  the making of the movie and a TCM<br />1989 biography of the life of Gary Cooper written and directed by critic Richard Schickel and narrated by Clint Eastwood. Both documentaries are well done as is the vintage WB cartoon and humorous short subject. This film has both an English and a French soundtrack as well as English, French and Spanish subtitles. Five stars.globe.  Everyone involved in making this film did a wonderful, sometimes inspired job and all the effort shows in every moment of this outstanding picture.

B0029LHW68|5.0|Get over the \\"sound\\" of the album; it is not techno.   I'm tired of the \\"it sounds like U2 or Kings of Leon\\" reviews.  This is the equivalent of saying all 70's or 80's music sounds alike.  No, it's the \\"new sound\\" the sound of the decade.    The fan chants. This is the most brilliant idea ever.  Just imagine the response at concerts. All the fans knowing exactly what to sing and when. \\"The Summits\\" where a true testament to how passionate this band is about their fans. I don't find this annoying at all. Most chants take place as an intro, exit or some chorus we would butcher trying sing along to anyhow.    Favorite tracks of mine, Night of the hunter, Closer to the Edge    The \\"From Yesterday\\" video \\"The Wish\\", asks for \\"the sound of tomorrow\\" this is it, This is War!
B002UD56I6|5.0|I enjoyed this documentary so much, I went with a few of my friends and we found ourselves pretty much singing and dancing to the music. It hit all the great songs Michael did and even some not so popular ones. This would have been a great concert to attend, the dancers were top notch as was the musical band behind him. While watching we realized that he was true perfectionist when it came to his sound, which was great because we see too many \\"performers\\" who don't care how they look on stage and can barely sing. Michael Jackson, despite how you feel about his personal life, he was a true musical artist with actual talent. He could still dance and move while singing without a hitch, it was wonderful to see him in such a positive light after so much negativity for so long. Gone too soon.

The load time for the previews was just over 1.5 minutes (acceptable), but that's not the bad part. After the previews you get a screen that basically say it will take about 2 to 3 minutes to load. The screen was displayed for just over 11 minutes and then went blank, but I could hear the disk spinning so I waited till just over 15 minutes to stop it, after the disk slowed down. I hit the [Stop] button and got a message that said \\"This disc does not allow this operation\\". So I turned the machine off and ejected the disk. I then tried again. The same results, but this time after 15 minutes I just let it go, and wouldn't you know it after 21 minutes and 17 seconds the move menu came up. I have the Disney UP movie also, though not as bad it took close to around 9 minutes to load. Let's compare this to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix [Blu-ray] 4 second to start playing, 4 second to top menu (yes that is 4 seconds). For fairness Harry Potter's menus isn't as advanced as the next movie I comparing it too.  Next comparison Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen [Blu-ray] 1 minute and 13 second to load its menu. I have other but the results are similar. What the heck is wrong with Disney? I will not buy another Disney movie if this is how bad there load times will be. And how do they calculate the 2-3 minute estimated load time. I just wish I had a PS3 to test it on. I guess Disney's magic doesn't work on Blu-ray.  I got this movie free with the Blu-Ray player purchase. But I think I deserve another movie to select form from Amazon. Amazon is still my favorite place to shop, but come on what gives with this
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|i admit, i cried within the first 10 minutes of the movie. the beginning was so touching and it took you through the highs and lows of love and marriage. despite the outpour of emotion from my otherwise non emotional self, the rest of the movie was funny and very well done. it is about the adventure of an older newly widowed man resisting the movement of his home. to avoid being sent to an elder home, he launches himself in the air using balloons and sets off to south america. little does he know a boy scout has stowed away and is along for the ride. i would say that \\"Up\\" is one of Pixar's best movies to date, i'm not sure if i would watch it again because it hit home personally for me, but its a great film.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|It is obvious Harry is growing up, and the feel of the movie reflects this.  I loved the other movies but they had a very predictable feel to them.  This one was by far the best so far, but that is just me.
B00000DLV1|5.0|This album is ALWAYS in heavy rotation for me. Its amazing sound, chill mentality, and stunning vocals are par to nothing else in its genre.
0786868724|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Mitch Albom, so when I learned that this book was out I jumped on the chance to get it and read it. This is his best book yet. I read it and then went out and got copies to give to family and friends.    In this book, Mitch begins by talking about his childhood and the way he viewed his church and his rabbi. he goes on to tell you the story of the rabbi and flashes back to the story of another man destined to become a preacher. by telling of these two men, Mitch reveals a great deal on this issue of faith and at one point he focuses on the question \\"Is God Real?\\" I particularly like the answer he provides to this.    This is a good book for those looking for hope, looking for God, and searching for lessons on faith. But this is also a great story with plot.    My only regret was that it was a little short and ended way too soon. I am looking forward to more books like this from Mitch Albom.
0060899190|5.0|Any absolutely amazing collection of people's inner thoughts and secrets, each submitted to the author on a post card. A great idea, and a great read. This book really makes you stop and think about the secrets in your own life, as well as wonder what inner secrets those around you have and never share.
0930289234|5.0|I got From Hell and loved it. Got Watchmen and was blown away. I think Alan Moore can tackle any subject and make it compelling. Absolutely brilliant.

0394873742|5.0|My 5 year old son has had this since he was 2 (it is big enough that he used to sit in the middle of it and read) and he still looks at it. There are tons of bright pictures on every page and words to go with them. Highly recommended!
0060899220|4.0|Bourdain's book is an adventure through restaurant kitchens all over the world. It was informative and funny - and it will make you reconsider your food next time you go out to eat!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Joss Whedon's space adventure ticks pretty much all the right boxes: it's sharp, funny, thrilling, and intelligent. He sets out to entertain and does so from start to finish, never allowing himself to take things too seriously, and never patronising his audience.    To be honest, there's nothing new here, but it's done with such esprit and flair that its derivative nature is forgivable: This is homage rather than lack of imagination. If, however, Whedon had managed to come up with a more original story this would have been a 5-star movie.    BTW, look out for references to other blockbusters including Blade Runner, the Indiana Jones and Star Wars series, along with many others. Even Kill Bill gets a nod.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Ms. Keys continues to grow as an artist who isn't afraid to go out on a limb with expressing herself.  Everything is not always a winner (i.e. Distance and Time, Like a Sea) but I give her an \\"A\\" for effort.  When she attempts to be hip, the result is the forced \\"Put it in a Love Song\\" featuring Beyonce, which does not sound natural. IMO, Ms. Keys has always been an hybrid artist (mix of pop & soul) so it does not surprise me with each album she blends both of those worlds and pushes the envelope on each release.  She strikes gold on tracks like the gorgeous \\"That's How Strong My Love is\\", \\"Wait Until You See My Smile\\", \\"Empire State of Mind Pt. 2 (Broken Down), the nods to Prince gems \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\" and \\"This Bed\\", the reggae infused \\"Love is my disease\\" and the hypnotic soul with a hip-hop kiss \\"Unthinkable (I'm Ready)\\" featuring Drake on background vocals.  Ms Keys, please keep exploring and not settling for status quo.  This CD is what musical \\"Freedom\\" sounds like.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have played this CD so much that I think I will have to buy another to keep in my car and maybe one for work also.  I can't get enough of Susan's mellow/smooth tones.  You can feel her heart speaking in her voice.  It sends chills up my spine.  I especially love \\"Who I Was Born To Be.\\"  It makes me cry every time.  Simon Cowell said they chose the music to display Susan's taste and talent.  I know she has a wider range of music in her.  You can hear the bluesy undertones in \\"Cry Me A River.\\"  I hope her next CD explores those other tones/ranges to her voice.  I want to hear EVERYTHING this woman can do with that marvelous voice.
0307593525|5.0|I recently received this set and could not be more pleased! The recipes I have tried so far have been fantastic, while the descriptions and details for preparing and cooking the meals are excellent. I would highly recommend these cookbooks to anyone who wants to do some authentic French cooking or who simply wants a great way to shake up the same old recipes for family and friends!

0307346617|5.0|Obviously one of, if not THE best in the genera.  Most people who read it will reads it at least twice.  Go get it if you don't own it and go give it another go if you already own it.  Then give it to a friend to spread the love.
B000000H5K|3.0|Roots being the 6th studio of Sepultura and their 1996 release does not sound like alternative metal, groove metal, or death metal. It sounds more like alternative rock with metal glimpses here and there. Compared to earlier releases like Arise and Chaos A.D. the speed has been considerably slowed down and the texts refering to Brazilian politics and culture is hard to understand for someone that gets very little news from that part of the world. Rolling Stone gave the album 3/5 whilst Allmusic gave it 4/5 in their respective reviews. I am not saying that it a bad release by any means but compared to prior releases it is not as strong. 3/5.
1400049628|4.0|He takes it so seriously and writes it so honestly that you find yourself believeing it could happen.  A good read and a good addition to the genera.
B000000H3W|5.0|Arise is the 4th studio album by Sepultura and their 1991 release and was hailed by critics and it is not hard to understand why. On this album mixes thrash metal and death metal with great lyrics and melodies. The booklet is quite nice with great photographs of the band and contains all the lyrics. The booklet also contains well-written linernotes written by Don Kaye. The cover is very strange and I have no idea what it is supposed to represent. We also get a list of the brand of instruments that the band uses which is quite rare to be included. Allmusic gave the album 4.5/5. I give it a 5. 5/5.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I popped this CD in as soon as I received it today. I was skeptical about it with all the hype and pre-sales (mine wasn't a pre-sale). I enjoyed her on YouTube, like just about everyone else in the world, but still...    I didn't need to worry. This is a wonderful, mournful, hopeful CD. Susan Boyle really is a fabulous singer, and her first CD is wonderful.
B000000H4V|4.0|Chaos A.D. being Sepultura's 5th studio album and their 1993 release is a departure from their death metal sound and into a more mix of thrash metal and groove metal sound. The booklet is very disturbing with many pictures that are quite controversial. Especially the picture with the bodies in the coffins. I assume these pictures were included for shock value but I am not so sure one could not have it done with less offensive pictures. All the lyrics are included and we get a list of whom plays what. Allmusic gave the album a 4.5 and Rolling Stone gave it 4/5 in their reviews. Whilst being a good release it is not as great as Arise and I therefore give it a 4. 4/5.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Loved the item. Shipped out on time and i enjoyed it. If you havent bought this album it is a MUST get!!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This is an excellent film from beginning to end. I not only loved it so much but each character was protrayed with very talented actors, I was thrilled to see an old face.<br />One of the best Star Trek films out of 1-10 I give it a ten. A must have for a true fan.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I HAVE BEEN A DJ SINCE 1993 IN BOTH NYC AND FT LAUDERDALE.  I RECENTLY DID A WORLD AIDS DAY EVENT AND DECIDED TO FEATURE THIS DVD.  IF YOU DID NOT KNOW: FREDDIE MERCURY DIED OF AIDS.  I ALWAYS LIKED QUEEN AND FREDDIE BUT I WAS BLOWN AWAY AT THE CRYSTAL CLARITY OF BOTH THE EDITING, VISUAL AND THE SOUND WAS ELECTRIFYING...IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS JUST RECORDED AND THE SONGS AND PERFORMANCES UNDLINED WHY QUEEN WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST BANDS OF ALL TIME.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.  AFTER TIME, YOU FORGET ALL OF THE GREAT SONGS THEY ACTUALLY DID, AND SOME, YOU WILL BE SURPRISED THAT IT WAS THEIR SONGS THAT OTHERS MADE FAMOUS..FOR INSTANCE: \\"THE SHOW MUST GO ON\\" USED AND COVERED IN THE MOVIE \\"MOULIN ROUGE\\".
B002M2N9JI|5.0|La Roux is simply amazing!  The songs are soo catchy with the great lyrics and tunes.  I simple can't get enough, there is not one song on the CD that I will skip when listening which is very rare these days. Very similar to an underground Lady Gaga, no she is much better than Gaga.  I expect to hear much more from and about La Roux in the near future she is an extremely talented artist with such a beautiful voice.  A must have CD!!
B002T9H2LK|3.0|I really really do enjoy alot of films by this director, but I'm starting to lose hope in him.  After watching Death Proof my one and only time at the movies I started to think he went off the deep end.  By the commercials I thought this movie looked like another Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill (vol. 1 of course cause vol. 2 sucked). For the most part I thought this movie really was alright.  unlike other people who have given this movie a bad review, my dislike of the movie is different.  Ok, if you are going to make a movie where 2 hrs. of it is in a different language, at least leave the text on the screen long enough for people to read.  I can glance through and get the general idea of what the conversation is about, but if I'm having to read the subtitles I want to understand all that's being said not just  bits of pieces.  This movie is 2and a half hours long, and I'm making it an extra hour because I'm pausing it every two seconds for fear I might be missing something inportant.  I tell you one thing, I've read where they are making a Kill Bill vol.3.  I'm giving him one more chance to redeem himself, and if that movie sucks I'm giving up on him completely
1577314808|1.0|There are two things this book reminds me of; the movie Southland Tales and a conversation I once had with a former cult member.      The movie Southland Tales:  This movie was hyped up because of the star-studded cast and the reputation of the director.  On the outset, it really appeared to be a great movie.  Similarly, this book is fairly hyped up because of the author's reputation, and people's need to show they are intelligent and enlightened.  As with was the case with the movie, once I got into this book, it became a random collection of incoherent ideas thrown together to make money.  I even caught myself doing the same thing with the book that I did with that movie.  I read it a few times thinking I just didn't get something.  Then I started talking to a few people and reading some feedback.  Just like the movie I realized the people praising it were doing so mostly to prove that they understood.  After all, if you don't like the book, you just \\"don't get it\\".  Which brings me to the next point.....    The cult member:  I knew a woman that was a formerly a cult member.  The way she described how the leader and followers of this cult lured her in was remarkably similar to how Tolle and his fans market this book.  They create a circle of enlightenment and understanding.  If you like the book, you are included, enlightened, intelligent.  If you don't, your and idiot and you don't understand. Once you are enlightened, you will love the book.  He prays on lonely, weak, downhearted people looking for answers.  He does it for money and/or power.      This man is no spiritual teacher.  He takes well thought out ideas such as Freud's work in psychology, twits them around and regurgitates them with descriptive words that don't belong.  He states plainly in the introduction that the words he uses phrases that sound out of place.  Of course, this is because of the difficulties that exist when trying to describe an enlightened state.  I'm guessing he picked up on how ridiculous some of the latter passages were and threw that in for cover up.  He also mentions in the introduction that he was homeless directly before his 'enlightenment'.  It's a good thing this miraculous transformation occurred that made him rich or he might have to do some actual work.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I have all the premium pay channels and watch all of the series.  Rome is hands down the best pay tv there has ever been (better than the Wire, Sex in the City, Sopranos etc).  When the last season ended i was crushed and felt that there was enough undevolped story line left to get at least one more season and possibly two.  The Blue Ray is incredible and the set will come to life (the soundstage and shooting was done in Italy so it very realistic) and the editing is top notch.  There is somethnig for everyone, sex, war, backstabbing, suspense, drama etc.  Never before have I enjoyed watching a series from start to finish like I did with Rome.  I am sure that my copy will be passed around to all of my friends.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Clint as everyone knows is a great talent in both acting and directing. And here he does both, giving a fine performance as Walt Kowalski, a war veteran and retired Ford worker living in Detroit. We pick up Kowalski's story at the funeral of his long time wife. As an unemotional type he will grieve in his own quiet way. We learn at the wake that he has a strained relationship with his 2 grown sons and their families. They have moved on to the greener pastures of the suburbs while Walt stays in his old decaying urban neighborhood. The movie makes the most of the on location filming in Detroit. The dying city is filmed with great effect. You see Clint's character moving through very troubled neighborhoods with vacant storefronts, crime, rundown and abandoned homes. It is sad and unfortunate that this is a true portrayal of Detroit.<br /><br />As someone born and raised in Detroit everything is dead on in it's portrayal of this slowly dying city. I saw a parallel with my own upbringing as I also lived in a neighborhood that changed from predominatly white. My Father had many of the same racist notions that Kowalski has here. And Kowalski has no problem slamming just about every ethnic or racial group- Jews, Asians, Blacks, Latinos, Italians etc.. No group is left out of his (often funny) racist tirades. In finding them humorous I do not claim to share his views or endorse his racially insensitive remarks. It's just the way that Kowalski so proudly takes ownership of his beliefs that make them funny.<br /><br />My father and other racists I have encountered had no problem offering up racist commentary but usually reserved their comments for private conversations. Walt Kowalski is way over the top, he gets right up in there face and does it. In one scene he is invited to a family gathering in a house full of Hmong people. Even though he is the only white amongst them he has no problem referring to them as 'fishheads.'<br /><br />There are interesting performances here -the young priest who challenges Kowalski to come clean with God. The Italian barber who exchanges funny and racist banter with Walt. The young Hmong siblings who befriend Walt and break down his barriers. And this is where the story leads us as Walt gets drawn into helping the young Hmong boy, Tao, who is being troubled by a violent gang. The title of the movie refers to Kowalski's mint condition 1972 Gran Torino. a classic car that he actually had a hand in building at the auto plant. In this troubled neighborhood it is coveted by friend and foe alike. Many of the Asian actors are newcomers and you would think that next to the shining star that is Eastwood they would drag down the film. For the most part that doesn't happen. I found this drama very compelling and entertaining.
B0018LMKIK|4.0|No one can tell us what the best is. However with the volume in this collection you will be hard pressed not to find your favorite.<br /><br />Creedence Clearwater Revival produces sounds that permeated the many movies from the 60's on. It is almost a game to figure out how many movies used their music. You know the image for Suzy Q (hint: Apocalypse Now). But do your remember \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" from \\"Werewolf in London?\\" I leave the others for you to discover.<br /><br />For me thought each song brings up actual places I have been. If you are new to Creedence you have a treat coming to you, as they are as unique now as when they recorded the music. Their songs are also great to listen to while driving. Start your own revival.
B001DSNF8C|1.0|Horrible movie-don't waste your money.Bond chases the guy through a construction site with everyone watching but when they are running through the site at the end noone notices them.Seems like someone who have called the cops with all of the shooting and ruckus going on.Of course they jump from obstacle to obstacle which would have killed the normal person.         Then after Bond is surronded by an army of men with guns he somehow is able to escape.It's like the script was written by a 5th grader.\\"Let's have all kind of cool stuff that doesn't make sense.\\"If you are a true bond fan of the James Bond classics then this movies will disappoint-big time.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin...this two DVD set is sure to please diehard fans of the legendary kings of hard rock and will serve as a tremendous introduction to the band for newer fans.  These DVDs have it all - live concert footage from 1970, 1972, 1973, 1975, and 1979, promos, press conferences, and a whole lot more.  In my opinion, this DVD set is far better than The Song Remains The Same DVD.  This set also contains a couple of songs from their Madison Square Garden performances on their 1973 tour that don't appear on The Song Remains The Same.  These songs are Misty Mountain Hop and The Ocean.  You'll see the changes that took place with their stage performances from year to year.  The 1979 footage is very interesting.  The band seems more mature.  The total running time of these two DVDs is five hours and twenty minutes, so this will provide lots of entertainment for Zep fans.<br /><br />There are a total of 30 songs between the two DVDs.  All of their classic material is here, and then some.<br /><br />If you want to see the greatest hard rock band in action, then definitely pick up this set.  Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham are legends who made legendary music.  It is worth the extra money to own this set rather than The Song Remains The Same.  Sure, that is a classic set of 1973 concert footage, but this set gives you a lot more.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

B000683VI4|5.0|With over 250 reviews, most of which lovingly describing the plot and shouting praises for the Actors, screenplay, sets and everything else worth mentioning (of which there are many); I am straying a bit from the regular outline for reviews.  I hope the folks who review the reviews (before publishing them here) have a little patience with me.<br /><br />I am an over 60 male who absolutely loved this film.  It's been a while since I have had the enjoyment from a newly made film of this category of entertainment.  I refer to that category as: \\"loving human reality.\\"  I imagine that younger audiences would think of it as silly, old fashioned and dull.  No thrills, no chills.  No frontal nudity.  No gore or blood dripping from the scenery.  Could love be love without all the confrontations, horrible language, backstabbing and general, all around hostility and negativity?<br /><br />I think love can simply be love.  That's the reason I loved this film.  Am I dating myself?  Yes, but I don't care.<br /><br />\\"Why ask for the moon when we have the stars?\\"  (thanks BD)
B002KREVE2|5.0|Excellent concert.  Almost makes me feel I'm there with the crowd!  I've been a fan since the 60's.  Leonard Cohen is as entertaining as ever!  Great CD.  I highly recommend it to fans and newcomers.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|There are many reviews that cover the plotline.  Every other review I read expressed the same feelings that I had about the impossible poverty, depressed living levels and the expectations of people who feel there is no future for them or their children.<br /><br />How wonderful it was to watch this young man break the steriotype and come through the disbelief of the show producers and police.  Still, with all the negativity around him, our Hero comes through like the Champion he is in life.  A perfect role model for his peers and for everyone.<br /><br />Want to laugh?  Want a cry or two?  Need to feel like we should all have hope?  This film will give you all thse and more.<br /><br />I am almost speechless.

True stars shine brightly from inside out.    So it is with Susan.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|A Showtime production, Dexter is an anomaly.  It is a brilliantly written, intriguing, and totally engrossing series, that is seldom predictable.  Besides a compelling storyline, and characters that seem real, what makes the series even more unique, is that the protagonist, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter expert for the Miami police, is a cold blooded murderer.<br /><br />Hall's unusual role is the key to the series, and his performance is a riveting, and captivating character study, that makes Dexter a very hard show to turn away from.  Morgan is guided by the `Code of Harry'.  Harry (James Remar) was Dexter's adoptive father, an ex-cop who recognized that his traumatized son, had homicidal tendencies.  To help him survive, Harry trained Dexter to channel his desire to kill in a 'positive' direction, by instilling the directive to kill only those who truly deserve to die.  This twisted morality is quite bizarre, and makes for fascinating viewing, as Dexter kills ceremoniously.<br /><br />Presumably to contain any spilled blood, plastic sheeting is typically spread all around the area, and Dexter himself is also covered with plastic sheeting.  Victims are taped down naked to a table top face up, helpless and unable to move.  After drawing a blood sample for his collection, Dexter gets to work.  The dead body is chopped into pieces, and the remains placed in trash bags.  Few of the grisly details are actually shown, but the presentation is still pretty chilling.  The series has a wicked sense of humor, as Dexter discusses his thoughts through narration, as he nonchalantly goes about his business, which includes murder.  Harry is dead, but appears frequently, in flashbacks.  Harry's biological daughter Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), also works for the Miami PD in homicide.  She is eager, enthusiastic, loves to swear, and has a problem with authority.<br /><br />The twelve episodes play like a chapters in a book.  Unlike most weekly series, the format does not always involve solving a particular case within the episode.  Instead, the story unfolds broadly and more naturally, with information about Dexter and his past, coming in small bits.  Dexter is dealing with coming to terms with his emotions, or lack thereof, and watching how this affects the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz), is fascinating.  Benz's performance is pretty amazing, playing an abused woman trying to start a new relationship.<br /><br />The central underlying story concerns a serial killer known as `Ice Truck Killer', who specializes in neatly slicing up his victim's bodies into bloodless pieces.  The whole concept is diabolically macabre, and well executed.  The killer has taken a special interest in Dexter, and tension and suspense grows more intense, after the killer's identity is revealed with a few episodes left to go.  The killer has an elaborate plan, though he is forced to improvise when the pursuit begins to close in.  As Dexter begins to recall the horrific circumstances surrounding his mother's death, the killer makes his play.  The writing is outstanding, and keeps you off balance.  Approaching the conclusion, things get a little shaky in the turn, but control is reacquired, and Dexter finishes wildly and dramatically, with a stylistic flourish that does not cheat the viewer.<br /><br />Dexter is refreshingly different from most forensic procedurals.  Although dealing with violence and death, there isn't a lot of fighting, shootouts, or chases.  The focus is on character and story development.  While there are things that go over the top, or are illogical, unlike programs like the CSI franchise, the level of drama isn't routinely pumped up by threats, flashy violence, condescending dialog, or music.  The police in Dexter work `normally', with no overly dramatic background music, while routine tasks like, processing the crime scene, performing tests, or analyzing evidence take place.  The level of acting by almost everyone involved is excellent, from the minor characters to the leads.  The writing is not perfect, but the characters and their dialog, are mostly credible, showing the audience some respect.  There are no long winded pretentious speeches sprouting psychobabble, phony overdramatic situations, and characters trying to top each other, or engaging in supercop behavior.  Criminal Minds or CSI Miami, this is not.<br /><br />The series is far from perfect, and doesn't escape being ridiculous.  While a darkened room, draped with plastic sheeting, with a naked victim tapped down helpless, is a terrifying scene, it makes little sense, unless Dexter has giant rolls of plastic sheeting, and maybe a case of packing tape in his car.  The time it would take to actually prepare the scene, and put up all that sheeting would be ridiculous.  Tape and plastic sheeting are excellent for retaining evidence like fingerprints, would have to be destroyed.  Dexter disposes a couple of bags of body parts per kill, but what happens to all that tape and plastic sheeting?  Over the course of the season, Dexter takes chances, makes mistakes, and has several close calls, and is clearly under suspicion, at the conclusion, setting the stage for the next season.<br /><br />One of the few negatives is the lack of subtitles, and the inappropriateness of the extras.  Two episodes have commentary tracks, but some of the other bonus materials, are not directly related to the series.  The mini-documentary Witnessed in Blood, covers the forensics for an unrelated criminal case.  And two episodes of Showtime's series Brotherhood are included, presumably as an attempt to promote that series.  More material specifically relevant to Dexter, would certainly have been preferred.  Otherwise, needless to say, the series is highly recommended to fans of the forensic crime genre.is excellent, from the minor characters to the leads.

Over the course of the season, Dexter takes chances, makes mistakes, and has several close calls, and is clearly under suspicion, at the conclusion, setting the stage for the next season.    One of the few negatives is the lack of subtitles, and the inappropriateness of the extras.  Two episodes have commentary tracks, but some of the other bonus materials, are not directly related to the series.  The mini-documentary Witnessed in Blood, covers the forensics for an unrelated criminal case.  And two episodes of Showtime's series Brotherhood are included, presumably as an attempt to promote that series.  More material specifically relevant to Dexter, would certainly have been preferred.  Otherwise, needless to say, the series is highly recommended to fans of the forensic crime genre.
B001DRF84W|5.0|In comparison to the 08 Edward Norton Hulk, I think this Hulk film was way more enjoyable.  I will say that Norton's Hulk has a better audience range, while this film appeals to those select few who enjoy psychological examination in the superhero genre.  That is precisely why I like this installment more: the stronger emotional depth.<br /><br />Hulk definately nails psychology of Bruce Banner.  It manages to use its dramatic scenes way more effectively than its action scenes.  We get to see how a Bruce Banner would actually feel in this overbearing situation.  While our newer Hulk may be more exciting, I believe the 03 version had much more realism to offer.  The funny thing is that both films have extremely talented casts, the difference is the director.  Ang Lee knows how to make an artwork out of film, while Louis Leterrier abandons human emotion.  The reason why people like the newer film more, is because it is a faster paced action film, while 03 Hulk is hard to label an action film.  I call it a science-fiction drama.  While it has dynamic and lengthy fight scenes, audiences didn't want to sit through long scenes of talking to see them.  Another thing that bothered the world was the editing of the film.  While it may be painful the first time to look at 3 split screens every 4 minutes, it becomes much more rewarding after a few viewings.  Seeing different angles provides a analytical realism.<br /><br />As far as our Blu-ray release, I am somewhat satisfied.  While I got a good sized package of special features, some of them were reused, which in my opinion is embarassing.  Don't expect much, because there's not a lot sweet extras.  The problem is that they didn't plan for a big blu-ray when it was release, it being filmed in 02/03.<br /><br />So anyway, bottom line:  Hulk has more depth than its follower.  While this one may not be as full of energy, it definately puts the Hulk in a realistic perspective.  Expect great performances and a tragic superhero.  While it may not be the best action superhero movie, its one of the best drama superhero movies.While it may not be the best action superhero movie, its one of the best drama superhero movies.
B000ZELISO|1.0|Well, my wife and I were all excited to get the new Harry Potter movie on Blu-ray but when we received it it was not what we ordered!  We ordered and confirmed that we were supposed to get the Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy and BD-Live.  That is what our online invoice states and that is what our receipt in the box states but we received the Blu-ray + BD-Live only version!  Even when I click the online invoice it now reverts to this BD-Live version of the movie.      I spoke to customer service and they are working to get the correct one out but their system will not allow for a replacement.  I cannot even find the version we actually purchased on the Amazon site anymore.  Such false advertising if they do not rectify the situation.      I usually get excellent service from Amazon but I will be extremely dissapointed if this situation is not rectified quickly.
1592403913|4.0|This is a charming book.  The author deals with this otherwise dry material (punctuation!) in a smart and funny manner, with anecdotes and historical references.  The problem has nothing to do with the material (which is brilliant), but the mechanics: The typeset is tiny, tiny, tiny.  It is, in fact, the smallest print I've seen in a book, ever.  I got eye strain reading it, even with my reading glasses perched at the tip of my nose.  I recommend buying Eats, Shoots & Leaves in a bookstore, where one can examine the various editions and make sure to select one that is printed in a civilized type size.
B002M0HHC0|5.0|Eric did a great job with this book.  It's very professionally written and appeals to all levels inside your organization from HR, to Marketing, to Finance.  Any folks who read this book will have a much more thorough understanding that Social Media has on the future marketplace.
B001UW58WW|4.0|I wouldn't have it playing while trying to read, but while doing house hold chores that seem to drag, this CD kinda speeds things up, just look at the action on the cover picture. If I were to catch this artist in person, I would feel exhausted just watching him perform, probably after the third song. Music quality is A-1.
B000SIBH06|5.0|My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult tells us of the struggle one family must go through for the life of a daughter, Kate. Kate was diagnosed with cancer when she was very young and her parents, especially her mother, try so hard everyday just for her daughter's life. Then the possibility of having a new child was discussed amongst the parents because they needed a perfect match to help donate certain things to Kate. So none-the-less, Anna was a \\"designer baby\\" with the soul purpose of saving Kate. But at some point she becomes fed up and sues her parents for medical emancipation of her own body. This goes with out saying, but her parents are furious. Can Anna win her own case? What will happen to Kate?     I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone that loves a good heart felt novel. I found it quite easy to read this book because I wanted to know what was going to happen next, and I am not a person who loves to read. Every chapter is told from a different character's point of view, which helps to create a lot of variety and diversity in the feelings that are shown. Another thing, if you think that just by seeing the movie you know what's coming, you are wrong. The book features a different ending that some wouldn't see coming.
B001UV4XTC|4.0|\\"A Serious Man\\" is a film directed by Ethan and Joel Coen (Fargo, No Country For Old Men)) about an uncertain man. Larry Gopnik is a professor of physics, and a family man, who seems to have no control over his life. Various elements swirl about him that he helplessly seems to accept. His wife wants a divorce, some anonymous person is trying to discredit his reputation, and a student is trying to manipulate Larry for better grads, and so on and so on Larry is a man like a leaf in the wind, who is caught in a world beyond his control. This is a darkly humorous look at a frail man, portrayed as living in a unknowable, and terrifying world.
B002MW50KY|4.0|Well people, your beloved Seer is back to spread Christmas cheer and a new review. Well, it's the holiday season after all. I don't really have the time, as all my fans know, however I am known for my sacrifices for the public good. So, I have torn myself away from my hot toddy to write this. Are you satisfied now? And, yes, I do expect many presents under the tree to show just gratitude. If not, yellow journalism will prevail on future reviews. And, I do name names (!).<br /><br />O.K., aside from all that, let me tell you I met up with Bob (at his request) some months back to discuss his forthcoming Christmas offering. He arrived at a famous coffee shop in NYC looking refreshed and pleased. \\"What have you been up to Bob\\"? I asked. \\"Well Metamorpho, I think you and everybody will be surprised that I recorded a Christmas Album\\", he said as he used great amounts of honey in his coffee to sooth his vocal chords. \\"But Bob\\", I said, \\"You didn't do the standard Christmas songs everybody knows. Did you? I'm sure you wrote them yourself\\".<br /><br />Bob paused. He gazed out of the window, watching people pass by that he knew would be wearing warm overcoats and boots eventually. Then he looked at me. Peering.<br />\\"You know Metamorpho, I am getting on in age and I need a break. I have written songs for almost 50 years now. I just need to relax a bit and do some covers\\". To tell you the truth people, I sympathized with Bob. After all, he is one of my biggest fans.<br /><br />He then lightened up. \\"I think you will be surprised. And my vocals are not bad considering I have 10,000 nodules on my vocal chords\\". It flashed in my mind that I did an internet search once and it said he started his career with only a 1,000 nodules but they have increased expoentially each year. \\"Well, I'm sure it will be fine\\". He then got up to leave and said goodbye. He left money for the coffee but I had to cover the tip myself. I guess he doesn't know your beloved Metamorpho is a non-profit Seer. I was a tad annoyed, however, I learned later that he donated the album profits to charity. He probably had to save the tip amount for studio time. Whatever.<br /><br />Anyway, after you muddled through this somehow up until now, I really should tell you about the album. It's fun. It truly is. Who would have thought he'd do this at his age. But hey, if you're Bob Dylan you've earned the right to do anything you want musically. He has vocal abuse, and it shows here. Raspy and rough in spots. This might be off-figgy-pudding to some (but face it, the main objection to his tunes was probably his voice, thus, what's new?). The album has a down home appeal, reminiscent of some tunes from the 50's. The band provides great backing and is perfect for his voice. And, I have to be honest here, the more you listen to this the better it becomes. (No! I won't allow you to blame the vast amounts of spiked egg nog I've had this evening!). Then again, one has learned from the past to never take Dylan at face value. There is always more there. And you may not realize it until many years hence.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars. It is by no means a classic, but hey, it's Dylan. People will say that my review is tainted because I know him personally and I am an avid fan of his prior work. Well, I might give him a slight edge here. But, honestly, it's not as bad as some people would have you believe. Yeah, it's rough in spots. But as I said, it's a fun recording (and I believe sincere as well). In my book, fun should always win out. Especially at this time of year. So, I recommend it if you are not overly critical and being a grinch. Dylan has made a career fighting the establishment Grinchs. He's always won. And, he'll win this one as well.<br /><br />Now, let me get out my thermalite Seer's outfit. Looks like snow!<br /><br />Holly Jolly, Hot Toddy, Good Golly Miss Molly!<br /><br />love, Metamorpho ;)er, I learned later that he donated the album profits to charity.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Always liked Michael Jackson but became bigger fan recently. Product was very good and later I was able to see the movie so very glad that I did buy this cd.
B002QGUFWE|3.0|I bought The Fame Monster because I loved The Fame and was looking forward to the 8 tracks. I had previewed them online and was excited for the entire songs. I am sad to say that this CD actually disappointed me. Only Bad Romance, Alejandro, and Monster are actually good songs. Telephone is also good but not very original, and the addition of Beyonce is unnecessary. The rest of the songs are lackluster.
B001CU1RRM|5.0|the product was as advertised and what I wanted. All info I needed in order to make a decision on purchasing this product was given so it was easy to decide to buy it.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Many fans believe that 1998's Donde Estan los Ladrones is Shakira's best album. I love that album but I have to disagree with them and say that Fijación Oral vol. 1 is Shakira's defining moment as an artist. She shines as a writer, a producer, and a vocalist. The lyrics are some of Shakira's best and the music is characterized by Shakira's own unique brand of fusion. Yet, I am sure that the future will bring us another Shakira album where she will top herself again.
0061719544|3.0|The first third of this book is about Craig's sad younger years and the middle of the book details his love of drugs, drinking and women. It's only the final third that really is interesting to read--about his life in America since he has been sober.    Believe the criticisms mentioned in other reviews of this book--it is too long and detailed.  He gives all sorts of \\"who cares\\" type information, especially when talking about his time in Scotland. American readers will not know the TV programs he did there--so why so much detail about it?    The book is also very sad and depressing for the most part.  He whines a lot about his problems and mistakes, until he goes through rehab and gets sober.  After that point he makes something of himself, comes to America and the book turns interesting.    One problem is his compulsion to criticize American things like Christianity and Republicans (especially Dick Cheney!).  He comes across as a kind of snotty know-it-all outsider.  It's understandable that with his background he would not uphold religion or conservatives.  But  his writing about them is purely emotional and   without intellectual support. It seems out of place here and could be a turn-off to potential viewers.     So the advice would be to read a little of the beginning, then pretty much skip to the final third. The rest of it is just drugs, drinking and rock & roll.
B000G03RJA|5.0|It has been so many years since Gloria came out. Hard to believe. What a voice. Powerful and immediately recognized. This is a great collection. All the songs are great. The only song I did not like that she redid was The Power of Love by Jennifer Rush [[ASIN:B00004U69O Power of Love: Best of Jennifer Rush]] and [[ASIN:B000U1K4PU Stronghold - The Collector's Hit Box]]. Celine's was good, but Jennifer's is far and away better than any of the remakes. If you like Laura and Jennifer check out Bonnie Bianco's Very Best of which is not featured on Amazon.com but is available on Amazon.de. I order from Germany all the time and never have a problem with the CDs coming.

160024842X|5.0|I first read The Lovely Bones the year it was released (2002), and I loved it. I recall reading it in one sitting I was so hooked. It ended up being my favorite read of 2002.  So I thought since the movie is being released this month, I wanted to read it once again before I saw the movie.  This time, I listened to the audio version, read by the author, and although I enjoyed it, I wasn't as in awe as I was the first time around. Has that ever happened to you with a reread?  For those of you who still have not read this book, it starts out like this:<br /><br />\\" My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie.  I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973\\"<br /><br />From heaven Susie narrates the story of her rape and murder.  She even reveals who her killer is, and she enlightens the reader as to what her heaven is like, and how it is ever changing.  From heaven Susie is constantly monitoring her family on earth as they try to cope with what has happened to Susie. Although Susie remains fourteen throughout the story in heaven, her family ages by eight years as deal with the aftermath of her murder.  Susie's father is obsessed with finding her killer and little by little he is gathering evidence on the person he suspects murdered his daughter.  The mother deals with her grief by having an affair, and her brother Buckley and sister Lindsy are also trying to understand and move on with their lives at the same time.<br /><br />Still an amazing debut novel, which I enjoyed, I am suspecting that the reason I did not enjoy the audio as much as the print version was because of the author's monotone voice, which in my opinion took away from the terrific story. Despite that this book (especially the print  version) is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I downloaded this cause everyone said it was good, and this is my first CD from these guys.     Wow, glad I did it cause this is an awesome CD. I love many kinds of music, and this is a new band (for me) that I will be keeping track of. My girlfriend liked many songs, and even my daughter thought some of the songs were great.    Thanks to the Amazon reviewers for great input. This is why if you weed through the reviews you can discover great new music.    Highly recommend this CD. Great, inspiring, POWERFUL music.
B0026P3G12|1.0|This cd is overrated. She has a fair voice, but seriously lacks refinement. Once again, people who have no business judging music have gotten excited about mere medeocrity. I'm just glad I didn't spend any money on it and listened to a friend's cd first.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|i've only watched 7.5 minutes but it's obvious this is one of the best action movies of the year...    I'm a Star Trek fan and I loved this movie.  Too many star trek fans are efette and pompous wind bags who can only scorn.  Long live the vision of star trek!!!
B000002N3N|4.0|Enya - The Memory of Trees (1995)<br /><br />In certain circles, such as my profession, massage therapy, Enya is ubiquitous. People tend to get really tired of hearing her all the time. E.O. - Enya Overdose - can be an unpleasant, almost sickly experience. Aside from that, I think some people are just jealous of her enormous popularity. I just learned that her \\"Day Without Rain\\" CD which came out in 2000 was the 16th highest seller of the last decade.<br /><br />But she's wildly popular for good reasons. One could say her music is synthesized plastic, but it's beautiful, soothing plastic . . . what's not plastic is Enya's sweet, melodic voice (at least I HOPE it's not plastic! - I sincerely doubt she uses auto-tune). Enya's been accused of being soulless - harsh! - but sometimes you'd rather hear something calming, pleasant and pretty instead of some gut-wrenching Aretha Franklin or Janis Joplin weeper, wouldn't you?<br /><br />The following is a song-by-song breakdown of the album to give readers an idea of which tracks they might like to sample before getting the whole album:<br /><br />\\"The Memory of Trees\\" - a majestic, cinematic opener. No lyrics, it serves as a wonderful prelude. *****<br /><br />\\"Anywhere Is\\" - I know some people like this one but I find it unbearable. To me, it's too cloying, \\"sing-songy\\" and flat-out dorky. It's just too \\"jaunty\\" for my tastes. I'm forced to program the songs on my CD player whenever I want to hear this album because I refuse to listen to this one (and of course, I program only certain songs from this album for massage). I was shocked to see it on Enya's Greatest Hits collection. *<br /><br />\\"Pax Deorum\\" - Quite different than anything else here, this track has an ominous, pulsing sound which makes me think of impending war in some Medieval or Lord of the Rings setting. Enya chants most of the words, sung in Gallic, in a low register. I never use it for massage but it's an interesting track if yer in the mood for it. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Athair Ar Neamh\\" - Another one sung in Gallic, this soft, restrained song is one of the most beautiful on the album. *****+<br /><br />\\"From Where I Am\\" - is a short instrumental with only piano and some very subtle atmospheric touches. A sweet melody. *****<br /><br />\\"China Roses\\" - possibly Enya's best song ever. Sounds like floating through heaven. Magical! *****+<br /><br />\\"Hope Has a Place\\" - a gentle song about love. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Tea-House Moon\\" - a pretty instrumental, vaguely Oriental. ****<br /><br />\\"Once You Had Gold\\" - another, soft, sweet song with a gorgeous melody. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"La Sonadora\\" - is a subtle, slightly somber track sung in Spanish. ****<br /><br />\\"On My Way Home\\" - begins with some rolling, old-school synth sounds reminiscent of her first album and soon bursts with bright energy. A fitting finale. ****in Gallic, this soft, restrained song is one of the most beautiful on the album. *****+     \\"From Where I Am\\" - is a short instrumental with only piano and some very subtle atmospheric touches.

1401323820|4.0|The book, in short, was awesome.  I'm a huge fan of the series, and when I found out that they had hired a ghost writer to actually write this, I was excited.  The entire time I was reading it, I was enjoying it.  It reads just like an episode, which is good and bad.  If you were expecting something else, you are sure to be disappointed.  The characters in the book aren't simply based on the characters in the show, they're pretty much identical copies.  It's not too surprising, considering the way Castle seemed to be writing the book.  Again, if you were expecting anything more, disappointment will ensue.  What this book really comes down to is one thing: the fans.  This book was written for fans of the series, and no one else.  Sure, people who don't watch the show can probably enjoy the book, but less so than those of us that do.  There are some blanks that might need filling, but the fans can do that themselves, while others can't.  This book is and isn't meant to be the epic that it appears to be in the series.  I give it four stars simply because it is pretty simply written, albeit thrilling.  Fans, you will enjoy this, others need not apply.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|I missed this film when it came through the local theaters but am glad I got to to see it on DVD. Sure, the screen is smaller but 1) You can go back and see the parts that you you want to see (and even zoom in on the performers fingers) and 2) You get to see the \\"Deleted scenes\\". (Read on about those.)<br /><br />This documentary was directed by Davis Guggenheim who won lots of awards for directing Al Gore in \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\". (To make Al Gore seem interesting for two hours, talking about global warming was a challenge that Guggenheim overcame.)<br /><br />The premise is that the Director got three electric guitar geniuses from differejnt cultures and generations in to room to reminisce and play together. Jimmy Page (British) is the elder statesman here; The Edge from U2 (Irish) comes next in the age-line; and Jack White of The White Stripes (Detroit, MI) brings it into the 21st Century.<br /><br />What I expected to see was a \\"super session\\" in one room for 98 minutes. But that's not what you get. The Director used this \\"first time meeting\\" as a jumping off point to follow the careers of the three men, jumping from one to the other. There really isn't much footage in the film of the meeting and no complete songs are ever presented. (If you read the credits there are nearly 100 (!) songs excerpted for the soundtrack. There's lots of archival clips of Page in his various bands and Edge and White in their respective musical collaborations as well. But it's still riveting.<br /><br />The DVD includes commentary by the Director and Producer (none of the musicians included) and a 30-minute Press Conference in Toronto that does include Page, White and Edge. But then there ar4e the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" - 12 of them totaling 26 minutes. It's here we see Page play acoustically for a full song, some on stage jamming and questioning each other and even a section where Edge reveals how he  - and Bono - got their unique names. (Why wasn't this in the film?).<br /><br />This is a min-history of the electric guitar from the mid 1960s to the present and anyone who plays electric guitar will get something from it.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"rom the mid 1960s to the present and anyone who plays electric guitar will get something from it.

B002X20W2E|5.0|I was looking forward to Rihanna's new album. I wanted to see if she would write songs about domestic violence, terror, darkness, and abuse. She did. Obviously, not everyone wants to hear songs about that kind of stuff, but her lyrics are subtle enough that she's not hitting you over the head with it. You have to read between the lines on most of them. If you've been in her situation, you can understand what she's saying. If you haven't then it'll just go right over your head (like all the rest of the violence in the world that you probably pretend doesn't exist.) I really need music like this because it helps me connect with my own feelings.<br /><br />Like the others have said, \\"Hard\\" and \\"Wait Your Turn\\" are really awesome songs. They totally rock. \\"Russian Roulette\\" is dark and scary and I like that about it. She said that the song wasn't really about playing Russian Roulette. It's about a relationship, obviously a dangerous one that could result in her death. I completely relate to the line, \\"I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving. I know I have to pass this test.\\" Some violent guys will tell you to go ahead and leave if you want to, but they're just testing your loyalty to them. If you do leave, they'll attack you. I'm guessing Chris probably was pointing a gun at Rihanna, telling her she could leave if she wanted to, but she knew he was testing her and would probably kill her if she tried to leave. So she didn't leave. There's nothing more terrifying than dealing with a rage-filled psychopath. I should know. My ex-boyfriend is in prison for murder. So I can really identify with the themes on this record, which I interpret to be about violent relationships. I'm glad Rihanna was able to tap into those feelings and write about them. It helps the rest of us who are going through similar situations.<br /><br />I really loved the 30 minute concert video that aired on VH1 and BET. She sang mostly songs from this album. I'd love to have a DVD of the full concert. If anyone knows where I can buy the concert, let me know. I haven't found it yet.<br /><br />Way to go, Rihanna. I'm a huge fan now after hearing this album. Thank you. )O(I can buy the concert, let me know. I haven't found it yet.     Way to go, Rihanna. I'm a huge fan now after hearing this album. Thank you. )O(
0547258305|4.0|I won't recap the synopsis, since that's been done to death. I enjoyed this book a lot, it was an easy read, and I really fell into the story itself. I would recommend this book to any of my friends who are YA and fantasy lovers.     The Pros:    1. The characters are fantastic, complex, highly flawed, but also easy to love. I'm quite taken by Katsa, who is strong and brave and while her Grace makes her seem like she can do anything, I think there is more to it than that. Because she can do anything (or nearly so) it breaks her perspective and she doesn't understand people very well because of it. Sometimes she learns things about herself (and others) that almost seem childlike because she never understood before. It was not about killing and fighting, so it wasn't important. She may be fast and strong and clever, but she cannot make friends, doesn't trust easily, and sees no essential future for herself. Po was excellently drawn, though sometimes disappeared under the weight of Katsa's character, and the side characters like Giddon, Oll, Helda, and Randa are beloved though quickly disappear (much to my annoyance. I'd have liked to see Oll throughout the story.) Bitterblue was a wonderfully drawn child, which is often hard to do. The only character I was really disappointed in was the main bad guy. I felt like he was a real missed opportunity.  2. I really enjoyed the romance. While it was incredibly predicable, that was ok. We all know that Darcy is the love interest in Pride & Prejudice, but we don't care. It's the journey into love that makes the story. There are sex scenes, but they are pretty vague. You know it's happening, but you don't know what is happening. I thought it was tastefully done. I liked their story together.  3. The idea of Gracelings is original and fun. I liked the idea that some people have very useful Graces and some Graces are not useful at all. I wish this would have come into play more often than just with Po and Katsa, but beggers can'tbe choosers.   4. Even though there is a lot of traveling in this story, none of it is boring. I enjoyed the scenery and the exchanges between the characters while they rode. I liked the anticipation of where they were going next.  5. Some of the small, but exciting scenes really made this book. The rescue in the beginning, Captain Faun's ship, the journey back to Po with Skye, the first time Po and Katsa fight.   6. This is just a great fantasy. It sometimes doesn't feel like YA, because it is obviously a very different world than our own and the characters are forced to be adult before maybe young adults in the real world are. But I think it works.    Cons:  1. Some of the writing is not great. It feels a little amateur sometimes and sometimes it doesn't feel well edited. However, the story reads quick and when the descriptions and the dialog are \\"on\\" they are really \\"on.\\" But sometimes they miss. I think her writing will get better with time.  2. The main bad guy, once revealed, is sort of a let down. He only appears twice in the story, and for very brief moments. I like that we know him mostly through rumors and stories (it goes along with his character well) but it leaves something to be desired as far as plot and development. I understand a sociopath/psychopath when I see one, and I like that for a change the bad guy is just...broken and that he's not got some epic desire to take over the world. But I think he could have been an all time scariest bad guy ever if he'd been fleshed out more.   3. The ending. Sigh. The resolution of conflict is satisfactory, it's what comes after that left me unsatisfied. The ending after the ending is long and drawn out but does not add much to the story. I like the idea of following up with characters after the conflict is resolved (I think sometimes books end TOO fast) but this one ended too late, and with certain characters going their separate ways. It just didn't leave me emotionally satisfied.  4. The anti-marriage thing really turned me off. Not because I'm pro-marriage, it's GREAT that Katsa doesn't want to get married and doesn't like feeling forced into it. But I never really understood why she didn't want to get married. Or furthermore, once she fell in love with Po, why she'd still be so fiercely against marriage. I get it if she doesn't want to get married, but I don't understand her disgust by it. I also don't like feeling like the characters, despite their affections for each other, might be with other people. It sort of ruins the love story.  5. Final nit-pick but one that really turned me off. Oh the names. Oh man, some of the character names are just wretched. Po was nearly unforgivable. I realize it sounds silly, but the name Po just didn't inspire in me the character's personality. Same goes for Helda (like she opened up the big book of servant names), Bitterblue, almost all of the country names (Monsea reminded me of Monchichi which I think was a cartoon in the 80s), all of the characters on Captain Faun's ship, etc. I can see some people unable to take the characters seriously. (Princess Bitterblue reminded me of Princess Buttercup and it was all downhill from there)    Still, my nitpicks didn't detract from an excellent story. Highly recommended.
B0025KVLUQ|2.0|I believe this \\"remaster\\" will be considered one of the great sonic blunders of the CD age. There is too much compression on this thing-- it doesn't breathe, it doesn't feel in any way like a true performance. They were tempted by the sirens of compression, and they could not resist.

1934429376|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1SY4KX894R47K]]Charley Harper is an artist with a very unique style he calls \\"minimal realism\\". He's able to capture the essence of his subjects with minimal visual elements.<br /><br />The painting of birds caught my attention with the clean smooth lines which resembles vector work. His colour choices are from observation in life and the resulting image is always bold and striking. Many of his pieces are on nature.<br /><br />The author Todd Oldham only discovered Charley Harper's work in 2001. Since then, he has been collecting all the work he has ever published. The result is this impressive 424-page book that collects work that span the entire career of Charley Harper. It includes the commissions he done for Ford Motors, schools, advertising agencies, etc.<br /><br />There are two editions for this art book. The first is a 5.5kg book published in 2007, the year Charley Harper passed away. The newer edition, which I have, is the shrunken down version which is lighter, more handy and affordable. The construction of the book is great and all the illustrations are brilliantly reproduced.<br /><br />The contents are as follows:<br /><br />  * Conversation with Charley Harper<br />  * Betty Crocker's Dinner For Two Cook Book<br />  * The Giant Golden Book of Biology<br />  * The Animal Kingdom<br />  * Ford Times Magazine<br />  * Birds & Words<br />  * Advertising & Promotions<br />  * Mosaic Murals<br />  * Paintings<br />  * Posters<br /><br />There's a nice long interview written by Todd Oldham which is also translated in French, German, Italian and Spanish.<br /><br />Charley Harper has published a few books before so there might be some duplication here. If you're just intent on getting one book, make this the one. It's a beautiful, timeless art book.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B00092ZL80|5.0|As  they tell us, these guys (plus one woman) have been around for more than 30 years....at least, the core of each band has. It shows in a most positive way. While the bands may be particularly up or down on any given night, the concert tour organizers and the audiences know that most nights a group of solid professionals, highly skilled on their instruments, well rehearsed in the basic format of their program, will turn in a performance that will make the average audience happy. So it seems was true the evening this DVD was \\"cut\\". The sequence is described in Amazon's comments: an introduction by  both bands, a separate set for each, and then a prolonged finale by both. While each is a rock band set in their style for decades, they are enogh different in instrumental, physical and, particularly, vocal styles, to make a long program sufficiently diverse to maintain interest. Earth, Wind and Fire is a set of vocalists  supported by a fine  band, Chicago is a fine band with good vocalists.The first offers a more outgoing, audience-interactive demeanor, the latter a more focused instrumental ensemble. Their finale together is a typical all-out razzmatazz set, which, as used to be said, deservedly has the joint jumping. As is its intention, it overrides any  quibbles most in the audience will have had with particulars in the previous performances. As with the live audience, so with the DVD audience, you should end the session well satisfied with the concert. Oh, yes, as is almost always the case with these live endeavors, if you know the songs sung, you will be ahead of the game, as most lyrics are not sung to  be comprehended.
1591841666|2.0|... it really shouldn't be this book by Seth Godin. The funny thing is I'm actually a *big fan* of some of Seth's other books (The Purple Cow and The Big Moo being two of my favs - the former proudly displayed in our living room bookshelf as I speak) but I get the distinct feeling that Seth dreamed up this little \\"gem\\" while sitting on the crapper after a particularly spicy night of Thai food... in Queens evidently. It's not that this book is really that bad per se it's just bad when compared to his other work. And if I'm being totally honest, the concept is an interesting one (particularly to entrepreneurs like myself) but this treatment is a rather ridiculous over simplification of how life really plays out. Not to mention the fact that many of the examples used to illustrate points are so poorly analogized as to be severely off-putting, especially to anyone who knows anything about them. (Body building to office work... really? Oy vey!)    -Seth, I love your work man, and if you personally ask me to remove/modify this review I'd be happy to do so with a simple explanation. Opinions can change and I'm not an unreasonable person so perhaps I just don't get this book? (I've been know to be a little thick in the head from time to time.) So Seth, please prove me wrong about \\"the dip.\\"    Cheers,  Sean Conner

B002T9H2LA|1.0|I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino!  I own just about everything he has ever done,or acted in, or produced and the 2 I dont yet own, I want to get.  I didnt get a chance to see this in the theaters, so when it came out this week I went right to Target ( sorry amazon, new movies are a I want it now purchase) I came home and made sure I had everything ready for a great night at the movies, at home. Turned on the 46 plasma, cranked up the surround sound and settled into the couch with everything I would need so I would not have to get up for anything. I even turned the ringer off on my phones. And then I was in for the biggest disappointment of 2009.  I wont waste your time with giving a blow by blow report as to why I thought this was possibly the most horrible film I have seen in 2009,but lets just say being a huge Tarantino fan it is very hard to admit that this movie just falls flat on its face. The actors were great, or course the gore and blood sense were very gratuitous. It is after all Quentin. the movie just dragged on, and on, and on........ the story line was incredibly boring and mundane.  I just did not like it at all, and if I could, Id return it. But you know once you break the seal, you own it even if its not worth a nickle with dvds.  So it goes in the dvd collection as a reminder to rent it first before buying it. Redbox is only a $1, and even at that its to much for this film. gets one star because there is nothing lower.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|The Apocalypse is coming in the form of a Quarter Pounder. As powerful and alarming as \\"Food, Inc.\\" is, it's still probably too tame and restrained to convey just how horrendous our food system is. This really needs to be a 10 hour series that goes into extreme depth and detail, and is shown in every school and to every congressperson. I have tried to stop eating meat ever since I traveled through Texas cattle country 20 years ago. It's a scene as bad as any from Nazi Germany, the cattle pens resemble bleak concentration camps. And the stench is so extremely foul, it hits you many miles down the road, and then it stays with you for days, and weeks. A nightmare. I say I've tried to stop eating meat, but I am not perfect and have my weak moments. I eat much less meat than most people, and that's good, but I can do better. The big problem is that it's not just meat that's causing so much damage to our society. It's corn syrup and soy products, which are in nearly everything we consume. Even Batteries! So it's more than a little frustrating and confusing. There are a few good answers and positive ideas presented here, but we need more and we need 'em Fast. Technically, the film is superbly made, covers a very wide spectrum of the condition, and manages to not leave me feeling too hopeless and depressed. I do that fine all by myself. So, even though I don't think it goes nearly far enough to make us, all of us, realize that our Doom and Demise is accelerated by our irresponsible and inhuman food choices, I highly recommend \\"Food, Inc.\\"
0439023491|3.0|I am of two minds about this book because the two halves are like night and day. The first half is, regrettably, poorly written and suffers from very uneven pacing as well as \\"middle story\\" syndrome. The author is trying to expand the world that was set up in The Hunger Games, and tosses out a number of threads that set up the events of the next novel (as well as the second half of this one). The problem here is that there are so many ideas and events, with very little time spent developing each one before it is off to the next, that it's jarring. The pacing is so choppy that I think the first half would have benefited significantly from a non-linear structure, with parts perhaps being told in flashback. I also had difficulty believing some elements, such as the rather important conversation that takes place in the first chapter (I am trying to avoid spoilers here), as well as Katniss's continued naivete, but these are minor nits compared to the larger issue.<br /><br />Fortunately, when the second half rolls in, we're back to the tight pacing and excellent story telling that made The Hunger Games such a fabulous book. And, yes, there's a sort of cliffhanger ending that really delivers and sets up the third book rather neatly.<br /><br />So, overall, a good read that is almost sunk by a poor start. Just hang in there.

I am finding it frustrating to have to dial to the exact 2 min and 34 sec spot in my song to rerecord. Whenever I try to use the punch in and punch out mode I have to either start from the beginning of the track and wait till I get till 2min and 34 sec. Or rewind It each time manually to 2 min an 34 sec. Isn't their any way to go threw this faster? I rerecord multiple vocal takes and need to be able to start recording at the place I need to be at at the touch of a button.

B001OQCV24|1.0|I seriously thought about posting a one or two word review of this cinematic excrement.  After all, why waste more energy on this epic piece of trash?  It didn't even meet my minimum criteria for brainless popcorn flicks.  It wasn't even fun.  And if you can't make a movie about the destruction of humanity fun, what good are you as a director?  Emmerich's other films are stupid beyond words, but they at least were marginally entertaining.  As I squirmed restlessly through 2012, my thoughts shifted back and forth between two competing, frightening notions. First, I wondered whether Roland Emmerich and his writers were monumentally overpaid dunces.  At some level, the film has the feel of an earnest effort by folks who try to seem smart, but aren't.  For example, the ham-handed and inept insertion the Buddhist parable of the overflowing cup suggested dimwits who were desperate to appear intelligent, and might even have (falsely) fancied themselves as smart.  Second, and more chillingly, I wondered whether the movie was the product of careful marketing to a \\"common man idiot\\" from whom hundreds of millions of dollars could be wrested. Maybe it's both.<br /><br />As I left the theater, I wondered whether 2012 would push any alien overlords that might be looking in on mankind to pull the plug on our empty civilization. There would be at least one silver lining: no more movies like this one.

B00005Y1Y3|4.0|Released in 2002, \\"Bright Midnight: Live in America\\" offered previously unissued 1969-70 recordings of The Doors in concert. Now that the complete shows are available, this disc serves as a tantalizing sampler of the Hollywood, New York, Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Detroit engagements. Along with the excellent sound quality are memorable versions of \\"Break On Through,\\" \\"Five to One\\" and \\"Light My Fire.\\" From an unvarnished standpoint, Jim Morrison's drunken interpretation of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" tells you all you need to know about the group's wild and unpredictable Boston gig. Though derived from the same concert tapes, \\"Bright Midnight\\" remains a more satisfying Doors compilation than \\"Absolutely Live.\\"
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|During the 80s, the Walt Disney decided to do their own followup to the original 1939 Wizard Of Oz movie, but unlike Filmation's Journey Back To Oz, this one was live-action(although it had was some killer claymation). No relation to the Rankin/Bass animated TV special of the same name, Return To Oz was done in conjuction with MGM and weirdly enough George Lucus. The movie acts as a sequal to the 30s movie, as well as a combo of Land Of Oz and Ozma Of Oz. Taking place about 6 months after the cyclone hit, Dorothy's constant going on about Oz has her aunt and uncle worried that she's crazy, so they send her to a clinic to get lobotomized by a 19th Century pinball machine. She gets sprung by a mysterious blonde girl, and falls into the river during the middle of a rainstorm, and is swept back to Oz in a crate. Once there, she is suprised to see her hen Billina from back on the farm with her. They find Dorothy's old house near the ruins of the Yellow Brick Road, which is a little strange since the house didn't really go to Oz in the first movie as it was all a dream. She heads for what's left of the Emerald City where everyone has been turned to stone. Dorothy is then chased by some of the monsterous Wheelers(who're supposed to be in Ev!), and finds the robotic Tik-Tok in a closet. She winds him up, and he helps fend off the Wheelers. They then go to confront \\"Princess\\" Mombi, who here is more like the character of Princess Langwidere from Ozma Of Oz, where as Mombi from the books was your stereotypical wicked witch character. Princess Mombi kidnaps Dorothy so she can use her as one of her spare detachable heads, while Tik-Tok is unable to help her as he's wound down. While locked in a tower, Dorothy befriends Jack Pumpkinhead, a living wooden man with a pumpkin for a head. After winding up Tik-Tok again, they use the special Powder of Life to bring a flying creature with the head of a moose-like Gump to life and fly away. Dorothy and Co. end up on the mountain of the Nome King who they learned is responsible for totally screwing over Oz. The Nome King offers them the chance to save the Scarecrow who he's keeping as an ornament, but only at the cost of them turning into ornaments themselves. He also reveals that he managed to take over Oz thanks to the power of Dorothy's ruby slippers that fell into his desert when she went back to Kansas. After only Dorothy is left to go choose, she manages to free Scarecrow and the others, but the Nome King is a sore loser and threatens to devour all of them. Fortunately, Billina manages to lay an egg in his mouth, and eggs are poison to nomes. The Nome King kicks the bucket, and the Emerald City returns to its green glory. Dorothy is asked to become the new Queen of Oz, but says she wants to go home instead. However, Dorothy releases Princess Ozma(the true heir to the throne)from Mombi's magic mirror, who it turns out was the girl who freed her from the asylum, and uses the ruby slippers to send her back to Kansas. This movie was a drastic turn from the cheery musical that had until then become an American standard, and drew it more into the darker tone that the original L. Frank Baum novels had. Another aspect of the books taken into the movie was the character designs and the look of Oz itself. The movie's scarier motif actually frightened alot of kids and parents from seeing it in theatres, which subsequently turned this into more of a cult film. If you were expecting this to be something you could sit your toddlers down to watch without them peeing in their pants, you might wanna wait until they're a little older. Aside from that, the film is an almost perfect homage to Baum's legacy. Most notedly are the performances by Fairuza Balk as Dorothy who is the closest to being like the fictional character as possible, while at the same time is modeled after Judy Garland, although more closer the Dorothy's actual age. The other good performance is by Jean Marsh as Mombi, who reprised her character of an evil witch in the film Willow. I greatly admired the effort put into this, and truly believe it is a worthy continuation of the classic movie. Hopefully future Oz-related movie productions will make the same attempt to capture the magic of the original books.er of an evil witch in the film Willow.

It not only enlightens us about the horrific practices   of the billion dollar food industry, but also offers ways about how we can help  achieve changes in the system, such as shopping at farmer markets, directly   buying from local farms, caring about what we eat and how it is raised,   demanding that our grocery stores carry acceptable brands, and by letting policy   makers and local and national politicians know of our preferences for wholesome,  sustainably and humanly raised, locally grown food.

B002OVEB5S|3.0|First let me start off by saying that the album itself is great, I just had to take off 2 full stars for how useless the extra DVD is. Minus one star for the extra dough they charge for it and minus one star for how lame the short film is. I feel very disappointed and ripped off. The animation is boring crap, the storyline is lame, it doesn't feature even one full song and lasts a paltry 20 minutes long. SPOILER ALERT: Considering the content of Slayer's lyrics you would think the person who came up with the short film could of come up with something more unique. Instead, the plot follows a man who finds his mother killed by a man in a gimp suit when he was a child. Jump to about 20 years later and we find that he has become a killer himself, tracking down & killing various women in order to butcher them in an attempt to re-build his beloved mother out of the corpse' body parts. When his task is complete he lays down to take a nap with his creation only to wake up and find that she has left. That's it. Oh and if you think that sounds like perhaps the short film contains some cool Slayer lyric style gore, you'd be wrong, the gore isn't even satisfactory. The storyline could of been made more interesting had the short film been animated better (it was barely animated actually) or at least included some more creative imagery. Anyway, the album itself is KILLER! Just don't waste the extra dough for the DVD, it's a complete ripoff. I'm trying not to blame Slayer for ripping me off & instead put the blame on the schmucks who talked Slayer into including this lame crap with the album. Surely Slayer wouldn't rip their fans off in this way.<br /><br />P.S. If you're looking for a recent metal release with an excellent DVD companion, check out the Deluxe Edition of Dethklok's Dethalbum 2. It contains over 50 minutes of excellently animated & often hilarious cartoon music videos with all the gratuitous cartoon gore you could wish for.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|CASTLE is must-see TV for me, and not because it has anything lofty to say about the world or is trying to wow you with CSI-esque SFX and gadgetry.  CASTLE hearkens back to the classic '70s detective shows, where murders were solved by tracking down leads, using their brains, and cracking wise every now and again.    Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) is the playboy, Pulitzer winning, crime novelist who, through his connections with the Mayor, manages to finagle a ride-along with NYC homicide Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic).  After working with her and her team (Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever) on a case about a serial killer staging the murders like scenes in Castle's Derrick Storm novels, Castle decides that Beckett is the perfect muse from which to base his new series and break his writer's block after he killed off Storm out of boredom.  Kate is forced to put up with Castle's immaturity and blatant romantic advances because the NYC Police Department is in need of some good PR.    You definitely have to suspend your belief over things like: would a female homicide cop really run/break down doors wearing heels (albeit not high-heeled pumps, thank goodness); would a writer would be allowed this much access to evidence, interrogation, and suspects; a writer definitely wouldn't be riding along for this amount of time no matter how friendly he was with the mayor; and would he conveniently have the skills and connections to help solve so many murders.  This is not a show for those of you looking for CSI-like gritty, forensic crime dramas or dark, police procedurals.  The crime solving -- working through evidence & suspect leads, with a few twists along the way -- is secondary to the relationships and brainstorming.    Having no detailed/graphic forensic evidence explanations and being light on the action, Castle is really about the romantic dance between Castle's \\"6 year old on a sugar rush\\" crush on Beckett and Beckett holding him at bay with her wit and fortitude.  It's more like \\"Moonlighting\\" or \\"Remington Steele\\".  We also see Castle's  relationship grow with the other homicide detectives Esposito & Ryan and Captain Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson).  His home-life provides a nice counterpoint to his on-the-job shenanigans, where the loving bond of father and daughter (Molly Quinn) and son and mother (Susan Sullivan) -- even though they are (refreshingly) non-traditional takes on these roles -- show that Castle isn't just a spoiled, childish jerk.    As long as you approach the show as a fun, light, escapist romp, I think anyone can enjoy it.    The first episode is a bit heavy-handed on making Rick as obnoxious and over-the-top as possible.  The mother's character is also written that way for the first half of the season.  By the second half, the writers seemed to realize that she can be wacky without being obnoxious and the character makes the family dynamic work. The father-daughter moments between Fillion & Quinn are worth their weight in gold.  By season two, the show is a well oiled machine and all of the characters shine.    As for the extras, the audio commentaries, \\"Whodunit\\" and \\"Godfather\\" features are fun and insightful; the bloopers and outtakes are hilarious; the \\"Write-along\\" is a bit forced at first, but ends up being a lot of fun too.

I felt like i had to make myself keep reading just because i wanted to know the end, but it wasn't a book that i couldnt put down or anything like that.I enjoyed Picouldt's way of writing everyone member of the families point of view. I didn't enjoy the ending one bit though. I didn't take anything away from this book, i didn't reflect my life any different way, which is usually my faveorite parts of book. I was dissapointed in the lack of lesson in the book. Over all though, it was emotional and well crafted. If you enjoy this book i reccommend another jodi picoult book call the pact, touching on teen suicide.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|Do the math, unless your intraparietal sulci are fried.   German kills? 7, maybe. Four or five under the floorboards, two ladies; one strangled after she has killed an unarmed soldier, the other in self-defense.  American kills? 100's...including brain surgeries with dull instruments (infinitely more powerfully portrayed in The Untouchables), fatal tonsures, botched tracheostomies, spinal adjustments with heavy metals, mercy killings to spare the 'livestock' a par-broiled fate. Sitz-bath, anyone, after this putrescent mass passes?    No mention of the uncounted French, Belgium, Greek or Polish civilians put against walls for every German killed by a commando action. The highly educated/intelligent members of Mountbatten's \\"X-Troop\\" knew this. Their missions were to obtain information; to slip in and out of occupied Western Europe un-noticed. Though they sought invisibility, they suffered a 50% mortality rate.     No mention of the medical experimentation on old men, pregnant women and children. The ovens and charnel houses. The fields which are still white. Even burlesque can be edifying, or have a semblance of balance. How about a musical based in Cambodia in the late 70's? A lampoon set in Rwanda, 1994? Our history is filled with unimaginable tragedy. Salivate-away, QT. Aegri somnia.    Would Jimmy Stewart have played \\"Aldo the Apache\\"? Clark Gable? Charles Durning? Audie Murphy? Humphrey Bogart? David Niven? Charles Bronson? James Whitmore? Tyrone Power? Brian Keith? James Arness? Lee Marvin? Alec Guinness? Doubtful, as all of the aforementioned served honorably in actual combat in WWII. Have the makers lived in a war zone or experienced the horrors of combat? Seen bodies piled like cord-wood? Looked directly into the face of genocide? Hardly. Why is it these omega males in the industry so relish blood, brains and guts? Obvious. They're behind a camera, not under an MG42.       Is the parody of brutality in a casual, cavalier and comedic manner remotely healthy,given the context? Portraying our enemy's leaders as fools, perverts, simpletons and psychopaths, though they be so, is not a wise philosophy to propagate and instill into our national psyche. We do so at our own peril. The German High Command, in 1939, considered Americans too soft and decadent to repulse their Aryan might. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was recently referred to as a \\"cab driver\\" on a  syndicated program. Should a low-yield glow appear 80 miles over Kansas, your diodes and metaloxide semiconductors won't be grinning.   Were we to succumb to a fascist/totalitarian regime, these omegas would be the first into the chutes. Are they utterly ignorant of history?     Our 7.5 billion-seat Collosseum. Panem et Circenses? Consider the 32\\" classrooms our 'children' attend, the histories they learn. All celluloid. Many college grads cannot locate Germany or Japan on a world globe. Fewer know the date of our entry into WWII. 'Those who don't know history remain forever children'. Will the 'children' interpret this as gospel? When or if they reflect on WWII, will they think of us as the monsters? \\"History is 85% prejudice\\", said a wise historian.    This film is an insult to the 430000+ Americans who perished in the conflict, and specifically this group of commandos. If the prime-movers of this enterprise are so anxious to explore our dark nature, they should enlist. Fatigue their senses with real blood, guts and death. Place everything they are and ever will be onto a real stage.      Kruger, Waltz, and Laurent are too capable to be associated with this irresponsibly twisted, high-school-dropout, egesta.  The film fails as parody, satire, war epic, action, comedy, thriller/suspense, farce, adventure, social commentary, drama, or horror. It tries too hard to be all of these. It fails to be any of these.      The most charismatic character is a monster. The most sympathetic character, Shosanna, is poorly developed...so where does the audience seek sanctuary? With whom do weidentify? Where is some high ground (or a hole to crawl down)?  The dialogue is torturous, protracted, and puerile.   The whole thing is a disrespectful paean to a confusing number of silver-screen progenitors. Inside joke?  Expand your intellectual horizons, QT; get your GED.     Ars est celare artem (it is [true] art to conceal art).    This is story-telling at its worst.
B001UXJQHE|5.0|I have given this dvd a 10 out of 10 as I feel the presentation is the best out of all of the Andre Rieu programs. The music selection and vocals is just great. Had Carla M. had at least on song on the dvd the program would have been over the top at a 11 or 12. Great addition to any musical collection.
0896898288|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book.  It has inspired me to try to make a quilt like this one.  The letters from the farmers' wives are wonderful.  Even if you don't quilt, you would love reading it.
0316066524|5.0|When this book was first published, I rolled my eyes at friends who recommended it. Five or so years later, I read it again, and enjoyed it. Two years after, at 23, I read it again. And the footnotes. And read it again. It's been one of my favorite books ever since, and at 29, I am convinced it will become more relevant with time. And I say this as the child of a librarian and granddaughter of a professor who previously thought the only good books were published pre-1950, a la Tolstoy. I was wrong, and learned it thanks to this novel.<br /><br />DFW was one of the most intelligent and prolific writers in modern history. He not only saw societal problems on various levels, he understood the way to make these issues most relevant to a modern audience was to approach them in a beautiful dance of words and metaphors, which is what he has done in these pages. It is not easy to read. He didn't want it to be. Wallace was against, and admirably so, the dumbing down of literature and of the masses. He expected more of the reader, and the reader in turn was given the imaginative web of characters, subplots, and humor in Infinite Jest. It was well worth the effort.<br /><br />There is so much I could say about this book, but I couldn't possibly do it justice or come close to the genius of the author. I'm not typically impressed by modern literature, and find most 'hyped' writers to be cliche, self important, and boring. DFW, while certainly a bit arrogant of his own intelligence, was a notable exception. He saw the world in a way that was honest, heartfelt, and complicated (realistically).David Foster Wallace, we miss you. Thank you for this book. It mattered more than you thought.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Not so much a movie, more of something for film students to do reports on. It's so slow! When are people going to realise if you put in subtitles, don't put light colored writing over light colors so people can't read them! I don't mind subtitles myself, I love asian films. When you put in English subtitles, shouldn't you put all the subtitles in English? Most of them are in English, but some are in German (when the character is speaking German) or French(when the character is speaking French). Pointless, just like this flick.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|The best Sci-Fi I have seen.  Period. I think Universal has to take a chance on making a sequel to Serenity.  The fanbase is continuing to grow and it's quite evident in the DVD and Bluray sales.  Universal gave the green light to spend a $40 budget and they pretty much made that money back with movie tickets and DVD sales.  I'm pretty sure if they decide to shell out another 40 to 50 million for a sequel, they will not be disappointed.  I will be the first one on line for a movie ticket.  Bring it back Joss Whedon!!!
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I have not yet had a chance to view this DVD so cannot comment other than give satisfaction on speed of delivery.  Even my rating is an estimate since I have not watched the movie yet.
B0025VLEM0|4.0|4 of 5 stars for the creepy sci-fi movie Shaun of the Dead. I started watching this movie with low expectations (look at the cover, come on...). As it started, I was prepared to be disappointed. So meet Shaun a male air-head drifting thru a dull life. Totally asleep about things around hm. Shaun barely notices when those people around him start to ah ah change. Yeah, change. As the people around him become zombies, they (as you would expect) move much more slowly than normal people. The zombie disease is passed person to person by a bite (zombies like to bite). So with little purpose or plan, Shaun starts to collect the people in his life who are not infected and take them to a safe place; their corner bar.<br /><br />A very British movie, a kinda odd and funny movie. It turned out to exceed my expectations enough that I'm giving it a 4 star rating. I do recommend this movie but not for young people; its kinda bloody.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|There are a few holes in the plot that would be hard to close.    I'll ignore the question of why the Vulcans loaded Spock's ship with a huge ball of red material (looks like ~1m in diameter, or ~500 liters), when only a droplet is needed.    I'll ignore the question of why Nero is the last of his race. If the Romulans knew their planet is about to be destroyed, I would expect them to send away as many people as possible.      OK, Nero has seen his planet & culture destroyed. By some miracle, he returns 129 years back in time. Then he waits 25 years, and the tool with which he could save Romulus falls into his hands. What does Nero choose to do ?    Give the Romulans some red matter, so they could save themselves in a hundrend years ?    Go home and enjoy the company of his own race ?    Give his race technology which allows to arm a single mining ship with weapons that can destroy an armada of star fleet ships ?    No, no, and no. He goes to destroy Vulcan and the federation on his own, ignoring Romulus & it's fate. How logical of him !
B000WZAE1I|4.0|4 of 5 stars for the fantasy adventure movie Stardust. A really nice fantasy movie was fun to watch. A young man lives in a town that borders a magic place; a stone wall is the dividing line. As the young man escapes his town he finds many wonders in the magic land. The movie addresses a couple of generations of time and events. In the future generation, an old king about to die needs to name one of his seven sons as new king. They are sent on a quest. Oh, and the sons have a habit of killing each other. And then there is this girl or is she a star? Not really sure. Yes, a little confusing, but, a funny and nice story. Very well made with a good look and feel. Special effects are well integrated.<br /><br />All in all, a fun, cute, interesting movie with a couple of plot surprises. Well worth the time to watch. Recommended for teens and up. BTW, Michelle Pfeiffer is still beautiful and one of my favorites--she plays on of the witches (oh, did I mention there are witches?).
1594488878|3.0|Nick Hornsby's novels are kind of like candy: they are enjoyable and fun, but they don't have a lot of staying power. \\"Juliet, Naked\\" falls squarely into the Hornsby niche. I zipped through it on a snowy weekend and found myself wanting to see what would happen next. But I didn't feel as if I'd learned anything by the end, nor was I taken to an especially interesting world. It was sort of like hanging out with someone who lived through the 60s as a hippie and has some tales to tell )even though this book doesn't focus on that period at all), and it's fun to hear his stories, even though now he just works in the cubicle next to you.    The plot is Hornsby's typical music nostalgia, but twisted through the lends of today's obsessive bloggers. It almost feels as if Hornsby is trying to remain relevant by using the web as a plot device. I'd feel better, probably, if the characters hated the web and spent time trying to fight the encroachment of it on their lives.    Anyway, the book centers around Duncan, who's an obsessive fan of a reclusive 1980s musician named Tucker.  He hasn't been seen nor heard from in 20 years.  Why Tucker dropped out of sight just at the time he was starting to earn a broad following is the puzzle that Tucker and his fellow bloggers discuss endlessly, while trading bootleg concert tapes and trying to decode Tucker's lyrics. Duncan has been in a loveless, pallid relationship with Annie for 15 years, and she's now 39 years old and childless and wondering if she's wasted her life with Duncan. Duncan has similar thoughts, though without the regrets about children. Anyway, when Duncan is given the first copy of a soon-to-be-released CD of Tucker's demo tapes for his most famous album, Duncan praises the CD. Nobody else seems to like it very much, including Annie, who writes a critical review on Duncan's website. Tucker has been reading the website while trying to understand his 20-year funk, and he writes to Annie to compliment her on her analysis.They begin an email friendship and flirtation, and then they meet face-to-face a few months  later when Tucker comes to London to see his daughter. Duncan has left Annie for another woman, though, predictably, he's having regrets about his decision. So Annie and Tucker have a fling that might enable each of them to break out of their deadening patterns.    In the last 10th of the book, various plotlines come together, as Tucker tries to make sense of his lost two decades, Annie tries to make sense of her lost 15 years, and Duncan tries to explain to Tucker why he has been so inspirational to his fans.     It's a neat little package, and it actually seems very plausible. There's some exaggeration for comic effect, but, basically, it could happen. Perhaps the Tucker person wouldn't be so witty after spending 20 years as a drunk (and then a recovering alcoholic) with three ex-wives and a bunch of children he's avoided. He'd probably be less charming, less attractive, and less devoted to his youngest child -- but that's a minimal complaint.    All in all, it's a fun book. Unlike some Hornsby books, you don't need to know much about music or pop culture to understand what he's describing. It's more about the inner world of Duncan and Annie and Tucker -- three middle-aged people struggling with lost opportunities and lost time.
B001DHXT2A|2.0|I loved this movie in theaters and waited this long to buy it. I knew I wanted the three disc set with the itunes copy. I have the dark knight digital copy and i find it really rewarding to have my favorite movies on demand at my desktop.    The download for this digital copy expired mere weeks before I bought it in november of 2009.    I emailed Universal home video but have gotten no response.    I was gypped.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|We saw this movie when it first was broadcast on HBO a long, long, long time ago ... had to watch it twice to make sure what we were seeing was actually what we were seeing. Then had to watch it a third time to make sure.<br />This is NOT a movie for children to watch! Even if \\"Caligula\\" was called \\"Little Boots\\" in ancient Rome, THIS IS NOT A film for the kiddies. Actually, I'm not sure my Grandmother is old enough to watch this! But I am ...<br />Malcolm McDowell portrays Caligula as a lot of history implies - sadistic, degenerate and totally amoral. Reminds me a bit of his role in Kubrick's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", but not quite as unnerving.<br />Obviously, we cannot attest to the historical accuracy of the content, but it is an interesting film.<br />If you have the chance, watch it for yourself. You'll agree.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Breathtaking scenery in the film.  You must see it in 3D.  THe floating mountains, the flying birds.  The crazy animals.  Just a great Sci-Fi Adventure.  I predict that this will hit top 10 in IMDB.  WHen I looked yesterday, it was 169.  Now it is 51.  This is a spectabular movie.  Groundbreaking movie technology.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|I am a very heavy gamer, I literally DONT turn off my machine 24/7.  The reason is, my game runs 24/7, selling stuff / leveling and stuff.  The graphics card is engaged 100% of the time as well, running my computer at 95% to 100% cpu utilization all the time.  My computer used to run 49 degrees to 50 degrees with the 'stock' thermal compound.  I then planned of buying a stronger processor to upgrade my laptop so I bought this arctic silver 5 3.5grams compound.  Turns out day after that the processor i'm trying to buy got sold out, in short i didnt replace my processor.  Just so i'm so bored and I told myself its useless that I bought this, i disassembled my laptop Gateway P-7805u and replaced the original thermal compound with this AS5.  And WOW, my peak temperature dropped from 50 degrees to 45 degrees, tops.  usually stays at 44 degrees.  So i would say, this pretty much made my laptop 10% cooler than my stock original thermal compound.  Needless to say, the fan doesnt run as much as it does before.  Totally worth the money!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has enchanted me with soft words and sweeping melodies. She has brought me to sing again songs I thought left far behind.

B002MW50KO|5.0|It is a common opinion that Dylan's greatest strength is his lyrics - no, it is his singing that is his greatest strength. It is interesting to see the number of 1 star reviews for this album of tuneful cover versions. A lot of folks don't seem to like dylan's singing here never mind the backing singers or the fact that he is 68 years old. When Dylan wrote a mainly instrumental album in the early 70's it was still his vocals that clinched the deal. For example, there is a beautiful longish instrumental build up to Billy 1 but when the vocal comes in you are in the prescence of vocal greatness - it is simple as that. What has that got to do with 'Christmas in the Heart' in 2009. Well there is a lack of respect or ignorance towards Bob Dylan the vocalist. Remember 'No auction Block' from the early 60's a song that is not a Dylan original but how good is the vocal ? i mean really just how seriously great a singer is he? Here on this fabulous christmas album nearly 50 years later it is a voice that has sung many a song and 'lived a life'. 'I'll be home for christmas' has something in the vocal that hits the nail on the head as to what that song is about - never heard a better version this side of Elvis Presley. i think i'll phone up Josh Groban and ask him how good a singer is Bob Dylan and if he thinks his version is better? I don't know what he would say - really don't -love the way Dylan can release a grest record and have fervent fans give it 1 star . i spoke to Elvis recently and this is what he said: \\"Dylan's voice cuts through iron and steel - it is truthful and gets to me like no other. i really liked 'Christmas in the Heart' ..i'm a big fan -\\" The cd has 15 tracks covering the main bases of what christmas has become and therefore what it is :) there are 4 tracks that are joyful in their insanity - 'here comes santa' 'winter wonderland' are a bit mental as is the frantic 'must be santa' -a party song if ever i've heard one. Possibly the most nutty track is 'Christmas Island' - the fruity backing singers and guitars are a joy to behold as are the words referencing presents in the canoe and staying up late with the islanders. Yes, Christmas pretty much has descended into madness these days. Dylan also presents 'O Little Town Of Bethlehem', 'Hark The Herald Angels Sing' and 'The First Noel' traditional carols in case we forget we are suppose to be celebrating the incarnation of the solid rock made before the foundation of the world :) Hanging on? can't say - oh i forgot about 'oh come all ye faithful' that starts off with some frankly bizarre Latin (and not any south american vibe). When i was speaking with Elvis he thought his version was better but he did not want to make a big fuss about it out of respect for Dylan. There is 'drummer boy' too and a thankfully less sugary 'do you hear what i hear' than Bing Crosby's version. There are also a few nostalgia type tracks such as 'silver bells' and the nat king colish 'christmas song'. Like several dozen others the record reflects Christmas has become a variety of things; for some it seems to be a time of intense loneliness because there is something about the festive period that brings this out. Dylan does 'christmas blues' one of the most interesting songs here and it does a great job conveying that sadness -one of two without the backing singers. It too has a great vocal. The album cover, title and even the saucy inlay let us know not be too serious here. Dylan, of course, is a music lover. On this album it shows in particular -can't explain it....there is corn, there is santa for crying out loud but certain songs are being sung nevertheless.

B002VPE1AM|4.0|It's not just been the most talked about movie of the year - it's been over a decade James Cameron has been building to this - so it would seem that Cameron has built expectation too high and that the movie could only disappoint.  And yet, while not a perfect movie, he certainly has pulled something special out of the bag - a real spectacle of a movie, something new, and finally - a film where the 3D is not a distraction (or worse, a headache).  For the record, I saw this in IMAX, so perhaps this helps the immersive nature of the 3D.  While it is still to my way of thinking a gimmick which does not truly add to the experience, it does have the virtue in this case of actually working, rather than distracting you.  Cameron seems to be the first to make a feature in 3D where there are certainly moments of things shooting out of the screen (Look, floating drops of liquid! Duck, the flamethrower is coming this way!), but always within the confines of the story development, and never shoehorned in because of the medium.  What we are treated to is utterly spectacular worlds which are entirely a figment of the creator's imagination, believable in a way that cgi has seldom, if ever, been before.  There's a richness of lore and background here that will actually make this worth watching twice to catch the detail.  But what about the movie itself... The story is vintage Cameron, and has been much discussed - enough to say it wears it's anti-war and pro-environment credentials on its sleeve.  The planet Pandora has been targeted by one of those big cumbersome corporations Cameron specialises in, with big brutish machinery and military to back it up, to take a valuable mineral in large strip mining operations.  However, the planet's population don't take too kindly to this.  To interact with the 12 foot high N'abi and this world where everything is oversized, genetically created Avatars are used.  It's the `user' of one of these Avatars who becomes the lynchpin of the story - anex-marine, who now has to decide whether to gain his redemption by fulfilling his marine training, or to embrace the new Gaia he finds on Pandora.  Sam Worthington is perfect in the role - it works that he is relatively unknown, so that we just believe him in the role.  Sigourney Weaver is also her usual terrific self and several other character actors fill out the other roles.  However, the natives (who are to all intents and purposes like Native Americans), and the bad guys (the evil land-raping corporation with its attendant military) are just a little too stereotypically bad.. there's no feeling that you can get inside their heads or understand them.. they are just ciphers in the story to make a point.  Perhaps that's ok when it's a point well made, but the bluntness and obvious nature of the message here could grate with some.  At over two hours long, the movie seems just a little long, but it would be tough to decide which spectacle you'd like to cut to make it shorter - the floating mountains?  The aerial battles?  The flying.. well ok, enough said, I don't want to give any more away...  So a popcorn chewing event movie it is, classic cinema it isn't.  It might not be spectacularly good - but it's definitely good - and certainly spectacular.  Frankly, with all the hype, and with all the new cinematic technology on display, if you don't go see it to make up your own mind, you're going to find yourself left out of a few conversations...
B001LRJH0U|2.0|First I am a fan of Harris, Mortensen, Zellweger, and even Irons. I am also a fan of westerns which have faded from the mainstream quite a bit. I was really excited about Appaloosa but after a watch I found myself personally very disatisfied. The acting is great, the scenery and setting are perfect, but the story! It is extremely sluggish and dry and often times confusing. I found myself often asking \\"why are they doing this?\\" and \\"wait, what?\\" There is a total of 1 major fight scene that lasts all of 20 seconds despite the films promise of \\"Thunderous Action and Nail-Biting Suspense.\\" The majority of the movie seemed to center around Ed and Viggo sitting around drinking coffee talking to each other. Maybe I just need to watch it again but first impressions are everything and to be honest, mine wasn't a good one.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is my first cd from him and I love it. It is a must buy.
B002JWD6AS|2.0|This book was a really big disappointment. When I read the backcover, I thought 'Wow, this seems pretty good.' I read the reviews on it and saw that most people put five stars so I said 'What the heck?' and wasted a pretty penny on it. While the author's hot-and-cold view on werewolves was pretty original, the rest of the story was sappy and boring.  Grace is obbsessed with a wolf--creepishly obbsessed in my opinion because at the time, she thinks he's just a wolf with pretty eyes--who saved her a couple years back from a whole pack attack. Every winter she pretty much hangs around outside to stare at a wolf who won't come out of the woods. Then one day, I won't go into why, she finds a naked guy at her slider--if I remember correctly--and immediately takes him to the hospital where she waits for him and then offers to let him stay at her house since her parents are basically nonexistant. Soon, he's sleeping in her bed but, of course, he doesn't try anything because that would be too realistic. Come on! A teenage werewolf boy isn't putting the moves on a pretty girl while they are in the same bed? Its just too fake. She also makes it pretty clear that she doesn't mind if he acts a little PG-13. And since I feel bad for bashing the book so much, I'll say that the writing was very well done, poetic even, but waaaaay too sappy for my taste.  So the plot was good, the events were unrealistic, and the writing was well done but too girly for me. Yep, that pretty much sums it up.
B002MW50KO|1.0|I bought Dylan's Christmas in the Heart CD today.  I haven't bought a CD in 2 or 3 years.  The concept of Dylan singing Christmas carols seemed unusual, so I thought I would give it a listen.     Is it possible to create one of the best albums of all time (Blood on the Tracks) & one of the worst?      Not only is this Christmas CD/album unusual, it could be one of the worst albums of all time.  You can't play it around little kids, I think they would be scared & start crying.  My ears hurt listening to it.  It may even cause bleeding in the aural canal.    It is not just disappointing, but it is historically bad.  If you didn't know it was Dylan singing, you might think is was William Huang of American Idol infamy or a drunk uncle who smoked too much & sang into a tape recorder.    This is from a context of me liking much, but not all, of Dylan's stuff. I think Love & Theft from about 5 years ago is great.      Dylan's CITH CD's badness is of historical magnitude.  I listen to it because it is so unbelievably bad, perhaps like slowing down on a highway to get a better look at a fatal car crash.     All proceeds go to charity, so at least something good is coming out of this project.    Merry Christmas to all & best wishes for 2010.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This is so far by one and only Blu-Ray disc.  I haven't seen quite all of it yet.  The quality of the pictures is sensational.  I got this one because I know it's something I will be watching more than once.  A great bargin.    My only reservations are (1) For me there is a bit too much animal stalking and killing.  I know this is the natural way of the world, but there are people I can't show this too because of all the sometimes savage killing.  (2) The sound level is way too low.  I have to jack the volume up 100% or more to hear the narration.  Then sometimes I forget to put the volume down again, leading to an unpleasant blast from my speakers.

0385504225|2.0|I have read Brown's Deception Point and I thought it was actually a better book than the Lost Symbol. Here is the major problem I see with this work (I might have this same critique of Deception Point if i reread it): it is essentially a long drawn out plot of a single day or a series of days that has very little substance or depth. This entire book (and I mean the entire book) is drawn out by the lead characters going on tangents that really do very, very little to advance the plot or add anything worthwhile to it. The essence of the book could be written in a page or less, but Brown drags you through pages and pages of essentially useless information (some parts of which I eventually ended up just skipping past because I was so annoyed after hundreds of pages of it). I found myself thinking, \\"Get to the point already!\\" I understand this is an action/thriller-style novel, but I want Brown to leave me feeling more intellectually or even spiritually fulfilled rather than just entertained.     Most importantly, I felt that the ending was very weak, anticlimactic, and not the revelation that Brown set me up to think it would be. I will say no more.    So the book wasn't for me. That said, if your looking for something just to entertain you for a few days, pick up a copy. You may like the ending of the book and I can guarantee you that you will be entertained.

B00127RAJY|5.0|After working out with a variety of Biggest Loser DVDs for several months, I finally picked up one of Jillian Michael's solo projects, the 30 Day Shred. This DVD includes 3 levels of difficulty, meant to be worked up to over 30 days (presumably spending 10 days in a row on each level). Once you've hit the 30 days, or whatever schedule you work out for yourself, I recommend rotating all 3 levels for a nice variety.    To summarize, this DVD is fantastic. Jillian employs a unique 3-2-1 circuit training system - three minutes of strength training (divided into two 30 second / 1:30 intervals), two minutes of cardio (divided into two 30 second repeating intervals), and one minute of abs, which you do three times with different moves in each circuit. Jillian has two 'helpers' working out behind her - one who generally does an easier, modified version of a move, the other who does a more hardcore move to work your way up to.    Level 1 is a nice light workout that will still get your heart going, but without killing you - a great intro to the system and as Jillian promises, it does get easier with time, helping you to build up confidence in your body. Level 2 is by far the hardest of the 3 levels, with a large focus on the arms / shoulders / plank pose. Level 3, although challenging in its own way with many plyometric / jump training moves, also has some really creative moves I haven't seen in the other workout DVDs I've used, which actually makes it more fun than level 2.    Jillian herself is, as always, a great motivational force. She doesn't talk too much, her instruction is very intuitive to make sure you don't strain your muscles or perform something incorrectly, and she seems to know exactly when you want to quit. Her 'bodies' in the back are a little less inspiring, angling more towards the robotic end of things, but they thankfully show good form, and also a little humanity when they get as tuckered out as you do (PS - keep an eye on Natalie, she cops out on a fewmoves, which Jillian occasionally calls her out on...you know it's a tough workout!).    And most importantly - the results. This was a game changing DVD for me. I believe all of the working out I'd done leading up to this DVD was the perfect foundation for finally getting results. I've noticed my muscles firming up, my body slimming down, and generally just felt healthier and stronger, and very happy with how I've progress in general. I don't do all the tough moves all the time (or in a few cases, ever), and I should probably do Level 2 a bit more often, but I still feel great and happy I tried this DVD out, I definitely want to check out other Jillian Michaels products.    A couple of caveats for everyone out there - I feel like this DVD would be extremely challenging for someone who hasn't been working out on a relatively consistent basis. Having done five months of Biggest Loser DVDs, I was used to the types of moves explored here - lots of squats, lunges, planks, etc. Don't be afraid to slow down the pacing of this DVD - work your way up in longer than 30 days, I myself spent two weeks on each level instead of just 10 days. Additionally I think if you're on the older side, this DVD would be quite challenging, as I tried to get my mom to do a Level 3 jumping lunges move and she nearly fell over. Finally, I wouldn't recommend anything heavier than a 3 lb or 5 lb weight, unless you're going for a bodybuilder look. As it is, I mostly stick to the 3 lb as I find many of Jillian's moves are pretty explosive and can strain your muscles with a 5 lb weight. That's not to say it's not worth challenging yourself - but be aware that this DVD is not for the ambivalent towards getting fit!
0920668372|5.0|I read this book to my son over and over when he was little.  He's now 20 yrs old and still says it's one of the best memories he has of growing up.  I've given it for shower gifts, and people tell me years later they still love it.
B002O4J4DO|3.0|Why take the legacy of a great band, upgrade the audio then leave out several crucial cuts on a 2-disc compilation? Despite the fair price, there are at least six cuts from Chronicles 2 that should have been on here instead of six cuts that maybe be part of the band's history, but don't deserve a place here. In addition, the four videos sound like al;bum tracks and look as old as they are.<br />This two-disc collection should  have been an audio upgrade of Chronicles 1 & 2 instead of the poor collection it is.<br />Upgraes for man of the songs can be found on Fogerty's great \\"Long Road Home.\\"<br />This recording, however, is a must to avoid.

B002OHDRF2|5.0|I recently watched this movie and I really enjoyed it.  Having seen the previous three movies, I was skeptical, but it really had good continuity; especially with the first two Terminator movies.  I think they should actually make another movie to continue this story line.  What I didn't like was the way Amazon constantly changed the price and finally bumped up the full screen addition to $24.99.  I went to ebay and bought it brand new for $9.99.  Amazon needs to be more competitive.

B0026P3G12|2.0|with all the hype , i was expecting something spectacular. this cd is very disappointing. there are only a few cuts, (I Dreamed A Dream, Wild Horses, You'll See) that showcase her fantastic voice. the rest  are tedious and drag. and,  what's with all the church songs? hopefully if she records again she will pep it up a bit, and choose songs worthy of her voice.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|This album absolutely blew me away the first time I heard it and I find it more compelling with each listen.  It's use of classical motifs and a big, arena sound are absolutely magnificent.  The album is meant to be listened to from track one to the end, though each track stands well on its own.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|I got it for $9.99 for the Black Friday.  It is great. Sent the copy to Costa Rica.  The digital copy works when transfering through Media Player.   But I couldn't have it work for Itunes. Didn't recognized the code even though it was recognized in WMP.  Great quality. No complains. Lots of Audio and Subtitles options.
074356619X|5.0|Wonderful set! I don't have time to read a book and thought this is a great way to get through the book.  All my friends have the book and loved it.  I have not listened to it yet, but my friends said the book was wonderful.
B002MW50KO|5.0|For those of you who don't appreciate this album and/or Bob Dylan, I understand.  It's similar to those who look at a Picasso and say, \\"What a mess!\\"    For those of you who have heard and felt Bob Dylan's genius over all these years, you will understand what I mean when I say, \\"I can't completely explain why I listen to Bob Dylan and I can't completely explain why I appreciate him more and more each time I listen.\\"  There are very few artists who have this gift.  This album gets better every time I listen to it.    Thanks to you Bob and thanks for dontating the proceeds to feed the needy.
B0014E9188|5.0|First, to be honest as a fan of Porcupine Tree it would be hard to disappoint me and this DVD package certainly did not. Because my chance of getting the opportunity to see the band live is not very good I was glad to get a chance to see PTree on stage and this concert performace recorded in Chicago during the October 11th and 12th 2005 portion of the Deadwing Tour.<br />The setlist is good, as with any live concert footage unless it is sliced and diced from multiple shows you are limited to what the band plays in the show but this is a good selection of the bands material over several albums. I won't go into the specifics the product info gives you that but it is a good representation.<br />The video is good live stage action, some of the footage from the stage video, multiple angles, the black and white segments fit in well with the Deadwing theme and art work.<br />There are some nice extras, a segment of concert footage from the Rockpalast show and options that allow you to enjoy the video productions from the band. It provides some good variation from the concert footage.<br />Overall I was well satisfyied.

A must for early<br />Sci-fi fans!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Certainly wasn't disappointed.  In fact, turned the sound up and got lost in the music.  Then came interviews, TV specials, guest appearances and the promise of more to come.  I thank her for all the reflections her singing has given to me.
B000R9J3XE|5.0|Love this CD, it has all the classics, but I was disappointed that Supervixen wasnt on it....oh well...Still good
B002VECM6I|5.0|The recently released sports movie, Blind Side, is an eye opener and takes a look at how one person, and in this case one family, can make the difference in the life of an individual down on his luck. It is a feel good movie and you'll leave the theater thinking better of your fellow man. Now, everytime I tune into an NFL game involving the Baltimore Ravens,I won't be looking downfield to see the result of the play, instead I'll be back at the line, focusing in on No. 74, Michael Oher, to see if the 6-4, 309 pound tackle did his job. For you sports fans out there, it has been well publicized how Oher, a homeless teenager was taken in by a well-to-do family, learned to play football at a Christian school,went on to star at Ole Miss and was drafted by the Ravens earlier this year and has now started in all 13 NFL games.I doubt Blind Side will garner any Oscars, unless Sandra Bullock can somehow beat out Meryl Streep for the best actress hardware. Bullock is outstanding in the role as the patriarch of the white, well-to-do Tuohy family who ropes in the homeless, African-American teenager and changes his life forever. As a side note,I'm becoming a Tim McGraw fan. Not because he's a heck of country singer, or for the fact he's the husband of Faith Hill, but because he's not too bad on the silver screen. Despite the fact, McGraw, who plays Leigh Ann Tuohy's husband in Blind Side, takes second-billing to Bullock's performance,I noticed his soft-spoken, behind the scenes portrayal of the family's bread winner.A few years back, McGraw played just the opposite as Charles Billingsley, an alcoholic father in the 2004 sports movie Friday Night Lights.Two different roles, but two very good performances. As for Blind Side, I'd give it a five-star ranking and put it among the decade's best sports movies.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|When this was released, it became my favorite album.  Forty years later, it still is.  Mick Taylor, the greatest lead player in a two guitar band ... Keith Richards, the greatest rhythm guitar player since Son House ... Mick Jagger, the greatest combo front man/singer of all time ..., add the genious feel and tumble-down tandem of Bill and Charlie, and you have the incredible brew that was truely the Greatest Rock and Roll Band of all time.    I'm astonished that they left Satisfaction off the original release.  It is as great as JJF, Rambler, or Sympathy!        If you are young, buy this release.  If you have heart, soul, guts, brains, and sexual organs, you will be levitated.  Absolutely levitated.    Now you understand, I hope.  The greatest rock and roll album of all time just got even better!!!    Thank you, Stones.  Thank you, Mick Taylor.  Thank you, Abkco.

0761119752|2.0|I agree with number of people, \\"The rhymes do not flow very well.\\"  Of course they don't because she is heavily \\"inspired\\" from Dr.Seuss' book called one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish. When taken out of context, no wonder the rhymes do not flow well - you can not imitate the master!      It was disappointing that she copied some of the lines verbatim: page 6 of the Seuss' book reads \\"Some are red. And some are blue. Some are old and some are new.\\" So does her book...    Don't waste your money with her book but get the Dr. Seuss's Beginner Book Collection. Brilliantly written and fun to read over and over...
0385504225|3.0|\\"Lost Symbol\\" starts out strong.  It is a quick paced thriller with intellectual stimulation all around.  How could it not be with Robert Langdon at the center?  Unfortunately, toward the end of the book, it stops being quick paced and it stops being a thriller.  About the time you learn the ludicrous reason the CIA is involved (the CIA involvement is not a spoiler--it happens early on), Dan Brown's latest falls into a mess of irrational plot twists and plodding dialogue.  In fact, the plot itself ends many chapters before the epilogue and the book takes on a tedious pseudo-textbook quality (once again, not a good thing).  With the novel alternating between a preachy Sunday sermon and my worst college American History professor, it became a battle of wills between me and Brown--could I actually hang on long enough to finish the book or would Brown's pedantic prose lull me to sleep (in the middle of the afternoon).  I won, if you can call actually finishing a book that had lost all interest to me.<br /><br />The beginning is good enough to warrant a \\"not bad rating\\" with the stars but the end keeps it from being a truly good book.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The first one i received had a gash in it, i notified amazon via e-mail and they overnighted me another, i had to wait until fri, instead of wed, but no big deal. This was great customer service on amazon's part. I appreciate them very much. Keep up the great service. R.P.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I reviewed the theatrical cut of this movie a while back.  I didn't like it, to say the least.  I thought it was badly written, badly acted, and badly cast.  I stand by that review, but Amazon will only let me put up one review of this movie.  This movie and the theatrical cut are two different movies.  This movie is a huge missed opportunity, and it shows just how idiotic studio execs can be.    Daredevil is one of my favorite comic book superheroes.  He is a very unique and interesting character.  He is a crime-fighting vigilante by night, and a lawyer by day.  That is the cool thing about him.  You can have good Daredevil stories with super-villain fights, and good Matt Murdock stories that take place in and around the courtroom.  Personally, the Matt Murdock persona was always more interesting to me than Daredevil.  And this movie is a Matt Murdock story.  The plot of this movie was cut out of the theatrical cut.  Not a subplot, like it says on the back of the box.  THE plot.  The only thing left in the theatrical cut is a couple of subplots.  Matt Murdock agrees to defend Coolio (I don't remember the character's name), who stands accused of murdering a prostitute, Lisa Tazio.  That's the thing about Matt Murdock, he defends the people that no one else wants to defend.  He finds out from Ben Urich, a reporter, that Tazio had access to one of the Kingpin's men.  She was selling Urich information about Kingpin, and they killed her to shut her up.  Murdock realizes this and realizes that not only does this lead back to the Kingpin, but that Fisk is the one who killed his father years ago.  And it makes sense when Daredevil tells Fisk that \\"the word's out on the Kingpin.\\"    Now that I have seen the actual movie, I have a completely different outlook on the casting.  Ben Affleck is an alright Daredevil, but a perfect Matt Murdock.  And to me, that persona is more important.  I like Jennifer Garner as Elektra, which is surprising because I did not like her in the theatrical cut.  And role was not cut down a whole lot in that version.  Fans have complained that this version of Elektra is not enough like the comic book character.  In the comics, Murdock and Elektra dated in college.  When her father was murdered, a torn Elektra left Matt.  He next sees her years later, when she has become a vigilante.  The film version of Elektra is partly based on Maya Lopez, aka Echo, from David Mack's run.  The similarities are unmistakable.  Her father is killed by the Kingpin.  She is manipulated into believing that Daredevil is responsible.  She also has a flirtatious relationship with Matt Murdock going on.  When she confronts Daredevil, she realizes that he is Matt Murdock and that he could not have killed her father.  Elektra in this movie is not exactly the same character she is in the comics, but at least they pulled her characterization from somewhere in the comics, not just out of thin air.  The biggest casting problem I had before is Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin.  Kingpin is my favorite Marvel villain, and second favorite comic book villain of all time.  He is a lot more suave in the comics, and he is a lot more in control.  This characterization of Kingpin is okay, though.  It is a new take on the Kingpin, while he still has certain elements of the comic book character.  His two best scenes were cut out of the theatrical version.  In his introduction scene, he sees in the paper that someone has been selling information about him to the papers.  So he kills both of the nearby bodyguards.  Most of his fight with Daredevil was cut out.  In that scene, Daredevil punches him in the face seven or eight times, and he isn't even staggered.  Probably the best casting are that of Foggy and Bullseye.  Colin Farrell was the one thing I liked about the theatrical cut, probably because none of his scenes were cut.  Jon Favreau, current director of the Iron Man movies, is a perfect pick to play Foggy.    There were some re-shoots for thetheatrical cut, namely the confessional scene and the love scene with Elektra.  The latter scene is probably the worst thing about the theatrical cut.  In that cut, he hears someone getting beat up and wants to go help them, but opts to instead stay and have sex with Elektra.  In the Director's cut, he leaves her on the roof and goes to help the guy getting beat, showing that his role as Daredevil is more important to him than anything else.  When he talks to Foggy the next day, it finally makes sense why he is does not want to pursue a relationship with her.    I love this movie.  If you are a fan of the character, or just the superhero genre, check this out.  Sadly it was not released to theaters because of a pretty crappy producer who felt the movie needed to be cut down, and did not need a comprehensive story.
0440539811|5.0|Illuminatus is one of the best works of fiction I have ever read, ever. I know this because this book was so absorbing that in the wake following its completion I almost didnt know what to do with myself. Ever feel like that before? Where you spend hours to days to weeks to months on end reading a series, building up a relationship with the books and all the characters inside it, only to have the series end and feel like you've been broken up with? This is one of those books. I can pretty much tell that im going to be reading this thing more then once. I have the feeling that because it is so rich in potential meanings and sub plots that every reading would be different then the last one.
B0025KVLTM|3.0|I have been a fan of The Beatles for many years and enjoy Sgt. Pepper to a certain degree.  I enjoy other Beatle albums more.  My enjoyment of Pepper is tempered slightly by the gap between the legend of the alleged months it took to record, the layers and layers of multi-tracking musical \\"innovations\\" that are proclaimed to have been achieved on Pepper and what I actually hear on this release. I find pre-Pepper Beatle albums superior partially because they did not have half a year to work on them.  They contain more immediacy and zip to them because they were working on stricter deadlines.      There are some nice songs on the album.  The title track, With a Little Help, Lucy in the Sky, A Day in the Life and When I'm Sixty-Four are good ones in my opinion.  All the songs for the most part are the same tempo, though, which makes the album drag. Many of the songs seem phoned in, and in most cases simply competent rather than outstanding.  I find the album flows well until running into the syrupy track She's Leaving Home which I rate as a misfire attempt at another Yesterday and Eleanor Rigby, in that it is a strings-only socially conscious ditty that to my ears simply doesn't work and disrupts the flow of the album.  Within You and Without You is interesting, and on some occasions I find it enjoyable and other times find it tedious and want it to be over with.  My non-Beatle fan friends loath it.  Getting Better, Fixing a Hole, Being for the Benefit, Lovely Rita and Good Morning Good Morning are simply pedestrian filler songs that offer, to my ears, nothing musically or lyrically interesting.     As many have pointed out, this album is often rated highly because of the impact it had at the time of release.  And others have pointed out the album has not aged well.  I agree with both of these points of view.  So the question is, should someone who does not posses this album but is thinking about getting it, do so?    Beatle fans of any age should acquire this album atsome point.      If you are under thirty and not a Beatle fan, I would not recommend it.  As time goes by, and musical styles and means of expression evolve, I would think may young people of today would find this album mundane and uninteresting.  I find it slightly mundane and uninteresting.  I would liken the idea of Pepper to young people today to my thoughts on listening to Glenn Miller or Frank Sinatra when I was fifteen. (I'm in my mid-forties.) That was \\"old people\\" music with cobwebs and dust on them.  Though this album has significance to a large percentage of perhaps the 40 + demographic, young people, particularly those of perhaps 25 and younger think of this album and The Beatles for that matter, as positively pre-historic.  I would qualify this, however, because of the release of The Beatles Rock Band game.  It is possible that presenting The Beatles music in the context of a video game could generate interest in the 25 and under crowd.      If you are over thirty, and not a Beatle fan but want something safe and non-threatening to listen to, you should give Pepper a shot.  It's pleasant enough and does have it's historical significance.      As for the quality of the remastered Pepper I find, with a side-by-side comparison with the earlier generation Pepper CD little to no difference.  I am no audiophile so I am basing this simply on what I am hearing.  It is perhaps a little louder.  I don't here any more pop in the drums or a significant improvement in the quality of the bass as many have reported.  If you already have Pepper as part of a comprehensive CD collection but are not a Beatle fan(atic) I would advise you to save your money.  If you are a Beatle fan you will probably end up purchasing the remastered Pepper and most if not all the remasters anyway.

B00260HH3K|4.0|I'd have to agree with one reviewer out there in cyberland that people just love to complain about live-action adaptations of their beloved series. Determined that Hollywood will never get what made those series so great in the first place in the movies.  Dragonball: Evolution is certainly no exception. I was one of those few that remained optimistic about the movie. I'll admit, fans have a right to be upset that the people who made this movie took liberties in making the movie, not adhering to the original DBZ series storyline and whatnot. They also have the right to be unhappy that the production values were pretty low-budget. I, too, was expecting something pretty spectacular in that department as the anime is pretty wild.<br /><br />Yet, even so--on its' own merits, I still thought the movie was entertaining. Personally, I enjoyed it. My thoughts on things are that, if they made this movie exactly like the anime series, it would be pretty pointless. Why would fans even bother to go see it at all. Honestly, I've been a fan of the series since it first aired years ago and I wouldn't see it if it were exactly the same. Second, maybe they didn't have enough money to make the production values any better. I hear tell that a sequel is already in the works. If so, maybe they'll get things right this time all the way around. That way, casual fans and hardcore fans alike will feel the same way about the movie.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I've got the mono box. Listening over speakers (not headphones), it's truly great! Clean, wholesome, rich sound -  -  like never before. I'd say \\"Yesterday\\" for me is the standout, but all of them are great in mono. Ringo's \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" speeded up is the only slip up. Just play it on the speakers...     But listening to the stereo versions is also good (even on headphones), and it's a fun and learning experience comparing the two. So to me it's obvious - - get the Mono box and add your personal favorites of the individual stereo versions (I don't recommend getting the stereo box). At least get the stereo Abbey Road and Let it Be to complete your collection (I did).
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Someone else commented that this movie was horrible and full of sexual innuendo.  I really think he had to have had it confused with part two, Ice Age: The Meltdown.  Part three, Dawn of the Dinosaurs was way better.  Part 2 definitely had some trashy stuff in it.  Our son watched it once in the theater when he was 4, didn't understand the bad stuff, and we've never let him watch it again since.  We almost walked out of the theater except that grandma and grandpa took us and it was their treat.      But this one is SO SO SO SO SO much better!  It's very funny.  Scrat meets a girl and, according to my son who is now 6, they kiss in the sunset and that marries them, so when they're moving in together later on it's ok because they're married.  If that explanation works for your kids, great!  But I think that's really about the only thing.      We laughed so hard.  We actually went back to the theater 4 days later to watch it again.  We love parts 1 and 3.  Skip 2 altogether.  Just explain to your kids that Manny meets another mammoth and gets married and they have some new friends join them.  That's all you've missed.      Highly recommend this movie!
B000EBEHR2|5.0|I have been a Placebo fan since a teenager, I hope that doesn't give away my age, but the band has really grown since the 90's. I love \\"Meds\\" because I feel we have all taken that part in life where we downfall and just want to get back up but can not do it on our own.     Infa-Red is another great track I wish they had in my earlier years to break up with my past lovers. You can feel the passion the band plays as a whole.     But I would have to admit the best two songs in the whole album have to be Broken Promises & Running Up That Hill. There is just something that moves a person to tears when there is this soft signing and breaks into hard heart pounding beat. I must admit I love the whole album. I hope you get to enjoy the experience of Placebo.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Wasn't excited about some of the music choices on this album but she has an excellent voice and I was not disappointed.  Hope we see more from her
B000002GVO|4.0|That line (from the album's title track, of course) pretty much sums it up.  You can try to put this music down but the fact remains, this music is essential for any classic rock / Eagles collection.  It has stood the test of time, the songwriting and musicianship are brilliant, and the music itself just plain kicks!    The title track kicks off the album, and boy what a kick!  Next to \\"Take it Easy,\\" it is the single best song (in my opinion) that the Eagles ever recorded.  Then we get \\"The New Kid in Town,\\" which is a fun song, followed by the hard rocking \\"Life in the Fast Lane.\\"  Those are my three favorite songs from the album.  The final track, \\"The Last Resort,\\" is a great way to end the album -- it eases us off into a sweet finish.    This is highly recommended.  Enjoy!

Mr. Vanyerchuk, if I send you my copy of the book, will you give me a full refund?
6304711891|5.0|A bit too much, \\"Oh my gosh, how could they do that\\"?, but then we can't forget the overactive minds in Hollywood and their need to fill so many minutes with good or stupid scenes and as usual, they pick the stupid.  The movie is about 90% good and 10% stupid.
B002R5V7MG|4.0|I don't mean to sound a cautionary note here, but Esa-Pekka Salonen wasn't exactly chopped liver either. Like Dudamel, he excels at music that is highly rhythmic and colorful. He also recorded a very fine Mahler 3rd symphony for Sony Classical, and that was without the benefit of either Royce Hall (UCLA) or Disney Hall. Instead, it was recorded in the rather dry acoustics of Dorothy Chandler. His other two Mahler recordings - Mahler 4 and \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\" - weren't quite up to that same level, but they were decent enough. He's also one heck of a good composer. In fact, I must say that I enjoy Salonen's own orchestral works more than the newly commissioned work that opens this concert: John Adam's \\"City Noir\\".     \\"City Noir\\" is a decent enough work - one that plays up to the strengths of the L.A. Phil. (who are nearly unrivaled in the execution of modern works). But it easily could have been chopped down to just its best movement, which was the third and final one. Like so many contemporary composers, Adams is a marvelous orchestrator, but truly lacks any kind of melodic profile. It's easy for tedium to set in, simply because there are so few reference points along the way (or musical buoy markers). It's for that reason that I recommend just doing the third movement in future performances (it would make a great, short opener before doing other works that are highly rhythmic, and also use tons of percussion).     The Mahler 1st is a solid enough performance too, but I really prefer another DVD of it: the one on Euroarts, with Fabio Luisi leading the wonderful Staatskapelle Dresden. To me, it sounds as though Dudamel has lived with the Mahler a bit too long, and loves this piece perhaps just a bit too much for its own good. I would like to have heard a bit more \\"freshness\\", and more willingness to the let the music speak for itself.    For example, I can't say that Dudamel's lumbering tempo for the first movement's main melody - borrowed from Mahler's own \\"Gingheute morgen ubers feld\\" (the first of the \\"Songs Of A Wayfahrer\\") - is somehow an improvement over what we normally hear. It forces him to make a massive speed-up at the end of each of those two sections (assuming that one is doing the exposition repeat). Thus, it sounds a tad contrived. The same holds true for the start of the scherzo.    I appreciate that Mr. Dudamel is willing to take the scherzo at a heavier, more lumbering gait. But do we really need him to start ultra-slow, then speed up, each and every time the scherzo starts over? Making that effect just the very first time, would have gotten his point across perfectly fine. Also, it's here in the scherzo that Dudamel's biggest interpretive \\"tick\\" comes to the surface: his constant slashing at every accent and big downbeat that rolls his way. It sounds over done. In that sense, he reminds me a bit of Solti and Bernstein, which may to be some people's liking (and I do like those two conductors, but for numerous other reasons).     Fortunately, things go more smoothly - less interpretive distractions, shall we say - in the final two movements. That stated, the final chords of the symphony certainly could have used more from the ongoing bass drum roll supporting everything from underneath. Where was it?    Still, this is an auspicious start to a new partnership that's dangerously bordering on being over-hyped by the media, and everyone else. Let's give the Dudamel/L.A. \\"thang\\" a bit more time to season. Meanwhile, let's not forget the solid contributions that Salonen made to this great institution, not least of which was the \\"pushing\\" for Disney Hall itself. If you're in this for the Mahler, I'd say stick to other tried-and-true, classic renditions. On DVD, I really like the Luisi/Dresden one (Euroarts, I think). Luisi displays more willingness to let Mahler's music speak for itself, combined with a more \\"rustic\\" sound quality from the Dresden orchestra.

B002RSDW80|4.0|JULIE AND JULIA is a film chronicling the lives of Julia Child (the famous author of [[ASIN:0307593525 Mastering the Art of French Cooking]] and Julie Powell, the New York-based author of a blog who challenges herself to cook her way through Julia's book (524 recipes) in one year (365 days). If you're a gourmet, a gourmand or just a mere trencherman you will appreciate this film.<br /><br />Amy Adams is delightful as Julie, a young newlywed who is searching for a \\"project\\" to brighten her days (she works for a redeveloper at Ground Zero and deals with traumatized survivor families every day). She's warm and appealing and the kind of girl we all wish we had waiting at home. Adams' competent acting though, is as nothing to Meryl Streep who catches the essence of Julia Child---wife, would-be mother, and chef extraordinaire. Streep is well-matched with Stanley Tucci (as Paul Child, former OSS agent and career diplomat whose FDR Liberalism falls prey to McCarthyite paranoia). There's real affection between the Childs; Paul is dedicated to Julia and her burgeoning career as a professional chef/instructor/author.<br /><br />Julia's happy home is is reflected in Julie's. Julie's husband Eric is about as loving as anybody can be in in the midst of what has become a near-obsession. He helps her boil lobsters (to the Talking Heads' accompaniment of \\"Psycho Killer). Not that they don't fight, but even their 24 hour separation has no impact on how endearing the characters are. Likewise, Julia and Paul Child are simply embraceable (even though neither of them can approach the Julie/Eric cutesy factor). So much is in the casting.<br /><br />Director/producer/screenwriter Nora Ephron has created a warm-hearted and amusing chick flick with surprising staying power.

0316113506|5.0|As an avid exerciser and elementary teacher, this book offered a lot of good insights, both for me personally and professionally. Basically, to sum up the book- exericse is essential for a healthy body and mind. On a physiological level it strengthens and increases dendrites (brain cells), increases certain \\"feel-good\\" chemicals, and improves cardiovascular components. This leads to a happy, healthier lifestyle.<br /><br />Ratey breaks the text down into several sections, discussing how exercise can positively influence each. Sections include depression, anxiety, stress, attention disorders, addiction, and hormonal issues. The text also talks about how exercise can improve learning and stall the aging process. Teachers and parents will want to pay close attention the learning and attention disorders sections.<br /><br />Ratey concludes the text with a section called \\"regimen,\\" in which he helps readers get a better perspective about what types of exercise they should be doing, and how often.<br /><br />This book is great for everyone, since everyone should exercise.

1401923119|4.0|Starting from the operation of the cell, Lipton builds a case for the idea that it is not our hard wiring that determines our destiny and the person we become, as much as the interaction of the environment with our genes through the epigenome.<br /><br />Lipton speaks (I listened to the audiobook) rapidly and his voice and style take a bit of getting used to, but the enthusiasm he has for the material he is discussing carry you through the more technical or scientific language. This is a well edited, well organized argument, that moves along nicely and answers objections as they arise.<br /><br />Some interesting \\"aha\\" moments for me were the self-organizing nature of the chemicals that make up membranes, as well as the action of stress hormones on babies in the womb.<br /><br />He ends off by explaining how the subconscious functions of the brain are very efficient, but also difficult to change in adulthood. His suggestions, only touched upon, for making changes to that system could fill another book, I'm sure.<br /><br />I also liked the clarity of his explanation of the role of modeling on infants, as well as the various states of awareness and how they relate to learning and embedding routines in the subconscious.<br /><br />I will be listening to the last two cds again.Lots of gems in there.
B001ECDVKE|4.0|i just watched my regular dvd on a blu ray system.  it is much better that way.  there are a few movies that excel on a blu ray system.   and these movies should be released on blu ray.  i'm sure jurasic park, and spawn will be great on blu ray and constantine is better on blu ray.  [i'm, also, hoping to see: LOTR- extended, eight legged freaks, evolution, and killer klowns from outer space on blu ray]    this is a comedy which is made to parody fifties sci-fi movies.  there are many big named movie people in this film; but i think it would have been as good with no name actors.  great amounts of action and special effects have been added.      'an unsuspecting world has just realized that many space ships have just arrived from mars.  the real brainy people (specifically: pierce brosnan ) say: \\"oh, they're intellectually advanced so they must be peaceful and highly enlightened.\\"  which strokes our ego because we [ that is: regular people] know that exploration is not for altruistic reasons but for some kind of personal gain.  and this is extremely  exacerbated by our understanding that the brainy people continue to blunder rather than admit they were wrong.  the brainy people find an excuse to blame us [we the regular 'stupid' humans] as the fault for an extremely violent action staged by the martians.      these nasty little Martians also enjoy torturing and devising elaborate plans to destroy creatures which live on earth.  when it appears that there will be no stopping them a ridiculously wild martian eradicating process is discovered.       this is a rather wild comedy which seems to have been inspired by sci-fi gum cards and the movies: 'independence day' and 'war of the worlds'.    *** the important thing to remember is that it's intended to be a wild comedy [ a little less then 'airplane' and 'ace ventura'.   maybe on the level of 'rat race']  the special effects and animation [not cartoon animation] are very good. ***

B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|Personally I don't get 300, but then again I'm not a gay man, but if you're reading this, chances are good you are!<br /><br />300 is a movie that works much like the old He-Man cartoon used to, appealing to the same demographic and that demographic's secret desire to watch well-developed men wrestle, run, fight and be oh-so mean to one another. I know when I was little in the 80's it seemed like all the boys in the neighborhood would exercise their inner gayness by rushing inside to watch He-Man with its now obvious homo-erotic undertones, but He-Man at his raunchiest was never anything like 300!<br /><br />Man, it must've taken total courage to make an erotic gay film like this in Hollywood of the Bush era. Shirtless men with oiled bodies running around half-naked, sweating, grunting, holding all manner of phallic-symbol swords, knives, spears, and with great facial hair, too!? I know all my gay male friends are in love with this comic book fantasy and LOVE getting it as a gift for their birthdays. I can just imagine all those \\"completely straight\\" husbands in suburbia sitting alone in their media rooms at night after the wifey and kids are tucked in, watching 300 and thinking and thinking and thinking...<br /><br />So if you're a gay man or think you might be, see this sweaty little flick with that someone special...and have a long smoke afterward!

B0026OE2O8|1.0|Oddly enough I share most of the messages the movie attempts to deliver. The photography is excellent and the art craftsmanship is superb. That said, the emotional propaganda is not the righteous and proper way to make the world better. The movie is not a balanced documentary. It leaves an after-taste of bad journalism.<br /><br />I appreciate being lectured. Yet I choose and value lecturers which operate with verifiable facts and earn respect for the substance of their delivery more than for the beautiful packaging they put around. I do not see this is being the case with the movie.<br /><br />As one of the commenters wrote, emotional stirring may have it's value. A professional artist with strong ethic is capable of getting a calculated response in an educated population, among others. A calculated emotional message which resonates without knowledge foundation is an emotional manipulation. In my assessment \\"Home\\" is a very professional yet very manipulative work. For each individual image or sequence in the movie without the commentary I would give 5 starts. Yet, when combined, it creates a new work of art of a damaging quality for the cause as far as I am concerned. The reason is that it is based on a very pervasive visual material, yet uses very low standards for information used to form a public opinion.<br /><br />Overall, without going into further details, the message delivery in the movie fits precisely the Propaganda descriptions in Wikipedia.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is one of those rare directors who can take the magic of nature and childhood, then somehow capture it for the screen.<br /><br />And his tenth Ghibli movie \\"Ponyo\\" is no exception -- it's a reimagined tale of a \\"little mermaid\\" who wants to become human so she can be with a little human boy she loves. It's a simple story told in a simple manner (occasionally TOO simple), but it has a lush oceanic beauty and an innocent sweetness that really capture your heart and imagination.<br /><br />A little boy named Sosuke finds a tiny \\"goldfish\\" with a human face on a beach, trapped in a bottle. He names her Ponyo, and goes to great lengths to care for his little fishy friend. But then the sea wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's overprotective dad, appears and snatches Ponyo back into the sea -- and she decides that she wants to become human so she can be with Sosuke. Having tasted a bit of Sosuke's blood, she sprouts chickenleggy limbs and starts to change, but inadvertently disrupts a magical well that causes the moon to drop, the seas to rise over the land, and prehistoric magic to rise once more.<br /><br />Sosuke and Ponyo are delighted to be reunited, despite the raging storm that is engulfing the city and causing ships to go missing. While the children go searching for Sosuke's missing mother, Fujimoto struggles to fix the balance of nature before the entire world is destroyed, with the help of Ponyo's sea goddess mother. The only hope of restoring balance lies in Ponyo and Sosuke -- and if Sosuke's love is not true, then Ponyo will be reduced to sea foam.<br /><br />Compared to Miyazaki's other movies, \\"Ponyo\\" is a very simple story -- it's basically a boy-meets-fishgirl story, with lots of children running around being adorable and exquisite looks at the sea. Even its theme is simple -- the story is dependent on on true selfless love and how it knows no boundaries of age, experience or even species. Not to mention parents letting go of their children.<br /><br />If there's a downside to the story, it's the lack of internal conflict. Example: the \\"test\\" that Fujimoto and the sea goddess use for Sosuke... well, it's far less impressive than it seems.<br /><br />And Miyazaki does not disappoint animationwise -- he conjures a waterworld of luminous sea life, sparkling ships, prehistoric creatures, finned submarines and a town that has been swallowed by the sea (complete with boats floating over the rooftops). It's an exquisite piece of work that turns the ocean into a magical, otherworldly realm where wizards work in coral-encrusted towers and shimmering jellyfish take little mermaids to the surface.<br /><br />Ponyo herself provides a lot of the movie's charm -- she's effusive, hyperactive, has a babylike fascination with the human world (\\"HAM!\\"), and an array of handy magical powers. Sosuke is a likable lad who is fascinated by Ponyo and her world, and Fujimoto makes a enjoyable anti-hero -- spindly, gaunt and with a mane of messy red hair, he's like a rock'n'roll embodiment of parental stress.<br /><br />The extras are pretty promising on this blu-ray, and they seem to be the same as the regular DVD edition's extras (rather than stiffing or one or the other group of buyers) -- a slew of documentaries and interviews (including with Miyazaki himself), storyboards, explorations of the story's background, et cetera.

0375757422|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

This is my first exposure to Taylor, and she has a great voice and a stunning delivery. One thing that really strikes me on this CD is how well the songs are laid out. Each song follows the previous one in a perfect, seamless manner. I am now going to look for other CDS of Taylor's to buy for my daughter, and see if they somehow end up in my car for my daily commute.
0316044938|4.0|I've been told to read this book for years already, when I finally took the plunge after seeing it on sale.<br /><br />The basic premise of the story is about a girl named Susie Salmon who was raped and murdered by a neighbor. Reviews would lead you to believe that the story begins once she's in heaven watching her family as they move on without her.<br /><br />However, let me warn you that Sebold is not discreet when writing Susie's last minutes on earth. The details were so graphic and vivid I had to put it down. I can understand from a writer's perspective that Sebold wanted to be authentic when writing about such an experience, but to those of us who get squeamish you may never want to finish the book. (I have a coworker who has confessed that she's never been able to get past the part of Susie's murder.)<br /><br />However, once the initial killing of Susie is completed you finally get to see what this book is about...a voyeuristic tale about the life of a family after a major tragedy. Perhaps this reviewed is marred by my perception, but I get the feeling that Sebold wanted to explore just how and why these families break apart instead of uniting when such terrible crimes are committed against them.<br /><br />There are certain family members that you begin to love and respect, while others as a reader and simply as a person you'll come to despise. Sebold makes it clear that the weight of Susie's murder either strengthens or destroys certain family members.<br /><br />Sebold's interpretation of Heaven is also fascinating. It's anything you want it to be and you can't be truly at peace until your family is at peace. Sebold also keeps the reader engaged by having Susie watch over the first boy she ever kissed and a young girl that could have been her friend had her life not tragically ended.<br /><br />Susie may be in heaven, but I found as a reader it was difficult to discern whether Susie was observing everything with the eyes of a young girl or a wise spirit. You'll notice in certain scenarios she's cool, distant, simply retelling the story while in other scenarios she longs to be part of the situation and her understanding of what is going on is based on the understanding of a 14 year old. For instance is Ruth truly seeing spirits or is she merely experiencing a psychotic episode? I loved how Sebold made me ponder that point until the very end, because Sebold would have it no other way. She wants you to question Susie's point of view and how it affects the events she's witnessing.<br /><br />The ending is fitting, complicated, and it leaves you with some questions concerning one character in particular. You finally learn what Susie's one desire in heaven was and how it was fulfilled. As her family finally comes to grips with her death, you realize there could have been no other logical conclusion.<br /><br />It's a wonderful story, but again, I must reiterate, be prepared for the beginning. Other than that potential drawback I think everyone would greatly enjoy this novel.You'll notice in certain scenarios she's cool, distant, simply retelling the story while in other scenarios she longs to be part of the situation and her understanding of what is going on is based on the understanding of a 14 year old.

B001EN71DG|5.0|The Trilogy is awesome, this is a great version because you can see the original movie and don't have to see all of Lucas' add ins, like the scene with the cartoon Jabba and Han does shoot first(he is a bad muther) like he is supposed to.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I only paid [...] at Sam's Club, and I am glad!     Bad:  Moves out of sync with music- why have the music, then?  Needs to work on her language:  \\"No Shame\\" is heard as \\"SHAME\\" by your brain.  There are many better ways to suggest modified moves.  Abrasive instructor, not in a tough, 'boot camp' way, but in a disgusted way.  Maybe she is better in person?  Boring.  Hard on the knees.  Warm-ups are uneven- she should do circular warm-ups in BOTH directions.  Strange facial expression and tone of voice.  Maybe she was bored, too?  Not even nice music to make it more interesting.    Good:    I did feel the workout, she did make us move. But I can do the same by riding a bicycle. Or running.  I do like the circuit idea.      After all the great reviews, maybe I was expecting too much.  I won't buy another of her videos again unless I can test it first. And what the heck is a 'biggest loser'?  that sounds terrible! I will probably do this a few times, because I am stubborn, but it wasn't fun.

B002T921DE|5.0|I saw GM at Earls Court in 2006 and Philadelphia in 2008. A fantastic show on both occasions. This Blu-ray is a faithful reproduction of the performance, from the moment the video screen splits revealing George to the sing-along encores. There's a reason his shows sell out and command high ticket prices -- the evidence is here.     Video and audio are perfect IMHO. A solid 2 hours of great entertainment.
0545123267|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and found myself very emotionally involved when reading it. I don't normally so that, so it surprised me to be feeling so sad, or so anxious while between the pages. I ripped thru the whole thing on a train ride and was surprised how moved I was by this very sweet, and often tragic love story.<br /><br />I found the temperature/seasonal aspects of the werewolves interesting. They were very much a dual natured creature, and there was such a magical feel to creatures who are one thing in the summer, and another in the winter. And I enjoyed the character of Grace, as a dreamy academic type. She, who cares for her parents, and friends but is never really seen at all. I liked Sam as the sensitive, cautious lead. And I found it refreshing how quickly they just seized the time they had with each other. So often stories like this have a weird no sex agenda, or a strange forbidden love thing. I loved that they wanted to be together, but external issues stood in the way. It was refreshing to see that all though Sam was a werewolf, only apects of that kept them apart.<br /><br />There were some major issues plotwise: The werewolves overall were really undeveloped, it confused me why we spent as much time with them as we did if it was going to go nowhere, the 'bad guys' were identified and then ignored, or  plotlines just vanished. I read the book thinking it would be a standalone and that made a lot of the added details just seem....strange. Or unresolved. Perhaps this book needed another 50 pages here and there to develop a more realized three act structure. But word on the street is a sequel is coming, so hopefully it will deal with those lose strands.<br /><br />SPOILER: The \\"cure\\" also seemed kind of lame to me. Meningitus? really? I can't imagine it would be that easy to get infected blood and just inject it into people all willy-nilly. The end just had a really slapped together feel, like it had been building up to end on a really sad note and the author could not bring herself to do it. Especially the \\"Jack is dead\\" line. I was glad Olivia opted out of the whole treatment thing, I totally would have.<br /><br />But all in all, a surreal and dreamy little story that had a very sweet love story underneath. It was beautifully written, and if this author can get a handle on refining the plot/character aspects I think she could really be something fantastic.<br /><br />And for all the twi-hards: Okay I get it, Twilight is popular, so any book which is a romancey teen-centric novel about a mousey girl and a mysterious dreamy non human boy will be compared to it. But that was not an original plot 20 years ago! Or longer really. It is a staple vampire,fairytale, Harlequin, paranormal romance thing so let's all take a deep breath realize Twilight is not the end all be all, and all books that come after it are not necessarily copying. This tells a different story, the characters are different, the motivations: different.t bring herself to do it. Especially the \\"Jack is dead\\" line.

B002VPE1AM|4.0|I'm a pretty big James Cameron fan, so it's nice to see him back on top in the Sci-Fi genre. Avatar didn't quite reach the brilliant levels of Aliens, The Terminator or Terminator 2: Judgement Day, but the visual beauty of the CGI here, especially in 3-D, is mind blowing. The story and some of the dialogue are the only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. It borrows heavily from films like Dances with Wolves, Aliens and about three or four more others, so the plot itself wasn't unique. Some of the dialogue is near George Lucas territory and reminded me of a few of those horrible lines from The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and yes, Titanic. Thankfully, most of it is pretty decent.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, Avatar is in my top three movies of the year. The feast for the eyes and the imagination behind it reminds us just how superb James Cameron can be. He has crafted something here that I actually felt a part of as I watched it. Seeing it in IMAX 3-D added huge amounts of depth and I can't imagine seeing it any other way. I felt all the performances were good, especially Sigourney \\"Ripley\\" Weaver and the main baddie, Stephen Lang. I also thought that Zoe Saldana delivered the most believable motion capture performance since Gollum first came along in 2002. James Horner's music seemed to borrow a little from Titanic at certain times, but I thought it captured the overall mood of Pandora and the ten foot tall blue creatures that inhabit it.<br /><br />Take my word for it, Avatar is a must see event movie if there ever was one. Everyone I heard as I left the theater had nothing but positive things to say. I think one guy best summed it up by saying \\"I feel like I just came out of a two and a half hour dream\\" and I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

B002TZS5GU|5.0|I was expecting a zombie movie.  But I like how the story went.  Made me think of how I would do things to survive.  One thing I did not care for was the racial statement.  Since it was kept in the movie, I wish they would have explained more.  I rented the movie, but now I will buy it and add it to my collection.

B0000542D2|5.0|Lets stop all thus rot about the film been cropped.     It was made to fit 1.66 to 1.85 for cinema release back in the 60's.       I worked on the Odeon Cinemas as a Projectionist and all the screens from 1954 on   were a variation of 1.85  and 1.66.Widescreen.    The film was Produced in the 60,s as a genuine Widescreen release.and ran on the Odeon Circuit to top business.     So the  DVD is in the correct ratio.      Top Quality transfer with great sound.   Highly Recommended.
B001B7CNXI|4.0|Enjoyed the flick overall, however the soundtrack was dissapointing to say the least.    If your expecting anything like the 80's Tv series forget it !  Still good entertainment however.    Also, can anyone tell me what the title of the instrumental song is that plays during the boat race along South Beach at the beginning of the flick ? its also featured after Patti Labelle's \\"One Of These Mornings\\"  during the end credits of the film.    Cheers  Pw
B0026P3G12|4.0|I enjoyed this product given it was Susan Boyle and I believe she is such an incredible talent.  However, I think after listening to the entire CD I came away wishing that the songs had been chosen differently, and perhaps a better production of the CD was in order to display just how magnificent she truly is.  I'm hoping for that next time around!

0330508121|3.0|\\"The Google Story\\" is a decent book if you are looking for a history of the historic company from an outside perspective. Many comments say that the author writes with a bit of favoritism, and I don't disagree one bit. However, the book does not intend to be anything else.<br /><br />The back cover proclaims \\"extraordinary access to Google\\", and it doesn't seem that way. The book offers a good history of the company and its challenges but does not go into much depth about any of them.  When they won back business in London, how exactly did they do it? It seems that the light criticism of Google is written from the company's perspective.<br /><br />With that said, if you wish to become aware of how Google obtained their success, it's a good and informative light read.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's voice is amazing. Her recently released CD includes an unusual grouping of musical types and emphasizes her inate ability to please audiences with a wide range of vocal renditions.  Bravo!!
6305508550|5.0|The cover of my \\"Office Space\\" DVD has \\"Work sucks\\" printed on the cover.  Well, this is a fact.  (If it didn't it would be surely be called something else.)  Reviewing this over 10 years since its initial release and having seen it around twenty times or so, it is still as funny as the first time I saw it.<br /><br />For me, working at a software company surely makes it hit right-at-home, but I'm sure it hits home for anyone who has worked in or out of an office. It's hard to work in an office about someone asking you if you have a \\"case of the Mondays,\\" \\"the O-face,\\" swearing at a printer or complaining about a stapler.  If I've spent a mundane week at the office, nothing is better than to kick back with this hilarious movie with a beer in hand.
B002JCSWUW|4.0|During his 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela regularly turned to a poem Called Invictus, and found profound inspiration.<br /><br />During his time as President he continued to turn to this poem, and knowing it by heart, wrote it out long hand, and to the Captain of the Sprinboks passed it, who found profound inspiration.<br /><br />During my life, I found profound inspiration in Nelson Mandela, and if a man can live in the unfair divided regime called apartheid, can spend so much time in prison, and emerge wise instead of rancorous, and can become president of a nation so divided, it raises the bar of human possibility, and inspires us to do better. If Mandela can solve the unsolvable problems of South Africa, if the Berlin Wall can fall, then cannot my own country's problem be solved, could there be peace in Nothern Ireland.  All of these things which once seemed impossible have come to pass.<br /><br />And Invictus the movie invites us to see Mandela in elegant action, uniting a divided nation, averting civil unrest and civil war, reviving the sport of apartheid (rugby), saving the Springboks from being disbanded, and playing a pivotal role in inspiring their triumphs.<br /><br />Clint and Morgan, between them have won numerous Academy Awards on their previous collaborations.  Morgan Freeman won best Supporting Actor for Million Dollar Baby playing Clint's sidekick, and played Clint's sidekick in [[ASIN:B000P0J0DI Unforgiven]].<br /><br />Morgan Freeman impresses as Mandela, who he knows personally, and does an outstanding job.  As much if not more is conveyed through a nod, a gesture and a facial expression than through words.  Matt Damon impresses as the Rugby Captain.  Having played rugby myself, he totally convinces in his body language and movement as a rugby player.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood does an impressive job outside his normal territory and familiar genre, making the rugby scenes very true to life.  Usually the cameras are off field, here they are up close and personal in the thick of the action.<br /><br />My one critique of the movie is that it lacks something Hollywood likes, namely the conflict, drama, and the hubris of the characters.<br /><br />In [[ASIN:B001NFNFNU Changeling]] for example, Christine Collins has to overcome great adversity, and transform from a mom mourning her missing child to an activist, even being committed to a psychiatric hospital because she disagreed with the police captain.<br /><br />In Invictus, the great Nelson Mandela adversity has already happened before the events of this movie happen, so the great dramas of his life remain unexplored, and the drama of his wife Winnie being charged with murder also remains unexplored.  A quality movie made about all that, would surely win many awards.<br /><br />Invictus remains a great movie, it's funny sometimes, it's gripping, it's inpiring, it's even exciting.  Although it's Morgan Freeman's movie, it's Eastwood's humor that's pervasive. It's a slice of Mandela, but not the whole cake. I fully expect Morgan Freeman will get nominated for this performance, and may even win.  I would not be surprised if Eastwood, overlooked last year for his masterpiece [[ASIN:B0020MKTOS Gran Torino (Full-Screen Edition)]], gets a nod this time as Best Director.<br /><br />Trivia. Watch out for the other Eastwoods, Kyle scores the music. Scott, scores the winning points, and plays No. 10 for the Springboks. Invictus means, unconquerable, invincible.  I hope this was helpful to you.My one critique of the movie is that it lacks something Hollywood likes, namely the conflict, drama, and the hubris of the characters.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|Last night I was among the sellout crowd for one of the two midnight openings at the local IMAX in San Francisco. The most anticipated movie event of the year, and it did not disappoint. IMAX, an exceptionally tall movie screen, with an exceptionally sophisticated 3D state of the art sound system.<br /><br />Donning my 3D glasses I wondered what to expect. Even though I arrived early, so did everyone else, so I recommend an early arrival, to get a good vantage point.<br /><br />Jake Sully, former marine, gets drafted in to replace his twin brother recently passed, on a very important mission to the Planet Pandora. At great expense his brother's DNA has been sampled, and combined with the local somewhat humanoid species, to create a hybrid which can be controlled remotely. In this guise, an avatar, an identity assumed in order to interact with the local species, and complete the mission.<br /><br />Jake enters the world as we do, knowing nothing about Pandora or the Na'vi people. As we observe with our 3D eyes, we experience the world as he experiences it, we come to know and love this world as he does, and we care about its people as he does. As Jake's virtual world becomes more compelling than his real world, he inevitably becomes torn between his mission, to attain the unobtainium, and his choice, save his legs, save the world.<br /><br />Avatar reportedly cost over $200 million to make, and the money is not invested in a name star, but to greater effect in stunning visuals, and groundbreaking technology.  Our 3D experience is not gimmicky like other movies, but rich and possessing both dimension and depth. Director Cameron goes all out to be totally original in this movie in every way, even in its 3D appearance, and in so doing ushers in a new era in moviemaking.<br /><br />Avatar as a movie has so many different levels spiritual, psychological, emotional, physical, ecological, a hero, and a heroine who shares her intuitive gifts, a vicarious adventure. Some of these are so subtle, because as the mind becomes occupied with the visual spectacle and the beauty of what you are watching, you many not even notice, that even though none of this movie is set on Planet Earth, your mind in searching for connection with what it already knows, goes to unusual places, almost like you have a double awareness, a hypnotic experience, a 3D way of looking, seeing both sides of the coin at the same time. It says a lot about our world, our history and our time, without saying anything.<br /><br />The greatest accomplishment of this movie seems to be, something that cannot be seen but can be realised. It's as if Cameron goes into our home which is more of a mansion than we imagined and opens all the windows, and opens the locked doors, and lets light in everywhere, and you think, I didn't realise my house was this big, and I haven't seen that before.<br /><br />I can hardly wait to see this movie...again. I'm hooked. Undoubtedly, Avatar will be huge. It deserves to be. A unique and new moviegoing experience.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Born to Run is a very real story that is not glossed or fluffed up for marketing.  Every runner who just loves to run will feel emotionally attached to the runners even if your ultrarun is 10 miles instead of 100.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I enjoyed listening to all my favorites, how sad to realize that we have lost such a talent!   I couldn't NOT purchase this last tribute and also enjoyed the pictures with the CD, nice release, highly recommend!
B002VECM6I|5.0|First, let me lay a couple of cards on the table.  I don't usually like Sandra Bullock.  Also, I don't like football, and therefore I don't like football movies (with the exception of KNUTE ROCKNE: ALL AMERICAN).  In fact, there are just a handful of sports movies that I do like.    But THE BLIND SIDE is not a sports movie.  (Or if it is, then it's the kind that's not really about sports.)  It's a movie about family.  And it boldly states that your family is not necessarily the people you're biologically related to or share the same skin color with.  Your family is the people you live with and cannot live without.    Michael Ohr is the quintessential - gigantic but timid and gentle - hero that everyone would love to have by their side.  And so is his adopted mother, Leigh Anne (portrayed by Sandra Bullock in what is easily her best performance).  One of the more important lessons Leigh Anne teaches Michael is to protect your family and loved ones both on and off the field.  When one of his former acquaintances speaks disparagingly of Leigh Anne and her daughter and then threatens him he....Actually, I don't quite remember what he did - it all happened so fast.  But one guy was slammed into a wall, and I think one was thrown against another.  And it seemed like he nearly caved in a stairwell.  It was so fast, it made Jason Bourne look like The Nutcracker.    One of the many things I love about THE BLIND SIDE is that the family is a family of faith.  Sean and Leigh Anne are Christian parents and extend Christ-like love to Michael.    I cannot conclude this review without stating my favorite line from the movie.  Leigh Anne has been threatened by an inner city thug who also plans to harm Michael.  She rips him a new one even in front of his hoodlum buddies and says, \\"I'm in a Bible study with the D.A., and I'm a card-carrying member of the NRA!\\"    While this movie is very much about family, it is definitely not a family movie.  It earns its PG-13 rating quite well.  It's not for the younger kids.  But it has a better message than probably any other film you're likely to find.
B002T9H2L0|2.0|I walked out of the theatre after about an hour of this film by Quentin Tarentino because after seeing such WWII films like \\"Defiance\\" and \\"Valkyrie\\", it lacked authencity.  It seems that Tarentino basically gathered every cliche that he has seen in much better films like \\"The Dirty Dozen\\", \\"Underground\\" (an obscure film with Cornel Wilde), etc.--and thrown in a blender and out comes this monstrosity.  I even gave the film a second try on Blu-ray and still despite the favorable reviews, changed my opinion of this film.  The film lacks suspense and Tarentino over does it in the dialogue department--allowing a scene to go on much longer than it needs to be. Christoph Waltz's performance as the evil Nazi is perhaps the only saving grace in this disappointing film.
B002VECMBI|4.0|Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) has found what he thinks is the perfect way of life. He is able to travel the country giving the bad news to people that have been \\"downsized\\" by their corporations. This way he can rack up the miles, stay at high end hotels and avoid any of those messy emotional attachments that tie other people down.    But he gets thrown for a loop when his own company decides to replaces travel with video conferencing. A new employee named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) is the one who came up with this cost cutting measure. Ryan is, of course, furious with her. But is still given the task of showing her the ropes while the new system is being tested. The \\"old dog vs bright young thing\\" dynamic is very much in place and creates some smart and funny moments.    But the movie kicks into high gear after Ryan begins developing feelings for a fellow frequent flier named Alex (Vera Farmiga). These two have real chemistry and Ryan is forced to question if his free and easy lifestyle is really what he wants.    Clooney is silky smooth as the travelling businessman who thinks he has it made. It's almost a given he will receive an Oscar nomination for this role and, if so, it will be well deserved. Vera Farmiga is also excellent as a woman looking for a little committment free fun herself.     But what I liked most about this movie is it's \\"old school\\" charm that relies on character development and well written dialogue rather than crude jokes or flashy special effects. There are a few scenes that didn't work for me. But still it's nice to enjoy a movie written for mature adults rather than hormone crazed teens, there are still a few of us grown up types that go to the cinema after all.    It's not my favorite film of the year. But it is still pretty darn good. Look for this one to rack up the awards on Oscar night.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|Just when you think that the romantic comedy has been exhausted comes this totally original \\"dramedy\\" that shows us the joy and the pain of unrequited love.  Joseph Gordon Leavitt has perhaps his best role since \\"The Hangout\\" & \\"Mysterious Skin\\" as the lovelorn pursuer of Zooey Deschanel who remains a mystery to him when she does not totally commit to their relationship.  How many times has a male heard the expression, \\"Let's be friends (not lovers)\\".  In a way, this film is in the tradition of Woody Allen's classic, \\"Annie Hall\\", something he is probably incapable of creating nowadays.  If you've ever been in the throes of an up and down relationship--then do see it!!  I can't wait for the Blu-ray edition to come out and revisit this wonderful film--perhaps one of the best comedies of 2009 along with \\"The Hangover\\", which is basically a farce.
B0029O08WA|5.0|As a lot of the songs on this CD have made their way onto the radio, I should point out that the best ones have not. OK Go's song \\"Shooting the Moon\\" is my favorite, but \\"Monsters,\\" \\"Friends\\"-- they're all great! Absolutely worth your time, especially if you liked any of the songs from Twilight.<br /><br />Since you've probably read the book, too, you should look at the shout-outs Stephanie Meyer does to her new favorite bands. Muse, naturally, but she's big fan of Jack's Mannequin, Death Cab for Cutie, and Gomez. Definitely bands to look up, and some are even on the album.<br /><br />If you're new to Alternative music, this is absolutely a must. You won't be disappointed!
0767903862|4.0|Mr Bryson has the unique ability to leave the reader with a desire to experience those places he has been to. His often humorous observations  make for an entertaining read. Sprinkled with history and some of the personalities that make up that history, he covers an amazing amount of  geography on this wonderful and somewhat remote continent. I don't believe anyone would be disappointed with this book and I feel that it is  among those that should be read before a trip to Oz.
B000000W5B|5.0|I like to keep my reviews short and to the point but I've always felt Goats Head Soup has been grossly disrespected over the years.  If anything, it suffers from [[ASIN:B000000W5L Exile on Main St.]]withdrawal. G.H.S. is arguably the end of the Stones incredible string of creativity.  Either way, it ranks in my top 5 of Rolling Stones albums.  Believe it or not, I think the weird title caused some people to write it off as a failure.  Don't let the negative reviews fool you, this record won't disappoint.
B00005JKNF|5.0|If one has a choice and is able to play NTSC format, the 2002 Collector's Edition of \\"Gosford Park\\" is the one to buy. First, it has subtitles, so one misses not a word of Julian Fellowes' champagne-sparkling dialogue as the actors move in and out of earshot at this Agatha Christie-like weekend house party gone awry. The DVD is also in letterbox format and the transfer is sharp and colourful, so that one can appreciate the luscious costumes, the sumptuous settings, and every detail down to the proper silver fish-fork. Thanks to Robert Altman's subtle direction, the viewer is given the impression that he is a participant, or at least, an eavesdropper, along with the servants, who, like silent characters in a Greek tragedy, are so taken for granted that they might as well be invisible--at least when they are upstairs. It is not until they are downstairs, or up in their cramped sleeping quarters, that they assume their human personae, and we discover that they have as many secrets (and are as rigid in their social conventions) as their \\"betters\\" upstairs.<br /><br />The characters in the film are well-developed, from the wealthy lord of the manor down to the lowly tweeny. With its \\"A-list\\" ensemble cast, \\"Gosford Park\\" also treats us to the best of British acting (actually, the best anywhere!): where else can we find, in one movie, the likes of Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren (in what is, surely, one of her most moving performances), Emily Watson, Eileen Atkins, Tom Hollander, Charles Dance, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Northam, Kelley MacDonald, Alan Bates, etc., etc.? Laurence Fox even has a small part. And Stephen Fry milks his \\"Inspector Plod\\" role for every ounce of humor.<br /><br />The performance of Claudie Blakley deserves especial notice. In \\"Gosford Park\\" she plays the gauche outsider who has infused money into her marriage and is consequently dispised by her well-born but empty-pocketed husband. She is the only one of the \\"upstairs\\" guests who emerges as possessing genuine feelings that are not constricted by the \\"rules\\" of society.  Like a chameleon, Ms. Blakley inhabits her roles so thoroughly and with such sensitivity that she blends into the background of whatever film in which she appears (whether playing a flighty starlet in \\"Cat's Meow\\" or a housemaid Martha in \\"Cranford\\"). Even though her name might not be on the tips of our tongues (as Mirren's is), Claudie Blakley's portrayals contribute the excellence that we have come to expect from British drama.<br /><br />Not to be missed is Julian Fellowes' commentary, which surpasses the usual \\"making of\\" commentary and could well be utilised in a university course on British social history. He not only comments on the film but he also elucidates the complex composition of the aristocratic household in Britain before World War II.<br /><br />And while I realise that this film might not be everybody's cup of tea--lovers of action flicks will hate it, the very complexity of the film makes it a delight to watch again and again.

B000000W5F|2.0|I like to keep my reviews short and to the point. Tattoo You isn't a bad album, but it ranks no where near their best. I hate to say it, but I find Tattoo You boring.

B002Q9VPFM|4.0|I was pretty excited for this movie to finally come out.  Not quite as excited as I was for The Dark Knight, but still.  I watched the movie at 10PM opening night, and it was a little hard to keep up the excitement for the next 3 hours.  Watching this version of the movie, the director's cut w/The Black Freighter cut into it, was at least an hour longer, but it was so much better.  I also knew that this version was coming out so I didn't buy any of the other separate releases.  Those were all to satiate WB's greed.  The one thing I don't understand is the motion comic.  If I own the original comic and I own the motion picture, then what the hell do I need with a motion comic?  Other than that I am very happy with this package.  If you haven't bought any of the other versions, this is obviously the version to get.  So get it.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|WOW! I just finished watching \\"Reds\\" for the first time since it was first run, and while I liked it much more than before, I'm glad I got it at my local library, & had a week to watch it....or I would have, if I hadn't found it so gripping that I watched it spread over about 10 hours.<br />I always really found the \\"talking heads\\" spots very interesting. These spots with people who knew Jack Reed, Louise Bryant, and Emma Goldman(or at least people who were around then) were very interesting, except for George Jessel...why him??<br />Brew some coffee, pop some corn, & settle in. \\"Reds\\" isn't for everyone, but it is an intelligent look at a time that almost no one is alive to tell us about.
0743289692|5.0|This book gave me a look at what life is like in this part of the World for women.     The heart of this book is the author's journey to finding her own voice. Once found, she demonstrates a high level of personal integrity and power. I found her story inspiring and mind changing.    After finishing the book, I watched her short film on YouTube. It is an artistic, confrontational, feminist, peice of art. I would love to hear an indepth interview with her.
B00018D44U|3.0|Compared to her first CD, it is obvious the producers and sound recording techs did a poor job.  You can hear the microphone stand vibrate in the last two tracks, and most tracks the microphone Norah uses distorts.  The post-mix production is average and doesn't make use of good stereo effects.  Again, I'm comparing back to back with her first album which is reference audiophile quality.    However, I do like the music and it will make a good casual CD to listen to.
0547260695|5.0|perfect addition for my own pop-up collection and even more fun to give to each of my adult children's families.  Nostalgia for those who have already read \\"the Little Prince\\" and magic for those who are new to the story.

What do they do years after the series has been canceled?<br /><br />And just what DOES happen to those radio signals of old Star Trek (and Gilligan) shows escaping the Earth, and traveling outwards at the speed of light?<br /><br />The Thermians discovered these \\"historical documents\\" (unfortunately for the Thermians, they had not invented fantasy, lying, or acting), and develop their society based on the principles of \\"Galaxy Quest\\" (a mock version of Star Trek) and its crew.  But another race is now fighting the Thermians, and winning.  The Thermians need the commander of the ship, the NSEA Protector.  They don't need the Protector, however, because, based on the historical documents, they built their own.<br /><br />Thus the adventures begin.<br /><br />The similarities to the original Star Trek series are interspersed throughout, and done well.  The bad dudes are very bad, and the Thermians are really just lovable.  No wonder they are losing!  But the key element of this movie is the transformation of the Protector's crew from actors to space-faring adventurers.  The vital connection they have with their groupies back on Earth is also well done.<br /><br />Great movie!  The extras include the deleted scenes, which you won't find on the earlier VHS editions.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Some family members insisted I buy this for laughs at Thanksgiving dinner. They found it entertaining in the same way that it is entertaining to hear Leonard Nimoy sing Proud Mary, but more so. To quote my teenage niece, \\"This is wrong on so many levels.\\"    Bob Dylan is an enormously talented man, I'm a big fan. I hope this album makes him money, because it sure isn't going to add anything good to his legacy as a musician. As for me, I'll stick with other albums and his terrific satellite radio program.

B00284BNKC|5.0|This is a great transfer to Blu-ray, despite the disc's discount price, and is likely the best this film will ever look.  It's a marked improvement over the DVD.    The picture is great.  The disc's bitrate averages around 35-36 Mbps.  The blacks and shadow detail are deep.  The color is accurate, bringing out the depressing greens of fluorescent lighting and blues of the night lighting, along with the warm natural outdoor shots of Coney Island.  Grain is very present but there is no visible digital noise reduction (DNR) applied.  There is maybe just a hint of edge-enhancement, but it's not offensive and not visible in normal scenes.  The film looks soft and hazy at times, but only due to the cinematographer's use of soft-focus filters.  When the image is meant to be crisp, it is.  You can see the detail in Jennifer Connelly's skin and Marlon Wayans' stubble.      The lossless audio is great in DTS-HD 7.1, really highlighting Clint Mansell's score and the sounds of the Kronos Quartet.  The hallucinations of Ellen Burstyn's character sound creepy and scary.    The extras are the same as on the DVD.  They include a commentary by the director, Darren Aronofsky, a very detailed commentary by the cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, deleted scenes, a making-of, an interview by Ellen Burstyn of the author of the original book, Hubert Selby Jr., and the usual trailers and TV spots, including the uncut TV infomercial that plays a large role in Ellen Burstyn's character's motivation.    A great presentation of this indie film!
B000K8MQ2M|5.0|I have loved this album since it came out many years ago.  The lyrics are well written and catchy.  They also give us some insight into what was going on in the the lives of the band members at that time.  Some songs are serious, some cynical, some just plain fun. A thoroughly enjoyable album.
B000005H7D|5.0|Out of John Coltrane's four most popular albums (the others being Giant Steps, My Favorite Things and A Love Supreme), Blue Train is easily the most straightforward and traditional.  Giant Steps pushes the language of bebop about as far as it can go, My Favorite Things lays down the foundation for Coltrane's modal explorations, and A Love Supreme is an early step into his final free jazz phase.  Blue Trane, on the other hand, is comfortably within the hard bop mainstream - and on the premiere hard bop label of the 1950s, Blue Note.    Blue Trane was recorded about 2 years after Trane caught his big break and joined Miles Davis's quintet.  A lot of those early 1955 and 1956 recordings show Coltrane struggling - whether with his substance abuse problems or with articulating his challenging ideas, I'm not sure.  But after kicking heroin in May of 1957, his playing and composition began to evolve by leaps and bounds.  He joined Thelonious Monk for a legendary gig at the Five Spot, and began recording a series of fine albums under his own name for the Prestige label.  (The first one, titled Coltrane, was recorded about 4 months before this one.)  His playing was growing so rapidly, and he was recording so frequently, that you can hear the change even across recordings just a few weeks apart.    Prestige and Blue Note had very different recording styles, and you can hear it here.  Prestige was about loose recording sessions with minimum preparation; Blue Note was about practice, rehearsal and creating a polished product.  While both approaches have their strengths, in this case Blue Train is well above its Prestige counterparts.  Not only does it perfectly showcase Coltrane's playing (both its power and its delicacy), but it's the first album to really focus on his compositional skills.  Aside from a beautiful ballad performance of \\"I'm Old Fashioned\\", all of the tunes are Coltrane originals.  The title track, a minor blues, might be the most striking, but they are all strong.    The sidemen play very well.  Lee Morgan was at an early peak here; while his playing doesn't have the depth it would acquire in the mid-to-late 60s, he plays with plenty of explosive fire here.  The rhythm duo of Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones show why they were in such high demand during this period.    I don't know whether this is the best Trane intro; as a fan of classic and progressive rock, the more exploratory A Love Supreme and Live at Birdland clicked instantly while Blue Train seemed somewhat ordinary at first.  But those whose tastes lean primarily toward mainstream 50s jazz like Kind of Blue, Getz/Gilberto and Time Out should probably start here.  Also, fans of this album should check out Sonny Clark's album Sonny's Crib which has a very similar lineup.
B0012Q732O|2.0|I love mind-expanding science fiction and fantasy.  So even though I read reviews that panned 10,000 BC, I thought there was still something there to enjoy.  After all, I'm even a fan of [[ASIN:B00003CXIV Battlefield Earth]] (and the book, which makes the movie even more entertaining).<br /><br />So, 10,000 BC.  Avoidable.  Forgettable.  Dispensable.<br /><br />I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to view it.  But the plot, which obviously parasitized plots and scenes from [[ASIN:B00003CXAT Jurassic Park]], [[ASIN:B0000844I8 Stargate]], [[ASIN:B00006ADD5 Lawrence of Arabia]], and who knows what else, was in trouble from the very beginning.<br /><br />There is a tribe/clan/society of people living at high elevation, who live on and for the mastodons that travel through periodically.  One day, a child with blue eyes is captured, and she is the basis for some strange prophecy.  Destruction of the village, but eventually she will be part of its new future, yada yada.  So she is taken by slave-raiders, and her \\"boyfriend\\" and a couple others go searching for her, meeting other tribes/clans/societies that team up to fight the slavers, the leader being, of course, a... 9 foot tall alien who is making a pyramid?  And don't get me started on the whole, ridiculous saber-tooth tiger scenes!<br /><br />The actions, accents, escapes, travels, victories, and rescues are just too, too, unbelievable... even for a fantasy movie!  So see this once if you are a fan of the genre, then put it out of your mind.<br /><br />This disc has both the widescreen and fullscreen versions included.

B000000W57|5.0|The sound of this (uncensored) edition of \\"Goats Head Soup\\" is much improved over the 1990 CD.  What makes it a collector's item is that it comes in a gatefold imitation of the LP sleeve, with a custom plastic case. The sound is probably identical to the standard 1994 release, so unless you want a mini-LP replica, I see no pressing reason to purchase this edition.<br /><br />Had the 2009 \\"Goats Head Soup\\" CD release been uncensored, the rush to find the 1994 CDs or the import CD would be unnecessary. One of the stranger actions by a major label, and as far as I know, not occasioned by any complaints.  It should be corrected with an amended edition.  Those purchasing a CD by a band like the Rolling Stones should be assured they're getting a faithful digital version of the original LP--or the changes should be noted on the packaging, so consumers can make an intelligent decision.
055380684X|3.0|Given what I do for a living (teach music), I have a vested interest in the reliability of this book.  Most of what Coyle suggests is not new.  There is such a thing as effective practice and ineffective practice.  It takes a long time to get really good at something.  Given time, good instruction and an iron will, a person can accomplish just about anything.    The issue of myelin (insulation around neurons which channels and focuses specific tasks, and which grows through deep practice) is new to me.  As he states, it is a pretty new field, and admittedly exciting in its potential.    The way he presents the case for myelin feels like an infomercial.  I have bought enough things off infomercials that I know when they arrive I can expect they are about 50% less impressive than they appear on TV.  The sweeping, general statements made about myelin really rubbed me the wrong way.  \\"We are Myelin beings\\".  His excitement and devotion to this new discovery is really not balanced, and as I've discovered in life - anytime someone seems utterly convinced they've discovered the holy grail of something, and appears incapable of questioning their own judgment - they are usually mistaken on some level.    For those who have seen Star Wars Episode 1: Phantom Menace.  Think of the moment when it was revealed that the mysterious powers of the force were nothing more than midichlorians - a quantifiable substance found in the blood.  I was bummed at this moment.  Standing before the universe in humility, and being willing to accept that giftedness is a real possibility is totally absent from this book.      Mozart was special beyond the number of insulated layers he had focusing his neurons.  I remain unconvinced by Coyle, but I did find inspiration in some of the non-scientific, and common sense wisdom therein.    I would recommend Malcolm Gladwell's book, \\"Outliers\\" over this one.  Better writing.  Similar subject material.  More balanced.  Feels less like your are being sold something.    David
B0000046X0|4.0|This, for my money, is the best of the fusion-oriented Return to Forever albums.  Return to Forever and Light as a Feather were, despite the electric piano and the Latin rhythms, still pretty close to what we'd consider straight-ahead jazz.  Hymn to the Seventh Galaxy and the next three albums are FUSION - electric music that borrowed pretty heavily from both rock and jazz while not really being either.    Over the progression of those four albums RtF would become slicker and more scripted, until they sounded like an instrumental prog rock band on Romantic Warrior.  This album is much more raw and punchy (no synthesizers), somewhat reminiscent of the Mahavishnu Orchestra's first few albums.  (Those expecting the edginess and fury of Mahavishnu might be disappointed, though.)  Though there is plenty of improvisation on this recording, there's a growing focus on intricate and complex ensemble passages rather than the wide-open freedom of Now He Sings Now He Sobs or Tones for Joan's Bones.  \\"Captain Senor Mouse\\" is one of my favorite Corea tunes.  In general, I prefer Bill Connors to the more flashy playing of Al DiMeola.    Overall, anybody with an open mind to guitar-oriented fusion will probably enjoy this album.  It's no Inner Mounting Flame or Bitches Brew, but offers plenty of enjoyment on its own merits.
B000784WMW|5.0|After wanting to see this 1983 BBC production for some time, I've finally gotten to see this at last. Having never actually read the book I wasn't sure what I would make of the production, which had been recommended to me because of me being a fan of Timothy Dalton, who plays the role of Mister Edward Rochester. What I got was a fine production to say the least. It has a fine cast, fine production values which help to tell this atmospheric romance/drama in a fine fashion.<br /><br />The cast is fantastic to say the very least. Both Sian Pattenden (as the child) and Zelah Clarke (as the grown-up) both give fine performances in the title role of Jane Eyre, both are believable in their roles and come across as strong willed but all too human characters, which is especially true of Clarke as her relationship with her employer Mr. Rochester grows throughout the story. Speaking of Mr. Rochester, there is an absolutely brilliant performance by Timothy Dalton in the role. Dalton shows a huge range of emotions in the part and he shares some fine chemistry with Clarke and they really work well as a couple. There's also a fine supporting cast as well including Jean Harvey as Rochester's housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax, Damien Thomas as Rochester's mysterious friend Richard Mason, Judy Cornwell as Jane's aunt Mrs. Reed, Mary Tamm as Rochester's love interest Blanche Ingram plus Elaine Donnelly, Morag Hood and Andrew Bicknell as the Rivers family amongst others. Also of mention is the performance of Joolia Cappleman as Bertha who, while not often seen, has a considerable influence over the story and lends it much of its atmosphere and mystery. Together they make for a fine cast of actors and actresses.<br /><br />There's also some fine production values as well. It was shot on both film (for exterior scenes) and videotape (for interiors) which some people have used against it as a way of calling this a cheap looking production. Nothing could be farther then the truth, which is that this was standard BBC policy at the time and virtually all of the programs made by the BBC (such as the original TV series of Doctor Who for one of many examples) were shot that way. Besides one shouldn't judge the production based on that, in my opinion anyway. Instead it should be judged based on the costumes and sets used. Both of those categories are successes as the BBC was more then capable on making fantastic period sets and costumes. Both the interiors and the exterior scenes are well shot and lit, which help to evoke both the moodiness of the story and the atmosphere of the period as well as seen in any of the scenes (interior or exterior) at Thornfield Hall for example. There's also some fine make-up work as well, especially in episode eleven which should be seen as not to spoil the story for anyone. There is also the music of composer Paul Reade who produced a fine piece of music for the titles sequences and the sporadic, but well made and used, pieces heard throughout the production as well. Once one looks past how the production was shot (which shouldn't really even be and issue), there are plenty of things in the costumes, set, make-up and music to admire about this production.<br /><br />Last, but not least, is the script which was written by Alexander Baron from the novel by Charlotte Brontë. Having never read the novel, I am unable to judge how faithful the script is to the original novel though, from what I've read from other reviews, the script adheres to the novel rather faithfully. Judging it then from the point of view of the writing alone it is a well constructed story which goes from Jane as a girl to her becoming the governess for Rochester's ward and beyond. There is a steady build-up of tension once Jane arrives as a mysterious laughter can be heard along with unexplained occurrences and Jane's growing feelings for Rochester.  Especially since it is told across eleven half-hour episodes which each ending, cliffhanger like, at a point that brings the viewer back to see what happens next (especially someone like me who hasn't read the novel). This may be down to the novel, I don't know,  but even if it is there is much credit to be given to  Baron for being able to bring it to this production.<br /><br />All in all this 1983 BBC production of Jane Eyre is a fine example of BBC costume drama. Meaning that has some really fine performances from its large cast (especially Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton), fine costumes and sets and a well written script. It is a moving human drama that is nonetheless atmospheric and tense. While I can not judge this production to the novel it is based on, I feel confident in saying that this is a fine drama that will prove enjoyable to those who have or haven't read the novel.see what happens next (especially someone like me who hasn't read the novel).

1440463336|3.0|I admit that this novel holds a special position in English literature and rightly so, but it was not as good as I had hoped. When the monster finally speaks in the story I swear his \\"voice\\" sounded just like his creator's. How could two characters from vastly different life circumstances sound indistinguishable? One was an adult born in to an educated well to do family and the other was recently and suddenly \\"awakened\\" to live in the woods as a hiddeous outcast. The monster taught himself to read Paradise Lost? Seriously? Actually that was the major flaw in the book. All the characters seemed to be interchangeable even though they should have totally different personalities.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't care for was the use of multiple narrators in the story. I know this was common practice in literature of the time, but not to this extent. The main narrator of the novel is telling a story to his sister about the story Frankenstein told him about his monster's story that he heard about the exploits of the family in the cottage. What is that like 5th person narration? I think this distances reader from what should be a very intense and personal story.<br /><br />I don't want to dismiss the contribution this has made to literature and popculture I just think that the story of how Mary Shelley wrote the story is much more interesting than the actual story Frankenstein.
B002T9H2LK|4.0|This review is for; [[ASIN:B002T9H2LK Inglourious Basterds (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />It seems every time we hear of an upcoming Quentin Tarantino movie we are expecting a  Kill Bill or Planet Terror type film filled with mindless violence and gruesome, grotesque scenes. It seems Inglouirus Basterds might follow suit after seeing the trailers, but somehow I felt pleasantly surprised after watching it and satisfied. Perhaps other viewers expecting much more action may hate it or get impatient with it. About half or more of the film is in French or German with English subtitles while the remaining parts are spoken with some English language.<br /><br />Set in fictionally France during the German Nazi occupation, a Jewish woman named Shosanna Drefus (Melanie Laurent) flees after her family is massacred by Nazis led by Colonel Landa who is a Nazi SS Officer nicknamed the \\"Jewish Hunter\\" (played brilliantly by actor Christopher Waltz). She would later come to ownership of a small theater under a different identity were she quietly befriends a German soldier named private Fredrick Zoller (Daneil Bruhl) who turns out to be a German hero because of his antics as a skilled sniper. A Nazi sniper who  single handedly fought off an Allied onslaught on his own. The German hero has a film made about him called \\"Nation's Pride\\" exploiting his heroics that will be privately viewed by some of the most high ranking Nazis including the Furer Adolf Hitler himself. The film will be shown at Shosanna's theater at the personal request of Private Zoller. Shosanna sees this as an opportunity to lock the building with everybody inside during the film viewing and kill them all as a great act of revenge for her slain family.<br /><br />At the same time we are introduced to Lieutenant Aldo (an offering of comic relief by Brad Pitt) who assembles a band of Jewish Americans soldiers bent out on wrecking havoc behind German lines killing Nazis disguised as civilians. His protocol, take no prisoners and collect 100 Nazi scalps (literally)! Eventually a double agent posing as a German actress meets up with Aldo's private commando basterds and learns of the Nazi gathering at the theater also. They plan to infiltrate and set off explosives at the theater unaware of Shoshanna's intent to burn the theater down.<br /><br />The title of the movie and the theatrical trailers I felt were very misleading because the commando Basterds were not really the main element of the movie which may turn out to disappoint a lot of people. Brad Pitt's character Lt. Aldo is not even the main character as I felt he was more of a third leading character behind the Jewish woman Shosanna & Colonel Landa. I have to admit, I laughed every time Brad Pitt spoke with his heavy, Tennesee Southern accent speaking lines like \\"We are in the Nazi killing business and cousin, business is booming!\\" Be prepared for a lot of dialogue which I felt was excessive at times like other reviewers have complained about given the almost 2.5 hour run time, but it all comes together in the end with a flourish. The fate of Adolf Hitler reminded me that this film was again fiction.

1601251831|5.0|This weighty tome serves as the new 'Monster Manual' for the Pathfinder Core Rules. This book is a work of art! I was very impressed with the quality of the graphics, cover art, etc.<br /><br />It also goes a great way towards detailing many of the classic monsters from D&D's past: orcs, goblins, dragons, demon-spawn, all get equal treatment here, with an average of one monster detailed per page. Sadly, some of the classic beasts of yore are no longer covered: for example beholders and mind flayers did not make the cut, likely due to copyright issues with Wizards of the Coast. Still, I cannot recommend it highly enough. Buy this now!
B002VPE1AM|3.0|\\"Avatar\\", directed and written by James Cameron<br /><br />In the distant future an extremely rare and valuable mineral has been discovered on a distant planet called Pandora. All that stands in the way of the human race mining this mineral is the local alien population known as the Na'vi whose main sanctuary is located on the largest deposit. The human race has developed a program which uses an Avatar or a Na'vi body grown by humans inhabited by a human's mind and controlled. The humans intend to work with the Na'vi in hopes of convincing them to move so the mineral can be mined but so far there has been no progress. Jake Sully, a former marine whose brother has had an Avatar grown for him steps in to operate the Avatar when his brother is murdered. Jake is given 3 months to work out a diplomatic solution with the Na'vi at which point Colonel Miles Quaritch intends to use superior military force to clear the area...<br /><br />Avatar is a visual and effects masterpiece, let there be no doubt about it. The story however could be described as anything but stellar and the on the nose politics present in the film posed a problem for me as well.<br /><br />The Good: Avatar is an absolutely beautiful film to view. The effects, the planet, the digital characters and the 3D were excellent. The casting of the film was done well and all actors seemed to agree with their characters. The film was also well scored.<br /><br />The Bad: The filmed seem a little hollow at the center as I wasn't drawn into great characters usually present in a Cameron film. Cameron doesn't usually re-invent the wheel when writing a story either but is able to carry a film with the great characters. With the great characters being absent in this film we are left with a very average story.<br /><br />Cameron seems to want his story to be a parable or allegory presenting obvious references to the current situation in the Middle East. Cameron often points the negative finger at big business and the like in his films but usually approaches it with some subtlety. That is not the case in Avatar as he clearly points to the United States and capitalism as great doers of evil. It goes so far as to use phrases such as \\"Shock and Awe\\" and \\"Terror on Terror\\" and to point out the company attempting to mine the mineral will eagerly kill all who stand in the way. It basically seems that the mineral is intended to represent oil and the Na'vi are suppose to represent Iraqis. Differing political points of are fine but I will turn on the news for that and would rather not have it forced down my throat in my entertainment.<br /><br />There are numerous plot holes and gaps in logic throughout the story but I can't go into detail without giving spoilers but can only say I expected more out of James Cameron.<br /><br />Overall: It's no Aliens. I had high hopes for this film but it fell short. Beautiful on IMAX but not a stellar film overall.with some subtlety.

B0000041LA|5.0|These performances are, quite simply, a must-have, and the standard to which every other recording of the Prokofiev concertos must be compared. The music is utterly fascinating, glittering, atmospheric with wonderfully ingenious and inventive thematic material and imaginative developments which to a certain extent combine the best of the Rachmaninov and Shostakovich concertos. The first concerto offers scintillating pianistic agility, gusto, bravura and enthusiasm. The stylistic connection to Medtner and early Rachmaninov is particularly noticeable, and Ashkenazy (and Previn) builds up and discharges a real punch. The second concerto - a better work, obviously - offers darkened drama and peerless pianistic command from Ashkenazy. Some interpretive choices might perhaps be questioned (many have questioned the rather free use of rubato), but I have overall never heard any performance coming as close to realizing the profundity and drama of this masterpiece, with a wonderful combination of brilliance and authority in the playing.     The glittering, mercurial third is just as masterly done, with the fireworks superbly discharged and the brilliant virtuosity amazingly dispatched. The interplay with the wonderful orchestration is marvelous, even if the piano is just maybe a little too forward in the sound picture. Here the competition is fierce, but Ashkenazy's coruscating playing, marvelously articulated and done with lightness and depth, yields to none. The fourth, for left-hand only, is delicate and full of imagination, perhaps in particular in the slow movement; the whole work, however, comes across as fresh and full of character, much more convincing than in any other performance I've encountered.     The fifth is powerful, imposing and rhythmically incisive. It has generally not been thought of as anything close to a highlight of the cycle, but in Ashkenazy's hands it almost comes across as such. His tempi are broader than, say, Richter, and I am pretty convinced by them. The version here is, at least, the stronger on atmosphere and fantasy. The performance, however, is perhaps less sparkling and humorous than some others, so I wouldn't dispense with all alternatives; still, the end result is impeccable. Previn's command of the LSO is superb, drawing brilliant and ferocious and colorful playing. The sound quality is warm and generally very well balanced, with the piano perhaps a tad to forwardly placed - some orchestral detail is overshadowed, but not to any extent that I find really objectionable. In short, these idiomatic, thoroughly convincing versions are mandatory listening for anyone with even a passing interest in the composer or good piano concerto playing. Superb.

B0015519VS|3.0|I am a huge Usher fan but couldn't really vibe with this album...my favorite song is \\"Trading Places\\" because it takes me back to the Usher who did \\"Confessions\\" I don't know if it is the distraction of a new marriage that the public didn't embrace or what but I couldn't play this album all the way thru like I could with his previous blockbuster. I am anticipating the release of his new album now that he has become divorced so we shall see what he comes up with...
0823003035|2.0|The artist seems more impressed with his own skill than in helping anyone try to learn how to draw.    The book has beautiful drawings and is a handsome book in general. It shows the authors work in an interesting way.    It is hardly a \\"complete guide to figure drawing: a contemporary perspective on the classical tradition\\" as it claims in the title.  Most of the text is empty of real meaning.    I would not recommend it to a friend.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|As a hard core Star Trek fan I must admit I did not watch this film when it came out nor when I first purchased it. For some reason I was worried they would do what The Enterprise tv series did and ruin my vision of what it could be.<br /><br />But boy was I wrong. I watched this movie and cheered it as if I was at a sporting event. It is nothing short of a incredible vision of Star Trek. The old characters we are all so familiar with shown to us as 'kids' yet it is so clear who they will grow up to be. The special effects are breathtaking, the pacing will take your breath away.<br /><br />PLEASE give us more!

B001FB55HQ|1.0|Not impressed...  clearly the only motivation behind this movie was to make a buck off the popularity of the first three Terminator movies...  by 15 minutes in I was waiting for it to be over.  About the most memorable thing for me about this movie was all the growling and yelling by Christian Bale (John Connor).  Seems all he did was scream the whole time.  The twist w/ Marcus Wright and his thread through the film was semi-interesting, but not enough so to save the picture overall.  There were some intense action scenes to thrill the 11 and 12 year old boys that were watching, but beyond that I found this to be a huge letdown.
0439023483|5.0|Fantastic in every aspect!! A must read!!    This is by far my favorite book!! Suzanne Collins has created a book that will capture the interest of anyone, of any age, male or female.  She creates a novel that has the perfect balance of thrill, suspense, romance and rebellion that will suck the reader in, and keep them on their toes, all the way through to the end.  This book can not fit into any single category, because of all the different aspects that it encompasses, which makes it perfect for nearly each and every reader.    Not only did I thoroughly enjoy this book as simply a pleasure read, but it also got me thinking about the Utopian, to dystopian society, that it portrays.       In this futuristic society, after North America has destroyed itself, the country of Panem is what rises from the ashes of our broken world.  The Capitol, a shining city situated in the Rockies, is in control of the 12 districts of Panem, which are all extremely poor underfed, and ill-treated, each specializing in certain goods to maintain the elegance and luxury of the self-centered citizens of the Capitol.  These Capitolians spend their lives making themselves happy in a world where they are surrounded by highly advanced technology which has few limitations, while the people of the districts live a life nearly as bad as the people living during the Great Depression.  Naturally the citizens of Panem saw this as completely unjust and crul, and rebelled.  Because of their weak defenses against the Capitol, they lost by an incredible margin, and earned themselves The Hunger Games.  Each year a girl and boy tribute from each district are chosen to be thrown together into a massive outdoor arena, to kill each other.  The last one standing earns endless riches and fame.  The entire event is broadcasted around Panem, where in the Capitol people consider it the ultimate form of entertainment.  The games are mandatory viewing, serving as the cruelest of reminders of how much control the Capitol has over the districts.     There may be some turn-offs to people when they first approach the book.  One being, the book description on the inner panel of the book jacket, which gives the impression that the story is strange and is centered mainly around violence, while in actuality, a lot more happens in the arena than just killing...  Collins shows in depth the bonds that are formed through different realationships with family members, friends, lovers and even some unusual and fascinating animals.    I have a copy that I keep for myself, and another that I lend to other people, my mom, step mom, and her mother have all read it, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I have never come across a person who hasn't enjoyed reading this masterpiece that Collins has created!

B002ECJZ76|3.0|I watched this movie last night and found it to be a nice Christmas movie.  I don't think it will become a classic, but it was enjoyable.  The dubbing into English was not the best.  The story of Santa Clause from the Finnish perspective was interesting.  I enjoy learning about how other nationalities view American traditions.

B002VPE1AM|4.0|Plotwise, Avatar is basically the intellectual equivalent of a Disney animated feature with a lot of PG-13 grade action and killing added in. That's not to say its bad, by any means.  In fact it's entertaining, has some memorable characters and moments, and keeps you interested from start to finish. It's simple, predictable, formulaic, etc... but its executed pretty well. In that respect, its similar to Titanic.    Based solely on its merits as a science fiction story, Avatar unfortunately pales in comparison to some of Cameron's previous work such as Aliens and Terminator. However, its definitely a milestone for what it accomplishes as a technical achievement in film making. I definitely think that everyone should see this movie at the theater in 3D. Not to do so would be to cheat yourself out of a very unique and enjoyable cinema experience. From start to finish, there were constantly moments where I found myself thinking, 'wow that's just really cool.' And the final battle sequence is nothing short of mesmerizing.    The simple minded story, the overplayed pseudo-native american characteristics of the Na'vi, and the hammy gaia worship spiritualism did make me mentally chuckle.  And when the cartoonish plot attempts to preach with half baked political statements, I did have to roll my eyes somewhat. But I must admit I was having too much fun for any of that to really bother me. All in all, Avatar is awesome for the experience and the sheer fun of it... not for being thought provoking or having a groundbreaking storyline. Sure it would've been all the more awesome if James Cameron had delivered a story just as epic and phenomenal as the presentation.  Nevertheless, a great presentation by itself does make a great movie sometimes.  I believe this is the case with Avatar, and I recommend you see it on a big screen in 3D!
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Whenever I've watched a movie with mates, it's not long for one of them to dismiss a situation within the story as unbelievable. My response is simply to \\"suspend your disbelief & enjoy the story\\". With Avator though, the unbelievable takes place before your very eyes and find yourself mesmerised & immersed in James Cameron's triumphant return to film (after the gayfest that was Titanic). Whereas The Hangover is my comedy of the year (and possibly the decade, although Role Models still rocks!)<br /><br />Avatar (not AR-VAH-TARR as some pretentious cock-blocking morons will say) is simply a breathtaking, visual feast for the imagination, young or old. Forget recent, lame attempts of 3D that apparently awed me at the time (A Christmas Carol for instance) Avatar doesn't chuck things at you from the screen, it draws you in. Imagine if you will, being inside a Wii or Xbox console's virtual world in 1080p, get my drift? I'm sure by now that anyone who's not seen this film, will know its basic plot. Let's face it, JC isn't prepared to bore our pants off, although we could've done without that tree-hugging BS that crops up occassionally and cod bohemian crap. Luckily, Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge (I don't make-up these names!) acknowledges this with an hilarious obeservation, during the movie.<br /><br />Avatar isn't without its flaws however, but Cameron more than makes up for it with A+ performances from a perfect cast and a couple of sweet touches to boot. What makes me laugh, is that when Terminator Salvation came out this year, a movie magazine had hailed Christian Bale as the saviour of franchise reboots. Don't get me wrong here, I like Bale; but to me, Sam Worthington was the more likable character of Marcus Wright (obviousy so much so, he's already wrapped up Clash Of The Titans, another reboot maybe?) And here, he turns it on again as Jake Sully, a crippled war veteran who doesn't give a hoot about his disability. I like Sam, as he's one of the lads, a real man (unlike me,a shameless metrosexual!) If he's not on every A-list director's call sheet by 2010, I'll shave my hair! (strike that, please!) It's his ability as well as a well-rounded cast, including Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver (in a great role) and Stephen Lang as an Apocalypse Now type Colonel, who has some of the coolest lines ever! Mustn't forget Michelle Rodriguez, who made me laugh out loud with a wisecrack about a firearm. What is the film's overall message you may ask? Personally I think it serves as being almost Anti-Republican (or American perhaps) in terms of what Stephen Lang and his crew's true motives are, but we'll save that debate for an old folks discussion.<br /><br />They say Twilight's New Moon is the biggest opening film last month, grossing $72,000,000. Who cares? What that gay excuse for a vampire film has done in ruining a legend; Avatar will sweeten the bitter taste in your mouth once again. I've already booked my place for the IMAX on Jan 27th 2010 (the only booking where I could get 2 seats!) What is astonishing though, is that when you leave the theatre, you'll never forget that CGI characters, when beautifully voiced, generate pure emotion. God, where's my Blu-ray of Iron Man?

0385504225|4.0|When I was questioned as to whether I planned on reading this book, my typical response fell somewhere in-between the lines of the `maybe later' reply.  The stories from the two previous books featuring Robert Langdon proved themselves entertaining, but there was nothing compelling about either one to convince me into dropping my current reading list to join `Lost Symbol' mania.<br /><br />Then a coworker set the book on my desk in an almost challenging gesture, forcing me to respond...<br /><br />Not to my surprise, what I discovered was another page-turner.  Just as with \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\", Brown leads a reader with promises of historical teaching moments, pseudo-conspiracy theories, villainous brilliance, and the possibility of simple truth revealed for the first time.  There is a wonder at how much of what he alleges is actual reality versus embellished beliefs.  That curiosity creates a sort of American mythology that could possibly be true, or could be the impossible-to-prove stuff of legend.  The constant `is it real; or is it mere fiction' quandary draws the reader forward to the story's culmination.<br />Then there is the question of the Masons.  Are the Masons as intricately connected to American success as proposed?  From this one reader's perspective, whenever the Masons are discussed, that discussion is always followed with a litany of famous historical characters claimed as Masons.  When those same historical characters are written of, any involvement in Masonry is never mentioned.  It seems Brown masters the ability of offering just enough truth in his fiction to make whatever is not actuality, a possible fact; hence part of the reason this book is so easy to turn from one page to the next.  You not only desire to see how Robert Langdon solves the riddling mystery posed to him by the villain, but you also find yourself wanting to know just how much of what Robert Langdon states is real.<br /><br />The bottom line, in my opinion, is anyone who enjoyed the previous stories from Dan Brown, they will enjoy this one as well.  It is worth the read; it holds a person's interest quite easily.  However, and I include this as a caveat, the ending fails to coalesce with the plot.  Not only does the villain (a superb blend of brilliance and insanity) alter his focus from ascending into heaven to become like God (what the `lost symbol' is meant to reveal), but the summation given by two of Brown's characters in the final few chapters makes no sense.  Brown is obviously trying to infuse his story with a bit of heart, to lift it above the status of mere thriller, i.e. some `meaning' readers can take away after the last page is read, but he misses that mark.  `The Lost Symbol' is an excellent thriller.  Period.\\"previous stories from Dan Brown, they will enjoy this one as well.  It is worth the read; it holds a person's interest quite easily.

But this year I have 3 classes and by the end of the day, I would be hoarse from reading. So I decided to order the audio version of the unabridged text and it worked like a charm. Jim Dale, a classically trained British actor, did a  wonderful job using many voices to read Dickens' masterpiece and it really came to life for my students.
B000OPOAJS|5.0|When I saw this movie on bluray I snapped it up. It's not the type of movie I would replace a DVD version with, but I misplaced or lost my DVD of the film so I had an excellent excuse. It's brilliant. The scene with the Russian ice skater doing her routine to Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini alone is priceless. The chase scenes are some of the most epic put on film, if a tad redundant and somewhat long. A solid and thoughtful spy/action movie.    Briefly on extras: Unlike some other writers, I simply don't care about them. I was really into extras when DVD's first came out about 10 years ago, but I have long since lost interest and rarely do I view extras of any kind. The commentaries, especially, I avoid like the plague. Just the movie as it played in theaters is good enough for me. The trailer perhaps. I'll ignore everything else with rare exceptions.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" is one of those films where you're happy to just sit back and let it happen. The story is unoriginal on just about every level, yet the way the story is told is an experience unto itself, not utilizing cinematic 3-D technologies so much as revolutionizing them, veering them away from conventional fly-off-the-screen tactics and ushering them into the twenty-first century. Yet again, Cameron's infamous tendency towards perfectionism (and really, really big budgets) pays off, allowing for one of the most creative, striking, immersive environments ever created for the big screen. To look at this movie is to envelope yourself in sheer visual delights, from futuristic spaceships to high-tech gadgets to fantastic creatures, all so finely crafted that they may be mistaken as the real thing.    The plot treads familiar ground as a fable about colonization, intolerance, corporate greed, wastefulness, and war. It takes place over 100 years in the future, when Earth, although not actually seen, has apparently been in the grip of an economic and energy crisis. In an effort to alleviate this issue, Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephan Lang) leads a military operation to the lush, distant moon of Pandora, which is home to a valuable mineral source known as unobtanium. Unfortunately, the largest deposit rests under a patch of land populated by the indigenous Na'vi, graceful ten-foot-tall creatures with glistening blue skin and gold eyes. Because they lack technology, because they believe their land has spiritual properties, they're considered primitive and savage by human standards.    Since Pandora's atmosphere is incapable of supporting human life, interaction with the Na'vi depends on linking the human mind to engineered Na'vi clones called avatars. Here enters Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-marine sent to Pandora to replace his identical twin brother, who has since been killed. His mission: Use his avatar to infiltrate a tribe of the Na'vi, earn their trust, and convince them to move away from their current location. Under the supervision of Earth scientist Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Jake assumes control of his avatar and enters the jungle, where he soon encounters a Na'vi princess named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Torn between distrusting him and appreciating his bravery, Neytiri is told by her mother, Mo'at (CCH Pounder), to teach Jake in the ways of their tribe in the hopes that he will become one of the people.    The story then becomes one of great conflict, not just between human and alien, but also between Jake's duty as a marine and his place amongst the Na'vi, which has been complicated by his growing affection for Neytiri. It also becomes a clash of priority, the heartless administrator Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) interested only in making a profit while Grace, who has studied the Na'vi for many years and can speak their language fluently, wants to see their species and way of life preserved. It inevitably comes down to a final battle between good and evil, in which Cameron relies on his own formula of pitting the mechanical against the organic; watching Jake fight Quaritch as he operates an enormous robotic walker, one cannot help but be reminded of the battle between the queen alien and Ripley's power loader in \\"Aliens.\\"    Much has been made of the technical innovations utilized in \\"Avatar,\\" and I have to say, everything you've heard is true. The 3-D process, made possible through the development of stereoscopic cameras, gives the picture a realistic sense of depth. This is especially true in the scenes taking place on Pandora, which is entirely computer generated. The Na'vi were brought to life by means of motion capture technology, adding a realism the likes of which I've never seen with computer generated imagery, not even in the last three films directed by Robert Zemeckis. They're undeniably otherworldly in appearance, yet they're not so exotic that basic emotions - fear, anger, grief, satisfaction - are impossible to point out. This was a wise move on Cameron's part; we can only invest in the Na'vi if we're able to relate to them at fundamental levels.    But the film's greatest achievement, like \\"Star Wars\\" before it, is in the way it blends special effects with common story elements. Jake, an example of the Amazing Grace paradigm, starts out as just another guy doing his job before realizing that actions have consequences, some of which could have and should have been prevented. The Na'vi can be symbolic of any number of mistreated indigenous peoples, from Native Americans to Aborigines. There's obvious distrust on both sides, which means there will eventually come a point at which differences must be set aside. The bad guys, most notably Quaritch and Selfridge, are very broadly drawn and not at all likely to have a crisis of conscience anytime soon. Just look at the name Selfridge. Doesn't it sound awfully similar to the word \\"selfish\\"?    All of this seamlessly combines into an unreasonably entertaining film, one that will be appealing, I believe, to audiences both inside and outside science fiction circles. It delivers as a visual effects extravaganza, yes, but it also delivers as an action spectacle, a morality play, and a surprisingly beautiful examination of spirituality, which in this case is backed by measurable scientific data. It also delivers as a showcase of 3-D, and if there's a choice, I strongly recommend you pay the extra money to see it that way (be it at a traditional venue or on an IMAX screen, which I hear is quite an experience). James Cameron has always been an innovator, and he has definitely proven himself once again with \\"Avatar,\\" a testament to the art of filmmaking.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Really good movie about the life of Supermodel Gia. Angeline Jolie's performance was excellent and touching at times and brought Gia back to life in this emotional and sometimes sad story of Gia's life and tragic death. The movie touched me long after I was done watching the movie and made me feel really sad that someone so beautiful, could feel so unloved and alone. It made me think harshly towards the people involved in the fashion industry and made me feel that they at times are no bettter then the people who are involved in the buying and selling that takes place in underground of human trafficing.
078322737X|3.0|I remember this film very well and wanted a DVD of it.  I wanted the digitally remastered copy, so I bought the DVD version.  I was disappointed after viewing the DVD because it appears I bought a second-rate copy of it, or possibly a pirated copy.  There are \\"skips\\" in several different scenes where if you were watching the VHS version, it appears as if a part was cut out, then the film was spliced back together.  I really wanted a first-rate DVD copy of this film but that's not what I got.    I have purchased DVD's from different Amazon vendors in the past, but my satifaction record is mixed - some really great, others very blah.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|I loved this one: the plot is great, the acting is simply superb, the screen play is of highest quality.    And on top of it all if your kid is thinking about becoming a journalist, let him/her watch, it may save him from this horrible dead end job.
B000IB0E8O|3.0|If you are a fan of the earlier Genesis stuff, or Steve Hackett in particular (he played guitar for Genesis in the early days), you will probably enjoy this CD. This was the 2nd Hackett CD I purchased (Voyage of the Acolyte was the first) and another pretty good, interesting effort. He sang all the vocals and played several different instruments. Some songs I really like, while others are just \\"ok\\", but overall worth listening to.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|It is a well written movie that adds to the very small body of films that have special effects but which are also great movies.
B000AM1TGC|4.0|This was Steve Hackett's 1st solo effort and was released while he was a member of the supergroup Genesis. He was assisted by the likes of Phil Collins, and Mike Rutherford of Genesis fame as well. Very good progressive rock for the era overall, but the final extended play bonus track, although very good, could have been about 7 or 8 minutes shorter as the same \\"chorus\\" was simply repeated over and over for at least that long.
B002Y5210G|5.0|I've been following Alicia since she broke through and this is by far one of my favorite albums. I think this album has more of an uplifting feel that anyone can grove to. If I can instantly pick 5+ tracks on a cd after listening to it once then it's definitely a hit and gets 5 stars.
B000003S1A|1.0|The copy of the CD \\"Discipline,\\" by King Crimson, which cost me $15, was defective and won't play beyond track 3 on my CD player. I thought Amazon exercised control over the quality of third-party vendors who sell on their site, but I was wrong. Is there any way I can get a good copy of the album or get a refund?<br /><br />Thank you,<br />David
B002RVCD0U|5.0|We rented the movie (video on demand) and loved it.  We stopped it 45 minutes into the movie to refresh our drinks.....it felt like only 15 minutes had passed.  Definitely worth the rental !
B002NWRMVS|4.0|On this CD, adult contemporary goddess Norah Jones has taken a moderate turn to the left, into pop/rock territory.  To me it is a refreshing change.  Although I loved her Grammy-winning \\"Don't Know Why\\", most of her music was a little too soft and mellow for me.  This album changes that.  And since Norah wrote or co-wrote all of the songs, it seems that she is making an artistic statement that she wants us to notice.  Don't worry. We're not talking hip-hop here, just tasteful change, nothing too extreme.<br /><br />Most of the tracks are characterized by prominent, but not overpowering, beats, and strong bass.  Another new thing is the background of mild electronica.  It has a \\"liquid\\" sound: it oozes, it quivers, it melts.  Sometimes the keyboards and guitars have the same liquid feel, with the notes falling like raindrops into a pool.  Norah's voice is as lovely as ever.  The song lyrics deal with the ups and downs in relationships.  \\"I Wouldn't Need You\\" in particular has an open, honest sexuality.  The melodies are just unconventional enough to be interesting.<br /><br />Probably the most pop-sounding tracks are \\"Chasing Pirates\\", \\"Even Though\\" and \\"Young Blood\\".  \\"Chasing Pirates\\" is a good strong opener, and all 3 are upbeat.  The most mellow track is \\"December\\", which sounds a little like Linda Ronstadt's \\"Blue Bayou\\".  Country/folk is very evident in \\"Waiting\\", which also has some unexpected key and chord shifts;  \\"It's Gonna Be\\", which is bluesy light rock with a 60's feel; and \\"You've Ruined Me\\".  Track #9 paradoxically combines the urban title \\"Back To Manhattan\\" with a slow country-waltz tempo.  \\"Tell Yer Mama\\" has a slight \\"cowboy\\" sound in the tempo, bass and some guitar lines; it makes me think of Johnny Cash.  \\"Man Of The Hour\\", with tongue-in-cheek lyrics, sounds a bit like the old standard \\"Makin' Whoopee\\". This is rather strange, because I believe her companion of choice is a canine.<br /><br />If recording artists want long-term careers, they know that change is necessary.  The trick is to find a sound that preserves their integrity, pleases their fans, and captures the attention of the general public.  I think Norah Jones has made a good step in that direction.ry.

B002MW50KO|4.0|I didn't know what to make of this album the first time I heard it.  Dylan's voice is more raggedy than ever and the arrangements are really corny.  I wasn't sure if Dylan intended this to be a joke or not.  After a second listen, I could tell that he was being sincere and was singing with a lot of feeling.  Now I like this album a lot.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this new Album.  Think Susan Boyle would be better off with songs such as the National Antheum and the Our Father.  Even the song, I Dreamed a Dream seemed a bit flat - not as much momentum as when she sang this on TV.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't know what this amazon reviewer is talking about. This album doesn't take getting used to. It grips you right away.    Every song is magnificent and is a big step away from The Bends(itself a great album). OK is a critique of modern civilization; of fat hungry bosses and the apathetic youth being consumed by technology. There isn't one track that isn't worth listening to; even the spoken word \\"Fitter Happier\\" and the heavily distorted vocals on \\"Climbing Up The Walls\\" serve as enjoyable listens.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Every so often I am surprised by a film and 'Christmas Story' is just such a film! The story of old Saint Nick told from Finland perspective is a marvelous story that is sweet, but never sappy and really belies the whole Holiday film clich&eacute;. The story of Santa Claus is told so matter of fact, that I felt like I was watching a \\"regular\\" movie! The only thing that keeps me from giving this a full 5 stars is the dubbing is a little off(unfortunately the original language option is not included) and that I think the film would have been better if it ended about a minute sooner. The shot of the spirit Santa Claus driving off in his sleigh, just took away all the realism that this film was giving me in so much abundance. I know, I know...it's a \\"holiday movie\\", but this film is so much more than that and I think it would have spoken louder and more profound had it showed us a little less. This is a small grievance and this film will be in my yearly holiday watching repertoire from now on! The film runs about an hour and 20 minutes and shows you don't have to have an overly long film to develop characters or tell a complete story! If you like Christmas films(and I know you do!)this one should not be missed!<br /><br />Happy Holidays to everyone!<br /><br />Merry Christmas!
1582701709|5.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent! The Secret really got me into the Law of Attraction. It opened to my eyes to what could be and has helped me to turn some things around, as well. I liked the way it was set up and loved the old looking antique type. It's a must have. (Also good for gift giving!!!) I highly recommend this one, along with [[ASIN:1439130833 The Secret Daily Teachings]].
B002WV5A9G|1.0|I gambled and lost, just finished watching Star Trek.  The other one star reviews are correct if you are a true fan of the originals this is no where near justice to Gene Roddenberry's mythos.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle has what many singers would envy - a very smooth, listenable voice, and that's what she should focus on throughout her hopefully long career in singing and performing.  The album may be too much of a hodge-podge of selections, but that's probably due to time constraints and the record producers trying to figure out what the consumers want to hear from Susan.  How many singers can create a repertoire of album-worthy songs in a matter of a few months?  Added:  It may be that Susan chose these songs because they are her favorites.  If this is the case, then she should have gotten more input into what would have worked to create a flowing, varied album that would fully showcase her talent.    As a middle-aged woman nearing 50 who dreams of performing on a small, local scale, I can truly appreciate the great opportunity that Susan has before her and I wish her all the best.    Susan emotes when she sings, and she shines on the softer, more wistful selections.  There are many excellent selections on this album.  \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" is less of a favorite because it is now all too well-known and no longer fresh. I am done with this song for a while, and she wasn't able to top her audition performance on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" on this studio album.  She might have been better served by duplicating her live performance on this song.  \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\" showcase the smooth quality of her voice, while \\"You'll See\\" shows the depth of her low notes and these songs are truly beautiful renditions of well known songs.  \\"How Great Thou Art\\" sounds as if she is performing a song that she may have sung many times in church, but in my opinion, she does not add to it the heaviness and \\"angst\\" that makes this song so powerful.  It is probably my least favorite song on this album for this reason.  \\"Daydream Believer\\" is another pretty selection with a lightness of tone and presentation.  For me she is reminiscent of Petula Clark on many of her ballads such as her cover of \\"It's the End of the World\\", a Petula Clark hit. I can only imagine her spending hours at home listening to the great singers of the 60's and wearing her records out.  Her lovely lilting tone and legato and rich low notes are what set her apart from many performers, and she does not need overproduction. My favorites on this album are \\"Wild Horses\\" (emotion and beautiful tone), \\"Cry Me A River\\" (very smooth, jazzy warmth to it) and \\"You'll See\\" (rich, haunting quality).    The other area where Susan finds her niche is by adding several songs that are lesser known such \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\" and \\"Proud\\".     If there is such a thing as singing \\"too prettily\\" (and there is according to my voice teacher), then Susans sings too prettily on \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"Silent Night\\". It is the rawness of tone and the intimacy of a singer's emotion that sets a performance apart and sends chills down the spine.  Sing ugly and bare your soul, Susan, and you will be self-actualized.  What comes across in this album is that she holds back some of the power in her voice.  It is as if she steps back timidly from her strengths.  Where she should growl in pure force on \\"How Great Thou Art\\", for example, she simply sings the notes with too little intensity.  The intensity on the songs on this album should vary, and it does to some degree - just not enough.  It does not mean belting out songs versus singing in a soothing or emotionally wrought tone - it means taking the song and pondering the words, then interpreting it and further refining the performance to state the purpose of the song and convey it successfully with sincerity and honesty.  Susan sounds like a \\"lost little lamb\\" on some of these songs.    For those who like Susan Boyle and her vocal quality, I would recommend that you try out Jane Olivor, Petula Clark, Katherine McPhee (\\"Hit Man - David Foster and Friends\\"), Karen Carpenter of The Carpenters (sadly missed) and Lucinda Williams. While these singers all have unique and quite distinct qualities, they all have the aching, heartfelt emotion in some of their songs that singers should embrace and Susan Boyle should strive to achieve. Raw intensity is the human experience.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|I purchased this DVD set for my 11 year old Autistic son who watches this all of the time. Our DVR used to be totally full all of the time w/all of the episodes that he recorded. My son has watched all of the episodes so much that he verbally recites all of the words to the episodes as he is watching them.     Each episode has a life lesson to be learned if you pay close attention. I usually watch these with my son just to view the content for him.     Thank you George Lucas for a great kids product.

B002UPA4ZY|4.0|I would give this 3.5 stars - Scrooge or Grinch that I am.  Christmas performances can have the tendency to have some hokey renditions of songs, and this is no exception.  I do not have the DVD, but I watched the entire PBS production and found some parts to be beneath Andrea Bocelli's dignity.  Most likely David Foster and Andrea were trying to appeal to all ages, but the performances with children and for children were hokey and boring and did not showcase Andrea Bocelli at all unless he was trying to show his versatiliy and humor.  The children were staged in the production - plastered smiles and all, or at least that is how I viewed them.  I also thought the Muppets were a real stretch.  Please leave this to Sesame Street.  Andrea's duet with Katherine Jenkins was not memorable. Katherine Jenkins is a beautiful woman (who was dressed in an over the top ball gown - sort of like a black mermaid costume), but her singing was not clear or emotional and the song was very bland.  Katherine Jenkins seemed to be merely there.  These are just of a few of the performances in the show.  Mary J. Blige (even though she was being videocast from NYC) was excellent and a breath of fresh air.  All in all, it is a very uneven concert production and may be just fine for Christmas but not for any other time of the year. I would not recommend that you buy this is as a gift for anyone unless you really know that they won't mind some cheesy, corny performances mixed in with the more serious performances.  \\"Jingle Bells\\" and \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" are laughably bad.  Read the other reviews and you'll see that I am not alone in my opinon.    If you want to experience a David Foster concert production well worth your time, please buy the Blu-ray \\"Hit Man - David Foster and Friends\\".  It is an exciting and memorable PBS concert event that will be a winner for all seasons and stand the test of time.  Andrea Bocelli maintains his dignity and Katherine McPhee makes magic with him.
B00004SVIK|5.0|If you had a copy of the original this is a must have.  \\"Mother\\" alone is worth the price of the cd.
0307269981|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed being immersed in the story line of Larsson's novel, but what I relished most was the gradual unveiling of Salander's character.  It's wonderful to finally have some complexity in the mystery genre.

B0009S4IKQ|5.0|Goulding's multi-cast and multi-story narrative is an intelligent and very human story. He captures the traffic of a famous hotel with exemplary commentary on people and society. He uses the sets to challenge and alienate them and great dialogue so that they may expound on their feelings. There is so much detail in his telling of the story that it cries to be noticed and appreciated. This genre of film has been imitated over and over again but it's never had quite the same feeling for this kind of material.  This video transfer is not perfect but quite good.
0307269760|3.0|I love Alice Munro and have almost everything she's written. No one writes like her (although she's influenced a generation of students in MFA programs) and she deserves the accolades. When I heard that this book was coming out, I was thrilled, as always.    After reading the first story, I thought it very dark, and not among her strongest efforts -- but I attributed that to the fact that she was trying something new. Then I read the next story, and the next, and gradually became more baffled. I got the impression that the author was deliberately searching out freakish subject matter, and exploring it without revealing much that was illuminating -- certainly not in a way I'm used to with her. Some of the stories ended with an abruptness that made them seem unfinished. Others just depressed me.    I know Alice Munro is a bit of a sacred cow, but frankly I think that this book doesn't come close to collections like \\"Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage\\".
0780021967|5.0|This is early Hitchcock while still in Britain and in particular, `The 39 Steps' is an indication that Hitch even with low British budgets was unstoppable as a master of suspense and innovativeness and he did it by using simple means. There are so many well-developed sequences, that might go unnoticed but they stick to the brain. Watch for the scene when our hero hides behind a bridge pillar as a train goes past him; the camera's movement and the set-up is pure modernism.  This is a beautiful transfer.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|With a large hi-def TV with good sound, it's almost as good as being there.  After all, unless you have front seats at the concert, you're watching a TV screen anyway.  This is a great concert and is very different from just listening to a CD.  Both are good in their own way, but for a mere fraction of the concert cost you can watch in on DVD forever.  Highly recommended - great band, good song selection.
B0007TKNII|4.0|Have always enjoyed the music and have seen the musical both on Broadway and locally.  Saw the movie when first out and wanted to see again.

0061730327|5.0|I first learned of William while watching the Daily Show with John Stewart. I was intrigued by his interview and decided to purchase this book. Boy am I glad I did. This has to be one of the  most inspiring stories I've ever read. Despite famine, poverty, ridicule, and the lack of a formal education, William's hunger for knowledge, ingenuity and tenacity led him to create something that would help improve life for his family and village. Reading about the circumstances and culture William grew up in was truly fascinating.     This book has inspired and motivated me to reassess my own path in life and it may do the same for you!

B002NOAF9W|5.0|I highly recommend this deluxe box set to any classic rock fan. It's an awesome incite into one of the greatest live performances ever recorded. The only let down is the dvd due to its length, but not it's content. The footage that they do have is historic, showing the band at their peak, and one of the greatest live versions of \\"under my thumb\\" and \\"satisfaction\\". It allows you to feel as though you were there during the greatest era of music. Hopefully the \\"exile on main st\\" box set is just as good.
B001PBRCVI|5.0|In 2002, Julia Jarmond is a writer who is asked to write a piece concerning for the approaching 60th anniversary of Vel' d'Hiv', a time in French history most would prefer to forget.  In July, 1942, the French police rounded up Jews and forced them onto busses which took them to concentration camps.  Sarah Stravinsky locks her four-year-old brother in a bedroom closet where they often hide, telling him that she will be back soon to release him.  She, of course, does not know that the police do not intend to let them return home. This author wrenches emotions from the reader through multiple twists and turns.  Even when it appears predictable, de Rosnay develops alternative and keeps the reader anticipating the resolution.

B001AQMBJQ|5.0|This is the best adventure series on tv.  I highly recommend the whole series on Blu ray, including season 5.  I know that some people get frustrated by the flash-backs/forwards and by jumping in time; but I didn't find the show to be confusing.  Unless people have difficulties staying focused and watching every episode, everything will make sense and won't be confusing.     I was only disappointed because this season (just like Season 4) was too short for me.  It felt like some things were rushed.    I would love to have another episode about Sawyer and Juliet in 1977.  Also, I would enjoy one more episode with Faraday.  Also, it felt like things started to get crazy too quickly when Kate, Jack, Hurley and Sayid reunited with Sawyer, Juliette, Miles and Faraday - Nevertheless, it makes sense that Sawyer and Juliette's time was destroyed so quickly, because they were not meant to stay in 1977 forever.

0143034901|4.0|In spite of it being a Gothic novel, it reads more like a mystery story. It was a page-turner more because of wanting to see what comes next rather than being drawn in by superb writing. In fact, I almost put it down during the first third because of unbearably machoistic statements to which I am allergic: \\"women want the opposite of what they think or say they want\\", and others.<br /><br />Once I got past the half-way point, the reading became more enjoyable for me. I was glad to have had the letter that explained everything because otherwise it would have taken a sequel to pull in all the loose ends, but I was disappointed that that was the best way the author could find to resolve the mystery. The mystery was more of a \\"why they did what they did\\" than a \\"who dunnit\\". For that reason, it was a bit deeper and more involving than the usual mystery.<br /><br />The idea was a good one, the storyline was good, the writing was good, and I'm not sorry I read the book. I liked the atmosphere.  I could just about \\"see\\" all the locations in my mind's eye. I didn't mind the improbable parts because it is clear this was a \\"detective\\" story and not great literature. Some of the improbable parts gave some comic relief and that was also good. I think that the author has a good sense of humour and there were some lines that drew a guffaw from me. The characters were less important to me than the plot. I really didn't care about any of them much - except for Nuria at the end (and if you think about it, she's the only character to be presented in first person). At the same time, as I write this review, I can see all the characters in my mind and they feel quite real to me. Interesting.<br /><br />If I happen to run across another Ruiz Zafon book I will probably pick it up, but he's not someone I'm going to particularly look for. As some reviewers wrote - it's good escapism. And today, in a world of lots of pretty lousy writing, that not bad at all.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|As I was going through my CDs the other day, I found this CD which I hadn't listened to in a long time, and I popped this disc into my CD player. I realized that I had forgotten how good this CD was. While it's not \\"Under My Skin\\" (in fact, it's quite the opposite mood-wise), it still is a fun record that is a very enjoyable listening experience. While, I'm not that big a fan of lead single \\"Girlfriend,\\" there are many better songs on the record.    Going through these songs, you realize that the lyrics aren't nearly as emotional or cleaver as songs from her second disc, \\"Under My Skin,\\" but songs like \\"I Can Do Better\\" and \\"Runaway\\" are catchy pop-rock tunes and the pretty clever \\"Everything Back But You\\" tells a story of Avril getting a postcard from her boyfriend that reads \\"I wish you were her\\" (OUCH!)    (Because you wrote I wish you were her/You left out the E/You left without me...)    Hints of \\"Girlfriend\\" are sprayed on \\"I Don't Have to Try\\" and the album's title track, but they are far superior and much less annoying. The album's true highlights, though, are not the \\"fun\\" tracks, but the ballads. Second single \\"When You're Gone\\" is very pretty and \\"Keep Holding On\\" is very inspirational. But the ballad \\"Innocence\\" has to take the cake for best song on the record. It is simply beautiful.    So, before you listen to the haters, preview some of the songs and see if you like them.    TOP 5:  1. Innocence  2. Everything Back But You  3. Runaway  4. When You're Gone  5. Hot
B002TZS5GU|4.0|First, this kind of genre (world falling apart) is my favorite. I eat these movies up like a zombie, which this movie didn't have any of.    I only heard of this movie yesterday so I rented it. Everything is solid, story, acting, etc. It gets 4 stars because it doesn't really add anything that we haven't seen in various other movies, not really, although it is a bit darker I will say. In fact, yes, it is sadder than most other movies like this.    Without giving anything away I have to say that the movie is not uplifting. This is why my wife didn't like when we got to the end.

B001LV5OOY|5.0|I had never heard of this band until by chance they were playing in Toronto during a trip.  I missed the concert, but purchased the cd.  It is one of my favorite cds and I like almost every song.  I am anxiously awaiting their next release.  Sounds like it will be a while, but if it is as good as this one, it will be worth the wait.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a romp that takes a bit of horrendous history and makes an entertaining film about it.  For those who admire the strangely off kilter Quentin Tarantino's films, this may just appeal as his best and fanciest production yet.  It is a way over the top story about revenge as carefully served out by Jewish American soldiers known as Inglourious Basterds on the Nazis who during the occupation of France sought out and murdered thousands of Jews.  This may sound like a grim topic for an entertaining film, but in Tarantino's hands it becomes not only a grisly look at reality but also an at times hilarious parody.<br /><br />The cast is almost secondary to the story: Brad Pitt as the leader Lt Aldo Raine sports a scarred throat and a somewhat tiresome Tennessee accent but seems to enjoy every grisly moment of his command to have all members of his division gather 100 scalps from the Nazi killers; Denis Menochet provides a sensitive opening as the French father who is hiding Jews (namely one Shosanna Dreyfus-  M&eacute;lanie Laurent - whose escape from her family's slaughter begins the lead seed for the story ahead), Mike Myers portraying a German parody as only he can, Daniel Br&uuml;hl, Marin Wuttke as a pitch perfect Hitler, B.J. Novak as Pitt's sidekick, Sylvester Groth as Goebbels, etc.  But the crowning actor in this film is the amazingly gifted Christoph Waltz as the multilingual, sinister, smarmy, yet elegant Col. Hans Landa who drives this wild tale to its grisly conclusion.<br /><br />As with all Tarantino films this is not a film for the faint of heart, but it is surprising how entertaining this sprawling story is in his hands.  It goes on a bit long and is chocked full of grisly incidents, but it is fine film making.  Grady Harp, December 09
1416595554|3.0|I couldn't wait to read Sashenka. Simon Sebag Montefiore's prior nonfiction works (Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar and Young Stalin) are, arguably, the last word on Stalin. He's better than Deutscher, Volkogonov, and Conquest--I doubt that Stalin will ever squirm under a more penetrating eye, and I hope Sebag Montefiore tackles Trotsky next.     At first glance, Sashenka is daunting to anyone who's ever contemplated writing a historical novel. Sashenka, the eponymously-titled story of a pampered young girl from St. Petersburg's Jewish aristocracy who becomes a rip-roarin' Red revolutionary, is jammed so full of precise historical details (right down to the peculiar vibrating chair that her father the Baron uses to aid his digestion)that any prospective historical novelist might well figure, \\"What's the use? No one'll ever do it better,\\" and quit in despair.     But on second reading, Sashenka isn't nearly as threatening. Sebag Montefiore has peopled his heroine's family with stock images from the Russian Jewish Stereotype Store--the Idealistic Young Girl, the Parvenu Moneybags, the Grim Revolutionary, the Saintly Old Rebbe and his Equally Saintly Old Rebbetzin, the Gladhanding Bon Vivant (hey, Mr. Sebag Montefiore? Isaac Bashevis Singer's The Family Moskat called. It wants its character back) and most offensively, the Bored and Debauched Rich Housewife, a type already used to better effect by Sholem Asch and Isaak Babel. It's tough to believe that one family could contain all these stereotypes, but this one manages.     Sadly, Sebag Montefiore has substituted rich detail for actual character development, because none of these stereotypes ever really comes alive. Including, sadly, Sashenka herself. Which is too bad. Because I think if I got to know her better, I'd have had a real crush on her. She's pretty hot, in a Red sort of way.     The second part of the book, though, not all the rich detail in the world can save from sheer implausibility and a mawkish endingwhere everyone in the world is reunited more or less happily. Except for (spoilers deleted), because she croaked years ago. Oh well. Too bad, because she was pretty hot. In a Red sort of way.     Sashenka is great as worm's eye view history. To read it is to learn gobs about 20th century Russia. As a novel, it's shlocky. The literary devices are just a leetle too well-worn (Sashenka's actions, quel horreur, echo her detested mother's!), and the story, once it leaps to the present day, kind of lurches aimlessly off into silliness. Apparently, once he could no longer use all the rich historical details at his command, Sebag Montefiore sort of lost interest.     Mr. Sebag Montefiore, if we ever meet, please don't punch me in the face. I don't mean to be a shmuck, but I like you a heck of a lot better as an historian than a novelist. Now, can we talk about that biography of Trotsky? Because I'd climb mountains to read that.
B002RSDW80|4.0|Nora Ephron has a gift for creating 'feel good films' that please a wide audience. Her works don't demand a lot from the viewer except a temporary suspension of reality to bask in her well-directed confections. JULIE & JULIA is not a great or important film, but it is a carefully meshed combination of cute story as portrayed by fine actors.<br /><br />The indomitable Meryl Streep inhabits the very well known character Julia Child, not an easy assignment when the real Julia Child was observed by a very wide audience during the run of her television show on cooking. At first it seems as though Streep will be impersonating Child, but as is this actress' penchant for acting she soon becomes Child, not by imitating but instead by channeling the strangely funny and deliciously wild chef who captured the hearts of millions. Her part of this two-sided story shares the development of her gifts as a cook as well as her warmth with her friends and her husband (wonderfully played by Stanley Tucci) and that story alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />The second side of the film is the story of a frustrated writer Julie (Amy Adams) who finds her joy in creating a blog to demonstrate that she can accomplish a goal: she will cook all recipes in Child's 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' in 365 days. Adams does well with the script and balances the story of Child's successful search for her dream in Paris of the 1950s with a contemporary take on a mirror search via blogging in the 21st century. It works as a very pleasant diversion. This is a perfect film for holiday viewing: it comes with a huge dollop of love and light comedy. Grady Harp, December 09

B00005JGAF|5.0|\\"Ramones\\" (1976) and \\"Leave Home\\" (1977) were the birth of punk, but their third album \\"Rocket To Russia\\" signaled further growth. They incorporated more pop and melody into their fast and furious sound in an attempt to be accessible. It worked. \\"Sheena Is A Punk Rocker\\" and \\"Rockaway Beach\\" were the closest they ever came to having hit singles.    The fact that it includes such famous tracks as \\"Cretin Hop\\", \\"We're A Happy Family\\", \\"Teenage Lobotomy\\", and \\"Ramona\\" only sweetens the pot. Well-chosen covers \\"Do You Wanna Dance?\\" and \\"Surfin' Bird\\" really seal the deal. Great bonus tracks? Yep, plenty of 'em. This CD is a must-have.    I love all 14 Ramones studio albums, but favor the first 7 (up to and including 1983's \\"Subterranean Jungle\\"). After that they took on a metal edge. Still great, but different. Hugely influential, always humorous, engaging as all-get-out - the Ramones are a band for the ages. Don't miss them!

B002T9H2L0|5.0|I'm a big Tarantino fan and have been since Reservoir Dogs. I loved Jackie Brown, and the Kill Bill movies were even better, but Inglourious Basterds is simply awesome. It's definitely the most bizarre WW2 movie ever made, but that's not a bad thing. By ar the most entertaining movie I saw in 2009. It's a long flick clocking in at 2 1/2 hours, but it's so enjoyable you'll forget about the time. Do yourself a favor and check it out.

B000YPUF9W|4.0|Picking up from where Resident Evil Apocalypse left off, Extinction sheds light on events following the spread of the T-Virus aboveground, in and around Raccoon City.   The virus has now spread all over the world rapidly killing all life on the planet while below ground the Umbrella corporation is carrying out experiments on Alice's clones in order to provide the zombies with intelligence and turn them into a work/labor force. Alice on the other hand begs to differ...   Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well!   The plot, the setting, the special effects, and the battles are all very good. Moreover, the film does a great job of establishing a cliffhanger for a sequel.   In short, it is a movie worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment as long as you are in the mood for that kind of a film.

B000WM725C|5.0|As protean an effort as Live Rust is, it pales by comparison to this disc. Pity he can't seem to get Archives to measure up to the bootlegs from other sources. In any case, as the product descriptions indicate, this is one of the complete shows from the Cow Palace from which Live Rust was cobbled together. Neil muffs an occasional line, but the intensity here is astounding and the renditions on this show of his war chestnuts throw sparks and spit fire. The disc sounds simply amazing, again leaving you to wonder what it is with him that he can never seem to get an even keel on the aesthetics of his records. For a guy who claims that sound matters, you'd wish he'd sit down and listen to this.  Quite honestly, I don't know that I'll ever go listen to Live Rust again. This trumps it. Has anyone got a similar disc or two of the shows that produced Time Fades Away? I am very interested. I saw a lot of those shows, and TFA didn't capture any of them. Let me know.

B002T9H2L0|2.0|The first chapter of the movie was well acted but it went down very fast in subsequent chapters. I could not believe that movies like this one are produced. It was a waste of money, film, and acting. Do not waste your time it's not worth it. I am convinced that when they advertise a movie, you know it not worth viewing.
B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson doesn't have any qualms about portraying a man with a 17 year old daughter that is striving to spread her wings.  Divorced, hurt for having not spent enough time with his only child, he portrays a caring man that will do anything for her.  She's his world and, at every available opportunity, he attempts to find the way to prove it to her.<br />Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson's character) worries, as parents do.  When his daughter takes off to Paris with a friend, he does the normal call-me-when-you-get-there, etc.  As a typical teen, she forgets, too involved in the wonders she has planned with her friend.  The one phonecall she does answer is the single thread that her father has to hang onto in order to save her, knowing she has been taken.<br />This is a high action, seat gripping action drama that I enjoyed thoroughly.  Neeson's character is as ruthless as any parent would be in that effort to save their child from a fate worse than death
0810983915|4.0|A day care operator told me about this book series, saying every one of her charges loved it. When I got it I could see why. It is the diary a pre-teen boy who thinks like a typical kid but worse, which gets him into all kinds of messes when his ideas go wrong. I think kids can't put it down because they identify with the things he thinks and the hilarious consequences. It is full of wonderful stick-figure illustrations, many if which add significantly to the humour of the story. Wan't your child to start reading more? Get this one.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This is one of the best zombie movies I've seen since Planet Terror. It's funny, and fun, and a great time if you like horror comedies and amusement parks. Nobody uses their real name to avoid attachment, and instead go by their intended destinations. Columbus is a college student who has rules and tries to see if his parents are still alive. He meets Tallahassee, who is a tough redneck that tries to find the last Twinkie on earth. They meet Wichita and Little Rock, two sisters that are con-artists. After finally getting along and becoming friends, the sisters leave because they don't want to get too emotionally attached. They head off to Pacific Playland to enjoy the rides, but they unintentionally attract a bunch of zombies nearby. I love how they use the amusement park equipment to kill the zombies. I highly recommend that you go to ZOMBIELAND!!!
B002XUM1NY|4.0|These are the types of stories that make me want to get back into writing on a regular basis.  They are fresh and full, and have such a wide range of imagination that they make me remember what it is to create a world that can easily be traveled to and from in the course of 15 minutes.<br /><br />While some of the stories are dark, a mature tween should have no difficulty in dealing with the themes and the questions that are posed by these stories.  \\"October in the Chair\\" and \\"Troll Bridge\\" were my personal favorites.  A personification of the months and what their stories would be hit squarely on my feelings, and an interesting twist on the story of the troll under a bridge made my heart cry.

0307269981|5.0|I'd heard great things about the Millenium trilogy but every time I picked up the first book it looked too complicated to get into.  Then I bit the bullet and bought the first one and never looked back.  It does take some initial effort to get into the storyline and to remember the character names, but he DOES keep reminding you, so you don't need to keep looking back in the book when you forget who is who.  Anyway---the second two books are even better.  The last book \\"The girl who kicked the hornets nest\\" is so superb that I read it slowly because I didnt want to end.  Salander is the coolest most original protagonist ever, and I think its turned the crime genre on its head.  Given the conspiratorial anti-government nature of the series, you can't help wonder about the untimely death of this super talented author.<br /><br />If you want a creepy, fast-paced, atmospheric thriller with a difference with fascinating uncliched characters and a setting in cold dark scandinavia ---buy these books.
0385504225|2.0|From the ludicrous descriptions behind the history of the villain, to the section in which the main character is blindfolded, only to end up in the most obvious place in Washington D.C., the author gives you plenty of opportunities to say \\"Aw, come on!\\"  I hated the book, don't know what my husband and other see in it...

B002NOAF9W|5.0|It's easy to argue when the Stones were at their best. From my perspective this live performance puts them at their pinnacle. Not too glizty and still pulling out the blues numbers which is their definitive roots. The set list combines their finest tunes and the additional Stones material is awesome. The package as a whole rocks. I was at the show in MSG so it has a special appeal to me. Hearing BB King and Ike and Tina gives a holistic feel to the show as it was truly an event. Mick Taylor, the new guitarist and Keith really hit it off. No contention, just lots of great guitar work. And the band is rocking. Nothing to argue. Just great rock and roll. This is a must for anyone who lived through the era or who wants to get an appreciation of what it was like.
B001AVCFJM|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good trek, not the best, but not the worst by any stretch.  I guess I should tell you what type and level of trekkie I am.  I'm 29, and as a kid, I absolutely LOVED the original series and the Shatner/Nimoy/Kelly/etc movies.  I enjoyed the next generation as well, though I thought it was a little sterile, at least at first.  Eventually in the later seasons of TNG the stories and characters became much more interesting to me.  I thought Generations was OK, and First Contact was outstanding.  The last couple Trek movies, Insurrection and Nemesis I thought were pretty much unwatchable.  I never could stand DS9, or Enterprise, and I'm pretty much nauseous watching Voyager.  For me, Star Trek jumped the space shark a long, long time ago.<br /><br />All that being said, I don't need to rehash all of the timeline complaints, JJ not knowing enough about Star Trek, etc.  When I watch this movie, I really see the spirit of the original series here.  I still watch the old series quite a bit, and some of those old episodes really play hell with the characters and story.  There are episodes where it seems Spock, Kirk, and McCoy ALL hate each other, especially in season 3, for whatever reason.  This movie is fast paced, and to my mind, very similar to Gene's original vision of a \\"wagon train to the stars.\\"  It's action packed, simple, silly, and fun, which is EXACTLY what Star Trek ORIGINALLY was, in my own opinion based off years of watching and loving the old series.  I'm not taking away from anyone else's negative feelings on this film and it's shuffling of characters and canon. I can see why some wouldn't like this, and that's fine.  In my view, I say - whatever, it's just nice to see a Star Trek film that doesn't suck back on the big screen.  And kudos to JJ for making Star Trek cool, as for the first time in my life I'm not embarrassed to say I like Star Trek.<br /><br />There are plenty of aspects to this film that show a real care for the subject matter.  Karl Urban in particular delivers a knock-out rendition of Bones.  Karl is apparently a huge Star Trek fan with a deep respect and admiration for DeForest Kelly, and it really shows that he took the time to channel the exact character that Kelly created, right down to the speech patterns, timing, accent, and facial expressions.<br /><br />Spock/Uhura - eh, I thought that was too much, and kind of lame, but like I said, I remember stuff like this happening in the original series all the time.  Red Matter - so big deal there's no explanation.  Who needs one, really?  Red Matter... just another in a long line of good old fashioned Star Trek plot devices - dilitium, slingshot-around-the-sun, pencil-lead-whale-speaking-soccer-ball-probe, planet-wide eco-system creating torpedos, V-Ger, 100 deck turboshafts, Tribbles, Katras, shape-shifters, mind-melds... I could go on forever.  There's always silly stuff in these things.  It's fun.  I thought destroying Vulcan was unnecessary, but I didn't personally know any of those future aliens, so I'm okay with it.  If you have a deep emotional investment in Trek, you might perhaps think the types of things depicted in Trek will happen in the future.  Think of this then: will anyone in 2309 be watching a movie or a TV show made in 1966 or 2009?<br /><br />It's a pretty good Star Trek with a few (as usual) flaws.  The only reason it is getting so picked apart is because in this internet day and age every Joe Trek can log on and speak their mind.  Use to be we just had to take Gene Shallot's or Roger Ebert's word for it.  There's my two cents.Karl Urban in particular delivers a knock-out rendition of Bones.

0767817729|1.0|There are two versions of this disc.    As it was originally released, it was a two sided disc with the widescreen anamorphic original aspect ratio on one side, and a pan and scan version on the other side.    That release went out of print, then it was reissued.    The reissue is **only** a one sided disc, and it includes **only** the pan and scan version. **That** is the disc that Amazon.com is currently selling.    Their current description (as of 12/19/2009) is therefore MISLEADING. If you buy this disc here (and likely from many of the vendors selling it used, unless explicitly stated), you are buying a PAN & SCAN ONLY version.    BUYER BEWARE.

I loved it so much when I saw it broadcast on HBO that I told every I know about it and had to buy a copy of the dvds for myself to watch over & over again.  I've been screening it for friends this weekend and still just as excited about this mini-series as the first time.  A MUST buy for fans of this genre!
B00003CWPL|3.0|David Lynch's surreal film about the terrors of parenthood is an unpleasant but unforgettable experience.  Early evidence of Lynch's genius is evident, but I can't deny that I was frequently bored during this short film.  It doesn't make me feel very intelligent to admit that, since this is clearly a very personal and thoughtful project.  Lynch has made a cottage industry of films that are difficult to understand but fascinating to watch, which can sometimes result in a frustrating viewing experience.
0385504225|5.0|This is a Great Book.  This is the first of the Dan Brown books I have read and I can not put it down.  If you are a fan of Dan Brown I think you will like it.  If you have never read Dan Brown before this I would recommend it.

I would recommend this book highly.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I'll start out by saying this isn't a comparison of Megadeth and Metallica so let's put it to rest. That being said, an album of this quality doesn't come by very often. In fact, I consider this the best album released in 09'. This gets a lot of airplay in my car since every track is good in their own different way, especially the title track. This is coming from someone that really hates the music industry but I went out of my way to buy this cd to support the musical direction Megadeth is going. Perhaps the best and most talented line up of musicians in Megadeth. Of all the bloated, ridiculous, idiotic noise that currently dominates the airwaves, this puts the smack down on all the lame, stupid music the MTV generation currently considers great.<br /><br />This is a no holds barred assault, a soundtrack for seething aggression and accurately points out the failure of the government bailouts, reinvents \\"High Speed Dirt\\" (Countdown To Extinction), torture, war, the inadequetely armed LAPD during the 44 minute failed bank robbery shootout, hostile government takeover / invasion of your rights, and the reality of living paycheck to paycheck. Even the one semi-slow song on this album didn't suck failure (track 8). Each track has a tight sound, is clean (not heavily distorted), acccurate, and produced with an intense clarity (unlike bands with overproduced albums that try to compensate for a lack of musical talent). Megadeth has reinvented their thrash metal sound of the eighties, early nineties, and are not holding back. To fully experience it, go to youtube and check out each song for yourself. If you love heavy music, this won't disappoint.

Despite the fact that I was intimidated until almost page 100 by authors' delving too much into the \\"goodness\\" of Israeli armed forces, and almost glorifying the neighbour-bashing Israeli army and air forces, I still kept reading the book which, in the end, turned out to be a very fruitful endeavour.<br /><br />This is a good book. It provides a very nice vision for those who are interested in economic development, industrial policy and especially innovation/entrepreneurship policy. There are invaluable hints regarding those topics, however much they are hidden in between the lines. Nevertheless, as I said, the tips are invaluable and very teaching.<br /><br />The main question I had in mind while reading the book was whether I could take home some of the experiences and lessons described in the book. Some definitely cannot be imported. They are those idiosyncratic things which are very much Israeli and Jewish-specific:<br /><br />- For example the role of Jewish diaspora and the resultant \\"connectedness\\" that came with it,<br />- the geographical positioning of Israel, the 'culture' of Israeli jews,<br />- war-related chance-based motivations,<br />- reverse Jewish brain-drain en masse and<br />- the never ending US-support of Israel (though, in the book, you hardly trace any mention of this tremendously important fact, which I believe, is a major bias of the book).<br /><br />There are, however, many other factors that you can take home regarding innovation and industrial policy, like:<br /><br />- The importance of talent & human resources,<br />- critical roles of cross-training, of<br />- venture capital financing,<br />- multidisciplinary approach to business problems,<br />- proximity of the elements of an ecosystem,<br />- of sense of community membership for the success of business clusters, and<br />- culture of risk-taking, failure-welcoming and 'chutzpah'.<br />- Also very important is the book's verification of the positive and critical role of government intervention in a country's entrepreneurial push and economic development.<br /><br />Those are very valuable aspects of the book.<br /><br />Moreover, the book is also very enlightening for those people like me who have very little knowledge about Israel and never interested in learning about that country's inner workings. Because, while you read with a focus to find clues regarding innovation and entrepreneurial policy, you learn the history, predicaments and some aspects of the inner workings of Israel's economic system. This, I personally found very interesting; kind of buy one, get one free.<br /><br />In a nutshell, even though this is a deliberate 'marketing' effort for Israel, it is still a very valuable book for those interested in industrial, entrepreneurial and innovation policy. It is, however, not at all a guide for company-specific innovation policies and certainly NOT a business-related book.o very important is the book's verification of the positive and critical role of government intervention in a country's entrepreneurial push and economic development.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever in this genre. I highly recommend it!!
B000NDEXOI|3.0|This is a pretty decent overview plus a couple rare tracks are nice, but where is \\"Wasted Time\\"?....which just happens to be my fav Skid Row track; and they even had a proper video for it back in the day. Also missing are a few other favs like \\"Firesign\\", \\"Eileen\\" (Subhuman Race), and \\"In A Darkened Room\\" (Slave To The Grind).  Even the song \\"Beggars Day\\" from the clean version of 'Slave To The Grind' would have been another great element to make this CD complete.     Would have taken Frozen, Beat Yourself Blind, and My Enemy off. I must have a weird idea of what their great songs were, because it's hard to believe my 2 fav songs from Subhuman Race, plus my all time favorite song by them are not even included here.
B0026P3G12|3.0|Not as good as we expected. We thought she would do better singing some of Barbara Streisand's songs. After I Dreamed a Dream she went downhill.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|I was pleased to receive my complete season 8 in a protected plastic cover. This definitely will help protect my product. I am still viewing the episodes and still just can't get enough. Great Show Overall!!

B001F12J48|1.0|We bought this for our kids thinking that watching it in 3-D would be AWESOME but were sorely disappointed. Barely any of the movie actually showed up as being 3-D. We darkened the room to see if that would help and we adjusted the contrast as suggested but it still didn't help. Thankfully, there was a regular version in the box as well so we stopped the 3-D one and popped in the original. Much better.    Do yourself a favor and stick to the non-3-D version!
B002HWUU1I|4.0|I like the album/CD, but it's not as memorable as \\"Once,\\" - a tough benchmark to equal.  I'd like to hear more written by Marketa Irglova.  My favorite song is \\"I have Loved You Wrong.\\"
B0002Y4T92|5.0|WHAT A FANTASTIC COLLECTION OF TALENT THE OLD AND THE NEW!!! TWO STAND OUT FOR ME WERE JONNY LANG AND STEVE VAI !!! I HAD NEVER SEEN THEM PERFORM BEFORE AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!! JUST TERRIFIC. WHAT A SHOW !!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Anyone who loves the Beatles (and even some new fans) will love this movie.  The actors are fantastic, the story is great, and of course the music is the best music ever written.  Without question, I would recommend this movie!  You can't see it just once, you have to buy it.
B00009P1O2|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS \\"WOW\\" FREDDIE MERCURY UNBELIVEABLE!! WHAT A SHOWMAN !!AND THE BAND FORGET ABOUT IT!!! TERRIFIC!!! AND THE STADUIM WAS ROCKING AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE BAND AND THE FANS WAS AWESOME!!!
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I purchased the Michael Jackson 25th Anniversary of Thriller (CD+DVD) used and received it in excellent condition.  It is a fantastic album that stands the test of time.  Not only do you get a CD, but also the DVD with some of Michael's best videos.  I would recommend this album, absolutely.
B000VR824S|5.0|I HAD BOUGHT THE 2004 VIDEO AND I HAD TO BUY THIS ONE TOO AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! BILL MURRAY WAS THE MC AND WAS SO FUNNY!!! BUT A WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE TWO HIGHLIGHTS WERE, JOHN MCLAUGHLIN AND JEFF BECK THESE TWO REALLY STOOD OUT FOR ME AWESOME!!!AGAIN WHAT A SHOW!!!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I needed these batteries for the fake tea lights I put inside my carved pumpkins and they work great.<br /><br />I turns out the same size fits in several other gadgets in the house so it's not a bad idea to get thia many.
031606792X|1.0|Half way through this book I stopped. I couldn't take it anymore.  The story just turned ridiculous. The naming of the baby, and the potential boy name! The baby storyline itself. Jacob imprinting. I just couldn't handle it.  Horrible horrible writing.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|this box  contains everything you would love to have from beatles!<br />nice nice nice
B002NWRMVS|4.0|On her previous effort, 2007's \\"Not Too Late\\" I complained that Ms. Jones was becoming narcoleptic with her music. I pleaded for Ms. Jones to try something new, and well, \\"The Fall\\" is what I received. Not quite the daring jump in originality or brave attempt in exploring new sounds, \\"The Fall\\" does have the distinction of being her best album since 2002's \\"Come Away With Me\\".<br /><br />Each track work seamlessly with the next. Each track is distinguishable from the rest. Still, she is stuck in snoozeville in places such as the nearly forgettable \\"Back To Manhattan\\" or the silly \\"Man Of The Hour\\". Elsewhere, the new elements lend a strength not heard before such as \\"Chasing Pirates\\", \\"Even Though\\" and \\"Young Blood\\". There are mellow tracks that do actually work here like \\"I Wouldn't Need You\\", \\"Waiting\\" and \\"December\\". The in-betweens like \\"Light As A Feather\\", \\"You've Ruined Me\\" and \\"Tell Yer Mama\\" add just enough padding to get you through the end. There are some rockers here (well, rockers for Norah Jones at least) such as \\"It's Gonna Be\\", \\"Tell Yer Mama\\" and even \\"Stuck\\" which showcase Ms. Jones' ability to do more than just jazz. The Amazon.com bonus track \\"Can't Stop\\" is worth of having been included on the actual physical release, but sadly is only available as a download here (which I did download).<br /><br />So, four stars because this is no \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Rumours\\", no \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" or \\"Nevermind\\", no \\"Violator\\" or \\"Achtung, Baby\\". What it is, is a strong performance from a still budding talent. At 30, Jones has room to still impress. As Ravi Shankar's daughter, she has the genes to explore more interesting musical territory. Will she?<br /><br />Here's my comparison of \\"The Fall\\" with Norah Jones other works:<br /><br />2002 Come Away With Me: Four Stars<br />2004 Feels Like Home: Three Stars<br />2007 Not Too Late: Three Stars<br />2009 The Fall: Four Stars
B00005JPSM|5.0|This show was one of my favorite..It is a great romance story, but what really is the best is there is not a lot of foul language and it is a great story. Most of the setting takes place in the kitchen so that puts it in a family setting to begin with. I watched it 3 times and probably will watch it again. The woman has problems of her own and ends up taking care of her niece. Her niece helps her to straighten out her life and the rest you have to watch for yourself..Buy this movie.....! I don't think you will regret it.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a kid. What I wasn't able to see then were all the extra features with this DVD. The featurettes, deleted scenes and alternate ending are great. I would highly recommend this DVD for the Christine enthusiast!!
B0026P3G12|3.0|From the first time I heard Susan Boyle sing on Britain's Got Talent I knew she would be a star and I wanted any album or song she would record. My problem is not with her voice, her voice is wonderful and refreshing to listen to. The choice of songs on this album is not what I would have hoped for and I was disappointed with most of the album. There were 3 songs that I really enjoyed. All the others were sung at such a very slow pace that frankly I couldn't wait for them to be over with. I was disappointed in the choice of what was put in the album as well as the slow pace in which they were all sung. Don't get me wrong, her voice and singing ability is outstanding but the songs that were chosen for this album leaves a lot to be desired.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|The movie is a classic.  Exceptional.  The first of the great scifis.  Enough already....  On to the important part of the review:  which version to get.  Kino is, without a doubt the best edition out there.  I've seen a few others and was extremely dissapointed.  The problem is that lots of scenes from the original print have been lost.  Many editions have not tried to keep the original complex storyline intact and so the entire beauty of the movie has been lost (to say nothing of the bad orchestral accompaniments and bad print qualities to go around!).<br /><br />Kino has a great soundtrack, wonderful print quality and is faithful to the original storyline.  so much so that when there is a missing scene, Kino puts up an intertitle to explain what was happening int he missing scene so that the original storyline still makes sense.<br /><br />Get this version or don't get any.  And, of course, enjoy!
0316096199|4.0|In the first five pages, Alice, a freshman in college at the time, is brutally raped. It's graphic, horrible and once I'd gone through with it her - I was in for the ride to find out what happens to a woman that might not have made it out alive that night.<br /><br />I'm not sure you can \\"enjoy\\" a true story about rape and dealing with it's aftermath - but, this is a page-turning read that hurled me into her nightmare and subsequent struggle for inner understanding and justice. And, it left me thinking about it long after I was through.<br /><br />Here's the upsides and downsides to me depending on what you prefer:<br />- Candid writing, that's not a pity-party<br />Sebold's direct style and candid look at this time in her life, combined with her writing skills are what drew me in. At the same time, she's not overly emotional or hysterical about it (even during describing her rape).  She simply recounts it. I can't imagine that any woman wouldn't be simultaneously drawn into it and repelled by the thought of her experiences happening to them.<br /><br />- It's not [[ASIN:0316001821 The Lovely Bones: Deluxe Edition]]<br />If you're a fan of her other book, and expecting that same kind of optimism in this one, you're just not going to like it as much. This is, afterall, a linear account of a real life horrific crime with a living victim  - not the fictionalized version.<br /><br />- You might not agree with all of her choices, but it's still a story of tragedy and triumph.<br />Some of the negative reviewers seem to dislike her choices and behaviour at times. Because her tale gripped me, it did make me think or hope sometimes that I would handle things differently.  But, the fact that she's so candid about her thoughts and actions when she was just a young college kid - is what makes this one unique.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Engrossing, direct, not overly emotional, roller coaster of a ride through another woman's tragedy and aftermath.  Definitely worth a read.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love hearing her sing and love to see someone who is unknown do well.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I suspected this might be bad based on lots of buzz, but it would have to be a lot better just to make it to bad. Certainly there are many low budget bad movies out there, made with unskilled actors and directors, that are worse than this, but for a major motion picture, this movie is in rarified company. This belongs up there with Glitter, Gigli, Showgirls, Ishtar, Any Madonna Movie, Sheena, Godzilla, Popeye, well I think you get the idea.    But don't trust me. The greatest movie review ever made, is about this movie. I'm not joking. It is seriously the greatest movie review ever.  It is 70 minutes long and can be found in installments on Youtube. Just search for:     \\"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Review (Part 1 of 7)\\", by RedLetterMedia.     It will explain in painstaking, intelligent, and hilarious detail why this movie is junk.    By the way, there are other very good reviews on Youtube that also intelligently dissect this lame movie. Search them out and view all of them. You will have a much more enjoyable time watching the critical reviews of this movie than the movie itself.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|If you enjoy vampire, supernatural amd romance genre, then this series is for you.  TruBlood loosely follows author Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse series of SciFi/romance novels and does it well.  The casting for the series is excellent with the actors fulfilling the temperments of the characters, and often as not the physical characteristics, also.  The plot lines differ to some extent but are still as anjoyable as the books and plausible within the story setting.  After awhile, one would not be surprised to read in the news that vampires have come out and are living in Bon Temps, LA.  This definitely is not intended for a younger and sensitive audience.  But if you are in the mood for horror and SciFi with a sexy attitude, sit back, kick up your feet, grab a bottle of TruBlood (yes, it is avaiable on the internet) and enjoy!
B002MW50KO|5.0|My wife and I listen to this album over and over again. As much as I'm a fan of Bob's, I cannot say the same about 'Together Through Life,' and 'Modern Times.' In 'Christmas In the Heart,' Bob Dylan, switching direction, has tapped a fountain of freshness that, once again, has renewed his heart. It becomes obvious as you care to listen, that this music is what Dylan has been all about in one way or another for some time. The acoustic and vocal arrangements are world class top-notch. Dylan is at the top of his game on an album one might think was a little side project. The warmth of each of these songs is remarkable, and each is so beautiful that I want to listen to every word. When is the last time I felt that way about Christmas music? Furthermore, this album has put me in the mood to get out my other Christmas music
0887308589|3.0|Any Dilbert book is great but this was supposed to be a new book and interior pages were stained. I had to ship it out in a gift box so I didn't have time to return it or get an exchange.
B0026P3G12|5.0|THE MOST ENJOYABLE CD I HAVE.  I LOVE SUSAN, LOVER HER STORY AND SHE BRIGHTENS MY DAYS AGAIN I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT ALONE WHEN SHE SINGS AWAY MY DAY.  JUST AN OVERALL JOY.  THE CD WAS HERE THE DAY AFTER IT WAS RELEASED.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|write a review. write ten reviews. don't write a plot synopsis. i was profoundly affected by this short story when i first read it [when i was ten] because each plot twist was a surprise. if your review includes a detailed description of the story, you are robbing people of the chance to experience it themselves. that is all
B002FID3M2|5.0|The book was in wonderful shape, just as stated.  I had read it before, but wanted my own copy.  I had not realized that this was a true story
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|Next has an intriguing premise of a man who can see two minutes into the future and the FBI agents seeking out his abilities to foil a terrorist plot to blow up a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles, but as other reviewers have pointed out, there are a few plot holes that would've made this a better movie. Who are the terrorists, why are they blowing a nuclear bomb up in LA ? Without this information, all we have is Nicolas Cage and Julliane Moore running around chasing terrorists because these are bad people.     As a big Jessica Biel fan, I have to ask what exactly she was doing in this film other than nearly being blown up by terrorists and having a quickie romance with Nicholas Cage...within the course of a couple of days. It felt like she was just kind of the generic good looking woman that could've been played by any number of actresses. Julliane Moore really brings it though as the hard nosed FBI agent desperate to stop terrorists from wiping out most of LA.     That being said, Next has a lot of action packed into 96 minutes, so if your a fan of fast paced action and can make it beyond the delayed setup, than this movie may be just for you. I'm not sure if I would drop sixteen bucks on this, maybe find it in a $10 dollar bin at Walmart or something.
B002P5XXR0|1.0|Would that it were. At least the sources would be something new for Horner. But instead we get everything from his bag of tricks, plus things from other composers' bags, too. I expected to hear a kitchen sink being hit with a baseball bat at some point (and got it halfway through the cue entitled \\"War\\"). Horner's talents are basically those of timing/pacing and orchestration/sound design -- the music is, in this case, so much collected garbage, it's not even worth pointing out the endless regress of sources, but he has succeeded in what he's best at (at least the latter; I haven't heard it in the film), providing deceptively effortless, transparent textures that often consist of extremely complex layerings. It's an extension of being able to \\"feel\\" across the sonic space of an orchestra - how certain timbres push forward, pull backward, sometimes support and sometimes \\"mask\\" others, etc., and how all this can be worked to develop the dynamic \\"world\\" of the music in terms of not just its themes and motives and harmonic architecture, but its sonic environment - in this case, applied to bring all manner of other exotic and synthetic sounds coherently into the mix, not just as occasional sweeteners or decoration but fully integrated; a feat, in other words, to accomplish this without it all sounding like wallpaper, deadened and two dimensional. But this is a starting point, not an end in itself -- just a good square one. Where's the beef? Nowhere in earshot, unfortunately. And Enya and Zimmer (and Prokofiev's and Rachmaninoff's estates) should probably consider lawsuits, considering how much business Horner's about to do using their work under his name.

B002GHHHPQ|5.0|This WWII film is based on the true story of the Memphis Belle, a B-17 bomber and crew based in England and flying daylight (the most dangerous) bombing raids over Western Europe. They have flown 24 successful missions and one more and they'll be done and able to go home. They would be the first crew in the Eighth Air Force to finish all 25. The fatality rate of these daylight missions is so high as to almost be considered suicidal. Over 200,000 men were killed in air battles over Western Europe during WWII. Because of their size and flying relatively low over targets, they were especially vulnerable to being shot down. The bombs were dropped by visually sighting the target and dropping the bombs. Needless to say, there was a great deal of 'imprecision' in hitting their targets. If the lead plane was off target, the rest of planes following their lead would be wrong, also. In the film, we see how seriously this particular pilot took the commitment to hit military targets and avoid civilians, although that wasn't always the case (they're all Nazis as one crew member screamed in defiance). They Army and Look magazine have already lined up a 'victory tour' around the U.S. to promote the war once they finish their 25th mission. But have they jumped the gun? They draw the Bremen, Germany assignment, one of the most dangerous. Once the plane takes off on their final mission, you are drawn into this drama and it won't let you go. The film is also punctuated with some archival footage of aerial combat. Take the time to watch the heroics of these crews who put their lives on the line every mission and changed the course of WWII and, ultimately, world history.
0061719544|5.0|Unlike some other autobiographies that seem to want the reader to feel sorry for them... they had a tough life, went to rehab, had multiple breakups, etc. etc. Craig takes you along to \\"ride shotgun\\" through both his triumphs and more trying times. Even amid his challenging experiences, the book retains a positive feeling. At times you'll laugh out loud, at others you'll wonder why some people put up with his ways. It's fast paced, never boring and realistic. Afterwards you may find yourself asking \\"How the hell is this guy not only still alive, but actually successful?\\"

When I went to my local book store to get the REAL ISBN # so I could find the correct copy I just went ahead and purchased the book from my local book store....bypassing Amazon altogether.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|In a Pulp Fiction deleted scene Mia asks Vincent if he's an Elvis or Beatles man. The idea is that while you can enjoy both bands, you're always going to be bigger fan of one than you are of the other. I find this to be a true assessment (and this will probably not be the last time I use this reference), and explains the way I feel about Star Trek and Star Wars. I have always been a bigger fan of Star Wars, although this is kind of a faulty assessment considering that Star Wars is more fantasy, and Star Trek is more science fiction. Having said that, I had no intention of seeing Star Trek when it was first announced. That was before I heard that TV mogul JJ Abrams (Lost, Alias, Fringe, etc.) was going to be directing the film. Only his second feature film as director, JJ Abrams cut his teeth by making the best film in the Mission Impossible franchise (Mission Impossible III) and was then handed the keys to one of the biggest and most loved TV/ Movie franchises in history. So how does a TV mogul do when given a franchise of this magnitude to reboot?     After the destruction of their home planet, a group of Romulans on a mining ship led by Nero (Eric Bana) travels back in time through a black hole to the year 2233 while following Spock (Leonard Nimoy). In the ensuing confrontation Nero destroys USS Kelvin, which also kills George Kirk, James T. Kirk's father, forever altering the Star Trek timeline. The movie chronicles the rise of Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), and how Spock (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), and the rest of the USS Enterprise crew come together.     With Mission Impossible III, JJ Abrams might have created the best film in the franchise, but you could still tell that he stuck in the world of the hour long TV drama. While amazing, Mission still felt almost like it would be more at home on the small screen rather than on the big screen. With Star Trek you never get that feeling. Abrams builds a world that feels lived in,while using a somewhat shaky cam, not nearly as shaky as Cloverfield which he produced, but shaky in a way that makes you feel as though you are there with the crew as you watch it.    Writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (Mission Impossible III, Transformer 1 and 2, Legend of Zorro, etc.) also create the best feature screenplay of their careers. Taking cues from back Star Trek stories to add in an effort to give references to past Trek stories. They also build fully realized characters from off the page rather than just expecting the characters to build them themselves like they've done in past screenplays (here's looking at you Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen).    The truth is, this all wouldn't be effective without the proper people to play the roles. I honestly thought it was impossible to replace the original actors, was I wrong! Chris Pine (taking his cues from Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones rather than from William Shatner's portrayal of James T. Kirk) shines as Kirk, making him rebellious, brilliant, and fun. Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings) creates a Bones that is hard, hilarious, and funny. Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) is hilarious as always. But, besides Chris Pine, the real star here is Zachary Quinto (Heroes). Zachary Quinto really shines showing the turmoil brewing beneath the logical exterior of Spock. We really feel his issues of coming to terms with being half human/ half Vulcan while also dealing with his romanticism towards Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and being bested in the program he created, the Kobayashi Maru, by James T. Kirk.    If there is an issue, it would be the action. Don't get me wrong, the action was shot amazingly, but for fans of the franchise (all you Trekkers out there) it might be a bit too much. It feels like Star Wars in a Star Trek wrapping, which is great for new viewers, but might alienate old viewers of the franchise. Also in recent years, when going up against villains like Joker from The Dark Knight and Anton Chigurh fromNo Country From Old Men, Nero from Star Trek really feels, well, kinda weak. But, as a reboot, the movie had more responsibility to build existing characters than new characters that won't last beyond this \\"episode\\" in the series. Also, there's been a lot of talk of \\"plot holes\\". I honestly take no stock in the \\"holes\\" left in the story as I feel most of these are from die hard Trek fans, and I can explain them away with simple explanations. There are several moments that seem to come out of nowhere (i.e. James T. Kirk running into Spock randomly on a space planet after being exiled from the USS Enterprise) but these are moments that naturally happen in science fiction, and fantasy, as a rule to a certain extent.    All in all I would highly recommend this addition to the Star Trek series and this part has also gotten me interested in the rest of the series. Who knows, maybe as other parts of this series come on DVD I will review them here. Until then, definitely give this a try, it was, by far, one of the most entertaining films of 2009!     5/5

B002T9H2MO|5.0|Duncan Jones, director and co-writer of Moon, has a lot to live up to. His father is legendary glam rocker and consummate performer David Bowie. While not exactly following in the footsteps of his old man, when you're the heir of such talent and originality a lot is expected of you. Add to that the weight of making a movie that nearly completely surrounds one actor, and the chips don't exactly seem stacked in your favor. Duncan Jones, though, handles the pressure admirable and creates a modern sci-fi masterpiece.     Astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) has been on the moon for nearly three years harvesting Helium 3 to send back to Earth to help solve the energy crisis, alone except for the moon base's computer GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), and unable to make live transmissions to earth due to a faulty satellite. Nearing the end of his service, and preparing to return home, Sam gets into an accident with a Moon Rover when he goes out to fix a harvester. After being treated, Sam goes to check on possible meteor damage, but things start to go awry when Sam finds a crashed Moon Rover with a barely living Sam in it.     As I've stated before, in my opinion science fiction is at it's best when it's trying to relate to the world around us. Duncan Jones, and first time screenwriter Nathan Park, create a believable future in which an energy crisis on earth dictates the need for another energy source off planet. In so doing, the premise leads to an indictment of the corporate world's lack of sanctity in human life. The screenplay is masterfully written, creating real characters that you feel for, in a very real world.    Among what really makes this film pop is the visual style and the special effects. Duncan realized the Moon base in a visual style reminiscent of the Nostromo in Alien, giving us something to latch on to in science fiction. Also adding to the realism, just like in Alien, is that fact that we're not seeing an amazingly clean, bright future, but a real, and somewhat gritty future. For a film made on the cheap during the writers strike over a period of only 33 days, the special effects look more real than most of big blockbusters that have come out this past summer. One of the reasons for this is because rather than use CGI to render the outside scenes and special effect, Jones chose to use miniatures and visual effects lending more realism to scenes that could have possibly looked cartoonish and taken away from the gritty dramatic feel of the rest of the film.    What really shines through in this film though is the acting. Sam Rockwell is a real tour de force playing two sides of the same coin. Playing the Sam who has been on the Moon he plays a calmer more plaintive version of Sam, and in playing the new Sam to arrive on the Moon base Rockwell plays him as an arrogant hothead. Never at any point do we get the feeling that these two characters are talking to air, or that they aren't in the same room, Rockwell's interactions with himself always feel genuine and believable, which is hard to attain, especially when practically the whole movie requires him to act against an actor who isn't there.    This is one of the rare films I don't have anything bad to say about. I highly recommend this film if you like science fiction, but unlike most sci-fi that comes out nowadays, this isn't an action packed extravaganza. This is a great character study with subtext that you can grab hold of. But even more than that, it's a very entertaining ride!    5/5
B00275EGWY|5.0|This film focuses on just enough realism for civilians to absorb, and enough realism for Marines to recognise as not just another phoney Hollywood glossy about what really goes on in Iraq.  What is interesting is to watch it with a Marine who has served in Iraq and listen to their comments about what they see.  This film is similar to the film in the UK, a short series about bomb-defusing units during WWII in London:  obviously it had a short series in that over the respective weeks, each of the primary actors in the unit meet their doom in one way or another, showing how serious defusing bombs was in the mid-40's.  Incredibly dangerous work.  Without giving away the ending, which is a surprise ending, it hones in on the reality and unique results of this MOS.  Each of these individuals (not sure females are permitted into this MOS, or that might have changed by now) are Purple Heart Heroes, bar none.
B001S86J0I|4.0|A little disclaimer: I held a little prejudice going into this movie; I do not like Tim Allen as a general rule. When this movie came out, I have to say that I wasn't interested at all. I wasn't into Star Trek, which this movie largely riffs on, and the movie looked cheesy from the initial trailers I saw. Add to that the fact that Tim Allen received top billing, and you might as well count the movie down for the count with me. But after hearing great word of mouth and seeing great reviews, I decided to put aside my prejudices when the blu-ray of the film was released recently.     Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) are the crew of a now defunct 80's sci-fi television show called Galaxy Quest. Relegated to appearances at fan conferences and the like, answering inane questions about the show, and repeating lines from the show they wish people would forget (\\"By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons of Worvan, you shall be avenged...\\") everyone is dealing with the fact that they are washed up has-beens living in the past and ready to throw in the towel. Just as their life seems meaningless a race of aliens asks for their help, thinking they are a real ship's crew, and the show is their \\"historical documents.\\"     I definitely made the right choice in finally giving the movie a try. Like recent \\"spoof\\" movies like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Galaxy Quest mixes reverance and spoof with great characterizations and an amazing plot to create a hilarious and fun riff of the sci-fi genre. Written by David Howard and directed by Dean Parisot, Galaxy Quest utilizes homages to movies and TV series from Star Trek to Star Wars to get the feeling of real sci-fi films, knowing when, and when not, to take itself seriously. Not only does this help to amp up the comedy, but it also gives us characters we can believe when they're thrown into extraordinary situations.    The casting is phenomenal, making for a diverse, funny, and well acted movie. The true stand outs in the film are Alan Rickman as a thespian who used to actually be a respected actor, but is now stuck spewing ridiculous catch phrases for fanboys and being upstaged by the Shatneresque Jason Nesmith; and Sam Rockwell as Guy Fleegman, a throwaway former cast member who died on his only episode of the show that is consistently worried throughout the movie that he's going to die in real life because he died on the show. Naturally, though, the whole cast is stunning, as could be noted by the pedigree of acting included here.    If I had one quibble with the movie, though, it would have to be the way the alien race is portrayed. I know they're not even humanoid creatures, but when they take the appearance of being human they could have been a little more natural, and not as stiff, or, dare I say it, annoying. They get better throughout the course of the movie, but they are still more or less caricatures throughout the movie and should have been just a little more fleshed out.    All in all I have to say that the film was extremely enjoyable, and I highly recommend it. If you enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, or well done comedy spoofs, you're almost guaranteed to enjoy this movie.    4.5/5

B002VPE1AM|5.0|Initially concieved in 1999 as Cameron's follow up to Titanic, Avatar was put on hold when Cameron realized the technology did not exist yet to support his vision. Over the course of the next decade, Cameron created much of the technology he needed to make this movie possible. In 2002, Cameron watched The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and through the character of Gollum realized that his vision was finally possible. Twelve years have passed since the release of James Cameron's Titanic, will his new film prove that Cameron is still \\"King of the World\\"?    Much has been made of Cameron's Avatar long before it's release. Hailed as a revolution in 3D and CGI technology, Avatar holds a lot of expectations, not the least of which is the fact that the budget and marketing for this film add up to approximately half a billion dollars, making it the most expensive movie ever made. Of course, Cameron has been here before. Titanic cost $200 million to make, the largest budget for a feature film at the time, and just when it looked like it was going to goose that laid the rotten egg it proceeded to make $1.8 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing film of all time. Cameron's also not new to the idea of revolutionizing the world of film with almost every movie he makes: with The Abyss he had the first all digital water effect, with Terminator 2 he had the first CGI character with realistic movement, and so on. Can lightning strike yet again?    I'm generally someone who's adverse to using all caps for anything, but: DO NOT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!! Also don't wait for it to come to DVD or to a TV station near you. Why, you ask? Because this movie is a movie that has to be seen the way it was intended to truly get the fully immersive experience. I watched the trailers on TV and online, and none of that compared to seeing the film in theaters in 3D. With Avatar, Cameron has truly outdone himself. When District 9 came out, I raved about the CGI effects in that movie, but Avatar is a whole other monster. With Avatar you truly cannot tell where the CGI begins and reality ends and vice versa, and on top of that it is the most beautiful film I've ever seen, CGI or otherwise. On top of that, Cameron's new 3D cameras create an experience that is in no way uncomfortable. No headaches and no motion sickness for those of you who suffer from that sort of thing. Instead, you get a highly immersive experience that leaves you begging for more (which is saying something, considering the film's run time is 162 minutes) and wanting to return when you leave.    I've seen a lot of reviews lately that talk about the film having a weak script with too many cliches and one dimensional characters. What you really get, in my opinion though, is old school story telling with a message, even though the message is drowned out in special effects and action. The script moves quickly, there is no downtime, but you also never feel like the pacing is off, or that it's moving too fast. Cameron has built a complete world, we don't just see characters and action, but we see complete eco systems, and are introduced to many characters. While the entire cast is amazing, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully and Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch are the real standouts here. Sam Worthington creates a character that you feel for, and through his progress from pawn to leader is truly believable and heartfelt. Stephen Lang, on the other hand, gives us a character that starts off just trying to do his duty, but eventually becomes a character on par with Sergeant Barnes from Platoon or Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now.    I purposefully chose not to mention anything about the plot for this movie. I think this movie is going to be the revolution of movies that Cameron believes it's going to be. I've seen reviewers compare it to The Wizard of Oz (the movie to truly lead the color revolution) and King Kong (the 1933 version, which revolutionized special effects), and I wholeheartedly agree. I still can't completely fathom what I just saw, and will probably see it at least one more time on the big screen if not more. Anyone who's into film, the tech of film, or just wants to keep up with where film is going in the future should see this film. On top of that, this movie touches on so many different genres (SciFi, fantasy, romance, war films, drama, etc.) that it will appeal to almost everyone. Once again, James Cameron is \\"King of the World\\"!    5/5
031606792X|4.0|The only possible put down I can find in this book is the change in first person perspective in the BOOK TWO area where Belle is giving birth to her baby. If you're one who like me has heard that book 3 was mostly focus on the were wolf story line than Belle and Edward and wish to skip book 3 you find start of book 4 Breaking Dawn has the feel of picking up where the end of book 2 New Moon left off.   I loved the family helping Belle get ready for the wedding and how her parents knowing they'd be no changing Belle's mind about the marriage made the best of it.  Both the wedding and honeymoon really draw me in.  How Belle becomes a vampire was different than any human turn transformation I read before and was done with great descriptive details.   It was also great at everyone reaction to Belle as a new born having such control over her vampire self.  The way the normal lost of control of a new born vampire is made in this book remind me of a similar decription in Mary Davidson's Undead series.  Two thumbs way up for this book for vampire romance fans.
0743297334|1.0|I got up to around page 60 and gave up.  I simply don't understand what all of the to do is about.  I found this simply boring.  But not to give up on Hemingway I will also try For Whom the Bell Tolls and see how that fares.
0553381687|5.0|I just finished reading and I must say that together with Lord of the Rings it's my favorite fantasy book so far. It starts slowly and takes time for the action to come but once it comes you won't feel disappointed. By the 2nd half of the book I was not able to put the it away. I'm so glad I also bought 'A Clash of Kings' before so I can start reading right away :D.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|So many movies promise much in the trailer and then fall flat in the theater.  Avatar is one of the rare cases where no trailer can match the thrill of the film itself.  I've written many customer reviews for Amazon but rarely award five stars.  With Avatar, I did not hesitate to give it the top rating.  It has all of the following in large measures: fully captivating storytelling, amazing visuals, excellent voice acting for the animated portions, and even such things as the score and credits worked really well.  And none of that even touches on the breakthrough technologies we've all heard about in the pre-release hype.  I saw the movie in 3D, and I certainly encourage everyone to do the same.  Often modern 3D movies don't really seem to take full advantage of the possibilities of the form.  Avatar has an unprecedented number of scenes with breathtaking 3D views.  Then there's the brilliant creativity and imagination at work in designing the world of Pandora itself.  The color palette used for the flora and fauna is simply beautiful to behold, and so many of the creatures are just way cool, especially the flying ones.  On the quality of animation, it's not perfect.  I have yet to see any CGI that's 100 percent believable where things like facial expressions are happening, but Avatar comes very close.  As CGI characters engaged in conversation, I was not distracted by the fact that I was watching CGI vs. live action.  And I had fun comparing the avatars' facial features to the live actors/characters they were based on (Sigourney Weaver's, for instance).  in all, I haven't enjoyed a movie-going experience this much in a long time!
0446698342|5.0|A wonderful heartwarming story. This one will be passed around friends and family until well-worn! Just another of Nicholas Sparks good books.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I saw it on the big screen and have impatiently waited to buy it for my home library.  Outstanding science-fiction.
B002MRRRAA|5.0|Amazing show, sonically great... agree the cut shots are a bit much if just sitting and watching.  Playing in the background while working is perfect though.<br /><br />Highly recommend for any true Nirvana fan.
B0019LY5IM|3.0|I love how Lost fans have been cheated out of quite a few bonus features for season 5, only because we don't have the latest and greatest blu-ray equipment.  Year after year, we have purchased these expensive DVDs, and our loyalty is rewarded with a slight. Not to mention the dwindling number of episodes.  But that is another story.  I love the series, but this was a low-blow.  Hopefully next year, they will learn to respect ALL the fans that made them the success they are today.
B001PR0YDA|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers that the animation was outstanding. The level of detail and the visual effects were simply amazing. Concerning the 3-D effects, I would say that they made the movie dimensional, but there were not many of those \\"coming right at you\\" types of effects. Rather the 3-D added a higher level of realism to the movie. The only 3-D effect that seemed to come right out of the screen was the snow, and this was happening throughout a large portion of the movie. I found it distracting after a while.<br /><br />I do agree that this movie is clearly not for children. It was almost always dreary and dark, and children would find it scary. In addition, something I haven't seen mentioned is that the dialogue is written as if this were an English period movie. I have to admit there were times I couldn't grasp what was being said, and this usually isn't a problem for me. My wife who loves period movies also had the same problem. I think children would get very lost quickly.<br /><br />We're big fans of Jim Carrey. Carey's so unique and so talented, and he did a great job. However if you're expecting anything funny because he's playing the lead, remember that this movie does not have comedy.<br /><br />Despite all of the things that are great about this movie, frankly I got bored (Please don't batter me because I'm sharing my opinion. I realize a lot of people will justifiably love this movie, but there will be others who are similar to me and will want to know what to expect).<br /><br />My favorite version of A Christmas Carol is Scrooged with Bill Murray. It was funny, entertaining, edgy, creative and so engaging. It got the message across, and I enjoyed the humor. This movie version was quite the opposite: Dark, serious, scary enough to potentially disturb children, and dreary. Of course there's nothing wrong with this, but it just didn't appeal to me, or hold my attention.<br /><br />Regardless, the story has a wonderful message, and this movie is fantastically crafted. Many people will justifiably love it.will justifiably love it.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I had not seen this for a few years and saw it was such a great deal here I picked it up.<br /><br />It is so well done. Even though the Muppets are at times funny they tell the Christmas Carol story with such love. The songs are truly touching. Real people play many of the parts also, it is a nice balance.<br /><br />The 3 ghosts are done fantastic, I love the ghost of Christmas Past she is like a white lacy fairy. What she has to show of course is not always good and the pain on her face brings a tear to the eye.<br /><br />I watched both versions back to back. you get the full screen extended version and the wide screen theatre version.<br /><br />This is a classic that belongs in every Christmas library.
B002MW50KO|1.0|I've listened to this three times now, and I'm still scratching my head asking ''why?\\" Never the prettiest voice, Dylan now sounds like Louis Armstrong with a cold. The polka (!) 'Must Be Santa' is kind of fun, but is unfortunately the best thing on this poorly produced disc. Am I being too hard on the RnR Hall of Fame legend? Well let's just say: I can't think for you-you'll just have to decide. *
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I loved Supernatural and these discs are a way to catch up with all the episodes I haven't seen
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|I like this CD better than her last one, but for some reason this cd as well as the last one are not the best imo. I like her first two cds better and it seems she will never be able to top those.  I fell in love with her music because of her musical abilitywith the piano.  I think she has ran away from that musically and concentrated soley on producer beats.
B001QOGY9K|4.0|Note: The following is a review of the movie (and not of the DVD - the review will be updated upon the DVD release in future):<br />My husband and I took our almost 5-year-old daughter to watch \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" this afternoon, and we all loved it! It was heartening to see Disney go back to old-school 2D animation which gave us some of the most memorable animated classics. As to whether \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" will become a classic remains to be seen, but it certainly is getting my vote. It's refreshing to finally see an African-American being the lead character in a Disney production (we had an Asian lead in \\"Mulan\\" and a Native American in \\"Pocahontas\\", so it's high time we had an African American in a leading role here). The way these characters are animated in this movie shows a great level of attention to detail, especially in depicting the facial features, the mannerisms, etc. The vibrant and throbbing culture of French Quarter New Orleans is gloriously depicted in a rainbow of colors that mesmerize and dazzle - the sights, sounds, food, etc.<br /><br />Set in 1920s New Orleans, the story follows the adventures (well, misadventures really) of Tiana (voiced by the lovely Anika Noni Rose) who as a child learns to love cooking, nurtured by her own gifted father (Terrence Howard). Her father dies and Tiana is raised by her seamstress mother (Oprah Winfrey). She grows up into a lovely young lady, working two jobs to save money in pursuit of her dream of opening a restaurant, just as her late father had envisioned. To cut a long story short, Tiana finds herself transformed into a frog, when she kisses a frog (who is actually a Prince). Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) is a victim of voodoo magic by the infamous and evil Shadowman, Dr. Facilier (Keith David), and together the pair undertake a desperate quest through the beautiful yet treacherous Louisiana Bayou, hoping to find something or someone that might change them back to their human forms. They are aided in their quest by a benign and musically gifted gator, Louis the jazz trumpeter (Micheal-Leon Wooley) and an aging Cajun firefly, Ray (Jim Cummings). There are plenty of twists and turns here to keep the adults entertained and enough visual eye candy to satisfy both the kids and adults. The songs (score is by Randy Newman) are catchy and entertaining, though I don't see them becoming real classics.<br /><br />Tiana is a strong personality - determined, feisty, independent, and ambitious which is quite refreshing from some of the older Disney princesses that were more stereotypical in their characterizations.She makes a great role model for young girls. However, I did feel kind of let down when the story reverts to the traditional princess and prince live happily ever after formula, which seems staged for commercialization purposes (got to have that Disney princess doll, mom!). There are also some scenes which depict the more gruesome aspects of voodoo that might scare young children (black, almost demonic looking shadows menacing the innocent). Parents of the under-5s may want to take note of this. For this reason, I have taken one star off. But, on the whole, this is quite a breath of fresh air in the Disney princess stories, and hopefully signals more creative and unique stories (with equally unique and strong female leads) to follow.r quest by a benign and musically gifted gator, Louis the jazz trumpeter (Micheal-Leon Wooley) and an aging Cajun firefly, Ray (Jim Cummings).

B000OPOAJS|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and finally saw a good price on Blue-Ray and AZ so I picked it up.  The Blue_Ray quality is very good but does not blow you away. So, I would say If you have a good DVD version, you may not need the Blue-Ray.    Now on to the movie: Every time I see this movie I am amazed at the car scenes. How did they film this on location Paris, Nice without killing anyone (maybe they did and I just don't know about it)?  The direction and how the cameras do not jitter at high speeds are amazing. It never looks like any of this was shot at slow speeds and then had the film sped up.    While, some might say the plot is contrived, I disagree.  I thought the plot was very good and engaging.  It created interest in all the characters early on and throughout the movie.    But if you like car chase scenes, you need this movie in your collection with Bullitt, 7 ups, Vanishing Point, French Connection, Bourne Indentity. I'm sure I'm missing some, just Google the rest.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I had to give this 5 stars to counterbalance those who liked it but still gave it 3 stars. Three stars may be respectable - a \\"gentleman's C\\", but to someone glancing at the star rating, 3 stars means \\"walk on by\\". For anyone open to it, and willing to give it more than one or two listens, this album is likely to become a classic. That's not to say that everyone will like it. Not everyone likes Louis Armstrong (though the number of people who appreciate his vocals has grown exponentially over the years; his voice was roundly dismissed at the time). Nor does everyone appreciate Tom Waits. The comparison of those two vocalists to Dylan's current voice is apt. Furthermore, the arrangements on this cd are impeccable. Dylan's (yes!) scratchy voice provides a touching counterpoint to the sweet (but not saccharine) arrangements and classy background vocals.
159448385X|5.0|If you loved  Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner, you will also love A Thousand Splendid Suns.  This is another dark tale written in the same excellent style as The Kite Runner, sprinkled with historical facts which paints a realistic picture of what life could have been like for the women who struggled to survive a life ruled by men, and filled with tragedy and war.  The novel spans thirty years of Afghanistan's history from the Soviet Union invasion through the reign of the Taliban and to the post-Taliban efforts to rebuild.  This riveting tale revolves around two women whose lives became intertwined through unhappy circumstances that cause their lives to begin unraveling out of their own control.  Finding themselves forced to obey the whims of an abusive husband, the story tells of the harsh realities of  life for Afghani women, dreams lost, lives ruined, small joys, and hopes for a better tomorrow.  A Thousand Splendid Suns, is truly one of my all  time favorite books.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan and like their music you will want to have this. It contains all the albums (CD/DVD format) from the first to the last album.     The box set is well constructed and each cd is put together with photos, liner notes and there is an additional cd containing the singles that the Beatles released.    From the early days, with the two to three part vocals, the distictive styles and opening of songs; to the gradual musical changes the group made during their time together, this box set is outstanding. You don't realize how great their music is until you listen to the entire history of their music.    The sound quality is also outstanding and you hear sounds and sometimes background that has not been heard before.    This box set is well worth the price and will provide years of listening entertainment for you.    Jon Green.

B000002UAU|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />I appreciate \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" as a landmark achievement in pop music.  At it's best, it does deserve to be mentioned as one of the best rock albums put together.  However, on balance, I take exception to the claim that it's the best Beatles album ever.  It's not quite as flexible as \\"Rubber Soul\\"  or \\"Abbey Road,\\" both of which have more variance in their styles.  Admittedly, I appreciate the Beatles more for their high level of pop craftsmanship than for their Eastern-tinged songwriting.  Among my favorites on this disc are \\"Getting Better,\\" \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,\\" and the extremely creative title track. \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" is reminiscent of Sinatra, of all people and is also a fine addition to the album.  This is a very good Beatles disc and is interesting as a solid conceptual album but in my opinion \\"Abbey Road\\" is the ultimate artistic masterwork of the Fab Four.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|James Cameron's Avatar is an amazing accomplishment.  He has taken animation and the action movie genre to a new level.  The plot is something of a \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" in space.  It's predictable at times, but not unrealistic.  Corporations are mowing down the Rain Forest and the U.S. government kicked out the Native Americans in real life.  This movie just dramatizes these historical themes from the perspective of the natives along with a visitor from the would-be conqueror's side who falls in love with the culture and with a beautiful girl, why not!  The movie is visually spectacular, astonishing really in how real this Real 3D technological makes this world seem.  The main characters are well cast and their performances are quite good, with Zoe Saldana stealing the show.  The action sequences are so fast that your eyes can't leave the screen, and I found the story tugging at my emotions just a little.  There are plenty of surprises to keep you guessing on the final outcome.  The movie runs nearly three hours, but I only glanced at my watch because I wondered how long I'd have to wait to use the rest room.  The James Horner score is competent, as his always are.  This is the movie to see this year, and it's the best reason to actually see a movie in a theater this decade.  Enjoy!

I can see why some have negatively criticized the CD.  The sets, the colors, the whole ambiance--this is a performance that has to be seen to be fully appreciated.  The Lord's Prayer with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is otherworldly and takes your breath away.  A treat for adults and children alike.  The love just flows here.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Loved watching this series.  Didn't have HBO at the time, but we borrowed the series from a friend.  The detail is phenomenal, and (from a girl's perspective), the story line (i.e. military language, etc) was easy to follow.  If you love historical documentaries, this is for you.  I ended up ordering the series for my grandfather for Christmas!!
B0017I1FP8|5.0|This was easily the best movie score I heard all year in 2008.<br /><br />The theme stays nice and tight during the entire score and the parts that involve The Joker have this sharp, kinetic vibe to them where in the other (Batman) parts it stays dark and heavy.<br />It resembles the Batman Begins score enough to be familiar but not enough to be a rehash .... and thats why I like it so much.<br /><br />There isn't much more that I can add to what has already been said ... but to say ...<br />Yeah ... its really that good.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|O.K. let me first start by saying I HAVE READ THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS MULTIPLE TIMES!!! For those people who want to diss the movie for not following the book exactly, lighten up. I doubt you would be able to do any better. This movie was already long. With any more added scences the movie could become TOO long, and people need to understnad that its incredibly unrealistic to think movie producers will follow every step and chapter in the book. If viewers would just watch the movie without all those prejuduces they might actually see what great movies they are and be able to enjoy them!     O.K., this movie was very well produced. It made me laugh, cry, and captivated me throughout. The actors truly shone in this movie!! I would recommend that viewers watch the preceding movies first, to truly capture the whole gist of the plot. So, for those people who left not-so-good comments..... If these movies were meant to be watched out of order the Half blood prince wouldnt be labeled the sixth movie!! Is it really that big of a deal to watch them in chronological order?!     These movies have such an intricate plot and dynamic theme that they stand out among thousands. I highly suggest viewers watch this movie and read the books if you havent already!!!! =)

B002QEXN2K|2.0|'Continuum' is one of the best albums of the past 10 years.  'Live From Los Angeles' was one of the best live compilations of the past 10 years.  This album starts out with promise, but quickly devolves into a steaming pile.  There are really only 3 or 4 songs that save it from being a 1 star album.  What's the deal with the 'Crossroads' cover?  Eric Clapton took that nice little Robert Johnson ditty and turned into a rock classic.  The remake on this album is just embarrassing.
0061564893|2.0|Having read Charles Hapgood's \\"Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings,\\" I was fully prepared to accept Menzies' thesis that the Chinese discovered America in 1421. However, his evidence is circumstantial and it is strung together by speculation and conjecture. Not only is his thesis unsupported, his reasoning is faulty, his thinking muddled, and his prose dull. There are also numerous factual errors in the book. The Chinese may have discovered America, but Menzies doesn't prove it.

0061120073|5.0|Francie Nolan is an 11-16 year-old girl growing up in 1910 Brooklyn, part of a seriously poor immigrant family.  Her story is valuable to teens, young adults, prime timers and retirees.  Her story is an inspiration to upwardly mobile individuals and a tonic for those who assume that the poor are lazy, unskilled, bad, incompetent or different.  The story is timeless.    Francie loves her alcoholic father and appreciates her hard-working mother.  Her life is shaped by a handfull of rules from her grandmother, most importantly those about thrift and education.  Her life is also shaped by her extended family, her neighbors and her city.  She is a good person who shares her innermost thoughts with the reader.  Francie is one of the most attractive characters in American literature.  She is not perfect; she's simplistic, naive, overly individualistic and overly focused.  But, she's a keen observer of life.    This book is rated a top 10 American novel on Amazon because it is approachable to all.  It reflects American values.  The description of life is authentic.  The characters are familiar, but not mere caricatures.  Francie is driven to succeed, but not at all costs.  She learns and grows.  The \\"cattiness\\" of life at all socio-economic levels is well-described.  Francie rises above it.  Random events and tragedy are fully included in the broadly positive tale.   In spite of economic pressures, war, cultural norms, institutions, and human nature Francie ultimately succeeds in her primary quest for higher education.  Her family succeeds economically.  But, this is not utopia.  Success comes with a cost.  It does not provide permanent security.  In the author's tale, grace comes to some, but not to all.    The possibility of individual progress, in spite of ..., is elevated by this novel in a believable manner.  If Francie Nolan can overcome the odds, we should all be fully engaged in the game of life, pursuing our dreams.    The CD version is exceptionally well performed.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Finding a movie for two adults, a six year old and a twelve year old is near impossible. UP achieved that goal with its quirky story line and witty dialogue. Really, who could believe a story with a house flown by balloons, an army of talking dogs, and a crazy explorer with a grudge? Yet Pixar pulls it off and then some. Some sad parts, lots of laughter, and a few morality lessons too - what else could you ask for?
B002TKNSPS|4.0|Does anyone care to tell me why US consumers are being denied from fabulous looking European / UK / Canadian blu ray steelbook releases?    Like rest of the world US consumer deserve just as much the option to pick between regular and steelbook edition's. I just stumbled across Inglorious Basterds \\"German\\" steelbook edition and boy it looked awesome. Check out this link -[...]    Gladiator's UK and German releases are also far better looking than the US release. They have the same content (better goodies inside in some cases) than bare bone US cheezy plastic releases. I realize some of these steelbooks are available on Amazon through private sellers at premium prices.     I do not understand why these big budget studios do not want to compete for our dollars with U.S. release of steelbooks. I am sure there are plenty of us who would pay a bit extra to obtain classy looking steelbooks over cheezy plastic blu-ray case. I own the bond steelbooks and they are pride and joy of my growing (350 and counting) blu-ray collection.       Thank you for your participation and happy holidays to everyone!!

B001H5X7I4|5.0|This 2008 film had me laughing hysterically from the very beginning.  It's a spoof about war movies and is full of sharp edged wit.  Part of the fun was never knowing exactly what was coming next.  Ben Stiller is the star and he also directed it and his sense of humor really comes through.<br /><br />The plot is about a group of actors making a Vietnam War film epic.  They are really bad at it and the first part of the movie had me laughing out loud as it depicted every stereotype that we are used to seeing in war films.  But then it goes on.  The actors are dropped into the jungle, thinking they are still making the movie.  However, there's danger out there - real danger, and they are unwittingly thrown into a serious confrontation with a drug gang that rules the area.  This doesn't stop it being funny though.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is cast as a white actor who dyes his skin to become black for the film.  He is so good at it that I really thought he was black until the very end when he takes off his wig and wipes the dye off his face.  Ben Stiller and the rest of the cast give really good performances.  I loved the concept and the writing is great!<br /><br />All I can say is a great big hooray for the cast, the crew and everyone connected with this film.  I loved it!

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Lady Gaga has had a highly successful beginning to her career due to the success of her debut album \\"The Fame\\" and it's four successful singles. But I was oblivious to the true talent and creativity of the Lady until I heard \\"The Fame Monster\\". That's when I began to realize that she is something special and needed in today's music industry. With that said, her new EP is an excellent dance record with a dark undertone.    The hit single `Bad Romance' opens the album strongly, a powerhouse dance song with a pounding house beat and great lyrics. `Alejandro' has a subdued latin vibe, accompanied with strings. `Monster' is a dance song with good synth drums during the verses. The simplest song on the album, `Speechless', is a ballad-type song with standard instrumentation accompanied with strings and Gaga's piano. It suprisingly fits in amongst the overall dance vibe of \\"The Fame Monster\\". The second half of the album begins with the goth/house \\"Dance In The Dark\\", which has a great synth line. During the chorus the beat gains a retro flavor, and for the bridge Lady Gaga raps with a style reminiscent of Madonna's `Vogue'. The next song is `Telephone', which has a gentle harp beginning and ending. It's driven by a straight techno beat, and contains a good Beyonce hip-hop section. `So Happy I Could Die' is a slow pulsing track with a restrained energy and oozing synth during the chorus. The closing song is called `Teeth', and the beat sounds like marchers marching with horns and sleigh bells.    Yes...\\"The Fame Monster\\" is a very enjoyable and fun dance record, but it wouldn't have as much kick and spice without Lady Gaga's unique, distinct voice and vocal delivery. Along with the clever lyrical content, this \\"Monster\\" will take a bite and leave an impression.    So what's in the future for Lady Gaga? Will she show staying power in today's state of music? I truly believe so...but what will she throw at us next? Everyone anticipates!    5 Stars!

8185300534|5.0|I wish everybody who's interested in awakening could read this book.  I'm a lifelong learner and I've been reading all kinds of \\"spiritual\\" books for 40 years.  I've noticed that even the most beautiful and enlightened teachers have a way of talking *around* the Ultimate, perhaps to draw you further in, or whatever, but Nisargadatta has a way of taking you right INTO It.  Over and again he engages the questioner right where they are and, usually in several short exchanges, delivers them some of the most simple and most profound Insights right in their lap.  Show-stoppingly amazing!  That's why I say he \\"throws it down;\\" again and again, there's just no beating around the bush.  I can only imagine sitting in the room with him when he's really on a roll.  A brilliant man, with almost no formal education, he's clearly not selling anything, and he's definitely not attached to anybody buying what he's NOT selling.  This is one of the most important books I've ever read, honestly, with every page conveying priceless insights, all immediately practical.<br /><br />The only downside, if you could call it that, is that it's presented as it was delivered, in dialogue form, so you might have to underline or highlight the pearls and then go back to bring topics together to get a more cohesive view of was said on many ideas and themes.  (But that's just extra work and not really necessary.)  If you just read the first ten pages of dialogues you'll see for yourself.  It's all so simple, and it's very real and applicable.  So what does he say?  Well, he can fill you in on all the details much, much better than I ever could.<br /><br />After this book I might recommend one more, The Ultimate Medicine--dialogues toward the end of his life, when he had little time left and insisted on no \\"kindergarten spirituality\\" talk.  But I Am That is definitely the place to start.  You might also check out some of the short videos of him on YouTube--he is animated and delightfully emphatic, and he says some of the most remarkable things right off the top of his head.

B002ECJZ76|4.0|A dubbed Finnish film about the origin of Santa Claus?  I must say I approached this DVD with a fair amount of skepticism.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, when it exceeded my expectations.  Once I got used to the often sloppy dubbing, I really enjoyed this film about the boyhood of Nikolas, who grew up to become the person we know as Santa Claus. Young Nikolas is orphaned at a young age and is taken to a village whose residents raise him like a foster child, going from home to home, until he eventually ends up with rather cruel guardian named Iisakki.  But Nikolas has a penchant for carving little wooden toys and leaving them on doorsteps on Christmas Eve, and once he is put to work in Iisakki's woodworking shop... well, the rest, as they say, is history.  It's a charming, believable and gently sentimental fantasy, well-acted and appropriate for all ages (though probably best appreciated by children 8 and up), with beautiful cinematography and even a decent music soundtrack.  You just have to deal with the dubbing, unless you find a subtitled version.
B002NPUCP8|5.0|Orianthi sets the new standard for female talent.  I knew she could play guitar with the best of them from hearing interviews, but I had no idea she could sing too.  Since I have bought this CD (which is phenominal by the way), her breakout hit has started receiving heavy airplay on radio stations.  She runs the spectrum from Michael Jackson pop to Santana's vibe to the heavy metal licks of Steve Vai.  She has the kind of talent that will enable her to be a force in the industry for years to come.
B00006G8HX|4.0|There is an unwritten law concerning the Star Trek movies.  All the even numbered movies (2, 4, 6...) are good, and all the odd numbered movies (1, 3, 5...) are horrible.  I bought into this, to a point.  I completely agree with regard to Motion Picture and Final Frontier.  However, I think that of the original six TOS movies, this one is exempt from the rule.  I don't think it's quite as good as 4 or 6, or anywhere near as good as 2, but I thought it was pretty close.  I think this movie is kind of put alongside 1 and 5 without any real thought put into it.  It isn't quite as good as the even numbered ones, so it's considered horrible.    The third movie in the series starts up a few days, or maybe a week after the events of part 2.  Spock is dead, having sacrificed himself to save the ship.  At the end of part 2, there was a sense of optimism.  Spock is dead, but there is hope that the Genesis planet could possibly heal him.  And Kirk has finally come to terms with the fact that he is getting old, and it not longer bothers him.  At the start of this film, however, everyone appears to be depressed over Spock's death, while in the previous film they seemed to have come to terms with it.  It's like they just decided to overrule what had happened in the previous movie.  On that subject, David Marcus, Kirk's son, is staying behind to study the Genesis planet.  For some reason, his mother, Carol Marcus, is entirely absent from this movie.  I mean, she isn't even talked about.  Her name isn't mentioned once.  I don't really understand why she wouldn't have wanted to stay behind and study the world she helped create.  For some unexplained reason, Saavik also stays behind.  Kirstie Alley did not want to reprise her role, so her actress was replaced.  I don't remember the new Saavik's name, but I couldn't stand her.  She just so wooden and bland, even for a Vulcan.  But she doesn't have as much screen time in this film, so it's okay.    The Enterprise returns to Earth, where they find out that the Enterprise is no longer going to be used by Starfleet.  Starfleet feels that Enterprise is too old and needs to make way for newer ships, like the new Excelsior.  Something so one has ever pointed out, to my knowledge, is that this is roughly a week after Wrath of Khan.  Why weren't they talking about dismantling the Enterprise in the last film?  And why did they send Enterprise on a training cruise if they were planning on dismantling the ship anyway?  Maybe they had been thinking about dismantling Enterprise for a while, and in light of the damage inflicted on the ship, they thought it would be too much trouble for them to repair the ship.  Okay, fine, but it seems like a plot hole.  As Kirk and his crew are mourning the death of Spock, Sarek, Spock's father arrives.  He is angry at Kirk.  He assumes Spock mind-melded with Kirk just before his death.  It turns out that Vulcans can live on even after their body has been destroyed.  They just have to transfer their brain to someone else's body.  Then they have to have someone transfer their mind back to their own body, on Vulcan.  It turns out that instead of Kirk, Spock actually melded with McCoy.  So why didn't Spock explain that to Kirk right before he died?  And why didn't McCoy start acting like Spock right away?  That would have saved everyone a lot of time and energy.  On the plus side though, it was pretty entertaining to see McCoy acting and talking like Spock.      Kirk realizes he has to go back to Genesis and pick up Spock's body, then bring him back to Vulcan for the ritual.  If he doesn't, any chance of saving Spock will be lost and McCoy will go insane.  He asks the Starfleet commander for permission to return to Genesis.  Starfleet refuses his request, saying that Spock coming back makes no sense, and that Genesis is under quarantine.  Kirk disobeys his orders and he and the rest of the crew steal the Enteprise.  The scene where they fly the ship out of the Starfleet hangar is probably my favorite scene in all of Star Trek.  And the captain of Excelsior, the pursuing ship, is such an arrogant jerk that it makes you want them to escape even more.  They leave earth and head for Genesis.    They get there, only to find the ship David and Saavik and David were on has been destroyed by the Klingons.  A Klingon bird of prey, captained by Doc Brown, wants Genesis.  A short fight ensues between the two ships.  Enterprise is crippled, and they lose power.  Doc Brown has captured David and Saavik, along with a reborn Spock.  However, Spock is now a young boy.  He was regenerated by the planet, but brought back as a young boy.  It also turns out that the planet is dying.  David engineered it using proto-matter, an unstable element...or something.  Spock is rapidly aging along with the planet.  He is in a tremendous amount of pain.  As a sign that he is serious, Doc Brown has David killed.  Kirk pretends to surrenderr, and then he and his crew beam down to the planet just as most of the Klingon crew is beaming aboard Enterprise.  Kirk has set the Enterprise to self-destruct, and in what is a great scene, the bulk of the Klingon crew are killed.  Down on the planet, Kirk and crew kill the remaining Klingons and rescue Saavik and Spock.  Kirk tricks Doc Brown into beaming down to Genesis.  The two argue, Doc Brown demanding that Kirk tell him the secret of Genesis, and Kirk calling him an idiot, pointing out that the Genesis experiment is a failure.  All the people who try to explain this to Doc kind of miss the point.  Doc isn't interested in creating a planet from lifelessness.  He wants Genesis for it's destructive power, like Khan did in the previous film.  Having the planet destroy itself after Genesis changes it does not really matter to Doc.  He wants Genesis as a weapon, nothing else.  And whether Genesis can sustain life is irrelevent, as far as he's concerned.    I have to say, Kruge is a pretty scary villian.  He would have been better ifhe had been played by someone else.  I'm not saying Christopher Lloys is a bad actor, he just wasn't the right actor to play this role.  He's better at playing comical roles than evil villianous roles.  So in a throwback to the old TV show, Kirk and Doc have a fight.  Doc falls off a cliff to his death.  Kirk tricks the remaining Klingon into beaming him up to the Klingon ship.  Man, these Klingons are dumb.  They leave for Vulcan just as the planet explodes.  They perform the ceremony, and Spock and Bones are both saved.  It will take some time for Spock to completely heal, but he is at least on the path to recovery.    As I said before, I like this movie.  I do not by into the odd-numbered Star Trek rule when it comes to this film.  I don't think this is as good as most of the even-numbered movies, but I think it's pretty good and under-rated.  I think too many people wanted it to be as good as Wrath of Khan, and in just about every way, it is just not as good.  But I still like it.
B001P4ESFS|5.0|There have been two years of Damages, and the third season is about to begin. If you haven't watched the first two seasons, I imagine that it is going to be quite hard to understand many of the references and some of the plotlines and characters of the third. Yet, on a certain level, it doesn't matter. My wife and I have watched the first two seasons - some of the episodes twice - and I doubt that either of us could give a good plot/character summary. Everything is convoluted, nothing is quite what it seems, and no one can be trusted - no one.       More or less, the story is about a young lawyer (a stunningly good actress - Rose Byrne) who joins a law firm completely dominated by Patty (Glenn Close - absolutely brilliant) and quickly finds her finance murdered and must kill a man who tries to kill her (but the body and all evidence of a killing disappear.) Actually, the series begins with her fleeing from the body of the dead fiance, half naked and covered in blood. There are a great number of various forms of flashback devices throughout the series. It would appear that a billionaire, Arthur Frobisher (played by Ted Danson, who like Ms. Byrne and Ms. Close, delivers a layered performance of great subtlety and depth) is behind the crimes. Patty is trying to destroy him in court because he cheated his employees out of great sums of money. A noble cause to punish him, but Patty will do anything - anything - to win. And everyone who appears to be one thing is actually another. The central oiece of advice given in the program is, \\"Trust no one.\\"       Thus, the viewer must watch and listen very carefully to keep things straight, yet, as said above, on some level one does not need to understand the story in depth to enjoy the outstanding acting, powerful direction, visual and aural subtleties, and plotlines that force the viewer to make some real effort to keep up with just the basics of what has/hasn't/has/hasn't happened.       Can a viewer just jump into the 3rd season? I am going to bet s/he can. So far, the on-going program has been so compelling that, like a great meal, it's a shame but it doesn't really matter if you miss the appetizer.       One final note. Given the show's intensity, it is a real pain to have it interrupted by ads. Either watch it on Tivo so you can fast-forward through the ads or just buy the series from Amazon.        Very highly recommended.
B002XGRSBI|5.0|Bought my deluxe copy at McCartney's website for a little over $28.00 including shipping. Why pay more? They were behind on their shipping as stated in a review. But the 27 day wait was worth it. The Letterman disc is really good with a nice tight 35 minute 7 song gig. With that DVD and the hardcover book it brings it up to 5 stars. Without those two, 4 stars. I personally like Part 1 of the 3 parts on the screen options of the concert because it perfectly divides Beatles, Wings, Early Solo and current solo. The last part is Beatle heavy ending with 9 straight Fab Four songs. Touching moment of the concert? Paul's nearly breaking down while singing \\"Here Today\\" his John Lennon tribute song from the album Tug Of War.

1416594787|5.0|The Greatest Show on Earth lives up to its name, in Dawkin's graceful style.  Dawkins blasts the idea that evolution is \\"only a theory\\" out of the water.  Every page provides insight into the inner workings of evolution, through example after example.  From dogs, cows, and cabbages, to so called \\"missing links,\\" this book follows Charles Darwin's tactfulness in On the Origin of Species by starting with what we all take for granted, artificial selection (a.k.a. domestic breeding) and builds on that foundation to lead the reader to natural selection, and evolution.<br /><br />  One of my favorite chapters was chapter 5, \\"Before Our Very Eyes.\\"  Dawkin's gives three examples of evolution that scientists have had the opportunity to witness first-hand.  I've always heard the history-deniers repeat the mantra that \\"no one has ever seen evolution happening,\\" so this was a very interesting chapter indeed.<br /><br />  I'm always amazed at Dawkin's ability to take complex scientific ideas and present them in such understandable and elegant form.  A great read!<br /><br />  \\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows.  There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"---On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin<br /><br />Shawn Sparlin
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I saw this movie via Imax in 3D. I think this is one of the most fantastic movies ever! The story itself is engaging and well thought out. The special effects truly set a new standard against which other movies can be compared - completely amazing! Everything is so realistic it's real easy to just let yourself go and let your mind believe it's real.    I've read various articles stating that this movie cost around 350 million dollars to produce. So, it will need to take in at least that much just to break even. Everyone needs to go see this incredible achievement and support this effort. If not, it will be a long long time before anyone dares to do something like this again.    Go see it - it's one of the best movies ever!    I, for one, will not hesitate for even a second to get it once it becomes available on Blu-Ray :)
0747599874|3.0|The book only took me two days to read, and only that long because I am a mom and wife, too. The book was a nice finishing touch to the Harry Potter series that shed light on a few details about the Potter-verse that was not included in the previous books. The book plays a key role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and it contains five stories that are classic fairy-tales from the wizarding world. The title page states that the tales are translated from the original runes by Hermione Granger. Each story is followed by a commentary from Professor Albus Dumbledore on the previous tale. Also included are notes that Rowling claims for herself as explanations for the non-magically inclined reader.<br />The first story is titled \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\\" and sheds light on the prejudice against Muggles within the wizarding world. I did not particularily care for this story because the main character, the Wizard, in the end had to sacrifice his free will to the will of his dead father.<br />The second story is titled \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune,\\" and Dumbledore's notes explain how this tale played a part in preventing theatre productions from being part of a Hogwart's education, as well as what started the fued between Lucius Malfoy and Dumbledore. I enjoyed this tale simply for the bit of romance at the end.<br />The third story is titled \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\". Dumbledore's commentary largely discusses love and the main character's impossible desire for invulnerability. He also makes mention of the meaning of a common wizarding expression \\" to have a hairy heart.\\" I found this story paralleled the fairytale \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" in some aspects, but the ending was entirely too gruesome for my taste.<br />The fourth story is titled \\"Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump\\". Dumbledore uses this tale to discuss the impossibility of restoring life to the dead, the nature of the Animagi, and the role of trees in wand-making. I enjoyed this tale for the way that the washerwoman outsmarts her foes.<br />The final story is titled \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\" and has the greatest significance in the final Harry Potter book, as the three objects described in the tale - the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and the Invisibility Cloak - belonged to the Peverell brothers, Harry Potter's ancestors. Dumbledore describes the moral of the story as that death can not be avoided, and he further assures the reader that the existence of the three objects is only legend and superstition. I enjoyed this story the most because it invokes the imagination with its possibilities.<br />Profits from the sale of the book go to the Children's High Level Group, which Rowling founded with Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne MEP.

B000002GZ1|5.0|East West is the Butterfield Blues Band's masterpiece, but this first and self-titled album is no slouch itself.<br /><br />This is classic Chicago blues--few of the tunes are origonals. But with a guitar cannon like Mike Bloomfield, this is an early example of what blues can sound like when a loud player with rock pepper applies himself to the music. The album gives you both a old style blues nuance and the edgy feel of the rising rock scene of the 1960s.<br /><br />Butterfields  band evolved from here all the way to Woodstock, but this is one hell of a starting point.
0307716988|5.0|Michael out did himself when he created such a personal book of his life.  I loved every word and I literally became sad when I got to the last page because as far as I am concerned, it could have gone one forever.      If you are a Michael Jackson fan, you won't be disappointed of you read this book.  I sure wasn't.  I finished it in 3 days flat because I just could not put it down.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I first listened to this as a 15-year-old in 1984. I hated the pop out at the time-Wham and Culture Club-and knew about the Beatles and Stones and Kinks. But I had no idea that there was such as thing as \\"Progressive\\" or \\"Underground\\" music.<br /><br />When I heard \\"Schizoid Man,\\" it scared the bejeaus out of me. Yet I understood the jazzy impulse, and understood for the  first time there were gneres beyond \\"pop\\" and \\"rock.\\" I shyed away, while still playing the track every chance I got.<br /><br />I still listen to this album often, not only for deep love for the music on it, but for all it taught me about music. This record lead me to John Coltrane, Bark Psychosis, and, litterally, 1000s of other artists. My whole record collection-10,000 rock, jazz and classical albums-leads straight back to hearing this record. If I am listening to Terry Riley, Miles Davis, Acid Mothers Temple, Sonny Sharock, Sonic Youth or Brian Wilson's Smile Sessions, it all leads back to the impact this record had on me 20 years ago.<br /><br />\\"21st Century Schizod Man\\" takes all the experiments \\"underground\\" bands were conduting at the time and blows them away in seven minutes. It was litterally-when the album came out in 1969- the hardest rock that had been recorded.  Modern hard rock bands are still striving for this type of impact, but don't understand music well enough to even touch this tower.<br /><br />\\"I Talk to The Wind\\" is a jazz-folk ballad. Brillant on its own terms with its flute and cloudy melotron, it is were the Beatles might have gone if they had the will. \\"Moonchild\\" is the Moody Blues meets free jazz. It takes the best elements of the latter, and is far more daring than anything the Moodys ever did.<br /><br />\\"Epataph\\" and the title track are more conservitive. They are, perhaps, better-produced copies of Moodys concepts. Yet even here, Michael Giles drumming and Robert Fripp's sustain guitar are aboslutely shots fired at the start of a revolution. The Police and the Talking Heads spent their careers working out the possitilities King Crimson presented on this album.<br /><br />If you want to understand the jazz of the 50s and 60s or the art-rock of the 70s and 80s, start with this album. Be ready, this is not only the trip, it is the ticket. Listen to it as if young and naked, ready to be turned on to a new world.<br /><br />If ready, you won't be the same after hearing \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King.\\"out the possitilities King Crimson presented on this album.    If you want to understand the jazz of the 50s and 60s or the art-rock of the 70s and 80s, start with this album. Be ready, this is not only the trip, it is the ticket.

B00008QSA5|5.0|Back in 1968, rock was in clubs, not areans. After the bands had finished their sets, late night jams were routine labratories. Hendrix, Jefforson Airplane, all the bands now in the pantheon hanging out and playing.<br /><br />This album is gives you a good idea of what this sounded like. Super Session is Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield and Stephan Stills, backed by one of  the most underrated bassists of the era, Electric Flag's Harvey Brooks. (Bloomfield was in the same band.)<br /><br />On the bill are blues jams, a few Kooper tunes, and a  fantastic jam on \\"Season Of The Which\\" by Donovan. These are the best players, and the jams have the craft of most studio albums.<br /><br />Bloomfield and Stills have very dfferent approaches to the guitar, and listening to the differences are one of the many perks to this album.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|When I heard that these Beatles' songs were mixed together, I was not too happy about hearing it.  Then I started to listen to several of the songs, and I was just blown away!  I admire the way George Martin, his son, Giles, the remix engineer, Paul Hicks, and others did it.  Sure, if you're a die-hard Beatles' fan, you're already familiar with the songs.  But, it's great to hear them differently, as opposed to having just another greatest hits album released.  (There are enough of Beatles' greatest hits albums already.)  Plus, the fact that this is the soundtrack for the famous Cirque du Soleil show, LOVE is another honor.      Some highlights of the album for me are \\"Gnik Nus\\", which I realize is \\"Sun King\\" played and sung backwards.  Obviously, this is nothing new, since the Beatles and George Martin recorded music backwards back in the 1960's of course.  But you don't hear it much on today's music.  Another highlight is where they mix together the songs \\"Being for the Benfit of Mr. Kite\\", \\"I Want You (She's so Heavy)\\", and \\"Helter Skelter\\".  It's great the way George Martin and the others let the songs overlap each other, but not too much that you cannot understand what is being played.  I also enjoyed hearing the two demos of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".  I especially admired the way George Martin arranged the orchestral instruments on the latter song.  This I read is the only new recording.  Well, I say that George did a darn good job of both composing and arranging as always!  You get to hear a slightly different version of \\"A Day in the Life\\", where you hear John play an acoustic guitar and sing, \\"Sugar Plum Ferry, Sugar Plum Ferry\\" at the very beginning of the song.  Another fine remix is the blending of \\"Blackbird\\"(recorded a whole step lower then on the normal version of the WHITE ALBUM), and \\"Yesterday\\".  Well, all the remixed songs here are well-done.  I'll let you hear them for yourself, so that you can make up your own mind.    Also, there's a booklet which features a collage of photographs of the Beatles in the past years as well as photographs of the Cirque du Soleil show.  All of these collages are colorful and put together well.  The booklet also features essays by both George Martin and his son Giles.  They basically talk about how this LOVE idea started and eventually how people like former Beatle, George Harrison and Cirque du Soleil founder, Guy Laliberte' put it all together to make it a reality.  It's very interesting to read about.    Well, if you're not a purist Beatles' fan and have an open-mind about how the group's songs are remixed and recorded, you might be able to get something positive out of this album like I did.  I realize  that there are many reviews about this album, but this one is of course, mine.  I hope it helps you out!
B000002UZU|4.0|This album has two parts--John Lee Hooker playing alone and covering the vocals, and the master with Canned Heat behind him.<br /><br />The first part is good enough, but it is when the teacher plays with the students that the music begins to kick and crunch. Listen to \\"Wiskey and Women.\\" Hooker's work does not change that much, but Heat push him and create a forward drive to this music.<br /><br />It is always a facinating process to listen to 1960s blues bands back their forefathers. These guys were soaked in the blues, but they played louder, faster, and harder than their musical daddys. They slid on their basses, they used feedback. They were listening to Hendrix and the Beatles and the Airplane as well as Muddy and the Wolf and John Lee.<br /><br />So when they bring this to the blues table, the music does take on an updated charactor. The old masters had great bands behind them in the 1940s and 50s, but by the rock era, bands like Canned Heat could truely pump the volume and up the dynamics of the music they learned from<br /><br />Get this.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this movie and would recommend it to children and adults alike.  I believe this movie will become a classic like so many of Disney movies do.  Even my husband, who does not like \\"cartoons,\\" stated that it was a great movie that was worth watching.
B0000025AI|5.0|Nothin' But The Blues is all Johnny Winter does, and he is the best at it. He played the music in the late 1960s and early 70s, when the blues was big. Johnny kept on bluesin' long after soft rock and disco took over.<br /><br />Nothin' But The Blues was made in the mid-70s, when Winter was working with Muddy Waters on the classic trilogy, [[ASIN:B00000258J Hard Again]],[[ASIN:B0012GMWIE King Bee]], and [[ASIN:B0012GMWIO I'm Ready]]--all of which are essential blues sides.<br /><br />Here Winter is working with Muddy's crack band; old blues men who went through  60s rock and came out playing pure blues better. There is steel guitar, hard backbone blues, all the ace work you would expect.<br /><br />When Winter titled an album, this man was seriously litteral.

B00007KWHO|4.0|One of the most interesting things a major music fan can do is hear a huge band before they got their footing.<br /><br />Hearing Time And A Word is a prime example of how rich an experiance this can be. Look even at the cover. It looks nothing like the Roger Dean trademarks we have come to know.<br /><br />This 1970 album features Pete Banks, not Chris Howe. Banks was a good player but not as flashy as Howe, so the guitar does not play as big of a role hear as it does on the classic Yes albums like Fragle.<br /><br />Strings, however, do play a sizable roll, and the big arrangments on these tracks add an amazing contrast to the flat and open dynamics Yes would later use. They almost seem like a wave sweeping over Jon Anderson's subtle voice.<br /><br />Very strange and intreuging albom
B000E6UK32|3.0|If you want a Blondie greatest hits record to collect the classic tracks in one place *as you remember them from back in the day*, steer well clear of this record: The remasterer has been at work, and most, if not all, tracks have pretty clearly been remixed as well as remastered, not to mention shortened. While newer listeners may like the updated sound (in some ways it's a sympathetic update - mostly just a little more bass and drums, and it's fairly subtle - but not so subtle that you can't notice it!) many of us older buzzards will feign righteous indignation that anyone could have dared to meddle with such pop perfection. This is DEBBIE HARRY for crying out loud. Is nothing sacred?<br /><br />A much better bet for those old timers would be The Best Of Blondie, which was released about 1984, and contains most of the essential tracks, as recorded and (mostly) unedited.<br /><br />What this collection *does* offer old timers is two things: Firstly, a good quality recording of \\"Rapture Riders\\", the mash-up of Blondie's Rapture and the Doors' Riders on the Storm. Purists hate it, but I think it's pretty cool.<br /><br />Secondly, the original videos. Now Debbie Harry in the late 70s and early 80s was like nothing else on the planet for a boy my age, and to see it on a good sized plasma now, while dated, still sends a shiver down the spine (notably the early ones - Debbie's gorgeous backlighting in Picture This and Heart of Glass deserve a special mention). But, candidly, many of the other videos are of historical interest only: Blondie fizzled out just before the MTV generation hit it off, so televisually slick this is not: while we should indeed think ourselves lucky that there even are contemporaneous videos of our pop goddess in her prime, most are somewhere between silly and unconvincing (Atomic, Hanging On The Telephone) embarrassing (The Hardest Part, which sees Debbie in S&M gear sporting - some would say wisely - a ridiculous long black wig and dark glasses) and downright bizarre (The Tide Is High - the band in New York with superimposed giant goldfish at the window, a mutant Darth Vader and then - of course! - some stock NASA footage of a Saturn V rocket) and the in any case dreadful Island Of Lost Souls). On the other hand there is a video for Shayla, which is a wonderful bonus.<br /><br />Nonetheless there's enough of that Debbie Harry Magic to make this worth the purchase for the DVD alone.<br /><br />But audiophiles: your best bet would be to go back to the Albums: Parallel Lines and Eat To The Beat (the latter of which I am proud to say was the first record I ever bought, aged 12) are outstanding records, but you only catch a glimpse of them here.<br /><br />Olly Buxtone (The Tide Is High - the band in New York with superimposed giant goldfish at the window, a mutant Darth Vader and then - of course! - some stock NASA footage of a Saturn V rocket) and the in any case dreadful Island Of Lost Souls).

B002RV01QI|5.0|Enya's new album is a greatest hits album- her second one, to be exact. It comes a little over a decade after her 1997 compilation \\"Paint The Sky With Stars- The Best Of Enya\\". What separates the two albums is that \\"The Very Best Of Enya\\" culls material from her later albums \\"A Day Without Rain\\", \\"Amarantine\\" and her 2008 album \\"...And Winter Came\\". The classics are on here, such as \\"Orinoco Flow\\", \\"Anywhere Is\\" and her biggest hit \\"Only Time\\". Even her song \\"Boadicea\\" from her debut album \\"The Celts\\" appears on here, which later became best known as the sample behind Fugees' \\"Ready Or Not\\" as well as Mario Winans' \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\". It's an album that is good to have in your collection, but if you're like me, you probably have all of her albums.
0547258305|5.0|This is another YA novel along the fantasy line. In this world, certain people are gifted with one extraordinary ability, which is called a grace. It could be almost anything - cooking, swimming, fighting - graces come in both useful and useless skills. The usefully-skilled are generally claimed by the king to serve him. Katsa is a young woman, unhappily graced with the skill of killing, and her king uses her to \\"discipline\\" people with whom he is angry. Behind his back, Katsa sets up a network of people who work together to help out ordinary people being wronged (an attempt to atone for the heinous acts her king requires of her).  Katsa finally refuses to work for him any longer, and sets off on her own mystery quest.  She meets another graceling, a young man, and together the two of them set out  on a dangerous mission. Romance, adventure, a bit of magic - great combination.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Gran Torino, a Clint Eastwood movie, has a simple easy to follow plot.  Eastwood plays a character that is struggling with life around him passing him by.  His life used to be more predictable, Now he struggles with the changing culture around him, to the point that he sticks out like a sore thumb.  But while the movie has a simple plot line, it certainly doesn't have a simple message.  In fact, Eastwood takes on some of the hardest hitting themes in our society today with such ease, I can't imagine another director or actor doing a better job.<br /><br />The movie is nothing short of amazing, and definitely describes the lost generation between the \\"greatest\\" and the \\"baby boomer\\".  His open hostility towards other races is not hidden, yet through the movie he embraces the very culture he says he hates.  The ending took me completly by surprise, and for me took the whole movie from a 4 star to a 5 star, and made my list of the most defining movies of this decade.<br /><br />The language is very raw so be aware.

0071636080|3.0|The You Tube videos and the excerpts seemed interesting, so I bought the book. It's worth the money, but that being said - it is merely a collection of public speaking and presentation tips with a focus on Steve Jobs' use of them.    There are no real \\"Secrets\\" here - everything in the book I've seen elsewhere. However, it is a good roll up and case study.    I'm not a big fan of Jobs' presentations - I've seen others like him - who can only do their thing in highly controlled environments. Frankly, after about five minutes, I find Jobs boring - once you've seen one of his presentations - you've seen them all. And the hyperbole gets really annoying after a while - or, to use Jobspeak - insanely annoying.    I only gave it three stars for two reasons: the author is clearly a Jobs worshipper, which blinds him to the fact that Jobs has a stage persona that Jobs is peddling as reality - the real Steve Jobs is rather different. (For a very different story, read the book Icon - which is an unauthorized biography of Jobs.) Secondly, the author ignores the history of Jobs, which tends to put a lot of the Jobs embellishments in factual perspective.    When you boil it down, Jobs' major contribution is that he has made existing technology much more accessible (and has done an excellent job at it) - but he really didn't invent that technology, as he would have you to believe. The Macintosh (and before that, the Lisa) GUI was taken for the Xerox Star computer that Jobs saw in 1975 at the Palo Alto Research Center. The iPod concept was taken from the Sony Walkman, The iPhone from the concept of existing smartphones (Palm, etc.) Laptop (or notebook) computers were created by someone else, not Apple.    If you read the book Icon - it points out that Jobs has had a long history of stepping in at the last moment and taking credit for other's work. This dates back to the Macintosh development team - which was competing with the Lisa project that Jobs was (mis)managing.    Jobs goes through the motion of thanking others, but he won't allow anyone at Apple to come close to competing with him - he learned that lesson the hard way from John Sculley. When Jobs passes from the scene, they will run Apple like they ran Disney for 20 years after Walt Disney passed away - they'll sit around a table and asked each other: \\"What would Steve do?\\"    The author here (Gallo) - makes an interesting observation, the eventual implication of which I'm sure he couldn't foretell: \\"Jobs is the Tiger Woods of business...\\"(page xii, Prologue)
0312997221|5.0|I'm a first time reader of Frederick Forsyth and about three quarters through \\"Avenger.\\"  I will definitely be reading more of his novels!  I decided to check out the reviews before I continued to see what other readers had to say.  Since I find this novel excellent and very informative about world history that for the most part always seems a little fuzzy and complicated, I thought it might be helpful to get some opinions of Mr. Forsyth's views brought about through the characters and circumstances of this novel.  I looked at the negative views mostly as I always like to hear another side of an argument before I make up my mind what to believe.  Without exception the naysayers claimed his writing was boring, trite, ridiculous character development, and generally too political or pushing his own interpretations of what's going on in our world today in regard to terrorism.  I read a lot of books by a variety of authors and I totally do not agree Forsyth is a trite and boring author.  James Patterson would be a good example as trite and poor character creations in his latest novel.  J. Patterson used to write some wonderful fictional works, but no more!  Anyway, in addition, I also believe terrorism cannot be dealt with through arbitration, negotiation, or any civil conversation between the terrorist and those he/she opposes.  The events described in this book ring true in my understanding and Mr. Forsyth brings them clearly and succinctly together to tell a tale based in reality.  Thank you, Mr. F.! All those who say he's all weak and wet in his writings and politically clueless, need to get a grip!\\"
B002VPE1AM|4.0|Avatar is a very good movie with great special effects. The problem is that the story is so simplistic and black and white that you never really get sucked in.  The 3D effects are great, they are effortless for your eyes.  Go see it, but you won't leave the theater with the adrenaline rush you had after seeing Aliens or Terminator 2, or the emotions from Titanic.  James Cameron has probably surrounded himself with people afraid to criticize him and it show.

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire is the second book by Suzanne Collins in her The Hunger Games Trilogy.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic United States where the country is divided into 12 districts and children are chosen by lot to fight to the death in a controlled environment by the ruling class.  In the last novel we saw Katniss, a sixteen year old girl, win The Hunger Games with a clever trick.  Problem is, it set off a chain of events that lead people to subtly, and sometimes not so subtly, challenge the authority of the ruthless rulers in this anarchic world.  And they are to change this by using Katniss again.<br /><br />Here we once again see Katniss being clever but we also learn she is an unwitting pawn in a larger game.  But what she is a pawn of I'll have let the reader figure out.<br /><br />This second novel was as entertaining as the first, and maybe more so, as Collins drives the plot along in some unexpected ways.  The characters in the book are its strong suit, as well as how Collins weaves the outcome of the book into subtle narrative as we get to the end of part two.<br /><br />While I have reservations about the setting of the novel, which make it bit less believable to me, the story and characters are fabulous.  It is greatly entertaining, a real page turner, and in this case rather clever as well.  I look forward to the final installment.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|This movie was recommended to me by Netflix, so I watched it on a whim one day.  I expected to hate it and turn it off before the end, especially since it is three hours long- but I loved it!  I am a HUGE P&P fan, have researched the book extensively and even wrote my masters thesis on it.  I know the characters, plot, scenes, and dialouge inside out and backwards.  The screen writer took everything we know about P&P and re-interpreted it.  IT WORKED!  Granted, there are somethings for which you will have to suspend your disbelief- the fact that a secret door to the Bennet's home magically opens in Amanda Price's bathroom for one- but that is what give the movie a lot of it's charm.  It is a re-invention of the story, the answer to the \\"I wish I was Elizabeth Bennet!\\" day dream!  No one can replace Elizabeth, the story DOES get botched without her, but it is a very funny journey to watch!  Especially with the references to the 1995 BBC mini-series.  I give 4/5 stars because the development of Darcy and Amanda's relationship is supposed to mirror that of Darcy and Elizabeth's, but misses the mark slightly for me.  However, this is the absolute BEST portrayal of Bingly I have ever seen, hands down, Tom Mison absolutely nails it.  Its definitely a different Bingly than the novel, but I think the new story line lends itself well to an otherwise shallow character.  We get a bit more depth to him, and he is no less loveable!  If you are a P&P fan and go into this move knowing that it is not supposed to be a faithful re-telling, then I think you will enjoy it!  If you don't like straying from tradition, perhaps this is not the film for you!

It is not a classical voice, it's a pop band voice, and when he tries to sing something like \\"Now Winter Comes Slowly\\" your thoughts may turn to euthanasia or, if you can't get out of the room, hara-kiri.   The album as a whole sounds wintry enough, though, and if you program out the tracks that have the miseries it's OK as background on a snowy night.

It appeared that he was struggling for subject matter and just needed to fill the pages. There was no intrigue or any substance to it. A HUGE dissappointment!!!! Advice: borrow it, don't spend the money on buying it.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|\\"Avatar\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: AVATAR takes us to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a reluctant hero embarks on an epic adventure, ultimately fighting to save the alien world he has learned to call home. James Cameron, the Oscar-winning director of \\"Titanic,\\" first conceived the film 15 years ago, when the means to realize his vision did not exist yet. Now, after four years of production, AVATAR, a live action film with a new generation of special effects, delivers a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new kind, where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film disappears into the emotion of the characters and the sweep of the story.    We enter the alien world through the eyes of Jake Sully, a former Marine confined to a wheelchair. But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart. He is recruited to travel light years to the human outpost on Pandora, where corporations are mining a rare mineral that is the key to solving Earth's energy crisis. Because the atmosphere of Pandora is toxic, they have created the Avatar Program, in which human \\"drivers\\" have their consciousness linked to an avatar, a remotely-controlled biological body that can survive in the lethal air. These avatars are genetically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora... the Na'vi.     Reborn in his avatar form, Jake can walk again. He is given a mission to infiltrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore. But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jake's life, and this changes everything. Jake is taken in by her clan, and learns to become one of them, which involves many tests and adventures. As Jake's relationship with his reluctant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them. Soon he will face the ultimate test as he leads them in an epic battle that will decide nothing less than the fate of an entire world.The cast led by Sam Worthington (as Jake Sully) is excellent! The directing and story and screenplay by James Cameron (who also did the film editing and produced) (who also directed \\"Titanic\\" (1997, also produced, film edited, and wrote the story and screenplay), \\"The Terminator\\" (1984, also wrote the story & screenplay), \\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\" (1991, also produced and wrote the story and screenplay), \\"The Abyss\\" (1989, also wrote the story and screenplay), \\"Aliens\\" (1986, also wrote the story and screenplay) & \\"True Lies\\" (1994, also wrote the screenplay and produced) is excellent!    The music by James Horner (who also did the music to \\"Aliens\\" & \\"Titanic\\", he also did the music to \\"Apocalypto\\" (2006) is excellent! The cinematography by Mauro Fiore (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming \\"The A-Team\\" (2010) is excellent! The film editing by Cameron, John Refoua & Stephen E. Rivkin (who also did the film editing to all 3 Pirates Of The Caribbean movies (2003, 2006 & 2007) is excellent! The casting by Margery Simkin (who also did the casting to the upcoming \\"Extraordinary Measures\\" (2010) is excellent! The production design by Rick Carter (who also did the production design to certain Steven Spielberg's & Robert Zemeckis' films and the upcoming \\"Sucker Punch\\" (2011) & Robert Stromberg (who also did the production design to the upcoming \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" (2010), he has done visual effects work on \\"2012\\" (2009), \\"The Road\\" (2009), \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra\\" (2009) & the upcoming \\"Shutter Island\\" (2010) is excellent! The art direction by Nick Bassett (who also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"XXX: The Return Of Xander Cage\\" (2011), Robert Bavin, Simon Bright (who also did the art direction & set decoration to \\"King Kong\\" (2005), the art direction to \\"The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King\\" (2003), Todd Cherniawsky (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" & \\"Sucker Punch\\"), JillCormack, Stefan Dechant (who also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"Alice In Wonderland\\"), Seth Engstrom, Sean Haworth (who also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"Thor\\" (2011) & \\"Tron Legacy\\" (2010), Kevin Ishioka (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to \\"G.I.

The set decoration by Kim Sinclair is excellent! The costume design by Mayes C. Rubeo (who also did the costume design to \\"Apocalypto\\") & Deborah Lynn Scott (who also did the costume design to \\"Titanic\\" & the upcoming \\"Love And Other Drugs\\" (2010) is excellent!    This is an impressive and beautiful film, visually and emotionally. This is one of James Cameron's best films, if not best film, since \\"Titanic\\". This is also one of the best films of the year, so far.

0321525655|5.0|Presentation Zen will finally make you understand why the typical PowerPoint presentation you often see is incredibly boring and ineffective at getting the audience to understand the message. How should we prepare, design, and deliver an effective presentation to get the message across?     Garr Reynolds begins the first half of the book on PREPARATION. How should we prepare our presentations? He tells us that working with restrictions and limitations are a great ally and are good for producing creative work. We should always focus on the core message and underlying theme. (\\"What's my Point? Why Does It Matter?\\")     The second half of the book is focuses on DESIGN. Here, he provides great design principles (with excellent examples) that anyone preparing a presentation should keep in mind. To create messages that stick, he refers to [[ASIN:1400064287 Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die]] on the six key principles: SUCCESs - Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotions and Stories. He also refers to Zen concept of simplicity to clarity, subtlety, essentialness, and minimalism.    It is very rare to find a book that is written with such clear message that tells us what we have all been doing were wrong, and how to do it right. He shows us how we can see things from a different point of view. Instead of asking \\"How can I save more time?\\" Why didn't we ask it is not just about our time, but it was about the audience's time? (\\"Are you wasting your audience's time?\\")    If you want to know how to make a better presentation design and delivery, this is the book.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|So the overplayed plot of the chosen one is done once again, only such a story is done far better in other movies (Matrix, Underworld).  \\"Wanted\\" is one of those movies in which you think to yourself during the movie, how did I get duped into thinking this was going to be a good movie...  Was it the action packed trailer?  Was it the trailer with Jolie?  If you are a big Jolie fan then you might actually enjoy this.  Otherwise, it is a bad rip off of other movies.

1593082649|4.0|Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.<br /><br />When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.<br /><br />Unlike all the other books Austen wrote, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a careful balance of two different styles -- a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels (she even lists a bunch of real-life gothic novels!), and it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.<br /><br />And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\"). And while the plot is sprinkled with sinister pseudo-gothic hints, Austen also takes the time to sketch out some romantic deceptions and tangles, as well as some deliciously arch dialogue (\\"I was not thinking of anything.\\" \\"That is artful and deep, to be sure...\\").<br /><br />The only part that falls short is the climactic encounter between Henry and Catherine... which is completely skimmed over, and related only in a distant vague style. \\"I leave it to my reader's sagacity\\" is not a satisfying way to handle that sort of romantically-charged scene.<br /><br />Austen also has fun with Catherine as the unlikely heroine of the piece, especially since she makes it clear that Catherine comes from a very mundane, undramatic background. She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.<br /><br />Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming. A delight.ming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\").

B002T9H2L0|4.0|Watched this film on blu-ray last night (as the snow poured down outside.)  This was the second time,as I had seen it in the movies last September.  It is an enjoyable and exciting film, good but not great.  The problem is too many scenes go on way too long.  The opening scene in the film is suspenseful, but goes on way too long: about 20 minutes.  I felt it was too long in the movies and last night I almost immediately forwarded to scene 2.  There is one other excruciatingly long scene involving a couple of the \\"basterds\\" and a British spy meeting a German film actress and allied spy (Diane Kruger) in a bar.  This scene also goes on way too long but, at least, ends excitingly.  Speaking of the \\"basterds,\\" they really do not play the major part in the film and are on screen rather sparingly.  For a film advertised as an action film, until the conclusion there really isn't that much action.  As for the actors, Brad Pitt has a few good scenes and his Southern accent is amusing.  However much of the film is spent with his chin out and a rather stupid expression on his face, he looks almost mentally retarded at times.  The major find in this film is Melanie Laurent, the french actress who plays the Jewish owner of the movie theater which Goebbels chooses for the premiere of his Nazi propaganda film.  This actress is not only beautiful, but gives an absolutely wonderful performance.  You cannot take your eyes off her when she is on screen, she reminds me of a young Audrey Hepburn in that regard.  Diane Kruger is also excellent as the German film star, secretly spying for the allies.  And finally Christoph. Waltz, as the SS Colonel Landa, nicknamed the \\"Jew Hunter,\\" gives a fantastic performance also.  There are numerous extras on the blu-ray including extended scenes (although many of the scenes really did not need any extensions.)  My favorite extra is a 2 part interview with Rod Taylor who has a short part as Winston Churchill.  He was one of my favorite actors growingup in the '50s and '60s, starring in 2 of my all-time favorite films: Hitchcock's \\"The Birds\\" and George Pal's production of H.G. Wells' \\"The Time Machine.\\"  I especially enjoyed hearing Taylor relate how, years ago, Quentin Tarantino wrote him for an autographed picture which Tarantino still has.  I can relate to this.  I have written to Taylor on several occassions and have several very nice signed lobby cards from him, including one from \\"The Birds\\" which I have framed, hanging on my wall.  The fact that Tarantino sought Taylor out to play this small role heightens my respect for him.  In conclusion, this is kind of a fun fantasy to watch, if you are aware that there is more talk than action and some very long, long scenes.
B002ECJZ76|3.0|This is the story of the man who became Santa Claus... no, not the real-life St. Nicholas. This constantly snowdrifted little movie is a fictionalized account of how an orphan child with a knack for woodcarving became the legendary bringer of presents -- and while it sometimes loses its depth in pursuit of the Santa Claus legend, it's a sweet, warm-hearted little movie with the aesthetics of a storybook.<br /><br />Nikolas' (Jonas Rinne) parents and baby sister are killed in a sleigh accident when he's young, and nobody in the village can afford to adopt the quiet boy. So the village families come up with a plan: Nikolas will be passed from family to family over the next six years, with each transition being at Christmas. And since Nikolas has a knack for carving wood, every Christmas he leaves toys on the doorstep of the families who once showed him kindness.<br /><br />Then at thirteen (played by Otto Gustavsson), he's handed off to Isaac (Kari V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen), a crotchety and cruel carpenter who initially treats him like a slave. But after Isaac discovers Nikolas' secret, he begins to warm to the strange, generous boy. And as Nikolas grows to manhood (Hannu-Pekka Bj&ouml;rkman), he's left with a remote, frozen house and a workshop filled with toys -- and a dream that he's determined to make real, bringing countless children toys every Christmas.<br /><br />\\"Christmas Story\\" (original title: \\"Joulutarina\\") is a refreshing experience in a sea of schmaltzy made-for-TV movies and stupid Christmas comedies. It has a mellow homespun charm reflected in the poverty-stricken fishing village, log houses and layers of woolly clothing -- and there's no preachy message about the true meaning of Christmas (love/family/generosity/all that), just Nikolas displaying it as he slowly morphs into Santa Claus.<br /><br />It's also pretty as a picture -- while there are some lovely shots of autumnal forests and fog-wrapped fishing boats, the real draw is the gorgeous pictures of little Finnish villages under a perpetual blanket of snow. The overall mood is an upbeat one, with a pleasant study of how the basic trappings of the popular fictional Santa Claus (the hat, the reindeer, the sleigh, the gifts) became a part of his legend. But it becomes darker and sadder as the lonely, generous man winds through the latter years of his life, only to have another upturn at the end.<br /><br />One thing that is a problem: there is no Finnish soundtrack in this movie, just English subs and an English audio track dubbed by people who often didn't sound too enthusiastic. It actually was sometimes more fun to watch the movie with the sound turned off.<br /><br />The child actors are thoroughly mediocre, but Bj&ouml;rkman really throws himself wholeheartedly into his role -- he's jolly, generous and thoroughly devoted to his new goal. And he's got a beard that could The only problem is that when Nikolas reaches adulthood, his motives become rather murky -- it's not quite clear WHY he becomes so determined to devote his life to Christmas, toymaking and all kids in the region.<br /><br />And while most of the actors are only briefly in the story, the few who stand out are excellent V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen gives a well-drawn performance as Isaac, who makes you hate his character, then pity him, then want to hug him; Mikko Kouki is quite good as Nikolas' best buddy.<br /><br />\\"Christmas Story's\\" English dub hampers it, but that can't erase some solid acting, lovely scenery, and a pleasant little made-up story about Santa Claus' origins.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|In Greek mythology \\"Pandora\\" was a woman who was given the gifts of the gods, thus translated \\"all gifts\\" as well as given her \\"box\\" (actually a jar) which, when opened, released ills to all Man -- greed, avarice, lust, anger, etc.<br /><br />James Cameron, after quite a hiatus after his number one best-selling film Titanic (still number one on the Hot 100 movies of all time) created a smooth world, actually a green moon orbiting a Jupiter-like gas giant planet.<br /><br />Earth is in dire need of a mineral (Unobtainium, named for obvious reasons) that's worth millions on the market.  They invade this moon and have conflict with the native peoples, the Na'vi, very similar in scope and story to Native Americans, with a story and a spiritual connection to their planet Pandora as our Native Americans have with North America. [[ASIN:0452276500 Spirits of the Earth: A Guide to Native American Nature Symbols, Stories, and Ceremonies]]<br /><br />The similarities are striking, the story is as old as time, and the originality is there as well.  I think what strikes me as others are the technical marvel of creating a world that is so full of life as Earth, how Earth may have evolved on a different plane.  Flowers of fantastic colors, hyena-like dogs with several eyes, and communing with dragon-like animals (in nearly the same way as Anne McCaffery imagined in the novel Dragonriders of Pern) [[ASIN:0345340248 The Dragonriders of Pern]].<br /><br />Jake [Sam Worthington, as  Marcus Wright in: [[ASIN:B001FB55HQ Terminator Salvation (Widescreen Edition)]]]is a Marine who is also without the use of his legs and is forced to use a wheelchair.  Cameron's sensitivity here is clear and I think anyone with a disability would feel grateful for how the character is portrayed.<br /><br />The Avatar is actually a DNA construct between human and Na'vi, a body is grown (this is the 22nd century after all) and then you're plugged in and for all intents and purposes you run the new body.  For a man with no use in his legs, having a new body where you can run and play is intoxicating.<br /><br />Animals:  The flora and fauna are amazing.  We can only imagine in a dream what crazy evolutionary accident made life become like on Pandora.  The Na'vi have a way of connecting their neural pathways through their \\"braid\\" from their heads.  Interestingly they can connect and communicate to the life on their planet.<br /><br />Before you start going \\"Oh, it's a Gaea worship myth!\\" Sigourney Weaver (working again with Cameron after the awesome Aliens [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]) explains the biology and how connected they all are.  There is even a Tree of Life and a Tree of Knowledge -- the religious connections and Native American connections are very clear.<br /><br />I mentioned the Dragonriders of Pern for a reason -- as the dragons hook up with their riders in the same way a cat will hook up with her kittens, so these dragon-like creatures hook up with their riders.<br /><br />Jake is torn between his duty as a Marine and his honor and responsibility as a member of the tribe of Na'vi who call him \\"dreamwalker\\" because he is an alien, not of their people.<br /><br />We've seen variations of this story before in history (invasion of the Europeans upon native peoples, invasion of Iraq for oil -- oops, never mind) and in impacting the environment -- Jake says \\"they've killed Mother Earth and now they want to kill you!\\"<br /><br />Breathtaking scenes of flight, violent rhinoceros-like animals that can crush steel, love, honor on one side -- the corporate greed and military mind of taking what you want and bulldoze the leftovers -- it's all here.  The amazing animation of the world, the peoples and space & planet scenes is seamless and realistic -- this film could be as big and as groundbreaking as King Kong was for its time, in terms of animation & special effects.<br /><br />What I think will attract the viewer is not only the sciencefiction trappings but an old story of sticking up for what you believe in.<br /><br />The moon Pandora had as the Greeks granted -- a gift of the gods [[[ASIN:0836881478 Pandora's Box (Graphic Greek Myths and Legends)]].

B002P5XXR0|4.0|There are two things I don't like about this score:    1.  I have a little trouble getting over how I keep hearing themes from all his previous work in it - I literally found myself humming or singing themes from The Missing, Titanic, etc., because there is so much in this score that is VERY reminiscent of those other scores.  In that sense, I do not find this score very original.  It seems like Horner just took previously existing work and played around with it to make this score rather than making something truly original.    2.  It seems to me that hearing distinctly Irish themes and Native/Aboriginal themes in the music adds to the cliche aspects of the movie that others have noted - the whole White Guy joins and saves Natives theme - that are a bit racist and worn out.  There was an opportunity here to try to musically make Pandora something truly unique and stunning in line with the state-of-the-art visual effects, but instead the music contributes to the cliche problem.    If one removes these two context issues from consideration, the score stands alone as something evocative and beautiful.  I do enjoy the music if I can get myself to ignore the two main issues I mentioned above.
B00004Z459|5.0|Being a loyal LP fan from day one I can conclude that this is by far the best of Linkin Park's three records and judging by the proclaimed history of the album, probably one of the best Alt Rock albums of the decade. The team of Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington pivot this genre to new heights providing catchy tunes and heavy riffs, this album will please those looking for good solid rock. Can't wait until the new album with a present late 2010 release date.

0143115014|5.0|\\"Perfumes: The A-Z Guide\\" is above all an education in writerly style. The form of the perfume review is one that the authors truly have down, blending personal anecdote and histories of perfumes and perfumiers, with their own analyses. Irrespective of whether or not you agree with them, you never feel that you are not in safe hands.     I don't know very much about perfume, unlike other reviewers, but the distortions of nepotism seem sufficiently incidental that the book's signal-to-noise ration is still extraordinary. And I'm not sure that there is a great deal to be gained by complaining that you disagree with the guide's verdicts. The point of education is to hone your powers of discrimination, not to be told that all your received ideas are valid and can be retained intact.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a delightful book!  This is one I couldn't put down until I finished it.  I want an Enzo of my own.   What a wonderful dog and a wonderful author to bring him to us.  I'm not going to rewrite the story--that's been done.  I just hope I can find another book that touches me as much as this one did.  This ranks as one of the best books I've read this year!
0307716988|5.0|I have learned so much about Michael that I never knew. I like being able to hear his story from him and not a third pary that does not know what is really going on. This book makes me laugh, cry, and smile. through it I can see his life through him. It makes me love and respect him that much more for all he went through and did to make albums that he knew his fans would love. If only every artist did what he did. But this book is a testament to why he was loved like he was. A must read for all Michael Jackson fans
031606792X|4.0|SUMMARY (spoilers follow):  \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is the fourth book in the Twilight saga.  Of course, it begins where the third installment, \\"Eclipse,\\" ends. Isabella \\"Bella\\" Swan is engaged to Edward (formerly Anthony Masen) Cullen.  Edward has made a \\"deal\\" with Bella that he will change her into a vampire himself if and when they are officially married.  She has made a deal with him that she will marry him immediately if he allows her to experience intimacy with him as a human.  She doesn't want to wait until her \\"newborn thirst\\" wears off before they can consummate their vows.  It is an uneasy compromise for both of them, but they make it, all the same, because, obviously, they can't live/function well without each other.     Well, they marry and during their honeymoon...lol..., he doesn't kill her, but he impregnates her to his dismay and her joy.  They have the baby, despite a very difficult (major understatement) pregnancy.  She's turned into a vampire by Edward and survives the ordeal intact.  Meanwhile, Jacob Black, the Quileute heir of Ephraim Black and Bella's best friend who wants to be more, has realized his status as the true Alpha of the wolf pack and goes against his wolf brethren, including Alpha wolf Sam Uley, to protect Bella and the baby from their attack.  In a surprising twist (that other reviewers have revealed, unfortunately), he develops an interesting relationship with Edward, Bella, and the baby, Renesmee Carlie Cullen (a combination of her mother's and her mother -in-law's names for the first name and her father's and father-in law's names for the middle name). Some very interesting details about the wolf pack are revealed, as well.    Bella does not go through the normal \\"newborn thirst.\\"  As a matter of fact, she skips that stage altogether, much to Edward's delight.  But, the menace of the Volturi, the \\"royal family\\" of the vampire world and the law keepers, is still there.  Bella has been changed, as promised by Alice Cullen (formerly MaryAlice Brandon)and seen by Aro (one of the Volturi) in her visions, so the threat of a human knowing their secret is gone. But, there is a quagmire.  The Cullen clan could still be in jeopardy of destruction because of Renesmee.  It turns out the Volturi have ulterior sinister motives that indicate no matter how the Cullens have tried to comply with the rules, they will still destroy the coven.      The Volturi and the Cullens gather their most gifted vampires and witnesses for a very dramatic supernatural showdown.  In the end, Bella, once the pawn in the game between the Volturi and the Cullen coven, becomes a power player.  I won't reveal the end.  But, I will say that it is a very feminine way to end a battle.       REVIEW:    I love this book! It is the best book in the Twilight saga, in my opinion. It is truly a fairy tale with a sinister \\"Prince Charming.\\" This book is geared towards teenagers and young adults.  I would not suggest \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" to any child under thirteen, unless they are required to discuss it thoroughly with an adult after they read it. It has some gory parts to it and it discusses very adult topics; although, the true Brothers Grimm fairy tales are pretty gory and violent, aimed towards children, and are considered classics.  Regardless, if the story had ended any other way, I would've been truly disappointed.  Stephenie Meyer has said that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" was inspired by a \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and \\"The Merchant of Venice.\\"  I can easily see where the final \\"battle\\" was inspired by both.    (SPOILERS HERE)The only reason why I wouldn't give it five stars is because it doesn't really clarify what Bella is going to do about explaining being stuck at 18 to her mother and father, Renee Dwyer (nee Higgenbotham formerly Swan)and Charlie Swan, in the long run (I've come up with my own little back-story that includes make-up, wigs, etc...lol).  It leaves me wanting more in regards to Jacob and how his life turns out as a de facto member of the Cullen coven, essentially.  Lastly, what are the vampires that lead an \\"alternative lifestyle\\" going to do about the corrupt Volturi family? They are a constant threat to any peaceful coexistence in the vampire world. Maybe we can squeeze one more book out of Mrs. Meyer, or maybe a \\"Breaking Dawn\\" cable television series....hmmmm.        Other than that, it was a great read.  Kudos to the author! I truly enjoyed being a part of her fantasy world for the week it took me to finish the books.  I am a fan and I've already read \\"The Host.\\"
B0019MQBJW|3.0|I've been waiting for a blu-ray production of this ballet that is widescreen, superb picture and sound, that has wonderful performances, choreography and camera work.  My wishes have been only partially realized with this performance.    On the plus side, Letestu is a plaintive, haunting, lyrical, captivating, Odette.  Her Odile has a nice edge to it.  Her dancing is superb.  The camerawork and cutting is excellent giving depth and complexity to the performance that I enjoyed.  Nureyev's extended choreography seems to have added variety and complexity to many of the corps scenes.     On the negative side, first, this is a minimalist production with mostly bare stage, little scenery, which stands in the way of my expectations for a  mystical, ethereal experience.  The most glaring fault, though, for me is the intrusive inclusion of the tutor/Rothbart character as a principal dancer, often competing with and interfering with the prince, making many of the dances pas de trois rather than deux.  I understand that this was Nureyevs intent, his contribution and take on the ballet giving it his unique interpretation.  This may work for some; it did not for me.
B000KJT8IG|4.0|I love this movie. I've had the regular DVD, Extended DVD, and now the Blu-Ray version. I want to say that the Blu-ray version is only a little bit better than the older copies but, . . . don't expect this older film to have a wonderful \\"Blu-ray look\\" like the film Batman and other new films coming out these days. In some cases, I find myself distracted and noticing the graininess, in their faces mostly. I'm glad I bought it anyway, of course. If you love this movie, I say buy it!    Only one other thing that could have made it all better: Next time get Chevy Chase to do the DVD Commentary.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Wow, \\"Avatar\\" is a beautiful movie, the trailers, viewed in 2D, don't begin to do justice to the depth of artistry and imagination devoted to the creation of the world of Pandora.  The flying rock mountains, the fluorescent plantlife and animals, the soaring flying scenes are all just fantastic.  And of course, coming from the creator of the first two \\"Terminator\\" movies, the action scenes are first rate and terrifying.<br /><br />The storyline is a very recognizable one that is often repeated in American cinema.  The story is basically a combination of \\"Pocahontas\\", \\"Dances With Wolves\\",  \\"Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest\\", \\"Dune\\", \\"Tarzan\\", and lots of other similar tales of a young man's journey into heroism,  rising from nothing to become a powerful leader/defender of another people, another world.  And along this journey, the young man meets the female who will be his devoted mate for life.  The story has echoes of Joseph Campbell and \\"The Power of Myth\\",  with the added post-modern, post-Title IX twist of the female saving the life of our hero at the end.<br /><br />The fact that this story resonates so deeply in American culture is simply a reflection of its importance in early American history, as this was not a myth based on white guilt, but a true story and common occurrence.  In the early days of contact between white settlers and Indians, many young white men did in fact choose to run away from their repressive European cultures to the free and open Indian societies,  often taking an Indian woman as a wife.  Sam Houston, a hero of Texas, was but one such example of a young man who ran away to live with the Indians, taking an Indian wife along the way;  Houston did go on to lead not the Indians, but the Texans, to freedom.<br /><br />And as pointed out in the book \\"1491\\", it was this interaction between white settlers and the Indian tribes that fundamentally shaped the character of early Americans, transforming the rigid and hidebound hierarchies of their European origins into the egalitarian and libertarian ideals of Indian culture.<br /><br />Supposedly, James Cameron took four years to make this movie.  It shows in the facial features of Sam Worthington who was only 31 when he was first cast and looks noticeably younger and more baby-faced in some of the scenes compared to others.<br /><br />I kept thinking back to when the last time was that I had seen such lush and powerfully creative fantasy images - so much of the background scenery from this movie could stand on their own as superb fantasy artwork, suitable for framing.  It has been a really long time - not since the fantastic artwork of Frazetta and others in the 1970's have I seen such beautiful fantasy artwork.  And so in the end, it was not the much-hyped CGI that drew me into this movie, it was the all-encompassing, outstanding fantasy artwork which made the world of Pandora come alive.<br /><br />The movie is certainly one of Cameron's best efforts yet (supplanting \\"Aliens\\"), and worthy of repeat viewing in the theaters... now if I can just get those darned 3-D glasses to fit...<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />Well, I managed to see this movie three times now, all in 3D, the first time in Dolby 3D, the second in IMAX 3D, and the third time in Real 3D.<br /><br />The IMAX 3D was actually the worst experience for me - because of the ancient linear polarization technology, the 3D effect was lost any time I tilted my head, and I would start to see double images onscreen.  As is often cited, the IMAX technology produced the greatest amount of 3D effect, but things tended to blur in the periphery of the image onscreen.  All of this gave me a headache after three hours of watching this movie.  Part of that may have been from the effort of having to keep my head straight and level for that period of time.<br /><br />The Real 3D was probably the best experience for me - the large glasses fit easily in front of my own glasses, and I had no trouble watching the movie and getting a 3D effect.  It was the most comfortable experience, and the bright screen made the images stand out, making it look as good if not better than the IMAX images.<br /><br />The Dolby 3D was only so-so.  The biggest problem was the small glasses.  It is often mentioned that the glasses are more expensive, perhaps that's why the lenses are so much smaller than the other two technologies.  I had trouble fusing the two images together into a 3D effect at times.  The picture was not quite as bright and sharp as the other two, as this technology is projected onto a regular movie screen.  But at least I could let my head loll around during the movie.<br /><br />So if you get the chance, I would recommend going the Real 3D route.  There are websites that identify which theaters have which of the different technologies, which I will post into the comments section.and the bright screen made the images stand out, making it look as good if not better than the IMAX images.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|This DVD is my second all time favorite.  I loved the performances both dancing and singing.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|You can turn this movie into a political metaphor with ease. If you're in the Pagan Circle, you are going to love this film. As far as the exploitation theme goes, it is dead on no matter what group of Indigenous (talk about loaded language) peoples and cultures are involved.         I was well satisfied with the graphics. This is a film that had to wait to be made. George Lucas did not have the depth of field and range available to even try to do something like this.       So argue as much as you want, I liked this movie. I even went to it twice one day after the other. If you know how few theatre visits I make, then you would know what a compliment that is to the film.      It is just plain worth it to see. Have fun.

B002GU5V24|4.0|The Genesis Live box gives a great overview of the live history of Genesis. Genesis Live and Seconds Out, both here in 5.1, really benefit from the new remix. Genesis Live has some bonus tracks from 1975, which is a nice add. Three Sides Live doesn't differ a whole lot from the original issue, but no 5.1 and a very cheap insert with this title are big negatives. The Way We Walk has been sequenced with the \\"longs\\" and \\"shorts\\" albums combined into the original running order. There is a slot for 2007's Live Over Europe, but it is not included with this set. The bonus discs, CD and 5.1 DVD is a 1973 concert from the Rainbow in London which is a good compliment to the Genesis Live album. A lot of positives, good remixes, nice packaging (except for Three Sides Live), and some nice unreleased Peter Gabriel-era tracks. Negatives, no surround mixes for Three Sides Live or The Way We Walk, and a slight mastering error on the end of the first tracks on both discs of Seconds Out. Also, the packaging of Seconds Out, like The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway in the 1970-75 set, has the CD's in very tight compartments in the packaging which results in some surface scratches on the CD's and DVD. While it's great to have a nice lloking book, the discs should not become damaged by just removing them to listen to them. Overall, a good package which covers just about all phases of Genesis with Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins as frontmen.
B00110K62U|5.0|If I could own only one DVD, Les miserables would be it.  The performances were so exceptional.  The idealism of the young was so inspiring.  The conclusion when all the actors who played Valjeans in various countries was simply great.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|You can tell John Mayer is writing from where he is at emotionally right now. This album seems almost light, soft pop not as bluesy. I like it, I always like what he does. Crossroads was an interesting listen. My favorite of Clapton's, he does it good with his own tweak to it. Half of my Heart has a good beat, easy to dance to....I give it a 75. I like the whole CD, all of the songs flow one to the next and have great sound. If we are lucky, the next CD will have stronger Blues influence and less pining away for what he can't or doesn't have. My review may confuse, but rest assured I do like it and think you should buy it.
0786868724|5.0|I saw the author on The Bonnie Hunt show last week and ordred the book because I was touched by what Mitch Albom said. Got the book in the mail today late. Had read it all by midnight.

B001QOGYFY|3.0|WHITEOUT<br /><br />STARRING: Kate Beckinsale, Tom Skeritt, Gabriel Macht and Columbus Short<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Jon Hoeber, Erich Hoeber, Chad Hayes and Carey Hayes; based on the graphic novel by Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Dominic Sena<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Thriller<br />Release Date: 11 September 2009<br /><br />The problem with movies like Whiteout is if you've seen too many `Who done it' thrillers and if you've seen too many `Snow' thrillers; then you pretty much know what to expect.<br /><br />You know that there is going to be a storm. You know that the characters are going to be isolated by this storm and that transportation and or communication will not be an option.<br /><br />You know that there is going to be a guy who will be close to the heroine but may have something to hide, so he could be the guy doing the killing. You know there is going to be a funny guy who is a little too funny, so he could be doing it. You know there is going to be a guy that seems way too much like the guy who's doing it, so he obviously can't be the guy doing it. And you know there is going to be a guy who is good looking, seems genuine, but also has something to hide, so he may be doing it.<br /><br />Whiteout encases these lovely clich&eacute;s, and plenty more. There's even a scene where three characters leave a perfectly good Snow-dozer to `investigate' a mysterious patch of ice and one of them - you guessed it - falls in. Then, there's no way the other two would follow that person down into the hole right? But they would and they do and of course snow caves in, leaving them trapped because they didn't think to tell anyone where they were going!<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale plays U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko. Following a traumatic experience at her previous station in Miami, she has requested to finish her final days at a quiet post in Antarctica. We learn all of this in a series of flashbacks fed to us in teaspoons throughout the course of the film. We also know that several years ago a Russian plane crashed carrying something valuable and landed near Carrie's new post.<br /><br />It was supposed to be quiet and nice for her and is; until she finds the first dead body. Then a killer shows up dressed like the killer from Urban Legend and tries to kill everyone; obviously related to the Russian cargo of the crashed plane.<br /><br />As painfully predictable as the movie is at times, it is different from your typical thriller as well. For instance, there are several intense moments outside in the blizzard, where the characters are fighting for their lives. You realize, `Wow, it would really suck to be in that situation'. The storm is insane and chaotic and was done pretty well with CGI (computer graphic imagery). And the ending was very different and not at all what you would expect it to be. I was very pleased by it.<br /><br />I enjoyed Beckinsale's performance a great deal; especially in her emotional scenes. You really do believe that something traumatic happened to her.<br /><br />I never get tired of watching Tom Skeritt on film. He brings so much to his characters and you can't help but like him; even if you're not supposed to.<br /><br />The chemistry between Beckinsale and Skeritt's characters was astonishing. They play old friends who trust each other and enjoy the company of one another, probably more than they do of anyone else stationed at the base. Neither one of them belongs there; they are just at points in their lives that have led them there and we believe it.<br /><br />Overall, the film was entertaining. Predictable at times yes; but different in others. I just wish there was more suspense. Some scenes seemed to drag on a little longer than they should without something startling happening.<br /><br />And I have to say that I feel the director (Dominic Sena) could have done a lot more with the film. After all, he did direct two of the best action thrillers ever made: Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish. I guess they can't all be winners.econds and Swordfish. I guess they can't all be winners.
B00008K7AM|5.0|The Hot Chick has become my new favorite stuck-in-someone-else's-body film, usurping the formerly untopple-able All Of Me, from the 1980's, starring Steve Martin.  While Martin's physical comedy far outstrips Rob Schneider's, Schneider brings a sweetness and believability to the screen, and as the movie progresses I grew very fond of him...er, her.    If you enter into the movie with a critical eye, you'll still come out impressed.  Rachel McAdams and her movie friends give flawless performances.  There isn't a false note played.      It's not just for teenagers.  I'm over 50 and enjoyed it immensely.  Do yourself a favor and watch this one just for fun.
B002NPCSJG|5.0|I usually don't read science fiction, but decided to give this book a chance. I'm glad I did this was a highly enjoyable read. I really like the fact that the book was a fast pace tight read. I was hooked by page 20 and finished the book in a day. Also the techno jargon is keep to a reasonable level so its not difficult for the average person to follow. I'm already starting up on the lost colony, and looking forward to reading more books from Scalzi

0307269981|5.0|Having just finished reading \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" for the second time, I am more convinced than ever that it is one of the best crime novels in years, and one of the best novels I have read in a long time. The second in a trilogy by Swedish writer Stieg Larsson, it again features Lisbeth Salander -- one of the strongest and most fascinating female characters I have encountered in fiction -- and journalist Mikael Blomqvist in a long, convoluted tale of murder and intrigue that is not only believable, but impossible to put down. If you haven't yet read it, buy a copy and read it...twice. The second read was at least as good as the first, and I discovered important clues that I had missed the first time. This book, like the first one \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", is sure to get a 3rd read some time in the next few months.<br /><br />The third volume in the trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\", will be released in the U.S. in Spring 2010. I can hardly wait. If it's half as good as the first two, it will join them as international bestsellers. A sad biographical note about author Stieg Larsson is that he died of a heart attack, at age 50, a few days after delivering the manuscripts of the trilogy to his agent.<br /><br />A 5-Star + read
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Okay, we all know about \\"the Circle of Life\\" by now, right?  It's the idea that life is connected and sacred, and the idea has become a huge cliche that makes even the tree-huggers among us (of which I am one) groan by now.  We've all seen the \\"Avatar\\" premise in many previous movies; it's a story about how the native people of America/Japan/the jungle/etc are connected to the land and respect it, and the invaders that come in pursuit of material gain are Bad, Bad, Bad.    \\"Avatar\\", however, embraced its sci-fi side to take the metaphor to a whole different level.  The native people of Pandora aren't just attuned to the land, they're literally connected it.  They can't just leave their home; it would be like you or I trying to scoop out part of our brain and function without it.  Thus, we the human invaders aren't just destroying a culture when we start burning Pandora to the ground to steal its resources, we're literally signing a death warrant for living creatures as intelligent and developed as ourselves.    With that bit of imagination, \\"Avatar\\" became both an allegory for colonization (like \\"Dances With Wolves\\", \\"Fern Gully\\", \\"Last Samurai\\"), and also a tale of survival.  Our heroes are fighting not just for their beliefs, but for life itself against enemies who are unable or unwilling to spare them as long as there's profit to be made.  Thus, \\"Avatar\\" is both a classic story and a new one with a truly modern twist.    The rest has been said: the visuals are stunning, the acting is great, the story flows well and never gets dull despite its length.  \\"Avatar\\" isn't for everyone, being heavy-handed and light on characterization.  But as a visual spectacle, a sci-fi adventure tale, and an epic story of survival and love, \\"Avatar\\" is perfect.

As such, they enjoy can do no wrong status in my lights. While I originally watched them with the uncritical eyes of a very young child, I must admit that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang suffers the most of the two from reviewing as an adult, crossing the line into twee treacle near the beginning and infantile silliness near the end, which Willy Wonka never does. Still (and I know this is self-contradictory) the film will remain forever perfect for those of us who first encountered it When We Were Very Young. (With the notable exception of the unbearable musical number \\"Lovely Lonely Man\\", which always has served as a room clearing test of willpower for any viewer. Hated it then, hate it now. If you can make it through that song, the rest is golden. Never in my life have I ever met anyone who goes around humming Lovely, Lonely Man, which is something I can't say for any of the other songs in the film.)<br /><br />That being said, for the love of all that is holy, do yourself a favor and do not purchase the full screen version of this film. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a widescreen film that makes continuous use of the full widescreen picture plane, so watching the pan & scan version is an exercise in deep frustration, especially (but not only) for those of us who are very familiar with the film. The only reason I purchased the full screen disc way back when it was first released, was that it was the only version available, and my deep seated love for the film overcame my equally deep seated hatred of pan & scan.

B002RSDW80|4.0|I can boil water. My \\"soul mate\\" can boil water and, in addition, throw something into the pot. That, sadly, is the extent of our culinary acumen. That condition, nevertheless, does not preclude said \\"soul mate\\" from enthusiastically partaking in the recent mania for all things cookery. This last sentence is a round-about way of getting to the why of reviewing this recent film centered on a parallel presentation of the lives of a modern (maybe, post-modern, blog and all), alienated, middle class woman who gets caught up in a French cooking frenzy and the American post-World War II \\"queen\\" of that domain, the alienated, upper middle class woman, Julia Child.    Now it would be quite easy to sneer at the original premise of the plot- connecting the high-pitched old PBS icon Child with a \\"thoroughly modern Millie\\", Julie, in a fluffy, feel good piece of film about the travails of finding meaning in modern day life. Or to look askance at those old OSS (predecessor of the CIA) connections of old Julia and her husband, Paul. Or, more interestingly, the <em>noblesse oblige</em> premise of an intelligent woman with time on her hands behind her manic struggle to publish a book on fine French cooking for the average, servantless American housewife.    On most days I would be more than happy to throw some barbs that way. But here is the \\"skinny\\". This is just , in its own way, a funny look at a couple of slices of Americana. Beside that, who has time to be critical, in the above-mentioned ways, when you have to concentrate on watching Meryl Streep BE Julia Child. (Director Nora Ephron, apparently, just let Streep goes through her paces, thankfully). As always that actress turns in a sterling performance, no matter what the part. Moreover, if those are not good and sufficient reasons for taking a dive on this subject, please remember that \\"soul mate\\", who loved this film. I do not want to have to revive, in our household, the old tradition of having someone else taste my food before I eat it.
6305313687|4.0|This movie is pure propaganda to get white people to dislike their race even more and to embrace the ills of multiculturalism.  Here in California we are the eighth largest economy in the world and we have been embracing multicultaralism for a long, long time.  I personally know for a fact that any good things about it, are heavily outweighed by the bad things.  It is fun to get to know other cultures, and one grows and learns a lot about themselves in the process, but it comes at a terrible price.  Multiculturalism is a looting of culture and tradition.  It is also the means to lower a people from prosperous, down into the ranks of the nothingness pool of poverty and enslavement.  Think that I'm just bigoted and don't know what I'm talking about?  I would've said the same thing to me a few years back, as I was also heavily indoctrinated by the media, believing that to roll out the red carpet to all peoples from all lands was an enlightened, peaceful position to be at.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Realize that you are not to blame if other countries have become rotten from the inside out.  Drop your guilt trip.<br /><br />American History X is a good movie, I highly doubt there is anyone disputing that.  Back in the mid-90s when I was attending the College of San Mateo, we watched it in my 3rd World Cinema class (a controversial class taught by a very opinionated black panther, and where my self-hatred really took hold).  It's a great movie to watch if you want to have a debate about racial issues afterwords.  But the scales are tipped in favor of non-white races in the movie.  If you can't immediately see that then just pay attention to the opinions in your debate, almost everyone will be defending every race but the white race after the movie.  It has always been one of my favorite movies, but now that I am learning to actually like my own people again, I see it for what it is, yet another brilliant propaganda piece made by Holly Wood, which is in fact an elitist magical world wanded by people who are not of my race, and who are famous for hating my race.  Disinformation is a lie sandwich, it will have good truth on the outer layers but a bad lie sandwiched in the middle.  This movie is no different.........<br /><br />The good message: You cannot judge a whole race badly based on the actions of a few bad eggs within it.  Every tree has it's good apples and it's rotten apples.  One must learn to judge people on an individual basis.<br /><br />The bad message: If you're a white man, then you should kiss black people's butts because they are more fun and let's face it, you owe it to them.  If you don't, then your white brothers and sisters are going to rape and kill you, because that is the real nature of the savage and ignorant white goyim family.  Blacks, Mexicans, and Jewish people are just innocent victims of the system, but they want revenge against you for all the atrocities that the system has committed against them, hopefully by your catering to them left and right you can eventually make ammends.<br /><br />\\"Ha ha whitey, now the whole world is blaming you for our actions.\\"itist magical world wanded by people who are not of my race, and who are famous for hating my race.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Alicia did it again. I don't get why people keep saying that this album is boring. I think it's just what the title says, it will help you feel free. It has songs for everyone. I love Alicia and after you buy this album, I'm sure you will too.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|So how is Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? I thought it was great and worth the delay. It has a few problems, but its good points outweigh its bad ones by far.    The movie vesion of Half-Blood Prince is easily the one of the darkest Potter films (apparently the rating doesn't matter very much) but it is also one of the most humorous. The film features performances from Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson that are all excellent with other great performances by Michael Gambon and Jim Broadbent, as well. The film, particularly the memory scenes, make marvelous use of dark greens and gray colors with plenty of special effects to recreate the grim atmosphere of the book. Frank Dillane is perfect in his performance as the teenage Voldemort during some of the flashbacks, creating a reserved scariness while maintaining the squeaky-clean appearance of Tom Riddle. Yet the movie balances the creepy parts with the funny scenes, mainly involving the relationship between Ron and Lavender Brown. Director David Yates improves his skills since the last film with a more involving and entertaining one here.    What confused me was the choice of what was taken out and what was added to the film. As with all book-based films, some edits were necessary to allow the movie to have a smooth run time (which never feels too long), while others make very little sense at all. Most of the memory scenes were completely removed, leaving only the \\"essentials\\". I wonder how they will explain a Horcrux such as Hufflepuff's Cup without the part included in book 6 that reveals its significance. I could not figure out why the fight scene at The Burrow was added, but I didn't mind. Perhaps to achieve a run time of about 2 1/2  hours, the film feels as though it were heavily edited in some scenes.    While not completely flawless, the filmmakers achieved what they set out to do very well with the sixth installment in the Harry Potter series. Check it out, this movie is definitely worthwhile!

0679410503|3.0|All the positive reviews of these three Vampire Chronicles state the absolute truth about the books. AND about the unabridged recording of the Interview with the Vampire book that is NOT included in this set.<br /><br />What people fail to mention about this set is that each book is reduced to only 2 hours of reading time each. The original Interview book was recorded on 13 CDs (that means Interview was recorded on 13 CDs for approximately 15 hours of unabridged story, versus 2 hours on these cassettes.)<br /><br />How can you possibly do justice to these books in 1/8th of the time? That is only 1/8th of an incredibly rich story.<br /><br />Just say no to this and read the book for yourself.
160094048X|5.0|Still rocks!  On to update this after eating the \\"Lazy Samoas\\" we baked for the holidays this year.  AWESOME!!!  Son is now ten and we have tapped into this many times over the past year.  Also their cupcake book is awesome.  His teacher asked that I send the vegan chocolate cupcakes in for a holiday party because the class devoured them at his birthday.  These ladies know vegan cooking!  This cookbook rocks!!!  ...[[ASIN:1569242739 Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World: 75 Dairy-Free Recipes for Cupcakes that Rule]]I bought this for my nine year-old son for Christmas, but gifted it to him early so that we could bake some holiday cookies together.  He has multiple food allergies and this amazing cookbook has given him deliciousness that he has never experienced up to now!!!  I've certainly made him some cookies over the years, but generally by making substitutions in recipes that call for dairy and eggs, so the texture is not always quite right and our brownies have generally been disastrous.  The brownies in here call for tofu, and he can't have soy... but I'm wondering if we could pull it off with banana or avocado instead.  I wasn't even aware that vegan chocolate chips are out there on the market.  In addition to the recipes, there is an introductory section that discusses ingredients, substitutions, tools for cookie success.  There is a plethora of recipes AND useful information!  Hmmm... We'll still have to do some subbing or skip some recipes altogether because of nut allergies (I don't know if sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds would cut it in place of nuts in lots of the cookies?), but can't wait to make over 30 of the recipes that we've tagged as safe or easily substitutable!  We've already made the peanut butter chocolate pillows, though we made them with sunflower nut butter instead, and they were SCRUMPTIOUS!  This evening he picked out the mocha mamas.  Again I subbed instant coffee for the coffee extract, but they are KILLER!  Had to limit his cookie intake, though, so he won't be awake all night.  I can't wait until he unwraps his cupcake cookbook by the same authors on Christmas day!!!  Next time I send goodies in to school, I think his classmates will really dig them!  THANK YOU LADIES!  Your cookbook ROCKS!  Signed, One Happy Mama!
B0000B1OGD|4.0|As the 1960's were coming to an end and, in the cautionary sf film era of 2001 and PLANET OF THE APES, Ray Harryhausen resurrects an old Willis O'Brien idea about cowboys tangling with dinosaurs.  This is an entertaining movie -- sure, everything that came before JURASSIC PARK suffers by comparrison -- with James Franciscus (BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES), Gila Golan (OUR MAN FLINT) and Richard Carlson (CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON).  Not on par with Harryhausen's best: 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD and JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, but a fun romp.  A popcorn picture.  Only extra is the trailer.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|I am a slight cynic at the moment regarding the whole love themed films, but this one actually came across as enjoyably fake (dance scene, a narrator, split screen) yet realistically adept in carrying it through to the end (in other words it might change your outlook). This definitely makes the recommendation list for both genders and all adult-aged groups looking for a smart, well written story. The Blu took hours to watch all it had to offer so I figure fans of this film will be wanting to know about the BD: worth it.<br /><br />The picture quality is solid most of the time (reference the facial hair visible to the count during the final bench scene between them), with the split screens being the only real falter I saw. The DTS is well done and much clearer than the last few DTS films I watched this weekend. The supplements are lengthy and include:<br /><br />* Making-of, 29:21 minutes. The unique style of filmmaking and storyline come across to the features also. The interviews and logistics of making this are covered in such a way as to not be boring. 30 minutes can go long on docs like this but it was worth the time.<br />* Summer at Sundance, 13:46 minutes. The usual coverage of a behind-the-scenes look at doing the Sundance thing, with a couple extra jokes thrown in.<br />* Audition tapes, optional commentary on Gubler, Arend - never been a fan of these.<br />* Storyboards, optional commentary. Different angles of a couple scenes, lasts a few minutes.<br />* Bank Dance, 4:17 minutes. A great sequence that could be a short film on its own - worth your time if you pick this as the only supplement to watch; essentially a musical/dance number with our main two cast during a bank robbery.<br />* Sid & Nancy, 3:28 minutes. A brief skit on our main two role-playing again, except all dressed up in the circa clothing and fighting away.<br />* Music video, 3:55 minutes. Sweet Disposition by Temper Trap. Trippy little video with lots of interesting visuals.<br />* Conversations with Zooey & Levitt, 12:26 minutes. This was one of the most sincere interview sessions I have seen as a supplement. They ask each other questions over coffee and are having a good time doing it. Great material if you are into these two actors.<br />* Filmmaking specials, 4 segments totaling 6 minutes. The director gets couch-interviewed over varying topics including casting, the French references and color palettes. Was a little irritating as no play all option so you have to re-navigate each time.<br />* Filmmaking specials, 2 segments from Fox for less than 6 minutes. Standard fluff interviews for the Fox network.<br />* Commentary with the director, the two writers and Levitt. You will probably dig this if after watching the making-of you get an idea of what the crew's personalities are like - and you want to hear them talk for a couple hours.<br />* Deleted & Extended scenes, 14:42 minutes. Some of them were funny and/or relevant so I would have liked them in the film, but I understand why they cut out everyone talking to the camera, would have felt a little too much like Paper Heart.<br /><br />The audio is 5.1 DTS, a descriptive audio track is included, also Spanish, French, or Port 5.1. Subtitled in English, Spanish, Cantonese, Port, Mandarin and Thai. Region A coded. Disc 2 is the Dig Copy for Mac & PC. You can download the free app for doing the iPhone stuff also.<br /><br />As stated in the film, a story about love, but not a love story. Overall a great product worth the purchase for fans and non-fans alike. Enjoy.This was one of the most sincere interview sessions I have seen as a supplement.

B000EBD9TY|4.0|I absolutely hate to deduct a star from this movie.  It's my favorite play, but therein lies the problem.  Williams and Kazan were forced to alter much of the dialog, and more specifically, the ending of this movie to fit censorship standards.  As happy as it makes me feel to see Stella not go back to Stanley in the end, I know that's not the way it's meant to be.  Neither is Mitch supposed to stand up for Blanche at the end.  This is a great movie.  The acting (specifically on Leigh and Brando's end) is superb.  The cinematography and general direction is beautiful.  It deserves all of it's awards, and it's reputation.  It's the standard by which I judge all other Blanche and Stanley's by, but I simply cannot overlook the horrible injustice that was done in editing the story to fit someone's arbitrary moral standings.  The fact that this movie will forever be compromised is one of the greatest tragedies in American cinema.  It's just awful, and if I loved the story any less I would give it a 1 star rating just to register my disgust.
B00005JM8V|5.0|I have been reading and studying about the Holocaust for roughly 45 years.  When I was young I couldn't understand how such a thing could occur and yet it did and on such a mammouth scale that comprehension still escapes us.  I had heard about \\"Shoah\\" for anumber of years and would have watched it sooner except I could never find it on any available network or other outlet.  Thus I bought my own copy and watched it over the course of a couple of months.      \\"Shoah\\" is a set of 4 DVDs that have approximately 125 \\"chapters\\" overall and a viewing time of 9 1/2 hours.  It consists of a number of interviews with Holocaust survivors, witnesses and even a few participants.  The series of interviews are generally in a loosely chronological order as far as the events they describe.  This makes for a more orderly (if that is possible) and focused perspective.  The overall cast of interviewees are somewhat limited (thanks largely to the SS and similar obstacles) yet they provide a great deal of detailed eyewitness accounts of their experiences.  There are two or three German officials interviewed (one who was apparently unaware he was being recorded) and their information was also an important inclusion in the overall accounts.  The interviews often took place indoors but the director used plenty of outdoor footage of the actual sites in which the events being described took place.  The last part of the last DVD focuses on the Warsaw Ghetto and the subsequent uprising.  The account of Simha Rottem, a survivor of the Warsaw Getto uprising, may have been the most impressive of the many soberly stunning accounts in the film.      There are some aspects of the movie that I found less absorbing than others but they were very few.  I thought that the director, Claude Lanzmann, spent too much time talking to Raul Hilberg, an historian.  Mr. Hilberg had some relevant things to offer but he was an outsider in a film made up of interviewers with insiders.  There was also a Polish leader by the name of Jan Karski who had a real hard time getting himself up to talking about what he had witnessed in the Warsaw Ghetto.  I thought that his reaction to the relatively \\"tame\\" events and observations he shared were also out of sinc with the rest of the film.      \\"Shoah\\" is essential viewing for serious students of the Holocaust.  The greater monstrosities are all there as well as the day to day life and the acceptance that their survival may have been as incomprehensible as the events they survived.  There were a number of times during \\"Shoah\\" when the survivor is relating his observations almost non-challantly only to come to a point where a sudden reminder of a person, a comment, or an incident emotionally overwhelms them completely.  After a moment or two of sheer anguish, the speaker continues on with his account as though nothing had interrupted his \\"presentation\\".  The mixture of Humanity and inhumanity is the ultimate greatness of \\"Shoah\\".
0767847431|4.0|After the less than stellar box office of VALLEY OF GWANGI, Ray Harryhausen and Charles Schneer return to the saga of Sinbad, this played with some gusto by John Phillip Law.  A beautiful damsel Caroline Munro (THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, CAPTAIN KRONOS), an evil wizard played by Tom Baker (tv's 4th DR WHO) with Douglas Wilmer (EL CID, OCTOPUSSY).  A quest for Lemuria and a magic fountain, this one features batlike spies, a sword battle with six armed Kali, a Centaur Grffin fight and a scantilly clad Munro!  Not as good as 7TH VOYAGE but it was a box office success. Extras are featurettes on MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, EARTH VS THE FLYING SAUCERS & 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVAR.

The remix of \\"My Girl\\" is snappy too.  Worth the five bucks or so.

B002VPE1AM|1.0|If this was the movie James Cameron has wanted to do since he was a teen, then maybe he should have taken better notes, or should have taken a very sharp editor's eye to his script.<br /><br />Because while this film is indeed pretty and a spellbinding achievement in the most stunningly realistic CG of any movie today, the plot is almost insulting in how stale, cliche'd, and just plain boring, ordinary, and generic it is.  There's no surprises to be had; you know exactly who's going to win and who's going to lose, you know exactly how different action (not just fight) sequences will turn out, you know exactly what characters will live and which will die, which ones will have an abrupt Heel-Face turn, and which ones will turn out to be good all along.<br /><br />I can't really tell just why such a film like this comes out so cheesey and cliche' in terms of its plot, whereas a film like Star Wars, in its trilogy, contains a great many classical and common elements of folk tale and mythology and literature, and yet manages to be a stellar and timeless story.<br /><br />This story in \\"Avatar\\" is anything but.  The only thing that will be memorable of this movie is its visual effects.<br /><br />Right from the start, the film does wonders with visual effects, showing us a highly realistic-looking sleeper ship, and a zero-g environment on board, that neither looks overly cartoony or overly CG'd.  It looks perfectly real all around.<br /><br />Every effect just screams \\"real real real!\\", from the computer monitors and holographic displays, to the plants and vegetation and variety of animals.  Cameron does not overindulge us by making us look at everything in detail, showing off, but neither does he rush through intricate details in an attempt to stay grounded to the script.  It's a perfect mix of showing us nifty new creatures and inventions without stalling long enough to make us think he's showing off.<br /><br />The Na'vi start off looking quite real, but very blatantly CG.  There's a very slight sense of artificiality in the Avatars when they are first on screen, and shown awakening and interacting with humans.  But as the movie progresses, the effects seem to get better and better, to a point where towards the end, when Na'vi and Humans interact closely, both of them look incredibly REAL, as though the Na'vi were a huge puppet creation, and yet it's entirely CG.<br /><br />Where they went all-out with the visuals, they completely lost it with the story.  It becomes less \\"Avatar\\" and more \\"Dances With Wolves In Space\\" or virtually any Generic Action/Adventure Film In Space.  The parallels with Dances With Wolves are the most powerful, likely due to the commonplace aspect of it.<br /><br />But the story doesn't treat this as some sort of surprise.  Nor does it even try to be distinct in some way.  You know exactly how characters are going to react to situations.  You know exactly what's going to happen next.  You know that the Generic Nerd Sidekick appears jealous and resentful of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) now, but you know later on he's going to become the HERO who tries to save him.  You know that Sully is going to be initially hated by Action Girl Love Interest (Zoe Saldana), but eventually get her to love him, You know that Bad Ass Action Girl (Michelle Rodriguez) is going to betray the humans and side with Sully and the Na'vi.  You know that certain characters are going to die.  You know that Sully will earn the trust and respect of the tribe.  You know that Sully is going to admit he's been spying on the Na'vi, and cause Action Girl Love Interest to cry and scream and hate him and tell him to go away, You know this and that and everything.<br /><br />It's all so obvious that it becomes stupefyingly boring, and you wouldn't have ever noticed that fact if the movie weren't so much fun to look at.<br /><br />But while the effects and even much of the story was interesting enough to keep me drawn in, the most spectacular visual effect focus was on the Na'vi themselves...  and the Na'vi themselves, as a society, were a breakneck yank out of immersion, and into a silly and childish realization:<br /><br />\\"They are exact alien copies of Native Americans!\\"<br /><br />They are exact copies, from the mohawks, to the way the Elder Father and Mother characters look and dress and sound, to the high pitched yipping sound they give in battle, they are EXACT COPIES of Native Americans.<br /><br />It would seem to me that this element was lazily left in from the ripping off of the plot of \\"Dances With Wolves\\", and that would probably be a great discussion point, but like a great many modern \\"PC\\" portrayals of Native Americans, they sugarcoat them so much, they become just as racist as the Savage Red Man (Blue Man?) portrayed in older stories.<br /><br />These Na'vi Americans are so in touch with their environment, they can talk to animals by sticking tentacles in their hair into plugs coming out of the animals' heads.<br /><br />They can wrap these tentacles around long tendrils from the \\"Tree of Souls\\" to pray directly to their God.  They have to cry and chant a ritual chant every time they kill an animal.  They use bow and arrows, ride on animals, and make yipping sounds like the Natives in old \\"cowboy and indian\\" movies and storypieces.<br /><br />It wouldn't be so bad, and it never really ventures into a racist depiction (especially since most of all these are ALIENS and not Native Americans), but the parallels are too strong to ignore---this is not even a metaphor or parody or Horatian satire, these Na'vi are nearly word-for-word copies of stereotypical Native Americans, with a little bit from everywhere, such as the Caribbean-sounding Elder Mother, to the \\"Great Chief Man Sitting Bull\\" sounding Elder Father, to the Warrior Son with the mohawk and pithy attitude to Sully.<br /><br />But since these AREN'T Native Americans and they ARE aliens, James Cameron can get away with essentially portraying them as the stereotype of the \\"in perfect harmony and touch with mother nature\\" good guys, whereas the Humans, with the exception of only the obvious ones and the Nerdy Pacifist Scientists, are all evil, greedy, corporate-thinking scum who can't do anything with a planet except rape it and kill it slowly for resources, as though environmentalism efforts today would never ever work out or catch on.  THANKS FOR THE FAITH, CAMERON!<br /><br />While the story is essentially glossed over with a spiffy coat of paint to seem new-ish, there's no real need to worry about spoilers---there's nothing here we haven't seen before, and nothing here that wasn't told better and more realistically in other movies and stories.<br /><br />It's a stereotypical \\"White Men vs Indians\\" tale of the 90s, with the evil Humans being thwarted by the holy Na'vi.<br /><br />And yet we get the Unfortunate Implication that the Na'vi apparently could not have survived or banded together without the leadership of Jake Sully, White Man Sky Person.<br /><br />THANKS FOR THE SUBTLE RACISM, JAMES CAMERON!lves, as a society, were a breakneck yank out of immersion, and into a silly and childish realization:      \\"They are exact alien copies of Native Americans!\\"      They are exact copies, from the mohawks, to the way the Elder Father and Mother characters look and dress and sound, to the high pitched yipping sound they give in battle, they are EXACT COPIES of Native Americans.

B001KOFH2G|4.0|Not going to give a full review; if you're buying it, you probably already know how great the movie itself is.<br /><br />I'd just like to point out that the CG effects don't hold up well in HD; they give themselves away instantly as CG: they look too clean and perfect to be real, something far less noticeable in the standard-def version. It's a significant distraction.
0143034901|5.0|This was our monthly selection at book club for November.. and I'm so glad!  I LOVED it.  While it starts of sort of  slow, it develops into an incredibly suspenseful story, with rich characters, surprising twists, and a compelling backdrop.  I highly recommend it!
0142406112|3.0|I enjoyed this book but it isn't nearly as good as the books that come later in the series. I am glad i read it and maybe my giving it a 3 star rating is only because i have already read all of the books in the series up to Snakehead. If i had written a review of Stormbreaker before I read any of the other books than i might give it 4 stars. But i am giving it 3 stars because as the series continues it just gets better and better. The first 3 books are all good but i don't think the Alex Rider series really kicks into gear until the 4Th book. And after that it never lets up. This series is a lot of fun for all ages.

B001CC7PP8|5.0|The 2008 special edition of Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" brings to modern audiences the spine-chilling thrills of the original plus a great deal more.  The digitally remastered print is impeccable and enables viewers to appreciate the set design; the chiaroscuro lighting in which sharp contrasts between light and dark add to the atmosphere of impending doom; and the amazing performances of the leads and the supporting cast.  The brilliant Anthony Perkins fully inhabits Norman Bates's character and, for reasons that defy understanding, did not receive an Academy Award nomination as best actor.  Also snubbed by the Academy was Bernard Hermann, whose iconic score was played entirely on stringed instruments.  Every scene featuring Hermann's music is enhanced by it, especially the famous shower sequence that had audiences in 1960 screaming their heads off.  The wonderful Janet Leigh was nominated for her believable portrayal of Marion Crane, an ordinary woman desperate to make a life for herself with the hunky John Gavin. Martin Balsam, a savvy character actor, is a private detective hired to track down Marion when she disappears.  Vera Miles, Crane's sister, Lila, aggressively pursues any clue that will help her find Marion.  Ultimately, however, Perkins's performance is the one that everyone remembers.  His stuttering speech, darting eyes, birdlike movements, ghoulish taxidermy hobby, nervous munching, and references to his overbearing mother all combine to create a character for the ages.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is carefully thought out and beautifully realized.  Hitchcock planned every frame in advance, hired a talented and creative screenwriter, Joseph Stefano, a wonderful cinematographer, John Russell, and a skilled film editor, George Tomasini.  The cast and crew worked tirelessly to put Hitchcock's vision on the screen.  The shower scene alone took seven days to complete.  The result is a terrifying and mesmerizing film that explores such themes as voyeurism, dysfunctional relationships, bad choices that wreck our lives, and the secrets and lies that entrap even the most average people.<br /><br />The extras are eye-opening.  They include informative feature commentary delivered by Stephen Rebello, author of \\"Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho.\\"  Rebello helps us appreciate Hitchcock's ability to get around the stringent censorship code, his groundbreaking use of camera angles, and his juxtaposition of wry humor and horrific violence. In addition, the late Janet Leigh tells us how much she loved working with \\"Mr. Hitchcock,\\" whom she respected greatly; she was happy to do whatever he asked of her.  Stefano found Hitchcock to be warm and approachable, not at all a cold and forbidding auteur.  We also hear from Hitchcock's daughter, Pat, and his assistant director, who notes Hitchcock's close attention to every detail, including lighting, set design, and special effects.  In addition, there is archival footage of hundreds of people waiting on long lines to get into the film when it was first released, since no one was admitted after the show began.  This gimmick inflamed people's curiosity and helped make \\"Psycho\\" a box office bonanza.  Hitchcock's legacy is discussed  by such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, who admits that he has frequently paid homage to Hitchcock, whom he considers to be one of the most imitated directors of all time.  This superb two-disc set is a must-see for fans of \\"Psycho.\\"  Just one bit of advice:  Don't watch it while you are in the house alone.ism, dysfunctional relationships, bad choices that wreck our lives, and the secrets and lies that entrap even the most average people.

B002NXSRVG|2.0|It seems this is the decade for resurrecting old cartoons as movie franchises.  Starting with x-Men, then Spiderman, then Transformers, and now G.I. Joe, each one has been jazzed up sex appeal, great special effects, big budgets, and a host of movie stars young and old.  Unfortunately, all of this does not replace a good script and authentic details, both of which are lacking in this movie.      First, the general premise of the movie is nonsensical.  To begin, we have an evil scientist who builds the world's ultimate weapon, metal-eating nanobots, on NATO's dime.  This grand weapon is then delivered to NATO in the middle of a foreign country, to be transferred in a small convoy to storage.  Last time I checked, the biggest and baddest weapons were usually developed at very secure national laboratories or military bases guarded by a whole lot of soldiers.  For something so valuable to be transported across open country guarded by a handful of trucks is ridiculous.  And this is how this movie begins.  But of course we need such a ridiculous setup to allow the aforementioned evil scientist the opportunity to steal said weapon.  Why didn't this mad scientist just program his nanobots to come alive while en route and destroy the convoy that was carrying them?    Another big problem in the script are the battle scenes, specifically how open they are.  Both the good guys and the bad guys in this movie are supposed to be the world's top experts in covert action.  Yet they walk around in very eye-catching outfits, pulling the trigger in very public places.  So much for \\"covert\\" action.  Talking about the outfits, why does the Baroness walk into battle with her breasts half-exposed.  Are they supposed to distract her targets (men mainly) so she can get of the first shot?  And the long hair?  Come on, anyone who has served in the armed forces knows that long hair is a no-no; they easily get caught or tangled up.    And then we have various issues with casting.  First of, whyis the US president played by a British actor, Jonathan Price, who clearly speaks with a British accent in the movie.  Come on, this is the year of Obama; get someone like Morgan Freeman or Denzel Washington to play the president.  Or at least an American who does not speak with a European accent.  And then notice almost everyone of note in either the G.I. Joe side or Cobra's side is either American or British.  We have two characters of Middle Eastern descent, and one japanese ninja.  Last time I checked, South Africa, Russia, Israel, Argentina, Colombia and numerous other countries outside of NATO have produced their fair share of para-military and cover action operatives, many of which operate on the free market.  Why is there nobody from these places featured in this movie?      These are all big misses.  There are lots of smaller ones also, but I think you get my point.  It was overall, an OK movie thats worth the time to watch on DVD.  I'm just glad I didn't spend 10 bucks to see it on the big screen.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|Ok...1st, this aint gonna be long.  Plenty of reviews on here already that accurately describe the movie.  It's a pretty good story-line, but some of the scenes get a bit long and drawn out.  The scenes you want to be longer are short and to the point.  Bradd Pitt does a nice job with his character, but unfortunately, he doesn't get a lot of air time in the movie.  That is the one area I think they really could have done better in this movie...more scenes with Pitt's 'Basterds' going about the countryside and killing more Nazi's.  The story line seems to shift more to Nazi character development and the one Jewish girl who wants revenge.    Also, if you hate reading subtitles in movies then you might want to AVOID this one.  Probably close to 1/3 or more of the movie is in subtitles (french, german, italian is spoken).  It didn't bother me so much, but the subtitles aren't up there for long so you'll have to read quick!  Especially in some of those long drawn out scenes I wrote of earlier.    All in all a good movie worth renting.  Some action (but not as much as u probably expect), some drama (too much), and a little bit of Tarantino's dark humour.  Check it out...
0226264211|5.0|Milton Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 1976 and this book is a testimony to his brilliance.  In just thirteen brief chapters he outlines and explains the relationship between capitalism and freedom.  Friedman succinctly explains the concept of economic activities wherein the totalitarian state uses coercion versus the market place that relies upon voluntary cooperation.  He also identifies that \\"political freedom means the absence of coercion of a man by his fellow men,\\" a lesson to be learned by our political elites.  He explains the roles of government as rule maker and umpire ... responsible for the maintenance of law and order.  In this capacity he also identifies \\"social security\\" insurance and public housing as not fitting the proper role of the US government.  Friedman next explains Lenin's famous dictum that \\"the most effective way to destroy a society is to destroy its money\\"(p.39); and that the recessions of 1920-21, 1929-33, and 1937-38 were made more severe by the Federal Reserve (p. 45).  Friedman was one of the first to challenge the Federal Governments logic that they must spend to eliminate unemployment ... explaining that this just does not work.  He also challenges equality of income as a social goal advocating instead, \\"to each according to what he and the instruments he owns produces.\\"<br /><br />This book is strongly recommended for anyone aspiring to elected office.  Milton Friedman demonstrates more common sense than the entirety of our elected officials in Washington DC.<br /><br />[[ASIN:143274917X Tea Party Revival: The Conscience of a Conservative Reborn:  The Tea Party Revolt Against Unconstrained Spending and Growth of the Federal Government]]
B001FB55I0|4.0|While this is no T2 (the best in the franchise, in my opinion), Salvation is at least better than T3 which was a ham-fest.  This provides a different view on the Terminator series in the sense that it does take place in 2018.  I went in to this movie with little or no expectations because of the bad reviews and came out pleasantly surprised.  It's a decent film.   I would (and have) watch it more than once.  What this says for my intelligence is questionable (as it seems to be made with someone with a low IQ) but sometimes these mindless-fun popcorn movies end up being the best guilty pleasures.
B001E45XT4|3.0|Be sure when you remove them or put them back on that you do so with both sides of the headset at the same time.    After about 6 months of use, and having the habit of always removing the headset with just 1 hand, the frame snapped.  The frame is not very strong in general, so be very gentle with these.    Otherwise, great sound.
0380977273|5.0|This is a tale of two boys: Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, one cautious, one adventurous and both who like to play and get in trouble as all young boys do. It also tells of the relationship between Will and his father who is an old man and has always felt that he hasn't been there for his boy because of his age.    A carnival comes into town, and when Bradbury terms it carnival that means it's bad, because circuses are fun whereas carnivals hold the freaks and are dark. And that is exactly what it is; the carnival arrives at the evil time of 3:00 am in the morning unannounced and mysteriously sets up camp in one night. The carnival, as expected, draws in all the residents of Green Town, Illinois with its promises of fun and a good time for all. What the local residents do not notice that is for a select few the carnival, run by Mr. Dark, offers even more than fun, it offers dreams fulfilled.    Jim and Will come across this revelation as they are sneaking around like young boys do, and they happen to be the only ones in town that know this carnival is evil, and they are praying on the towns people. Obviously, as boys, no one will believe them, except Will's father who for once in his life is able to help the boy and confront the carnival and Mr. Dark.    This is obviously a classic in literature, and a classic for the horror field, the way Bradbury creates such a believable fantastic setting is unbelievable. Bradbury can describe young boys better than anyone else on the planet, when reading it you feel like the boys, you can visualize everything they do because you can relate. And add the wonder that Bradbury has for Circuses he creates a unique story that is a joy to read. I love this story!
B002QB1910|1.0|There is a reason why this entire album was at one point on sale for 99 cents, and that was probably more than it was worth. Save your money, cause that price was probably more than it is worth. I personally have no attention span for mediocre suicide music, and weak vocals.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|When Alicia Keys came out in 2001 with [[ASIN:B00005JXS6 Songs in A Minor]], she was seriously hyped-up as being the next big thing. This exposure continued with [[ASIN:B0000DD7NL The Diary of Alicia Keys]], which I thought was severely overrated, but that didn't stop her from being the first artist in a long time to issue an [[ASIN:B000B5IPLK Unplugged]] album. I didn't get a chance to hear [[ASIN:B000VEYJP2 As I Am]], but I got my hands on The Element of Freedom.<br /><br />Speaking of As I Am, though, it was about that time that I noticed that Alicia's voice was starting to weaken -- but maybe that's because she sometimes has a habit of singing so hard that she goes off-key (see \\"Love is My Disease\\"). But there are still plenty of great songs on here to choose from, like \\"Love is Blind\\", \\"Like the Sea\\" and \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\". But her current single, \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\", is my favorite; and the song that follows, \\"Wait Til They See My Smile\\", is a close second.<br /><br />\\"Empire State of Mind (Part II)\\", which is an acoustic song with the same chorus but different verses, is okay (but note to another professional website; Jay-Z isn't on this version). However, his wife is on the album, on \\"Put It in a Love Song\\", but that song would fit better on Beyonc&eacute;'s album, not Alicia's (but the song isn't that great anyway -- sorry, y'all, I tried my best to like it). But a misstep like that is easily ignored because of how stellar the rest of the album is. Alicia Keys doesn't sing QUITE as well as she used to but the Element of Freedom is worth the bucks.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00127RAJY|5.0|First, a background of me.     At my work, I travel. I do eat a lot of junk food. I have a job that is really hard on your body. My body bloats and then deflates. Some weeks I only get 5-8 hrs sleep. Sometimes I work hideous 16 hr workdays.     I loved working out. I loved sports. I even dreamed of being in some sort of \\"Navy Seal\\" because I love being fit. For the life of me, it was hard getting some kind of exercise program to go along with my crazy work schedule.     At work I push heavy things. Very heavy carts (I calculated 500 lbs for some) and sometimes on an incline. I could tell my knee was getting weaker and it was sucking. I just HAD to do something to keep my body in one piece. I know if I didn't do some sort of exercise  and keep my muscles strong, I will get injured on the job.     I tried hotel gyms. I tried other exercise videos (one I think I got hurt because I didn't get the form right). I was seriously getting depressed.     Then on a certain channel, I found these exercise programs. I was hesitant, thinking I might get hurt or something...(like the last time) WRONG.     I pushed and pushed. I wasn't going to QUIT. If I felt something was sore, I knew what to do (you know,RICE). Like she says in her videos- just put the effort into it. So I did...until my knees were better. Soon my knees were not complaining. It is as if they woke up.     Gradually I got stronger. Those jumps are not sore on any of my joints anymore! I love them. I can jump higher and higher... I haven't done that in 10 yrs.     Primarily I did this to build strength all over, especially for my job to protect myself. I have bought all three DVD's and looked through her book to study the right form. (to prevent injury)  I love the ballistic stretches. Some of these exercise programs I've had in the past made me wonder what or how they were stretching. I think this is key to really getting your muscles warmed up.     Now I'm totally contemplating on working out my arms to get rippedarms like her! Love it.     And of course, if you really feel pain during this work out, ask a sports doctor what is causing your pain. I've had in the past and they really help and can give you great suggestions on how to keep up with your programs.     Two months into it- I have so much more leg strength.... I can do push ups again (whereas two months ago- NOTHING) and I don't get winded anymore.     I suspect I lost some pounds but I think I gained some muscle weight.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|In March of 2009, Michael Jackson announced a final 10 show concert run, This Is It, to be played at London's O2 Arena. Due to high demand for tickets, the concert was changed to 50 concerts to be played between July of 2009 and March of 2010. Sadly, Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, and the grand vision of This Is It was never completely carried. Thankfully though, the rehearsals were recorded for Jackson's personal use, and are now presented by Kenny Ortega (director of This Is It) and AEG Live to show the world Michael Jackson's vision for what could have been the biggest concert series of his career.    Michael Jackson was the consumate performer, forgetting about his personal troubles, he was known equally for his dancing and for his singing talent. From a young age he could imbue a song with emotion that even seasoned musicians had a hard time conveying. With his first solo album, Off The Wall, he sold over 20 million copies and the album was certified 8x platinum. But his true magnum opus, Thriller, spawned 7 singles (the album had 9 songs) has sold an estimated 65-110 million copies, making it the best selling album of all time. The video Billie Jean was the video that helped bring MTv into the limelight, and was also the first video by a black artist to be played on regular rotation by the network, while Thriller, is still considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time. And that's not even counting the millions of copies sold of his other albums after that. Even in death, Michael outsold the billboard charts for weeks after his death, and three weeks after his death, Thriller became the most sold album of the year to that point, surpassing Taylor Swift. With a legacy so prolific, does This Is It live up to the rest?    This Is It is not the morbid experience some people are going to expect. I'm sure some people are going to be watching for hints at his personal life, or for clues of his failing health looking for someone kind of explanation for his death. What you will get is the King of Pop in top form. He has never sounded better, and for 50, he keeps up well with his 20 something counterparts dancing on stage with him. His choreography is still top notch, and you see the genius behind the man. This is it truly is a celebration of the life and music of a genius entertainer and artist, and a perfectionist. Throughout the rehearsals you see him stop and telling people exactly how he wants to hear and see songs performed. This huge production was completely overseen by Michael Jackson, not created by a team for Michael, but created by Michael, and told to the team that he needed to create it for him.    And make no mistake, this was a huge production. Throughout, the movie you see some of what was planned for the visual conterparts to the stage performance, and it was just massive! Thriller included ghosts and a graveyard scene including zombies and a giant spider, all shot to be shown in 3D. Smooth Criminal had a video shot of Michael Jackson inserted into a Humphrey Bogart movie. On top of that were the pyrotechnics which had running fires and fireworks going off in the air over the stage. For purposes of the documentary, though, the focus is mainly on the performances, and besides Michael we get a look at the surrounding crew, and the true standout is Orianthi Panagaris who we see play guitar most notably on Black and White and Beat It. As a shredder she's definitely going to be someone to watch in the future.    But for all the praise that this doc deserves, it feels like it's missing something. Anytime we see Jackson on stage we hope to see him driving at 100%. Don't get me wrong, he sounds as good as he ever has, and even better at times, and he in no way looks or acts sick. But since he's taking in everything around him and still working on getting into shape to take on the full load of 50 shows, he's not exerting himself on the choreography to the point to where he really looks like it's flowing naturally, and seems somewhat lethargic when dancing and moving around stage. Also seeing bits and pieces of the finished project and never all at once as it would have been seen in the final show, this movie, for better or for worse, makes you want more. This could have very easily been a teaser for the This Is It tour, and, considering this is the last time we'll see Michael, that's something of a problem.    All in all, though, this is a great swan song for the King of Pop. It's a reminder that no matter what else, no matter what happened in his personal life, no matter what everyone thought of him or what public perception was, the public's eye really needed to remain focused on what mattered: the music, the performance, the genius. Whether you're a casual fan, or a die hard fan of Michael Jackson, I highly recommend you give this a try. If you were a fan, but dropped out when crap hit the fan in the 90's, you should still give it a try and put the artistry in perspective. This doc definitely doesn't disappoint!    4.5/5
B0026P3G12|5.0|I am extremely pleased with Susan's first album and cannot wait for her second! I agree with a previous review....she did play down her passionate voice..however her  two \\"new\\" songs really prove her talent...and sound like they were written especially for her!  I have played her album nonstop since it arrived....just cannot get enough of her voice and her sweet vulnerability.  After watching the Susan Boyle Story on YouTube I feel great joy in knowing she is fine and feeling on top of the world...and she is so lovely.  Her duet with Elaine Paige was awesome.  Imagine!   I hope Sharon Osborne personally apologizes to Susan:  she needs to look into her soul and the mirror.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Bought this game for my 7 yo nephew - easy enough instructions for him to learn quickly but challenging enough for kids and adults. We found ourselves playing it over and over again to try different strategies. So fun I decided to get a second game for my home.
B002Y5210G|2.0|Maybe two songs out of the album I could listen to repeatedly. Maybe I'm just in one of those moods where I'm listening to more gospel but this new Album has me wondering, where are the hooks and melodies.<br />I love an artist for what they are not what they will try to change into. My genre of music will change from gospel, to hip hop, to what ever I feel. I DO NOT EXPECT MY FAVORITE ARTIST TO CHNAGE THEIR TONE OR RYTHYM. IF YOU ARE A CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM AND YOU KNOW IT, DON'T CHNANGE JUST IMPROVE SLOWLY LIKE FINE WINE.<br /> This album was a disappointment, sorry Mrs. Keys

B002L6I9Z4|5.0|My 6 year old got this for his Birthday and absolutely loves it!!! Taking pictures inside is a little tough as the view screen is pretty dark so unless you have lots of indoor light you can't see too good,  but once you take the pics with the flash they come out fine for him! He gets a big kick out of taking his own pictures!! Outside it takes pics wonderful!! He carries this everywhere snapping away! We haven't put the pics on the computer yet as he hasn't even begun to fill it. It say's up to 80 pics but it takes more than that!! Don't know yet about durability as we have only had it for about 1 week so we will see!

So instead have my blu ray connected through the RCA.<br />  Bought this for gaming AND the fact that it mentioned 7:1 surround sound with movies. TRUE HD IS 7:1 right??<br /><br />2) Jack connector on Headphones to xbox controller is EASILY DISLODGED! Just turning quickly sometimes dislodges it!<br />  Maybe its just mine but seriously!? Unless I play there like a statue...<br /><br />Other than these two issues these are great sounding headphones. IMO...better than my friends ASTRO's!
B001AP11L6|4.0|Review no. 682. 'Elephant' is the duo's fourth CD, as I barely knew who they were when I got to catch Jack & Meg White on this actual tour. Tracks that I couldn't get enough of were the early '70's-ish \\"Black Math\\", the straight-ahead rocker \\"There's No Home For You Here\\", a Burt Bacharach song \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\", the (sort of) Zeppelin-like \\"In The Cold, Cold Night\\" and the disc's ballad \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\". I also enjoyed a couple of songs here that at least sounded a bit familiar to me - \\"Little Acorns\\" and \\"Hypnotize\\". Overall, superb garage / blues rock whose major influences are the Stones, Zeppelin, Janis Joplin, New York Dolls and the MC 5. An absolute must-have.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|It's a great set. Problem is: When Amazon put it up, they didn't offer or even mention that there's a Deluxe 2 DVD version with extras for just a few $ more. I'll think twice before pre-ordering from them again...
B0015ABRE2|5.0|They should write a book based on this story.    There is something very intriguing about a show with a serial killer that only kills bad people. (such as other serial killers).    But then you add on the fact that there has never been anything else like this on TV and the great writing that goes with it.    I just cant believe at the end of four seasons, the show is still as intense, the twists still get you, and perhaps the story gets even better than when it started. It never gets boring. We love it! =)~
B000ZECQ08|5.0|Excellent movie, loved the extra features.  The \\"Year in the Life\\" of J.K. Rowling was really interesting, very enjoyable.  Great buy for the money!
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I had not heard of this film before renting this.  I like sci-fi and action movies.  I tend to first look for simple escapism entertainment.  My job is high fast lane stress, and seek films that give me a break from that.   As I started watching this film, I started to think I had rented another disappointment, but continued to watch anyway.  The end result is a fantastic story, and one that I had no way expected.  The correlations and analogies made in this film were profound.  I truly enjoyed this movie. The special effects to me seem flawless and as was the story which I ended up loving more than a simple loud special effects movie which this movie was not.  Definitely worth watching and owning.
B001AP11L6|5.0|Love the creative vibes of Jack & Meg White, very talented musicians, look forward to getting the rest of their CD's.

0743289692|5.0|After describing the hardships of a pious Muslim wife with a cruel husband in a country where divorce is not allowed, Ayaan Hirsi Ali says:<br /><br />\\"If you are a Somali woman you must learn to tell yourself that God is just and all knowing and will reward you in the Hereafter.\\" (p. 12)<br /><br />Married Somali woman believe in the Hereafter for the same reasons I do, which is the same reason single or married, educated or not, Christians, Jews, and Muslims do. When contemplating own existence, we see ourselves against an infinite abyss that we call God. Our faith is a positive response to the message of miracle workers and prophets that our freedom is before God, that our past will be gathered up when we die, and that our death will be the defining moment of our lives. With fear and trembling, we hope for a perfect fulfillment in the Hereafter based on our human experience.<br /><br />Ms. Ali not just skeptical about the Hereafter, which is deism, but thinks people who do believe in revealed religion are irrational. Ms. Ali is in no position to criticize others because she herself does not see the irrationality of her father's explanation of why people should be honest. Ms. Ali thinks her mother is the one who is irrational:<br /><br />\\"Ma taught us to tell the truth because otherwise we would be punished and go to Hell. Our father taught us to be honest because truth is good in itself.\\" (p. 45)<br /><br />Both of her parents, as well as her teachers, gave Ms. Ali the gift of faith:<br /><br />\\"The Prophet did teach us a lot of good things. I found it spiritually appealing to believe in a Hereafter.\\" (p. 272)<br /><br />But ultimately she decided not to believe in God:<br /><br />\\"One night in that Greek hotel I looked in the mirror and said out loud, \\"I don't believe in God.\\" I said it slowly, enunciating it carefully, in Somali. And I felt relief.<br /><br />\\"It felt right. There was no pain, but a real clarity. The long process of seeing the flaws in my belief structure and carefully tiptoeing around the frayed edges as parts of it were torn out, piece by piece--that was all over. The angels, watching from my shoulders; the mental tension about having sex without marriage, and drinking alcohol, and not observing any religious obligations--they were gone. The ever-present prospect of hellfire lifted, and my horizon seemed broader.\\" (p. 281)<br /><br />Ms. Ali started her political career by criticizing a Muslim leader for saying in a TV interview that homosexuality was sinful:<br /><br />\\"To the Somali in me, this attitude was familiar; but the Dutch person in me was shocked. The interview caused a commotion, and I sat down and wrote an article and sent it to the NRC Handelsblad. I wrote that this attitude was much larger than just one imam: it was systemic in Islam, because this was a religion that had never gone through a process of Enlightenment that would lead people to question its rigid approach to individual freedom.\\" (p. 266)<br /><br />The so-called Enlightenment occurred in the 17th and 18th century when people began educating themselves instead of being educated by the Christian churches. People like Thomas Jefferson and Voltaire got miseducated and became deists. In the 19th century, humanism and socialism became important movements for social change throughout the world. Humanism is the belief that our goal in life should not be to serve God, but to serve mankind. Humanism replaces the study of revelation (theology) and the study of being (metaphysics) with science.<br /><br />The scientific basis of humanism is the pseudo-scientific idea that humans are superior to animals, not because humans have spiritual souls and animals don't, but because of evolution. Ernst Haeckel, and other early Darwinists, thought that some races were superior to the other races and that the life of some human beings has more value than the life of other human beings.

B001TOD92C|5.0|This film was stunning.  I've never been a Mickey Rourke fan... never really bothered to pay attention to him (maybe it's a generational thing?), but he did an absolutely fantastic job in this movie.  The Wrestler is a raw and gritty film.  I found myself turning away at many scenes thinking that they were too raw or unrealistic until my husband (who is a wrestling fan) chirped in that it was the most accurate portrayal of this level of wrestling that he has ever seen.  I think he was nominated for Best Actor (Oscar).  I can totally see why.<br /><br />This is so worth seeing, but very emotional.  I was enamored by the film and saddened by it.  Definitely Oscar worthy material!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great movie for real fans of Star Trek. I thought the actors did a great job of portraying their counterparts from the original series. I never tire of S.T., hope there is another in the works.    T.W.R.  Burleson, Texas
B002SJIO5E|1.0|This movie should be at least in the top 5 worst movies of all time if not the worst.  Awful, horrendous, boring, stupid or ridiculous could all be used to describe this movie.  The point where you think, it has to get better, trust me it never does.  I didn't know garbage gets rated 5 stars and I didnt want to give this 1 star.  It was a painful struggle to finish this movie, 0 enjoyment.  I will NEVER watch this pathetic movie again.  The people that rated this movie 5 stars must have seen a different movie.  As bad of a movie as Torque or Alone in the Dark were, they are drastically ahead of this one.
0446567337|4.0|I'm a longtime Sparks fan who admits not all of his books become my personal favorites.  There is something about \\"Dear John\\" that stands out for me.  There is obviously the \\"lost love\\" storyline that so many of us can identify with.  But for those who spend time around or have dated military personnel I think a large part of this book will ring true also.  Especially since 9/11 when so many Americans are spending 15 month deployments in the middle east or look forward to a discharge date only to be stop-lossed.  It takes a huge toll on not only the soldier but loved ones, too.  Not all strong relationships survive and if they do it's likely they will be forever changed.      If you're looking for a feel good book that leaves you smiling at the end, this isn't the one to buy.  But if you're up for a REAL story that makes you think about what it truly means to love another person, if you want to read a book that reminds you even sad endings have the ability to make us better people....\\"Dear John\\" is worth your time.
B00164KYV4|3.0|December 19th, 2009<br /><br />I wish I would have went to the movies to see this. It was pretty good in my opinion.<br /><br />In between getting songs for my iPod, I was glued to the movie. I wanted to see what happened to the broken-hearted girl. I wanted to see if she would ever get it right. I wanted to see if the guy who was almost forced into marriage would be less of a sleaze.<br /><br />I'm sure there is nothing new I could say about this dating movie that hasn't been said before. So I'll just say that it's worth it in the end and if you are interested in watching people trying to date and work various things out in their relationships, then this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Everyone seems to know everyone through a person or two. And some of them even leave \\"dates\\" for another in the next second.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was worth the watch.<br /><br />I'd watch it again too.<br /><br />3.5 stars.
1416583408|1.0|I am very unhappy with this book.  It seems to be a very uninteresting read.  I was hoping for some answers as to why my dog does some of the things she does, but have yet to get to page 100 and hard to keep reading.
B002P5XXR0|4.0|Well, I must agree with some of the other reviewers: this is not an entirely original piece of work.  Those of us who really appreciate film scores will be able to pick out recycled James Horner themes and cues throughout Avatar.  However, despite this fact, I still found myself really enjoying the album as a whole.  For me, the Avatar soundtrack is one of those few gems that gets better the more you listen to it.  At first I was a little put-off by such heavy synthesizer use (which Horner is known for), but after listening to it again it grew on me.  In my mind, the blend of heavy synth and orchestra paralleled the film's dichotomy of industry at odds with the natural world.  Now, sure, I could be reaching there, but in a quirky way it does actually make sense.  There could have been a bit more diversity among the themes and intimiate moments in the tracks.  However, if you see the movie you'll notice it too is rather sparse on those softer moments between two characters where we delve into their motives, emotions, and history.  The film's characters are rather one-dimensional (despite being in 3D), so it's no wonder the score doesn't offer as much complexity as we'd like.  I wish the music were a little stronger to stand on it's own (I always feel the mark of a great piece of filmic scoring is one that can tell the story all on it's own).  Still, this soundtrack is certainly not without it's key moments that completely sweep you into the music/story.  To that effect, Avatar does accomplish a rather emulsifying experience (especially if you listen to it again and get past our always too-high initial expectations), but it could have gone just that extra step deeper.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Unbeliveable!!!!!!!    a must for any fan..  by far the best concert i have seen..  I love the backstage footage you get to see.
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key took me totally by surprise. I was not intrigued nor particularly interested by the book review, but once I got into the book, I could not put it down.  I was horrified at the same time I was fascinated. The courage of this little girl and then the sequence of events which were taken to finally put her to rest was well done. I recognized and enjoyed all the well defined characters and appreciated their faults and ideals. A well-written book which I would read again.
B002NXSRX4|2.0|So I finally gained the courage to see this number, and realized it was yet another hokey take by Sommers.  We are talking Van Helsing territory with this film.  For some reason, the FX in Sommers' films have a made-for-tv cheese factor...along with script and acting.  GI Joe, sadly, does not improve on things.  Mis-castings galore with half the Joe team looking like Melrose Place drop-outs rather than seasoned warriors, along with the odd choice of Joseph Gordon-Levitte as Cobra commander.      Plot? What plot?  I wasn't looking for a deep movie.  Just some decent entertainment, but even for that this film was a weak sauce.  There are other options out there.    All in all, not the best start to a franchise.
B0016PM722|5.0|This really comes in handy. The other day at breakfast, my brother would not let go of my Eggo. I walked away and came back with my trusted lightsaber and sliced his hand off with it still holding the Eggo. I ate it with his hand so my fingers wouldn't get sticky from the syrup. Needless to say, he doesn't sit down at breakfast with me anymore.    During the summer, my hedges needed trimming and shaping but my trimmer would not fire up. Busted this bad boy out and it sliced through them like butter. Two of the hedges caught fire but luckily, my garden hose was lying next to me and I was able to put both bushes out sustaining only minimal melting damage to the vinyl siding.    Went apple picking last month and took it along to reach those big juicy ones that are higher up on the tree. I eyed a Golden Delicious that was about 12 feet up and must have weighed close to 2 pounds. I jumped and took a whack and the apple came down like a comet. Unfortunately, it also set off a fire that engulfed and charred all 24 acres of the orchard. An 8 year old got blamed for smoking a cigar. We'll have to travel a bit further for apple picking for the next few seasons.    During our divorce hearing this last spring, the judge ordered me to give my ex either the Hummer or the Escalade. I felt that she deserved a little of both. And my trusted lightsaber came to the rescue once again. I now drive a Humlade and she drives an Escamer.    All in all, this is a great, handy and helpful tool if used correctly in the proper hands. Just be certain to have a fire extinguisher handy as it sometimes tends to cause fires.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Baraka is an absolute wonder to watch, especially in HD format where the picture and sound is as pristine and clear as if you were there experiencing live.  Michael Sterns soundtrack is an audio treat in itself and lends support beautifully and in one instance heartbreakingly to Baraka's touching theme.  One only has to begin watching the intro to know that what they are about to see is a powerful commentary narrated by music.  The majesty, pagentry and human elements all combine to compliment each other in no way any other documentary can.  An absolute must.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played. Some friends brought it over and we bought it a few days later. It's easy to learn, challenging to master...but appropriate for all age levels!
B001F12J0C|4.0|For me this is a series that grows on you. When I first watched this series I hated it for its shaky camera work and jarring transitions, then as time goes by I enjoyed it more and more as do most people. The movies are what I call true sequels taking place moments after each film e.g. Back to the Future and The Lord of the Rings are other examples. The movies have an over arching storyline, with the exception of the first because it can stand on it own or with the rest of the series. Now on to a review of each movie.<br /><br />The Bourne Identity is about a man who wakes up with amnesia and discovers he's a government assassin who failed to pull the trigger. Soon after said government finds out he's alive wants to tie off loose ends and by tie off I mean kill both Bourne and his ally Marie an American traveler who helps in his evasion. The film ends on a happy note with Bourne reuniting with Marie in Greece.<br /><br />The Bourne Supremacy takes off where the first left off Bourne is with Marie in India and is being hunted by the CIA for a bombing he is framed for. Marie is shot and Bourne is on a quest for revenge and eventually clears his name and the film ends with Bourne going on a crusade to apologize to the families on the people he assassinated.<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum is Bourne trying to find his true identity and still being pursued by the CIA.<br /><br />Nothing else to say except these movies are nothing more than a thrill ride with an engaging story that should be watched if you even have a passing interest in the genre.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|5 star, amazing, fantastic and TRUE MUST SEE.....By far one of the very best movies I have ever seen. You will want to have this in your collection from the first time you watch it. I get goose bumps just waiting for the DVD so I can see it again
B000E41MRC|4.0|This film, and the wide-ranging responses to it, remind me of George Orwell's essay on Salvador Dali; that we can appreciate something as an artistic achievement while simultaneously condemning it as morally/ethically/politically repugnant.     There is no doubt that Leni Riefenstahl was an outstanding film-maker. For the 1930's, her cinematography is extraordinary; cameras perched on cars and aeroplanes, tracking and moving shots, close ups and distortion, extremely wide pans. From the vantage point of 2009, it's impossible to appreciate just how revolutionary some of these techniques were at the time. The sound and musical quality are also brilliant, considering the 1930's were still comparatively early in the sound-film era.    At the same time, be in no doubt as to what sort of production this is. 'Triumph of the Will' is a blatant piece of pro-Nazi propaganda, made by someone who (at best) was unbelievably naive about the true nature of the Third Reich. The opening shot has Hitler descending through the clouds, and the remainder of the film deliberately promotes the idea of Hitler as a God-like figure. The endless parades, marches, speeches, and adoring crowds are all used to confirm the idea of a nationalist Messiah come to redeem Germany after its \\"Passion\\" following World War 1 and the Treaty of Versailles. Riefenstahl keeps the mood triumphant throughout, although there are more sinister moments such as the matter-of-fact discussion of The Night Of The Long Knives, and hearing Goebbles preach about \\"truth\\" and decency is equally sickening and comical.     So what to make of this? It's clearly a major artistic achievement, but it is also an apologia for one of the most evil regimes in history. I do believe it has an important place in film history, not just as a piece of \\"art\\", but also as education. 'Triumph Of The Will' clearly demonstrates how such a repellant group of people were able to command respect and loyalty from ordinary Germans. Hitler is a compelling orator and passionaite nationalist, and Riefenstahl's highly idealised portrayal does give him a certain statesmanlike quality. It's not hard to see how a dispirited, desperate people might be taken in by such a man.     While it's not the sort of film that you \\"recommend\\", I do think everybody should see this film at least once.
B002OFWG7O|5.0|I love the Foo Fighters but of course this CD contains all of their best. Well worth the purchase. It was one of those CDs you cannot stop playing.
B000N3ST3Y|3.0|First things first: this is NOT in any way a complete and accurate summary of Genesis' long and diverse career. The focus is squarely on Genesis The Pop Band, almost exclusively covering the Collins-led era (with 'I Know What I Like..' and a reworked 'Carpet Crawlers' seeming like token Gabriel-era inclusions). It's designed for the VERY casual fan; the sort of people who jumped on board with 'Invisible Touch', thought 'In Too Deep' was a Collins solo song, and didn't realise that the guy who did 'Sledgehammer' was once part of the band.     In that context, I guess this works. Most of the big hits from the band's 80's and early 90's heyday are here: 'Mama', 'Misunderstanding', 'Invisible Touch', 'That's All', 'In Too Deep', 'Land Of Confusion', 'I Can't Dance', 'No Son Of Mine', 'Jesus He Knows Me',and the title track. But I'm not sure songs like 'Hold On My Heart' (one of their most insipid ballads), 'Tonight, Tonight, Tonight' (hardly a hit), and the Wilson-era 'Congo' really deserve to be here, especially when you consider what's missing. Leaving aside the Gabriel era, the album doesn't even feature all the important Collins songs. Where's 'Afterglow'? Where's 'No Reply At All'? Where's 'Man On The Corner'?    Rather than trying to cram everything on one CD, it would have been a better idea to do a proper set of compilations; one covering the Gabriel era and one covering Collins. Or maybe one \\"prog\\" compilation (covering everything up to 'And Then There Were Three'), and one \\"pop\\" album spanning the band's big hits. As it is, 'Turn It On Again' is a bit of a \\"nothing\\" album; it doesn't have anything for dedicated fans, while not giving casual fans a proper introduction to even the Collins era.     I give it four stars for the music, because what is here is very good, but subtract one for the sheer number of songs that are missing.
B002R5V7MG|5.0|I was at Disney Hall in October 2009 to see Gustavo Dudamel conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic in one of their four performances of Mahler's symphony 1.  My impression then was that Gustavo had passed the Mahler test with flying colors.  I love Mahler's 10 symphonies, and I've heard numerous performances of each over the years.  The Los Angeles Philharmonic led by Dudamel gives us a thrilling Mahler 1st, and it's perfectly captured on DVD.  For those who watched this performance on PBS, you really haven't heard it yet; Deutsche Grammophon has done a masterful job of approximating the dynamic range of Disney Hall's magnificient acoustic, and the performance is even better than I remember.  Disney Hall looks and sounds absolutely beautiful here.  I'm glad that this concert began with the world premiere of John Adams' City Noir, because the legacy of the L.A. Philharmonic's previous director Esa-Pekka Salonen, is that worthy new works by living composers deserve to be on the program with great works from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.  That's standard practice at Disney Hall.
B000LE16VW|5.0|This video is great.  It's a tear jerker, but shows faith and hope even in a very difficult time.
0321127420|4.0|Easy to read and understand the author.  Unfortunately, the book spends too much time and effort on ORM which is not very useful unless the reader intends to roll his own ORM tools.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I'm pretty new to Supernatural, but recently made the plunge for the DVDs/Blu-Rays after managing to catch one episode and having heard nothing but great things about the show.  I'm halfway through the first season, and the show is simply fantastic!  Plenty has been said about that by others, so I will comment more on the quality of the DVD release itself.  Firstly, it's a bit disappointing that there is no Blu-Ray release for the first 2 seasons, and none seem forthcoming.  Thankfully, many of the episodes still look good upscaled on my 50\\" plasma screen.  But a fair number look very poor due to being excessively dark and overly contrasty.  The episode \\"Hook\\" is a prime example of this.  I don't know if this is a problem with the DVD release itself or the source material.  Since this was an early episode on a new show (with apparently a low budget) whose future may have been uncertain, I suspect the problem is more the source material.  Don't let that dissuade you... it's a great show in spite of any production flaws it may have suffered from early on.
B002PHVHFI|5.0|Fantastic exploration. I bit of folk, psycho, indie, rock which sounds like a back drop to an animated movie from Planet OZ.  One of the best finds for the open minded listener who apperciates original music. I won't go into technicalities here, the other reveiwers did a gret job on definition but the singer takes you to a place you have never been and the stories are Wow! My favorite songs being \\"Oh Comely\\" and \\"Two Headed Boy.\\"  All the songs are worthy of praise and this music does sound best on vinyl.  For the mature music listener only. His voice is a bit odd but it becomes very fitting after a couple listens and you will apperciate the major effort he went into vocal emphasis
B001O0TXAS|5.0|This movie on spoiled zoo animals was made in 2005.  It is a film by Dreamworks and beautifully computer-animated.<br /><br />The story starts at New York's Central Park Zoo.  Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty a zebra (Chris Rock), a hypochondriac giraffe (David Schwimmer, and a lady hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) are best firends and stars of the show.  The Zebra has wanderlust as he turns 10 and wants freedom to return to the wild. He escapes and the other three break free to look for him and all reunite at Central Station in New York.  The public and police are terrified and the animals find themselves on a ship headed for Africa.  When the penquins turn pirate and hijack the ship, they are washed ashore in Madagascar.  The foursome soon find out that freedom is not all it is cracked up to be.<br /><br />I laughed at the jokes and personalities of the zany, good hearted animals.  This was just fun to watch.
1400044162|3.0|I was looking forward to reading this, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.  I struggled with reading this story and at the end, while I did like it, it's not one that I would read again. I'd still recommend it because it is very well-written, complete, and is a better quality of literature.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|An ubiquitous gringo finds himself searching for who-knows-what in Peru, attracting an over-exaggerated attention from local junta and clergy while lucky co-accidents united him with alike-delighted new age followers having saved his life on many occasions and securing his safe deportation to the USA, no further word of them left behind at the end.<br /><br />Rarely screened both picturesque Peruvian landscapes/urban areas and vibrant adventure are good for educating the young teens if realistic and a film was less peppered with out-of-this-world philosophical deliberations.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|For a movie based on characters from over 40 years ago, this is a great sequel/prequel that gives satisfying nods to the Star Trek original series without being rigidly stuck on exact re-creation.  I would have been disappointed if they had tried too hard to be exactly like the original series, because of course it couldn't be done.      The actors were very well cast to keep to the original characters, with enough change to make this movie its own version.  Purists will always get grumpy over any changes; don't listen to them.  The plot has some holes in it, but when has a movie NOT had a few holes in the plot?  Sure, Nero could have gone a different direction instead of becoming a sci fi serial killer. He let his anger cause him to make very bad choices, which happens a lot in real life too.    Star Trek has always been my favorite TV show; I have entire seasons on DVD and can quote dialog along with the characters.  This is the best of all the Star Trek movies, and has the makings of a new Star Trek series with the alternate reality and young cast.
B001GCUER0|5.0|We couldn't be happier with this DVD set!  Season 2 of Mad Men and even in a 'collectors' box!  We found each DVD in PERFECT condition.  We received our product in what was the fastest time.....less than 4 days!  We could not be happier.  Season 2 is exactly what anyone would want.......intrigue, laughs, LOTS of surprises and a confused Don Draper and oh yes,,,Poor Peter Campbell......NOT!  Be sure to see each and every second of this GREAT show.  On to Season 3!
0307245306|4.0|So there's an eleven year old boy who lives with a nasty step-dad named Mr. Dursley - sorry, it's Smelly Gabe.  He learns that he is special and goes to a special school - sorry, camp - where there is a kindly teacher who likes him, Dumbledore - sorry, Kairon, and a mean teacher who doesn't, Snape - sorry, Mr. D.  He then goes on a quest to save the world with a really smart girl named Hermione - sorry, Annabeth - and a goofy friend named Ron - sorry, Gordon.  Of course, no adults can help save the world.  It's just these crazy kids.      What's different?  Rather than the magic of [[ASIN:B001I1PW3K Harry Potter]], we learn that the Greek gods are alive and well, working behind the veil of human vision.  We meet all kinds of major gods, minor gods, demigods, mythical monsters, and other characters.  It got me excited about re-reading some of the Greek mythology that I enjoyed so much as a youth.      I wish Jim Dale - the superb narrator of the Harry Potter audiobooks - had narrated these.  Instead, Jesse Bernstein does his best eleven-year-old voice, aka annoying voice, and the accents are just bizarre (Zeus was my \\"favorite\\").      This was a fun listen; it totally drew me in, despite (or maybe because of) the similarities to the little boy wizard.  The gods and creatures really make the story, much more than the protagonists.  It will be interesting to see that dynamic evolve over the next books.    Note on content: No sex, no strong language that I can remember (besides words like \\"stupid\\"), and the violence is pretty veiled.
0307716988|5.0|...Autobiography by Michael Jackson. How can any fan pass this up? To those putting it down due to a few writing errors, as a writer, let me say Michael Jackson isn't a famous writer, he's a famous performer/artist. Honestly, there's nothing wrong with an artist journaling his thoughts and life experiences and turning it into a book to express himself to his fans, etc). If you want to get to know the real Michael, read this book. It's real and honest. While it's not up to date, you can get a pretty clear sense of the kind of man he is.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|I actually had to look up Isabelle Fuhrman to make sure she is just a child actress.  She was absolutely amazing in this role and deserves awards for this performance.  The story itself is a usual horror/thriller with lots of nail-biting suspence and cold-hearted action.  There's something about this film that draws me back to watch it over again.  It's really not that good, but the performances are a saving grace.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book has changed my entire view on running. I was was a marathoner for the challenge and health benefits. Now I am a runner for the joy of it. The book is a great read for everyone. For runners the tips and descriptions will make you faster, more efficient and injury free.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|My wife & I are both \\"Potter'ites\\" and liked the Half Blood Prince a lot.  It was much darker than previous Potter movies both visually and in mood.  The movie lacks nearly all of the humor found in the book (which we've read several times).  My brother, who hasn't read the book, watched the movie and thought, \\"HUH?\\"  It didn't make any sense to him.<br /><br />In watching the film a second time I can understand his confusion. If you haven't read the book, there are too many gaps.  This book is unique in that Harry is not involved in a single clear-cut mission against Voldermort and his followers.  Instead, the book details a whole host of events that seem intended to tie up loose ends and set the stage for the final one.  In compressing 652 pages into 153 minutes, the movie isn't able to establish a tie between these various situations and events as well as the book: In fact it hardly tries.  It feels more like a 153 minute \\"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\\" book teaser... a series of unrelated snippets designed to lure you into buying and reading it.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the book, you'll fill in the gaps and enjoy the ride. If not, you'll likely have a \\"HUH?\\" reaction like my brother.
B0026P3G12|3.0|The quality of the disk was not what I expected. Possibly this was due to my using it on my computer.  Her performance of the IDOL was far better than what i got from this. You may have better equipment.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|This is a film that grows on one with repeated viewings. My first thought when I saw it several years ago was, \\"How clever.\\" But it lingered in my memory, and I rented it again, finally adding it to my collection. The center of this updated version of Oscar Wilde's \\"Lady Windermere's Fan\\" is Helen Hunt's heart-breaking performance, but Tom Wilkinson's performance is equally as good and shifts the center of gravity of the story in a way that I think Wilde would have found very interesting. Scarlet Johansen is of course lovely and does as much as can be done with her part, but this is a seasoned and grown up \\"Lady Windermere,\\" and it's Hunt and Wilkinson all the way. Highly recommended.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I look forward to watching, enjoying and SAVORING each and every episode of this fantastic show.  The final episode of Season 2 is quite possibly the finest hour of entertainment I've ever seen. The writing, the directing, the acting, the storylines--well worth the price of admission.
0810983915|5.0|I bought these books on a recommendation from a friend. These books are hilarious! Excellent choice , written from an 8ish year old boy persepctive, great fun!  My son and I tear up we laugh so hard at these books. Not anything off color.
B00003CXBH|4.0|Here is a true view of the Church and State working in disharmoney.  So corrupt are both the Church and the very catholic (christian) states of Spain and Portugal that it never occures to them to put the believes they espouse before their need for power and money.  A tale (based on fact) to break your heart.  There is no defence for any of the actions in this story. Again we see deeds done in God's name, and the bloody hands that result. Like WWI, a \\"war where God was on everyones side\\".
1596912375|5.0|Well-written, intelligent. Though this is my first William Boyd book, I'm an espionage novel aficionado and found this book first-rate. Fleshed out characters. Seems plausible. Well-plotted. Explores relationships between (single) mother in late-20's and her mother, a former agent. Read it on one night because I didn't want to put it down. (No matter that I'm not sure \\"Restless\\" was most descriptive title). Highly recommended.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I was not sure what to expect after all the previews and hype that have been flooding the airwaves for the past few months.  Wow!  I would recommend if you can go see it in 3D as I did.  The mix of animation and real footage is seamless.  No spoilers here... The plot for the movie is probably one you are use to seeing.  But the fact that they pull it off and you relate to the characters and their plight is rare in some movies.  I recommend it as a must-see on the biggest screen you can find.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|The other reviewers are right - having seen this film I can say that it is one of my all-time favorite films. It has so many hidden lessons and messages about life that I'll need to watch it again. Can't wait.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred is the best dvd workout I have ever used.  I have ton of workout videos (like 15...seriously), but after buying this one I will probably not use any of the others.  I LOVE this workout!  And I love the \\"Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism\\" but that's another dvd for another time.<br />By the time I finish I'm sweating, breathing heavy, and I feel like I've done something worthwhile.  It's 20 minutes, so it's almost the nationally recommended 30 minutes of cardio but it's tough so I think it counts anyway. :)  On top of being a great workout, it's educational.  I've already learned about static stretching, some of the different muscle groups, and other interesting tidbits that Jillian throws in while she's training.  This makes me want to work out even more because not only do I FEEL good but I KNOW what this workout is doing for my body.<br />All in all, great DVD, great trainer (even if the biggest losers think she's crazy), and I'm thankful for this workout.  :)<br /><br />PS:  If you happen to be a christian there are some great parallels between some of the encouragement Jillian gives and how to grow in your walk with Jesus.  Can you find them?  Get the dvd and check it out.
B00150B2SS|3.0|\\"Tinker, Tailor\\" is a critically acclaimed novel by an absolutely fantastic author. There are many great reviews here and I don't want to repeat any of their contents. I simply want to summarize a few of the major points that I feel you should consider before purchasing this book and to give a brief explanation for my 3-star ranking.     Things to consider:    1) I consider Le Carre more of a \\"literary\\" author than a \\"commercial\\" one, by some definition of \\"literary\\" vs. \\"commercial\\" that is defined by writing style, not commercial success. You're going to see more of an emphasis on character and milieu than on a fast, twisting plot.     2) The author has an incredible understanding of human nature and even his minor characters are well motivated.    3) The book is written almost entirely in exposition, with a great deal of flashback.     4) Le Carre has an uncanny way of dropping phenomenal one-sentence nuggets on the reader when (s)he least expects it.     5) Le Carre is somewhat cynical.     In the abstract, numbers 1), 3) and 5)are neither good nor bad - your take on them is a matter of personal preference. Also, these five points are a reflection of my own opinions and you might find that you feel very differently about the book.    I could only give this book 3 stars because I find exposition and flashback extremely taxing to read. I can deal with a little of each technique, but this book has way to much of both for my personal tastes. There was even a large section of the book in which the protagonist is simply reading and thinking. Reading about someone reading is too recursive for me. This might not bother you at all, in which case you may find it a much better book than I did. I love Le Carre's prose, his character-driven nature, and his wry observations on human behavior. I don't mind his cynicism at all and I think very highly of him as a writer. This just wasn't the best book for me, and I will do more research in the future before I pick up another ofhis novels. Certainly I don't plan to continue this series.
B002IVLH60|5.0|Pearl Jam - Backspacer (2009)<br /><br />When I first heard BACKSPACER, I thought it was all about drugs. Lines like \\"Gonna see my best friend - make it go away\\" and \\"Got some if you need it\\" seem very suggestive, especially from the point of view of a drug addict. After closer inspection and repeated listening, I realized Eddie Vedder was merely toying with the language. While his metaphors do allude to getting high, he throws in a positive, life-affirming twist. More often, I find they're not really about getting high on drugs but getting high on life - and having a good death.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone that they sit through this album several times and let it sink in. On first listen, I thought the first three songs were just typical balls-to-the-wall Pearl Jam, but since then they've become more distinct in my mind and taken on more character. They're really good. But I immediately sensed many of the \\"second side\\" songs were sophisticated and worth repeated listening. And finally, the last song floored me as soon as I heard it.<br /><br />Some of this album is pretty heavy rock n' roll, close to the heaviest they've ever gotten. On the other hand, the guitars are often quite restrained, heavy but doing little more than outlining chord changes. But every now in then we get blasted with some killer soloing and runaway riffage.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Gonna See My Friend\\" - Straight up rock n' roll bashed out with a detectable taste of the Sex Pistols as guitar notes get bent and Vedder sings at the top of his lungs. May actually be about QUITTING drugs - talking to the friend may actually help (the singer) get rid of his cravings(?) ***3/4<br /><br />\\"Got Some\\" - love the sustained drum rolls at the intro. This is a driving song that finds Vedder still in punk mode, squealing some of his words like Johnny Rotten. Got some (rock n' roll?) if you need it. ****<br /><br />\\"The Fixer\\" - The bass carries the melody on the third hard rocker in a row. A cool song, it's basically about taking the initiative to make your life better and having a positive attitude. ****<br /><br />\\"Johnny Guitar\\" - a bunch of people find this the least impressive track on the album but it was the first one that stood out for me. It's much more distinctive than the first three tracks, especially Eddie's vocal melody. Supposedly he got the idea from looking at J. \\"G\\" Watson's album cover for WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? which is full of girls. Who doesn't like songs about girls? ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Just Breathe\\" - About this song, Vedder said, \\"As close to a love song as we've ever gotten.\\" No need to shout over a wall of noise on this one, Vedder sings in a low register over some sweet acoustic guitar picking, soon accompanied by swelling strings and gentle keyboards. It's not as good as a song like \\"Black,\\" (what is?) but it's up there. \\"Hold me til I die/ Meet you on the other side.\\" ****3/4<br /><br />\\"Amongst The Waves\\" - this one's majestic with a killer rhythm at the chorus. Finally, a guitar cuts loose with a solo! And it keeps building in a beautiful way . . . uplifting. Another song less popular than the others, possibly because it's neither an all-out rocker nor a ballad. *****<br /><br />\\"Unthought Known\\" - a cool song if a bit tired sounding, it's an earnest song that slowly builds. Love the Stooges-style piano (one repeating note). This one seems to explore the subconscious realm in our minds, the blueprint that guides our lives. ****<br /><br />\\"Supersonic\\" - \\"I wanna live my life with the volume full\\" - this is probably the most hyper-kinetic, pumped-up song on the album. At the \\"middle 8,\\" the tempo slows down for some killer guitar riffage before blasting off again for the finale. Like \\"Unthought Unknown,\\" this one also mentions dreams. *****<br /><br />\\"Speed of Sound\\" - is different from any other Pearl Jam song I can think of. \\"It's hard to remember anything/ Moving at the speed of sound.\\" Some interesting sound textures, a rockin beat that's kinda laid back, mandolin, piano . . . this is a sophisticated, well constructed song. *****<br /><br />\\"Force of Nature\\" - the very beginning sounds like a typical cheesy rock song before a minor guitar chord is hit and it becomes a really cool cut with an engaging rhythm. The song is full of sea and siren metaphors (sirens being the mythical female creatures who lure sailors to their death with their singing). It's a great song about a particular woman with an extremely strong personality. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"The End\\" - Those who've complained about Vedder's voice need to hear this track again. The acoustic guitar and orchestral accompaniment is beautiful. It's a song about death, but a really sweet one. *****+well constructed song. *****     \\"Force of Nature\\" - the very beginning sounds like a typical cheesy rock song before a minor guitar chord is hit and it becomes a really cool cut with an engaging rhythm.

B002VPE1AM|3.0|Spoilers:<br /><br />This film is fool's gold. It makes you want to pick it up. It makes you think you have something beautiful and great but it's substance is nothing more than iron pyrite. It's worth seeing for nothing more than the fantastic visuals. It's also Dances With Wolves but not as good.<br /><br />As I watched Avatar all I wanted to see and experience was Pandora. That was the only part of the film that mattered to me. When Jake Sully was wandering around there the film was a home run. Other than that I cared little for the contrived plot about why the humans were there and how they had to destroy in order to get some sort of fools gold. That humanity would destroy a fantastically huge tree and a native alien culture in our distant future seems an unlikely thing for us to do, especially given the current ecological and humanitarian direction that we seem to be steering ourselves, and our consciences in.<br /><br />The story of the unthinking marines and the corporations looking for `gold' just flat out sucked. I could have done without all of it. Any message the film cared to impart was unnecessary and seemed like preaching to the choir. Also, the mindset of the marines and corporation seemed so one dimensional. I could not buy their uncaring nature for a second and all those characters seemed like cardboard placeholders.<br /><br />I am also amazed at how anti-war messages always seem to be conveyed in films these days by depicting a fantastically exciting battle that is so much fun to watch. Cameron loves war. I can tell by watching his films. He loves to design specific types of hovering death machines that are in Terminator, Aliens, and now Avatar. I'm not sold that he is sincere with his message for peace given that his films are always so violent. Is showing and depicting violence the only path to peace? I feel Cameron, rather than just showing us great battles, which I feel is his true nature, has, due to his success and financial gain over the years, placed a phony moral façade over his films so as to come across as politically correct.<br /><br />The moral core of the film did not seem sincere and I am not even sure what message if any was trying to be conveyed. My son and I walked into the theater already knowing that wanton destruction is bad, hitting is bad, and violence against others is bad. We did not need to see and be lectured that humans have the capacity to be bad. We know that already. Could not the film have been told in a more peaceful way? Couldn't humanity have been depicted as having matured hundreds of years in our future? The same story could have been told about a man in an Avatar body becoming one of the residents on Pandora without all the bloodshed. The film did not need all the destruction. Cameron likes destruction though. Cameron is that awful part of humanity that likes to see what happens when the anthill is stepped on or a wasp's nest set a flame. His true nature shows through with this film. He burnt his own creation. He destroyed Pandora and it's people and after seeing the film and reflecting on it I feel it was unnecessary. This is a man who wishes he were there to see the Titanic sink so he made a film with a flimsy story so he could show it. Avatar is no different.çade over his films so as to come across as politically correct.

B002P5XXR0|2.0|What happened to Horner magic? Krull and Star Trek were siply fantastic, full of magic, storytelling, beautifull, inspiring. Maybe somewhere between Cocoon, Titanic and Avatar Horner lost magic. Anyway it doesn't work for ME. If you like his recent works youre going to like it. But if you don't put Krull Limited Edition![[ASIN:B001VDVZ1S Krull Limited Edition!]]in your  cd player and enjoy this masterpiece!
B000001ZS5|2.0|Of the eight JMJ albums I have, this is my least favorite.  The melodies are not that compelling and the sound textures are a bit odd (the digital sound effects don't seem all that interesting).  I bought this after listening to Les Concerts En Chine (The Concerts in China), in which JMJ performs all of these pieces live.  I much prefer the live performances, which are not dramatically different but seem to have more punch than the studio versions.<br /><br />Oxygene is still his best, with Oxygene 7-13 an admirable follow-up.  Chronologie, Equinoxe and Rendez-Vous are consistently rewarding, and I also like some of the tracks on the 2000 disc, Metamorphoses, a somewhat radical change of pace.  But this disc just doesn't ring my chimes.<br /><br />Trivial pursuit: I'm curious as to why Les Chants Magnetiques is translated as Magnetic Fields.  Chants is songs or tunes; champs is fields.  Both words are pronounced exactly the same, but it's hard to imagine that JMJ would get confused, as French is his native language.
B002O5M4SA|4.0|Enjoyable movie even now and even better that it is released on blu-ray. I wont go into detail about the plot but i will compliment on the quality of this blu-ray release. Great quality video and audio, both theatrical and extended widescreen editions on one disk, as for the extras and bonus footage, well you will have to find out for yourself if thats what you solely buy blu-rays for, i skip all the extra stuff and go straight for the main movie. A good transfer to blu-ray and good value and moneys worth for a great movie.
0393061310|2.0|About the most anti-scientific and anti-historic thing you can do when writing a book is to make up theories and philosophies that you think would be nice and then \\"fill in the blanks\\" by using selective evidence and interpreting it in your own way to suit your assumptions. Selecting the arguments to fit the theory. Unfortunately, this is what it seems Jared Diamond is doing the whole way through this book.    The entire book is for me a dramatic crusade by Jared Diamond to prove that he's not prejudiced against non-white people and trying to show how genes didn't play an influence AT ALL on civilisation and farming. He says that people from New Guinea are much smarter than europeans and he even goes so far as to put pictures of his friends from New Guinea in the book and dedicating the book to them (he does have pictures of people from other races as well). Many pages in this book could just as well be huge print of: \\"Look at me! I'm not a racist. I'm saying the non-whites are there by environment alone.\\"     But his propensity for arguing like this reveals a more insidious presumption on his part. He presumes that people who would choose to be hunter-gatherers simply because they wanted to, would be inferior. He is blatantly heavily prejudiced against the hunter-gatherer way of life, and for the farming way of life. Even more so is he against people who are less intelligent than others by continually talking about the \\"ingenuity\\" of farming and continually implying that to paraphrase: \\"farming the land shows superiority if it were the same environment, but the environment is very different throughout the world\\".        So unfortunately at every opportunity, Diamond lets his emotions get in the way of real science and critical thinking. His arguments are pretty pathetic in my view. There could be any number of reasons why farming took off in, as he continually calls it \\"eurasia\\", and a lot less in other places. Who really cares why it took off there? Nobody is going around saying \\"civilisation started in eurasia first therefore we're more intelligent and somehow deserve more\\".     I picked up this book hoping it would do as the cover stated, give me \\"a short history of everybody for the past 13,000 years\\". I didn't realise it was simply a crusade using (in my view) highly spurious and unfalsifiable arguments with one single goal in mind: to convince readers that genes don't make any difference at all.     This is what a typical argument in the book goes like: \\"such and such people near eurasia discovered the Superior farming method of living 6,000 years ago, while these other people near them only developed it 2,500 years ago. The lands appear similar, everything appears similar, so what happened?\\" Here nearly any prudent person would shrug and simply say \\"I don't know, it could be for any reason\\", but not Diamond. He then adds something like: \\"The answer lies not in that they're not as ingenius a race at all, it's because locusts would eat all their crops\\". Sometimes he even adds: \\"I know this sounds surprising/bizarre\\".       I simply cannot put any confidence in a man who for instance claims that the reason for the QWERTY take-over was to try to slow down typists. It's a well-known fact that it was to prevent jamming of the keys, that's why keys that were often used weren't placed close together. Jared Diamond also claims this to be \\"funny\\", but I found nothing funny about his made-up reasoning. He also said that a new keyboard layout has been developed that allows typists to type TWICE AS FAST as with 95% less effort!!! Imagine that, at least 120 words per minute with 95% less effort. How can anyone take a man who makes these sort of incredulous and arbitrary and just plain wrong claims on such simple things that we're all familiar with seriously on anything?! There are a number of examples throughout the book where I happened to have extra knowledge on the subject and was startled at some of his assertions. I cannot put any credibility in such a man.         So for conclusions such as that hunter-gatherer tribes are exceptionally egalatarian, and that the more densely populated a region is the less egalatarian it is: I simply can not afford a bone in my body to trusting this man's conclusion on anything, especially something political like that, given the rest of the book. Perhaps they aren't egalatarian at all (chimpanzees aren't), but Diamond just didn't see the rankings and relations within the tribes properly or didn't want to see them. There is nothing good or bad about rankings/egalatarianism, they both have a purpose. If Diamond wasn't so set on demonizing and politicising things I might have a reasonable amount of faith in his conclusion.        I did learn a few things from it and I like reading real history about this type of stuff, that's why I give it a 2 rather than a 1. But leave the pseudorational arguments out of it.     I'll leave you with this example quotation: \\"In short, Europe's colonization of Africa had nothing to do with differences between European and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume.\\" Charming!

B0001AP12G|4.0|By underground standards Kanye West is not very complex in terms of his lyrics. He's mediocre. He's not good enough. He's weak. He's this. He's that. FORGET THAT BS FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW. I brought this for 1 friggin dollar used just out of curiousity. I wasn't exactly floored the first time around, but I'll admit. Its great music.    LEMME BREAK IT DOWN...    -Kanye's simplistic lyrics aren't hard to listen to. I mean, if you are a \\"seasoned\\" underground head, you could be doing calculus homework and still catch EVERYTHING he says with ease. There's no hidden messages here. Just fun, simplistically conscious lyrics. DONT EXPECT MOS DEF BOBS CALIBER.     -ALL the beats are on point. It's early Kanye. He was still a BEAST. The beats and lyrics fuse together to make the funnest (\\"some of em dislexic, their favorite 50 Cent song is 12 Questions\\" LOL), most entertaining album (I'm killin these ni**az on this lyrical s***, mayonaise colored Benz I push miracle whips\\" LOL AGAIN)I've listened to since Sean Price's \\"Monkey Barz\\" and \\"Jesus Price Superstar.\\"    -It's not perfect. Breath In, Breath Out and Workout Plan were both garbage. NONE of the skits help out the album. They're practically useless.     -The best Outro OF ALL TIME IS \\"Last Call.\\" It was genius. He told his story basically. Most outros suck, but this outro is the BEST I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. Outro was utilized to PERFECTION.    THE FINAL VRDICT...    BUY IT. I guarentee you'll like it. If don't find something to like albut it you're either bull-headed or you REALLY HATE HIS CURRENT IMAGE. Forget that. It's 2004 Kanye. He was still himself. He made an album for the mainstream that got us underground heads lookin. I still enjoy it even though I listen to more complex lyricists such as Common, eLZHi, K-Rino etc. Kanye holds the album down lyrically still tho. I don't care.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Delivered as advertised. The Blu-ray/DVD combo was great for us becasue we plan to buy a Blu-ray player soon, but still have a DVD. This way, we could still watch the movie.<br /><br />Downside, the DVD contains no extra features, only the movie.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I think it would be a bit bold to say that this was the best film of the year. However, I did enjoy the sci-fi aspect of it. It has a great underlining story as it is set in South Africa, one of the racial hot spots of the world. But honestly, I felt like the movie was the product of smashing Independence Day with Slumdog Millionaire. There were aliens that could talk and a lot of tin shacks.<br /><br />One of my biggest questions after watching the movie was \\"How can the aliens understand English, but cannot yet speak it?\\" To me, that didn't make any sense. The language barrier kept bothering me as I watched the film until the very end. It seemed like no one could understand them, except the main protagonist. And when he responds to them, he doesn't speak in their language, but his own. Eh, perhaps there is a great explanation, but I didn't see one.<br /><br />It's an interesting film that I enjoyed, but probably wouldn't watch it again. Great themes of racial tension and love, but I prefer Kafka's Metamorphosis.
B002KREVCO|5.0|Great set, awesome track list, very good production, excellent quality and overall just an awesome set you need to have in your rock collection.  Very well done and includes both Bon Scott and Brian Johnson era songs.
B000LC55F2|3.0|Let me first start this review by stating that I'm a magician. I was a bit disappointed at the magic aspect of the story, but enjoyed the magician vs. magician premise. It actually did occur in real life. The funny thing is is that magic today is just as competitive as back then. I loved the star power in this movie, which I think gives it some credibility.<br /><br />The problem, for me, was the ending. I didn't quite understand what was happening at the end. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but I missed something. After watching it a second time, I understood what had happened and was pleased. But that initial misunderstanding still leaves me unsatisfied at the overall story appeal. However, this was one of the better magician movies and I think it's great for magic and magicians alike. I think it would be a great paired movie with something like The Illusionist, Next, or Shade.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I saw this picture when it was first released to theaters in glorious CinemaScope and stereophonic sound and at the time it was impressive indeed.  As time when on though, a few things about it bothered me a little:<br /><br />The appearance of the \\"Id monster\\" has a definite animated look, as indeed it was as provided by one of the Disney animators on loan-out to MGM.  The animated ray under the landing spaceship from Earth also doesn't look believable.<br /><br />Morbius points to the three-cornered opening as a \\"characteristic arch\\" of the Krell.  Those sharp corners would be seen immediately as stress concentrations by any engineer worth his salt going right back to the ancient Romans.  Obviously intended as something that would \\"look different\\".  Britain's first jet-liner, the de Havilland Comet had sharp cornered windows which caused the fuselage to crack and go to pieces in mid-flight and that was the end of that model.<br /><br />When Morbius demonstrates the recording made by Krell musicians thousands of years ago, it sounds exactly the same as the electronic tonalities we've been hearing all through the picture, so it doesn't have the impact it should.<br /><br />When Morbius has the Captain (Leslie Nielsen) fire his ray gun to test the strength of the Krell door,  Nielsen fires and then walks up to the door and comments that \\"this spot should be molten\\".  But he is pointing to a spot more than a foot away from where his ray supposedly struck it.<br /><br />Actually I like this picture a lot and these quibbles are mainly in fun.  For its time it was the Cadillac of science-fiction films - somethiing you would expect from MGM.  I\\"ll probably want to see the Blu-ray, but I'm afraid the landscapes of the planet Altair 4 will look more than ever like painted backdrops.<br /><br />p.s.  Well, the Blu-ray version of this classic did finally show up and I bought it and I'm very pleased with the upgrade-- especially the improvement in audio.  Filmed in CinemaScope, it had three channel stereophonic sound which is faithfully rendered in the Blu-ray version.  The video quality (as I predicted above) does show the details of where the sets end and the painted backdrops begin -- similar the the Blu-ray version of  \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  Even so I would never forgo the overall improvements of the Blu-ray version to the previous DVD.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Out of the hundreds of remakes, Muppet Christmas Carol is my champion of champion. In an age of CG, the Muppets are a reminder of how TV used to be. I love the combination of live actors with puppets that creates a magical world where ghosts can visit human beings. However, as with all remakes, I emphatically stress that viewers read the original. Yes, I'm an English major, but books are so much better.
B002BSHXJA|3.0|Having read many of the reviews on this site, I can't help being amused by the almost religious reverence in which the Beatles catalog is regarded.  What with the passionate discussions concerning the minutiae between the mono and stereo releases, people may as well be discussing different versions of the Bible.    I freely admit to being a Beatles fan, but I feel that most of the fervor over these new releases is being generated by nostalgia, not artistic appreciation.  Yes, the Beatles were the greatest rock and roll group of the past century (probably of all time), but let's face it... not everything they put out was wonderful.  For instance, Please, Please Me is an enjoyable collection of early Beatles originals and covers... but it's hardly indispensible.  The same came be said for the following album.  So for myself, debating the relative merits of the mono versions of these two albums over their respective stereo versions is a pointless exercise.    Of far greater importance are the iconic albums starting with A Hard Days Night, and excepting Beatles For Sale and Magical Mystery Tour (artistic low points both), includes everything in this set up to the White album.  As for the mono/stereo debate, my opinion is that Rubber Soul and Revolver both sound better in mono due to the poor left/right stereo mixes of those albums.  A Hard Days Night and the White album sound far better in stereo.  Other albums like Sgt Peppers have their interesting moments (She's Leaving Home), but overall sound better in stereo.    My feeling is that this whole mono versus stereo debate would be rendered moot with new, improved stereo mixes of all the albums (but particularly Help, Rubber Soul, and Revolver).  I think EMI missed a golden opportunity to give us definitive versions of these albums.  What a shame...
B000JML7EC|5.0|Moving beyond Muppet Treasure Island, I had a hard time even wanting to pick up this novel. Alas, I had to grow up and read the real story. I'm glad I did. While the novel is absent of catchy songs and puppets, Treasure Island makes up for it with graphic fight scenes and an outstanding narrative framework. I love that the story is mostly narrated by Jim Hawkins, our main character. Jim's voice places me so deep in the story that I felt every setting in the novel, from ship to island. Great classic and a must read for any English major.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Rome is not a show for the faint of heart as it could make some squeamish after watching incest, gore, blood and guts being beautifully depicted on screen. The show is somewhat of a double edged sword as the scenes are so discomforting and yet so hauntingly beautiful. Credit goes to the excellent writing, good acting and most of all authentic set designs that take the viewer back to Rome.<br /><br />This review is written after watching both the HBO series and viewing the show on DVD. I do plan to purchase the Blu Ray version of this show after Christmas.<br /><br />Highly recommend for adult viewers.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|As a magician, I was excited when I heard that this movie was coming out. Not only that, but for some reason, there were two magic movies coming out near the same time. Hmm? Some people are sure competitive. Anyway, I think it was great for the magic community.<br /><br />I loved The Illusionist. It had the perfect balance of magic with a great mystery tale that ensnared my attention. Nice star power and outstanding lighting and music. The twist at the end is great and something that I never expected. For me, until something better comes along, this is the one movie that makes a magician proud.

0380730405|5.0|I read and loved this book as a teenager.  I recently re-read it and loved it just as much.  It's a wonderfully atmospheric read which is part mystery, part romance but not entirely either.<br /><br />The story is about a girl (she narrates the book, but we never learn her name) who is working as a lady's companion.  In Monte Carlo they meet the taciturn Maxim de Winter, who recently lost his much loved wife Rebecca when she tragically drowned.  She marries him and they return to his country estate, Manderley.  Rebecca's presence can be felt everywhere: her belongings are still lying around, her clothes are still laid out in her bedroom and the staff follow the routines that she set.  The new wife becomes obsessed with her predecessor, who seemed in every way to be her polar opposite: beautiful, glamorous, highly admired and very close to the icy housekeeper, Mrs Danvers.  The book draws you in and I felt like I could completely identify with the heroine even while I was desperately wishing she would stand up for herself more.<br /><br />Just when you are starting to wonder if there is going to be anything more to the story, it takes a dramatic turn.  The central mystery is resolved and it turns into a different style of book, almost a thriller - but still centered on the mysterious Rebecca.<br /><br />While it's clearly not a modern novel, it is in no way difficult to read (if anything, it's hard to put down).  One thing that is interesting is that having been written in the 1930s, characters can react to events in a way that they probably wouldn't in a modern novel, even if it were set at the same time.<br /><br />The first couple of chapters are a little slow but do stick with it as you'll be hooked in no time - and then when you've finished the book you'll want to re-read them.  This would be the perfect book to read curled up by the fire on a wintry afternoon.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|What a great movie! Definetly own or rent this movie. My only complaint was that it was too short. Without the credits, the movie only runs an hour and ten minutes. I kept wishing the makers of the film would elaborate and explain more on some of the scenes that seemed cut short or rushed. I've seen some really, really bad movies that run almost two hours, this one could and should have run ten minutes longer than it did. My second complaint is the ending. I can't go into it too much without giving anything away, so I'll just say that I had to guess what might have happened for the ending to take place. The visuals are absolutley gorgeous and should be watched for that alone. It was shot in Finland and dubbed in English. Someone pointed that it was annoying because the voices didn't match the lips. I grew up on dubbed Godzilla movies, so this didn't bother me in the least. This movie doesn't look as badly dubbed as a Godzilla movie except in a few spots, but don't let these minor complaints deter you from watching this beautiful movie. Hey, it's only an hour and ten minutes out of your life. We waste more time watching drivel on TV, so why not check out this warm heartfelt movie? Give it a try. Tom C.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is the original zany Christmas comedy. From the beginning road race to the outrageous climax, [[ASIN:B000VBIGD6 National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Special Edition)]] will have you laughing out loud. Many movies have copied the jokes in this movie (especially the ultra-bright Christmas lights, which was copied in [[ASIN:B000UX798I Deck the Halls]]), [[ASIN:B000VBIGD6 National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (Special Edition)]] is the original and still the best.
0385040253|5.0|I'm a newbie, as I've only had my copy of Ashley for 25 years, unlike the fellow who bought his in 1945. :^)  But I want to echo most of what's been said.    If you're considering buying this book, how well it will fit your needs depends on what your needs are.  I strongly recommend you read the 2 and 3 star reviews, as what they contain are valid comments about the book.  Some of the criticisms that have been made of the book are:    * It's been in print for 60 years and hasn't been modernized.  * It was based on (mostly) natural fiber ropes.  It doesn't have relevant discussion of more modern fibers.  * Some of the drawings can be hard to understand.  * The indexing could be better.    If you're reading this, you have access to a computer, so you can learn an enormous amount about knots from the web, including color pictures, verbose descriptions, and animations.  It's a fantastic resource.  Why, then, would anyone spend 50 bucks on a book like Ashley?    If you just want to learn some practical knots, then there are many books that will suit your needs (if you can't get what you want from the web for free).  You can visit a library to take a look at different books.    Yet I still think Ashley's book belongs in my library (you'll have to make your own decision as to whether it belongs in your library).  I still pick it up and get immersed in it a few times a year.  It's fascinating reading and learning about all the different types of knots and other ropework.    There are some very practical things I've learned from this book.  One of my favorites is #364, which explains how to tie a constrictor knot to fasten a hose to a hose fitting.  I've used this many times over the last 20+ years.  My wife complained about my using worm-drive hose clamps to hold on the machined brass fittings and I had to agree -- they hurt one's hand when tightening a connection.  Ashley's method with the constrictor works perfectly -- so well, in fact, that I leave it on permanently.  Iuse 1/8\\" braided nylon rope.  I also use it to attached compressed air hose to its fittings.  You should also be aware that it could be an emergency fix for e.g. a broken radiator clamp.  I've even tied it in wire.    While I'm at it, I'll also pass on a comment about the knots I use.  For 95% of the things I do (and my wife and kids tease me about how much I use rope and twine to do lifting, pulling, and lashing), I use the bowline, constrictor, span loop, and one and two half hitches (often the second hitch is slipped).  I still use other knots, but one or more of those four are involved whenever I pick up a piece of rope.    Oh, and since I use the bowline more than the other knots, I'll pass on a relatively unknown way of tying this knot.  I don't remember where I learned it (it wasn't from Ashley), but the method is #1788.  I consider it extremely important, as once you learn it, you can tie it completely by feel, in the dark, the rain, or a snowstorm with ice-cold hands -- and do it in a few seconds (with practice).  The key is to pull on the knot properly so that you feel it collapse into a bowline.  This is such an important way of tying the knot, I think it should be taught to everyone.  Yet I've never run across anyone who knew the method (except the person who taught it to me).
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Avatar is movie magic, pure and simple.     I'm honestly having trouble writing a proper review of Avatar, the memories of watching the movie and the feelings it brought about are so overwhelming, it is hard to properly jot down what I think of it. However the word magic is the one that constantly comes to mind. Avatar is without a doubt the definition of movie magic. During all the pre-release hype for Avatar, I recall a movie director, whose name I can't quite remember at the moment, described watching Avatar as dreaming with your eyes wide open. At the time I scoffed at the idea, I knew the movie would be a good time, I mean it is James Cameron after all, but that seemed a tad hyperbolic at the time. Well after seeing Avatar not once, but twice, I have to almost agree. Experiencing Avatar was almost like a dream. Witnessing the monumental landscapes of Pandora, the lifelike CG creations, it was all nothing short of awe inspiring. James Cameron created something that is almost 100% purely digital, yet with more of a resonating heartbeat than the countless of tired blockbusters that seem to come out every summer. Avatar feels real, the emotion feels real. Just remembering scenes from the movie evokes a strong emotional sense, that you wish you could go back to the movie as soon as possible.    Cameron combines his beautiful creations with pure classic Hollywood storytelling. No cynicism here, just pure sincerity. But what truly sets apart Avatar from the countless would be \\"epic\\" movies these days, is its heart, and its thematic underpinnings. Avatar is a story about seeing and understanding people as they really are. Accepting different cultures for what they are, no matter how they are different. This is the heart of the movie, and in my mind is what will make it timeless. It is a story that will seemingly forever be parallel to human society. It is a story Cameron wrote 15 years ago, but is as valid now as it was then, if not moreso.     I could go on and on about the many wonders of the movie, however I would be spoiling the experience...In the end, Avatar may perhaps be the most CGI heavy live action feature film ever, yet it is one with immense heart and soul. Avatar is a reminder of why we go to the movies.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|AVATAR has changed everything, has pushed the envelope, will be the landmark in film that changes the way movie are made, just like STAR WARS did when it was created. Yet, in a boring year for movies it was propped up higher than it probably deserved.<br /><br />You make think that I'm off base here, but this review comes from a huge fan of James Cameron, The Abyss, Aliens etc. Yet, in a few years, after more directors and more movies are made with the technologies that James Cameron has pushed here, AVATAR will lose its luster.<br /><br />Notice the one category that AVATAR was not nominated for at the Oscars. SCREENPLAY. When Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) explains why the humans are on Pandora it was so blunt and quickly explained, I thought, that was really bad, but I figured it was gonna be a rare occurence. Then Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) starts telling Jake Sully (Jake Worthington) what he needs him for and you can't imagine how the alarms wouldn't have been going off in Jake Sully's head at how one-dimensional despicable this character was. He tells him that if he succeeds at stabbing the inhabitants of Pandora in the back, he'll get his legs back. Jake Sully's in a wheelchair.<br /><br />James Cameron is one of, if not my favorite director, because unlike Michael Bay and Rolland Emmerich, he knows that every action movie has to have a heart, and he's right. He knows that among all the flash and circumstance, you must slow down and make the audience CARE and he does it better than anyone.<br /><br />Yet, I thought Cameron was above using his films to make political messages. The Marines call the Na'vi terrorists. The attack on the Na'vi is referred to as 'shock and awe'. The unnecessary and unexplainable comparisons of the Na'vi to the terrorists that we fight today who behead journalists, blow up unarmed citizens and hate jews and christians for just being jews and christians, is detestable and boarders on treasonous.<br /><br />While the Marines and the company behind the human invasion are so horribly one-dimensional, and the plotline is sadly predictable and been done a thousand times, the STORY is like something you have never imagined. The story is far from typical because the story is the people. The story is the characters. The story is Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana, and the beautiful culture of the Na'vi. The story is how a crippled Marine went from a man on a mission, to a man reborn.<br /><br />The truth is though, I hadn't been sucked into movie like AVATAR in a long time. I was there on Pandora. I could feel the trees and the lights and the environment. It succeeded brilliantly at taking me away from my life and taking me somewhere, and that is the brilliance of movies.<br /><br />The production of AVATAR and its credible colors, environments and seamless transformations between what is real and what isn't is what will take this to its rightful place. It's a brilliant film and I will see it many many many times again. Yet, its screenplay will, in a few years, make it just another movie, after better movies are WRITTEN and produced with similar technology.<br /><br />If the Movie is released on Blu-ray or DVD without 3D. It isn't worth the purchase.asion are so horribly one-dimensional, and the plotline is sadly predictable and been done a thousand times, the STORY is like something you have never imagined.

B002PMV9FG|1.0|The widescreen DVD disc that I bought was so poorly produced that it was dark and faded throughout...up to the point where the disc stuttered, ground to halt, and refused to play any further.  There is nothing wrong with my Sony player: all my other discs play perfectly well.  The disc production had the appearance of an illegal rip-off or some low-bid, over-seas production.  I was offered a refund but not a replacement, leading me to think that I was not the first person who encountered these problems.  Locally, I heard that several other people had returned their discs to the stores where they bought them.    As for the movie itself, it does not stand alone as the earlier films did.  It has the appearance of being merely a transition between the previous film and the next. Despite the problem of the book being long and allotted theater viewing time limited, other reviewers' criticisms about omitted, essential scenes have merit.  Any person caught up in the Harry Potter craze will have to see this film; however, I am not convinced that everyone would care to see it again.
B002VECM6I|5.0|My wife and I just went to a double-feature. I picked AVATAR and she picked THE BLIND SIDE. Now, there couldn't be two movies on a different plateau than AVATAR and BLIND SIDE, but I'm so glad that she brought me to see this movie. AVATAR, I gave 4 stars, BLIND SIDE, 5 stars. BLIND SIDE, for what it was, was flawless.<br /><br />With BLIND SIDE, the story tells itself, because it's the true story of 2009 Baltimore Ravens Right Tackle Michael Oher, or possibly Michael Williams, or maybe something else, and his improbable escape from oblivion with the love and care of a rich white family in Memphis, Tennessee. Michael Oher's greatness, first showed up in his size and athletic potential and then in his courage to forget and go forward. Michael Oher, a kid who struggled at basic study skills and education, but scored a 98% in protective instincts. A tribute to his lifestyle and his ability to survive, homeless, with two shirts, a pain on his face that couldn't be explained.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, and I haven't seen a whole lot of nominated movies this year, but if she isn't at least a runner up to the best actress of the year, I'll be stunned. This was Sandra Bullock's shining moment. She is strong and she is funny and she is exceedingly brilliant at hiding the tears she sheds throughout the movie as her personna won't allow her to be seen crying. No scene was more poigniant than the one where she makes a bedroom for Michael in her beautiful home with a chipperness that you would expect from a spunky Tennessee mother. Michael says, \\"I've never had one of these before.\\" and she says, \\"What, a room?\\" \\"No, a bed.\\" he says. She looks at him, stoned faced, gives a quick nod and exits the room, enters the bathroom, locks the door and although we don't see it, we know exactly what she's doing.<br /><br />THE BLIND SIDE is a testimant to what life is all about. The Tuohy families link to Michael Oher may have been a rare occurence, and that's why there's a movie about it, but if we all looked out for each other a little more, despite color boundaries, despite class boundaries and just showed a little love and extended a helping hand when we could, the world would be a better place.<br /><br />The Tuohy's didn't just extend a hand, they extended their hearts and lives.t if we all looked out for each other a little more, despite color boundaries, despite class boundaries and just showed a little love and extended a helping hand when we could, the world would be a better place.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this adaptation. The emotions between the actors are intense and it keeps wanting to watch it to the very end. Magnificant scenery, acting, story and it's full of emotions. Another Bronte classic done superbly!
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|Bah-humbug, I say; this film is the worst kind of filth. Hopefully this massacre of an adaptation won't frighten viewers from investing in the graphic novel, which is infinitely more intelligent and rewarding. The problem isn't just the script - which is bland, misogynist, overtly violent and dimwitted - it's the direction. Let's face it: Zack Snyder shouldn't be making movies, he should be making screen-savers. It's over-stylized nonsense, and it detracts from the maturity of the content.<br /><br />So, in short, by turning Laurie into a self-centered bimbo, adding heaps of unnecessary violence, often hilarious dialog, and a side-splittingly out of place soundtrack, Zack Snyder has managed to turn an intelligent comic book (which is something of a rarity these days) into a moronic popcorn flick which has sold tens of thousands of chain-wallets and wristbands and beanies (which is tragically commonplace). Somehow, this disaster turned into a hit with a strange and decidedly 16-year-old fanbase. Well, you guys can have my copy - I think I'd rather just read it.<br /><br />Zack, your attempts at sabotaging things that I think are cool have not gone unnoticed. I've got my eye on you, bub, and if you lay one finger on The Dark Knight Returns, well so-help-me-God I will write you the angriest of emails. And don't you forget it.
0385504225|3.0|One probably shouldn't expect Dan Brown to ever top the The Da Vinci Code, but even with unhindered expectations this 3rd Langdon / Symbology mystery-thriller is a bit of a snooze, although that's not due to a lack of setting and premise.  Those elements are as appealing as ever, more so since instead of the usual far-off locations and ancient history presented in both Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, here we have a locale and era much closer to home for Americans:  none other than our own Washington D.C., and the theory that America's history and her founding fathers are steeped in Masonic lore and mystical secrets.       When Langdon is summoned by old friend Peter Solomon, a powerful Washington figure as well as a modern-day Mason, he thinks he's simply being called on to do one of the things he does best - lecture to a rapturous audience about symbology, which I find a fascinating subject all by itself.  Soon after arriving in D.C., however, Langdon is yanked into the midst of a bizarre and sinister plot that threatens the security of the country and even the world, yadda yadda yadda.      It's vintage Dan Brown with its lightning-fast pacing and cliffhanger chapter endings, chock full of interesting tidbits along the way to keep us interested, and we're much like the doomed children of Hamelin as we follow Brown's Pied Piper out of the village and into oblivion.  Where the story falters is in the characterization.  It's never been Brown's strength to begin with, and I don't know that his characters - including Langdon, although he's slightly more compelling - are meant to be much more than tools to move the storyline along.  Still, we need something to sink our teeth into with these characters.  Brown's formula usually includes a bizarre, almost Bond-esque villain who either wants something only Langdon can deliver, be it knowledge or an actual object, or wants Langdon out of the way so the criminal's evil deed can be fulfilled.  The villain here, a physically and mentally freakish man we know only as Mal'akh, is so two-dimensional and unrealistic that he struck me as a comic book character, and I thought he detracted from the value of the story rather than enhanced it.      Still not a bad book, and certainly an entertainer for the beach or other casual reading.  Where Brown lacks in depth he makes up for with master craftsmanship in creativity and story structure, and his patent on the esoteric thriller is rock solid.
144867185X|2.0|Keynes is pretty great (or at least, inarguably important), but this edition does not include footnotes, which were supplied by Keynes in the original text.  If you're bothering to read The General Theory, and are capable of following it, you're probably also a reader of footnotes, so do not buy this copy.    Of less concern, though telling, are the various typos that seem to be the result of (I'm not kidding) a bad OCR scan of an original.  On page 13, for instance, the word \\"ina~tained\\" shows up.  I'm assuming that meant \\"maintained,\\" and I think it's implausible that tildes are defensible typos.  C'mon Classic Books America--at least use spell-check!

B001G0MFOM|5.0|From 2002, when I watched for the first time The L Word here in Italy I've become a faithful fan of the lives of Tina, Bette, Jenny and all the others great characters of this series. For 4 seasons, Italian TV followed the show almost simultaneously with their broadcasting in USA and the rest of the world. Then, abruptly it stopped and still today we don't know when or if seasons 5 and 6 will ever be put on the air. But I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen in the two final seasons, so I ordered season 5 from Amazon.co.uk. Great season, even better than the previous ones. But then I discovered that season 6 wouldn't have been available in England before next July, so I decided to take the risk and ordering it in USA, although the regions for DVD system are different. You know, I couldn't wait, life is too short! As soon as I've received the package, I checked if my DVD recorder was able to read it. It was! So now I'm going to watch the whole season in the next weeks, to put even if a little sadly the E word (End) on this magnificent saga. Thanks Amazon!
0439023483|5.0|Before starting the book I didn't let myself read any other reviews so that I could create my own opinions of the story. I hate to know too much before I start. For this reason with movies I like to only see a preview once or twice so I can be more surprised by the actual finished product. Although I enjoyed the book it didn't go as quickly as I thought it would. The first time I picked it up I only got a few pages and then put it down and read a few other books. When I picked it up the second time I got into it right away. While I understood the premise of the Hunger Games I also had an inkling of the outcome because this book is the first in a series, it might have been better to have it be a stand alone novel. Also, I didn't care for the open ended way it ended. I know it needed to be left open for the next book, and I am lucky that I waited this long to read the first since now I can move right on to the second, but it reminded me a bit of the openness of the endings for the Fever series by Karen Marie Moning. Like the end of a season of a tv show that leaves you hanging so you'll tune in again in the fall. To me, if the writing is good I will go back for more by the same author and about the same characters even if I am not being teased by a cliff hanger. Perhaps with YA books this is more common to keep younger readers hooked.<br /><br />The story this first called to mind for me was \\"The Lottery\\" by Shirley Jackson. Usually when we think of having our name chosen from a bowl winning is the desirable option, but in both of these stories it is what everyone is crossing their fingers hoping against. Kind of like sacrificing virgins to the gods hoping for favor, they seem like pointless rituals from the outside.<br /><br />Haymitch, the advisor to Peeta and Katniss, the two tributes from District 12, is described as frequently being drunk. Haymitch was the winner of the Hunger Games many years before and I wondered if his alcohol abuse could be tied to the horrors he experienced and the kills he may have had to make as a player in the game. How much of themselves do the tributes give up in order to survive? Is it better to die yourself or to compromise what you believe in to win and make things a little better for your district? Do the winners lives ever go back to normal? If not should they want them too since starvation and hardship seem to be the norm? Will there be a way for the winners to share whatever they have earned by winning with their district and should they even be asked to? I also wondered how the rules worked for winners- would their names continue to be put into the lottery if they were under 18 or would they be dismissed for their prior service?<br /><br />I admired Katniss for stepping forward to take her sisters place and for using what she had learned poaching in the woods to keep herself alive. Peeta's enduring love was encouraging at a time when they had so little. The alliances that were formed in the arena reminded me of \\"Survivor\\" especially in that they turned on each other and had ulterior motives for teaming up. I really had an issue with the people living int the capital. If they had so much why couldn't they share to keep people in the districts from starving? Did the people from the districts ever had the chance to more to the capital or did you have to be born there? If the wealth was shared and the fences removed would there even be a cause for the people to rebel again? Some great issues were addressed in this book. Whenever a story inspires so many questions I think of it as a good book for meaningful discussions.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading the next book, \\"Catching Fire\\" to see where Collins takes the story!and the kills he may have had to make as a player in the game.

Steven Fry as Wooster's valet and problem solver is awesome. One of the remarkable features of the series is the 1920's settings.  Every detail is covered from cars to table settings, hotels to New York streets, music to clothes. It is wonderful, classy British humor at its best.  My son and I had a wonderful time viewing it together.

I was going to get just the Stereo version, and I am so happy I got the Mono as well.  I know the music very well, and the sound is incredibly true.  I am hearing things on the Mono CD's that I have never heard before.  Although I like the stereo version, it is sometimes jarring to hear a lot of separation in the music.  I find that I am returning more to the Mono CD's than the Stereo version.  Hope this helps!
B002T9H2L0|2.0|mediocer! Congratulations: the first time we've had to see him when he actually keeps his clothes on during the entire movie. This story is interesting, but totally ficticious and it really should have been called: \\"Vainglorious Basterds.\\" It didn't even have any HD stuners or relief for one second of what has got to be one of the most hilarious imterpretations of Hitler in history.  Hey Guys, if you are going to make a somewhat historical movie, try not to make it a goofy farce!

1906694176|5.0|For the third time, Steig Larsson delivers. (Too bad the US publishers didn't on this latest and last of the unbelievably popular Millennium Series--apparently they are waiting for some unfathomable reason known only to the inner world of publishing. I know people who paid upwards of 50 dollars for this book.  I only paid 12 pounds + shipping by purchasing Hornet's Nest from the UK.)  I am savoring every page, every word of this brilliant crime/political/social commentary novel. It is devastating to know that this talented author will not be delivering any more novels.
0810983915|5.0|My son is 9 and loves the Wimpy Kid series.  He identifies with the main character.  I know that he has read all of the books already, and was disappointed because I wanted to get him the latest in the series.  I asked him about this and he said he would like to have the book even though he has already read it.  He wants to read it over and over.  These books just don't go out of style!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The is very entertaining and educational. If you enjoy history, this will simply amaze you. I learned so much about early America. The acting is superb.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|There is no special box with this like that other reviewer reported.  I'm sure that was just something the studio threw in for early reviewers/gifts etc etc.    It comes shrink wrapped with a sticker.  That's it.   This is NOT a boxed set, it is a shrink wrapped bundle of 3 smaller boxed sets.   Its very compact, the size is about 4 single blu-ray cases stacked up.  Its not deluxe or impressive, its not a \\"Luxury Boxed Set\\".   You are buying the contents not the packaging.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|When this performance was released on DVD I was ecstatic and I couldn't wait to own it. I totally enjoyed it in the theater last year and on public television. I've already watched the dvd several times and I still enjoy every minute of it. I've read the other reviews here and I'm not sure why they sometimes so harsh. I suppose it is natural to compare performances but is it really fair? Maria Callas, Katia Ricciarelli and Joan Sutherland all sang more than 20 years ago. I have never heard any of them as Lucia. Anna Netrebko is a 21st century singer and a very good one. Here she is an excellent Lucia.<br /><br />I'm not a musician or performer so I don't criticze Netrebko's pitch or lack of trills as one reviewer did. It all sounds fine to me. She sings much better than I ever will. I do agree that her words often seem garbled and she could probably use some lessons in diction but since I don't understand Italian it doesn't really matter. Thank heaven for subtitles! Overall Anna Neterbko can sing well and act and look fantastic. What more do you need in a leading lady?<br /><br />When I heard that Rolando Villazon was not singing I was very disappionted. I love his voice and I was looking forward to hearing him. I had never heard of Piotr Beczala and was ready to dislike him. How unfair is that? He was amazing! Within a few lines after Edgardo's entrance in act 1, he won me over. I enjoyed every note he sang. Plus, he's a trim, young, good looking romantic lead. In opera that's a bonus; too many singers are overweight and older. I will now follow Piotr's career and, maybe, get to see him live someday if he ever comes to Minnesota. He and Anna sang well together and looked fantastic even in HD.<br /><br />There has been a lot of criticism written in Amazon's reviews about Mary Zimmerman's production. I think it is fine. I like the ghosts; they make sense and do appear in the book. Updating the story to Victorian times works also. I have no problem with the addition of a photographer at the wedding. It also makes sense although I admit it did break the tension surrounding Edgardo's arrival at the wedding. The photograher is a quirk that works for me. He does not distract me from the story nor does he take away from the sextet. I also like the sets very much. The outdoor set in Act 1 looks like a desolate highland place where you would expect to see a ghost. The slightly rundown home of Act 2 is effective. I totally love the staicase in the mad scene and the cemetary at the end. Seeing Lucia as ghost interacting with Edgardo was a good touch.<br /><br />Overall this was an excellent show. I have spent several evenings enjoying this production and I look forward to many more. Buy the dvd then get out the popcorn and some Kleenex while you watch it.wedding.

B002VT6C0K|4.0|I love Alice Munro's writing, probably more than I do any of her contemporaries. Her deceptively simple, yet spellbinding, words and sentences stack up like glistening beads to tell hard, sometimes gruesome, truths about...well, life. I might describe this collection as being somewhat more of an &#34;acquired taste&#34; than others of hers that I've also enjoyed, but there is much in here to love even for those new to Ms. Munro. &#34;Wood,&#34; in particular, I found to be a little gem - contained but powerful in its impact. The last story (that is, the title story) I didn't care for so much, but no matter; the collection is a strong one and stands up with the rest and best of Munro's work.
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes, Frank McCourt's heartbreaking memoir, is a one of a kind book. Heartbreaking, gleeful, hilarious, tender, and extremely moving, you are invited into a world of desperate poverty and fertile creativity and, finally, forgiveness and strength.    Enjoy!

Especially during these very tough economic times......JESUS IS THE REASON FOR THE SEASON......And should be thoughout the remainder of our days on this earth!
0786838655|5.0|My 9yr old son got me hooked on this series.  This is a well written fantasy book. Percy Jackson is a six grader who finds out his father is a God. I love how much mythology is woven into this story which is a nice boost for my son's education too.
B000002VMD|5.0|I liked this movie well enough to view it numerous times, and found something new or different each time.  There are those who do not like one or more of the actors, so have never viewed this movie.  Too bad.  Great movie, and really good acting.  Yes, there are some 'cheesy' moments, but they are few are far between.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's much awaited CD exceeded expectations. Her phenomenal vocal range, vibrato, and soulful rendition leaves us wanting more of her singing. The first released  album is a mixed collection of songs  including her now more than famous interpretation of \\"I dreamed a dream\\"  from the musical Les Miserable. This is sung even better with full orchestral back up. The CD begins with \\"Wild horses\\" which wakes you up and makes your hairs stand on your back. THe late night jazzy  \\" Cry me a river\\" is so soothing, a great wind down late night number, which we had the privilege of sneak Utube previews. \\"How great thou Art\\", Amazing grace\\" and Up to the Mountains\\" offers immense spiritual uplift for even the most hard bitten cynic.  Tracks 5 and 9 , \\"You'll See\\" and \\"Who I was born to be\\" are awe inspiring and self validating. The last two numbers are sobering , and the final track reminds us of Christmas approaching with \\"Silent night\\". Thanks to Amazon.com  I 've multiple copies of Susan Boyle's first release. May she release many more such albums that touch the hearts of millions. Amazon delivered my 3 copies expeditiously; at an unbelievable bargain  price. (I bought the 4th copy from  Dubai International airport Duty free music center.)

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Finding a used copy of Cloverfield is the best way to watch this movie. If you're the least bit curious about the movie, as I was, grab a cheap used copy, a bowl of popcorn, and a few captain & cokes, and enjoy !
B001DHXT2U|4.0|The movie was good it work well on my dvd player but not on my PS2.
B001OQCV24|4.0|Were there flaws? Yes, as some of the other reviewers have noted, but this movie was highly entertaining, and very exciting through much of it. In fact, though the movie was long, I was never bored. There were parts of the story line that were totally unrealistic. Yet I made the decision to ignore that and just enjoy the flick. And I did. It's entertainment, and I was very entertained.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, the special effects sequences were worth the price of admission. I'm not sure why people put down special effects movies. I agree that there must be more to a film than that, but this one did have depth. The story showed complicated relationships being worked out, forgiveness, people maturing and taking responsibility, parental love and devotion, people fighting for what's right and a lot more. It also showed us the darker side of human nature as well. It was interesting.<br /><br />I don't really believe that this exact situation is going to happen like this, and I don't believe that if this did happen, it would go down like this. And I don't really believe that John Cusack's character could have survived most of what his character pulled through. But who cares. It was exhilarating and a fun way to pass an afternoon.
B002VPE1AM|1.0|Take everything wrong with American culture in the last millennium (racism, sexism, Manifest Destiny, Imperialism, exploitation of the earth, etc.) and toss them all together in a cinematic soup and overlay that with a weak sci-fi plot; and with even less forethought, and what falls out is a horrible and expensive movie like \\"Avatar.\\" It is a \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" movie to embarrass all \\"B-rated\\" \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" movies.<br /><br />And as always, its context is transparent chest-beating (chomping at the bit to go to war) \\"white male heroism.\\" That Sigourney Weaver shares the lead in this now familiar trope, as the white female surrogate version of the white male hero, does not lessen the impact of its sexist and racist subtext in the least.  And of course, the antagonists are a thinly disguised cross between Native Americans and Watutsis, whose only difference is that they have tails (yes, that's right tails); their skin color is a funereal parlor purple and they are flat-nosed, cat-eyed and at least ten feet tall. Otherwise they are clones of 17th Century American Indians: with war dances, war paint and all.<br /><br />To go with this image, in 3-D no less, we have as a plot line: a supposedly advanced American society seeking to exploit minerals and to otherwise colonize a stone-age society in outer space somewhere. The Americans, as they somehow always are in these kind of movies, are an uptight, tightly wound bunch led by straitlaced militarists who have no values beyond their imperialist intentions and their love for playing pocket pool with their military hardware.<br /><br />Then comes the other familiar trope: the morality play. And I admit that within the rigid confines of a racist and imperialist paradigm, it does require some fancy footwork if not a bit of imagination -- however tortured it may be -- to come up with the idea that the white heroes get to live in both societies at the same time. That way, they get to play white morality against itself,(I guess to forgo the necessity of having to introduce a possibly superior alien morality directly into the plot).<br /><br />As always the whites are divided into the \\"good ones:\\" the tree-hugging, environmentally conscious liberals; and the evil warmongering racists ones, without a conscious at all. To complete this \\"closed incestuous moral circle\\" of \\"white only  on white only moral inhumanity,\\" the Space Indians become little more than a sexual prop to donate their chief's princess as the \\"white male hero's lover,\\" and then after that solitary deed is done, just as in history, they then become fodder for white superiority as demonstrated by advance weaponry and the unsparing Saddam Hussein like brutality (They even use CW against the space Indian's bows and arrows?).<br /><br />Oh, did I mention that the two-or three \\"good whites\\" all began the movie as \\"bad ones too,\\" but during the course of all the 3-D mayhem, they become guilty and are then somehow touched by \\"real (non-white Indian) humanity. And as a result, they undergo a moral transformation and flip, the same as Kevin Costner did in \\"Dancing with Wolves.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the movie is so predictable (and meaningless) that it is not even worth mentioning. The most memorable thing about the movie will not be that it was in 3-D, or that space level modern tech weaponry went up against bow and arrow war-fighting, or that it was an intramural morality play, but the colossal lack of imagination that went into this production. And the way the plot hewed so closely to the well worn white supremacist/Manifest Destiny/American Imperialist narrative. Either we have not grown up much as a society or the moviemakers simply do not trust us, or our kids, to have a brain.  Save your money. This is an expensive one Star monstrosity.
B002T921AC|2.0|There's no reason you should be buying this CD.   He has enough talent so that you wouldn't boo him off of karaoke, but that's the extent of it.  It's your typical mildly catchy beat with annoying repetitive lyrics that wear thin quickly.  It's definitely not the worst stuff out there as i'll give it a 2/5.   If your one of those homogenized people corporate America has produced/manufactured through the 'the merchants of cool' to just buy what you're fed by a cabal of writers then this album is for you.
B0000041DZ|5.0|Someday, in the not too distant future, technology will evolve in such a fashion that will allow the listener to \\"choose\\" his own sitting position in relation to the recorded artists. I was just thinking about that from listening to these Beethoven realizations. The microphones and this recording are presented as if you're sitting in a chair about 10-15 feet in front of the piano (by the curved outer rim) with bass notes to the right, high notes to the left. The recording is so transparently clear it's as if there's no one else in the room but you and Brendel. Wouldn't it be interesting, then, if you could position yourself on, say, the bench or maybe 10-15 behind (or to the side of) Brendel? I'm quite sure, although I'm guessing, that there are people out there who have a seating preference at recitals, concert halls, and so on. Seventh row center always seem to pop up as preferred seating position #1, but there may be others who are just as comfortable sitting in the back or up in loge. I enjoy these interpretations of the maestro's 32 Sonatas because they are performed reverentially, majestically, tastefully, and with a deep respect for tempi, colour, harmony and space. The recording itself is top shelf. It couldn't get any better. In The Honeymooner's, Ralph Kramden held out on getting a TV set because he's waiting for 3D TV. Fat chance! And yes, anecdotes aside, it would be interesting to be able to reposition oneself in 3D space vis-a-vis a recording. But then, by holding out, you would rob yourself of this exemplary recording & performance.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|Locks on tightly, and matches the original Dual Shock in terms of materials, look and texture. As far as function -- they're good considering they are just snap-on. It's not going to turn your Dual Shock buttons into \\"real\\" triggers like with the 360 controller. It's only a close approximation. Still, it's good for me because my fingers had a tendency to slip off the L2 and R2 buttons at times. That problem is gone now.

B002P5XXR0|5.0|Wow! Amazing soundtrack. The movie was so good I wasn't even aware of the music while watching it. What's so amazing is this CD is perfect mix of action type music and new age spiritual sounding pieces. Will love playing this CD over and over which will make the movie much deeper experience next time I see it. Some soundtracks are too heavy in the action tracks like some of the Borne Identity CD's. Then others too slow. This is perfect mix and I highly recommend it.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|See the IMAX 3D version.  In addition to the sheer genius of the way this movie is put together and the selection of the actors (Sadana and Worthington, especially, are charming and totally believable), there are story lines involving politics that unflinchingly criticize the exploitation of other cultures (yes, the colonel is over the top: so what--the evil perpetrated by exploiters deserves the harsh depiction), and others that expore religion, psychology, myth, archetypes, and more. I took my son for his birthday--he has not stopped talking about Avatar, so now I've ordered the movie poster and pre-ordered the movie for him.  Cameron's film touched both of us and will be permanently among our favorites. Thank you, James Cameron for giving my son such a memorable birthday experience.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love listening to Ms. Boyle and her honest style of music. Her rendition of \\"Wild Horses\\" says it all. A voice that soothes the soul. The only downside I found was that I felt she was held back a bit; I enjoyed watching the Britain Has Talent video of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", yet in this version on the CD, she doesn't quite \\"belt it out\\" like before. Still, a relaxing mix of songs that never fails to let us know that this is just the beginning for the amazing Ms. Boyle. I look forward to her future works.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I am not going to insist on the technical prowess and creativity of this film. The special effects, both visual and sound, are superb, sublime, perfect, the merger of Star Wars and Matrix, of all the best means ever devised to make our eyes and ears believe the unbelievable. James Cameron is a god of sorts in that field and he used the most advanced studios to produce a divine and magical fairy tale. Anyone who pretends to love the cinema cannot and must not ever be reluctant in the slightest way to go and watch that film, two or three times if possible. And James Cameron is just as good when he deals with the surreal and supernatural of this extra-terrestrial civilization and when he exposes the brutality and human underdevelopment with no hope to ever be emerging from their dumbness of both military higher-ups and greedy industrialists. To list and explain all the allusions to all the films you can and will recognize would need two hundred pages. So I will pass and trust your own knowledge to enjoy the many allusions. I want to insist on the central message of the film, both ideological and cultural. Americans arriving on this planet finds a humanoid species, both intelligent and developed, but in a direction that has kept and exploited the direct relation that every individual can entertain with the beasts of nature and the telluric or subterranean forces of nature seen as the mother of the equilibrium without which nothing can survive. The only aim of the Americans is to recuperate some ore that is in great quantities under the main home-tree of this species, under all the sacred places and natural temples of this civilization, and to use brutal force if necessary to clear the area.  Greed and death instinct are the two teats on which all these Americans have been fed. Genetic science makes it possible to invest the personality of a human into the genetically modified cloned body of a local humanoid, producing a spy who is to get into this community and bring back the information necessary for the military genocide while his human body is kept in some hibernating pod. The problem with that project is that the happy few who can thus get into that community fall in love with their civilization, their culture, their deep human feelings and their absolute cult of prowess, courage and intelligence invested in the full respect of mother nature. Eventually for one of them that love will mean falling in love with the daughter of the political (father) and religious (mother) leaders of the tribe. James Cameron is a genius in the way he depicts the strong human emotions on the American side, both negative and positive and this depicting is immediately effective on us who are well trained in reading, receiving and experiencing these emotions. We feel the full horror James Cameron wants us to feel in front of the ugly conquistador colonel and the admirable courage of this female marine who prefers betraying her camp to being part of a planned genocide. James Cameron tries hard to depict in the same way the extra-terrestrial feeling and emotions of these humanoids, both real and cloned, but there we feel them less because they are different and we are not in phase with them, especially since the special effects are making us slightly blind. But it remains absolutely sublime. The meaning here is that of the meeting of two human species and their divided objectives on both sides. It is the merging of the two species in order to produce collaboration, cooperation, exchange and even total gift of culture, technological power, natural knowledge, spiritual representations, and all other common or different domains. In other words we are dealing with the fascination of the other. Some call that inverted racism or mixing cultures, salad bowl or melting pot, integration or assimilation. But James Cameron shows us how that approach is dangerous and fatal for the weaker species who will always be the victim of the stronger species, understood asbeing the Americans who have  no word of honor when greed is in play. At the same time if we do not respect the other in its total personality, religion and religious beliefs included, we will only produce a genocide, be it at least a cultural genocide teaching English and imposing our culture, and negating the natural evolution of the differentiation of languages, the punishment of the tower of Babel in our religious lore. James Cameron is telling us a parable more than a fable, and he is in perfect line with the deepest Judeo-Christian tradition of ours, of the Christ who was rabbi Jesus before being crucified. That deepest belief of ours is called love: to love the other in his or her difference and to give to that other all we have and share it with him or her, expecting the same attitude on the other side but at the same time refusing violence in the other case and loving our \\"enemies\\" as much as our \\"friends\\". In other words, and to cut short a long story, this film is the First Gospel after Barack Hussein Obama's election, even if that new spiritual approach of the world did not produce a miracle in Copenhagen. The Second Gospel of this Obama era will be the announced film by Steven Spielberg on the last novel by Stephen King, Under the Dome. After Saint James, the first Bishop of Jerusalem and the elder brother of Jesus in the end stoned to death at the foot of the wall of Jerusalem, we will have Saint Stephen, the Protomartyr of Christianity, stoned to death on the encouragement of Saul of Tarsus, the future Paul.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDbeing the Americans who have  no word of honor when greed is in play.

B002VPE1AM|4.0|\\"Avatar\\" is an experience you do not want to miss in the theaters if you are a fan of fantasy and love intense, gorgeous imagery. Director and writer James Cameron clearly spared no expense creating images that will stick with you.      Jake Sullivan \\"Sully\\" (Sam Worthington) is a recently injured Marine who's also lost his scientist twin brother.  When he gets the opportunity to take his brother's place in the Avatar experiments, he accepts the scientists proposition to take over the alient avatar being grown specially for his twin.  He also accepts the charge of Colonel Miles Quantich (Stephen Lang) to infiltrate the Na'Vi people and find out how best to get them to move away from a rich deposit of newly discovered mineral ironically named \\"unobtainium\\" which an American corporation wants.  An accident brings Jake into the thick of Na'Vi society, where he is charged to learn their ways and given the chief's daughter, Naytiri (Zoe Saldana) to help him do so.      Jake has three months to pass the Na'Vi ritual and learn their ways--or the bulldozers come to destroy the Tree of Souls where the richest deposits of the unobtainium are to be found.      CGI:  You are literally on Pandora with the strongest longing to join the Na'Vi and commute with the magnificent Tree of Souls.      PLOT:  \\"Avatar\\" has been likened to \\"Dances with Wolves\\" in Space, \\"Manifest Destiny\\" by Barry Longyear and many others. The plot is stereotypical, which in some ways, is a good idea because I am not sure most people's brains could hold both the scenery and the story at the same time.      WARNING:  People with vertigo should use caution watching this film.  You are going to be flying on a dragon's back in 3D and the effects are very realistic.       If you hadn't already guessed, \\"Avatar\\" may be one of the top merchandised film of the year.  Already, you can see games, action figures, guides, and coffee table art books just to name a few of the selections.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2009
B0002F6AH0|5.0|To the person who wrote, \\"It's just all of the episodes of the old World At War series,\\" I say of course!  That's what we are expecting, no?  In short, it is the most definitive video series on World War II that I have ever seen, bar none.  I had the old VHS video set, and the DVD set is simply clearer and blows away the video cassette version.  Totally worth the money.
B000YAA68C|4.0|This is a heartbreaking yet cute story of a woman still in love with her dead husband, who left behind a series of letters and missions that he wants her to accomplish.  Of course, life continues, and there are friends and family and other men for her to deal with at the same time.  It's rather predictable, I suppose, but nice to watch for the locations in Ireland, as well as for Butler, Bates, Morgan, and Swank.

B002HWRZH0|5.0|I am a huge Star Trek fan so when the new movie came out on blu ray my husband and I shopped every website that had it to find the best edition. We ultimately purchased the Amazon Limited Edition Replica Gift Set because of the beautiful Enterprise replica. I was worried at first that it might not look as nice as it does on the website, but when it arrived I was extremly satisfied. The Enterprise Replica is beautiful, in my opinion they did a very good job and it is worth the price. I hope that they have more Replicas for the upcoming sequels, I will be buying for sure! Thanks Amazon!
B002HWUU1I|5.0|Like many people, I was first introduced to Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova when I went to see the movie \\"Once.\\"  Of course I was swept away by that charming film, and since music was so integral to its appeal, buying the soundtrack was a no-brainer.  Yet my love for the movie did not quite translate to the soundtrack which (though not bad by any means) has not earned anything close to heavy rotation at home or in the car.<br /><br />So it was only natural that the new album by The Swell Season (Hansard and Irglova), \\"Strict Joy,\\" would end up in my hands too.  And I have listened to this album almost nonstop since I first gave it a spin about a week ago.  The difference, I think, is one of scale and scope.  Although I love the music from \\"Once,\\" I have a somewhat limited appetite for spare, singer-songwriter music without any significant backing instrumentation.  All of the music from the \\"Once\\" soundtrack was beautiful in and of the moment, but not addictive in the same way that a really great album can be.<br /><br />\\"Strict Joy\\" is that kind of great album.  The cohesive feel of the songs is immediately apparent, yet the album is not repetitive or tedious in any way.  It's true that heartache is the subject matter throughout, yet the songs are so fresh and beautiful that I am never left feeling that I've heard it all before.<br /><br />The first two songs couldn't seem more different.  \\"Low Rising\\" plods along languidly, perfect for a slow dance or a slow drink at the bar.  The song is guided by a growling Hansard, and a mournful, bluesy electric guitar solo.  \\"Feeling the Pull,\\" at the opposite end, is a jangly, twinkling folk song, full of wanderlust and melancholy.<br /><br />The remainder of \\"Strict Joy\\" charts the territory in between these polarities, such as the sweet darkness of \\"In These Arms,\\" \\"Paper Cup,\\" and \\"Back Broke,\\" and the innocent sadness of \\"Fantasy Man\\" and \\"I Have Loved You Wrong.\\"  Yet the best songs may be \\"The Rain,\\" which starts off with just Hansard and an acoustic guitar, but escalates to a soaring, full-band sound with guitars, strings and a xylophone, and \\"High Horses,\\" a moody, fast-paced number reminiscent of Death Cab for Cutie at their best and REM's \\"Losing My Religion.\\"  \\"Strict Joy\\" is great throughout, but these are the album's real high points.ic guitar, but escalates to a soaring, full-band sound with guitars, strings and a xylophone, and \\"High Horses,\\" a moody, fast-paced number reminiscent of Death Cab for Cutie at their best and REM's \\"Losing My Religion.\\"  \\"Strict Joy\\" is great throughout, but these are the album's real high points.
6305308659|5.0|I used this with high school students for a remedial English class, to a great response.  Because the symbolism and the story features are so obvious, yet entertaining, it was easy for them to identify metaphors, allusions, themes, etc.  These inner-city (mainly Latino and Chicano) non-readers were able to write fairly decent essays about the themes in the film and the use of symbols, etc.  They also learned something about what the famous 1960's were a rebellion against -- just how oppressive that focus on conforming to societal norms can be -- and some gained insight into similar pressures in their own lives today.  There is just enough sexual references to catch the attention of all, without any explicit sex to make it unacceptable in the classroom. (most have much more explicit sexual content on their ipods).
B00003CX8N|5.0|This little film, based on the short book of the same name, is an understated masterpiece of a love story.  I've watched it many times, and it will always be one of my favorites.<br /><br />In the late 1940s Helene Hanff was a poor writer living in a shabby New York apartment.  She loved English literature but couldn't find copies of her favorite works anywhere.  One day she wrote a letter to Marks and Co, a London antiquarian book store on Charing Cross Road, asking for help.  One of the shop's employees, Frank Doel, responded, and a twenty year long friendship ensued.<br /><br />The movie, like the book, is based on the letters Hanff and Doel (as well as other workers at the bookshop and their families) exchanged.  The business relationship quickly turned into a friendly, loving one, and the great charm of the movie is how well it depicts the growth of this love.  Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins were naturals for the two starring roles, and the rest of the cast includes some stellar names like Judi Dench.<br /><br />The movie ends with some sadness because Helene and Frank never meet in this life, though that is tempered by scenes showing Helene's first trip to London and Charing Cross Road.  Whenever I watch it I come to the final credits with a warm glow of satisfaction.

B0007TKNCY|5.0|It's a classic screwball comedy/romance movie with a plot that is completely impossible to believe but enjoyable.  I love the timing, the snappy patter, the foot work.  Hey, did I mention it's a classic.  Cary Grant is FUNNY and Kathryn Hepburn is manic and wonderful.  I waited a while to add this to my collection and I've very glad to have it.  It's worth every nickle.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|Had the product been what it was advertised to be then I would have been completely satisfied. But the merchant (Tinnman) who sold this product to me sold me a Asian Import bootleg version trying to pass it off as the real thing.  Horrible quality both the physical condition and the viewing condition.  I've learned my lesson to only purchase direct from manufacturer or a very reputable vendor. An incredible bargain isn't always what it seems.
1400063515|2.0|The main lesson I learned from the Black Swan is that the author thinks very highly of himself. While criticizing narrative as a preferred way of communicating information due to its bias and lack of accountability for what it doesn't include, the book is one long narrative from a self-absorbed view of the author. We get to learn of his favorite French literature (by the way, the English translation is bad), his aristocratic upbringing (he read a lot, because the summer cottage was *so* boring), and that he was a stock market genius before he got tired of that. Learning through self-narrative shouldn't be imposed upon us by people we can't begin to identify with. The book is choppy, often with one paragraph having little or nothing to do with what came before or afterward, as if inserted because it had to go somewhere. The author uses enough parentheses for ten books. Attempts at humor fail. The book's message is, in my opinion, somewhat trivial. Basically, quite a mediocre work.

B0000AUHOH|2.0|...this is what we get.  A long, cheesy, terrible episode of the television show.  You know the odd numbered rule about the Star Trek movies?  It really applies to this movie.  This was just absolutely horrible.  The plot, the effects, the conflict, the unfulfilling ending...man.  Horrible.  But I'm not going to spend this review talking about how bad this movie was.  I'm going to talk about how it could have been good, and how they wasted so much potential.  The movie starts off with a guy riding through a desert on some horse-like animal.  He comes up to a little bald guy defending some holes in the sand.  The stranger gets off the horse thing and tells the bald guy to \\"share your pain with me\\".  The bald guy starts crying because he has absolutely no hair at all.  The stranger, whose name is Sybok, is then revealed to be a Vulcan.  When the bald guy comments on this, Sybok starts laughing like a nut.  We then cut to William Shatner trying to scale his own ego.  He, Spock, and Bones are on shore leave and have decided to spend it camping.  They have a scene where they try to teach campfire songs to Spock.  Many people hated this scene, but I thought it was kind of funny.  This is interrupted, however, because a hostage situation has developed at Nakatomi...uh...some planet.  The Vulcan from the opening scene has captured the capital city, and has captured three important officials, a Romulan, a human, and a Klingon.  Enterprise has been ordered to take direct action, even though the new ship is literally falling apart.  The admiral says that they need an experienced captain to settle the problem, no matter what the status of his ship is.  This felt kind of contrived to me.  If they wanted an experienced captain, why didn't they just beam Kirk over to a ship that was working properly?  Because then we wouldn't have had all that suspense with them having to do their jobs in spite of the ship's problems.  So they get to the planet and fight their way into the Vulcanguy's city.  They get to the hostages, but it turns out that the hostages have all \\"shared their pain\\" with Sybok, and are now loyal to him.  The whole thing was a plan of Sybok's to capture a starship which will aid him on his \\"quest\\".  We don't know what that is yet.  So the boarding party is forced to fly the shuttle back to the Enterprise.  You see, the transporters on the ship aren't working.  Also, a Klingon commander is after the Enterprise.  He wants Kirk.  The Klingons still have a grudge against Kirk for blowing up the Kruge's crew while they were trespassing on the old Enterprise.  So the shuttle makes it into the hangar just before the klingon ship attacks them.  I know many people hate this scene, but I actually liked it.  As they are getting off the shuttlecraft, Kirk jumps Sybok.  Sybok overpowers him, but Spock grabs a gun and has a chance to kill Sybok.  He does not, however.  Instead, he allows Sybok to take the gun from him.  Now let's recap.  At this point, I thought the movie was okay.  You have a pretty interesting conflict going on.  A Vulcan who appears to be delusional is in possession of the Enterprise.  And he and Spock  apparently have a past history.  Spock refused to kill him, which makes him a very personal enemy for Spock.  We don't know exactly what Sybok wants with the ship, but they could have made him a crazy terrorist leader or something.  They could have made this about Spock having to overcome his feelings towards Sybok and help Kirk retake the ship.  At the very least, they could have made it a dumb action movie about terrorists taking over the Enterprise and Kirk and Spock trying to defeat the terrorists by themselves.  Instead, out of the blue, we get Sybok trying to find God.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Spock says that Sybok is his half-brother, in one of the biggest plot contrivances I've ever heard of.  Spock: Sybok is my brother.  Kirk: I know for a fact that you don't have a brother.  Spock: Well, I have a half-brother.  What?  Like I said, contrived.  So the rest of this movie is too painful for me to go into too much detail on.  Sybok persuades Kirk and the others to assist him on his quest to find God.  They travel to the center of the galaxy and through the Great Barrier.  Which might mean something if we had ever heard of the Great Barrier before.  They get through the barrier, and they go to the planet.  It turns out that the being on the planet is not God, and Sybok sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.  Suddenly, the Klingons (why are they even in the movie?) attack the Enterprise.  Spock convinces General Korrd, the Klingon hostage, to talk the Klingons down.  Korrd succeeds, and the klingons beam Kirk off the planet.  Everyone is saved, and the audiences walk out of the theater cursing Shatner.  Most people would say that the movie in it's entirety is bad.  I disagree.  As I stated before, I thought the first half was pretty good.  The second half was terrible.  The plot just didn't know what it was doing in that half.  One minute the movie is about terrorists taking control of the Enterprise, then all of a sudden it's about God, then it's some kind of demon and not really God, then the Klingons are thrown into the mix (why not?) then the movie just kind of ends.  I want to talk about the effects for a minute.  The effects in the four movies previous were nothing to write home about, but they were still better than the effects in this one.  I know there was some confusion with Industrial Light and Magic working on the Back to the Future sequels instead of this, but man.  These effects were bad.  This was the only Star Trek movie that reminded me of the show in the 60s.  The effects, the plot, the terrible ending, and the heavy-handed message were all very reminiscent of an episode of the series.  Star Trek 5 was a failure for many reasons, not the least of which was the directing by one Willian Shatner.  This is not, in my opinion as bad as Star Trek the Motion Picture, but it is close.  I decided to post a link to a rifftrax clip of this movie.  If you don't know what rifftrax is, it's the same thing as MST3K.  If you don't know what that is, just click the link anyway.  The clip his hilarious.

0385504225|3.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books and couldn't wait for the release of The Lost Symbol. Though it started out with the usual excitement and intrigue of his other books, it seemed to rely increasingly on the unbelievable as the book progressed. There were several times when I actually threw the book down and said \\"this is just ridiculous\\" out loud. My husband asked which part I had just read, and then agreed with me. Having said that, I still recommend this book; the author gives an incredible amount of information about the symbols and religious origins of our nation.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|First off, I loved this film before most people ever heard of it and would set my alarm for 2 a.m. on a Wednesday morning(pre-VCR) to watch a bad print of the movie on the late, late show. I was tired the next day for school but my outlook on life and my fellow man was significantly refreshed.    Much was said, and rightly so, about the cheesy colorized verion in the 80s. Critics called it distorted and distracting and it was. This version is not and clearly reflects an amazing amount of effort and respect for the film. I feel the final product, with its painstaking attention to detail enhances rather than intrudes on the movie.     Arguments can be made that the film had its share of shadows and contrasts that color tends to soften. I believe that's why they provided a crisp B&W version as well.     I recommend this set no matter which version you choose to watch the most. It's great to see this wonderful movie getting the attention it deserves.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|While being sometimes so derivative of Glen Cook's The Black Company series that it becomes almost laughable, the first novel in the Malazan Book of the Fallen cycle is a fantastic read.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|I can see this movie aging well. All the cool Tarrantino trademarks are in this movie..the beautiful cinematography and superb attention to detail, the graphic violence, the striking contrast of later period, hipster pop and rock music choices over the dramatic scenes, the great campiness that pops up from time to time to remind you you're watching an entertaining movie and my favorite , his ultra hip and cool dialogue. Film students probably pour over every word of a Tarrantino flick to see how it's done by the master. Very few people can so consistently create such great tension and interest as in watching something as otherwise sedate as people sitting in a bar , chatting it up. I was a bit surprised though that so much of the movie was about people and scenes OTHER than the basterd bunch, though it all ties in nicely in the end. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

A good book, but not great.  If you are a Dan Brown fan, you will likely enjoy it but not fall in love with it.

0761129235|5.0|The common wisdom is \\"no pain, no gain.\\"  Not necessarily true.  The Kaizen Way reminds us that big changes need not be painful if we focus on little steps, micro practices, and incremental shift.  1% shifts, done regularly, can get us to a new place with (less) personal pain and in fact are more likely to help us make permanent shifts in our behavior.<br /><br />I'm an executive and life coach, and the philosophy espoused in this book fits perfectly with the approaches I already use with clients.  What I love about this book is that the author lays out a very good argument for small changes.

B002HWRYJE|2.0|I was looking forward to a great update of the Star Trek story, but was greatly disappointed in this film.  While the special effects, the sets and most of the actors (except for Uhura and Scotty) were well-cast for their roles, the story line was horrible.  A trite good vs. evil villan (named Nero, no less), and some really improbable things that would never happen in a Star Trek story (Spock would never jettison Kirk in a space pod and strand him on an ice planet - against Starfleet regulations), makes this a real bomb.  I'm a big-time Trekker and was dismayed to find such a dumb plot wrapped up in such beautiful packaging.  Glad I only rented it.
0439023491|5.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" Book Review<br /><br /> Have you ever thought what life would be like in the future?  The way I pictured it, was time machines, flying cars, and robots.  Well, in the book \\"Catching Fire\\", you learn to believe this will be how the world will turn out.  Let me just say it's not a happily ever after like in our fairy-tale.<br /> The story \\"Catching Fire\\" is the second book in the series \\"Hunger Games.\\"  It mainly focuses on Katniss and Peeta's life after the games.  Katniss the main character who really does not like other peoples help, which is why it took her so long to like Peeta.  She can shoot an arrow at anything, which is how she won the games.  Her life really changed when her father died in the mines and she had to learn how to protect and feed her family when she was only about 15.  Peeta is the other main character who grew up as the baker's son.  He can make anyone fall in love with him, even Katniss.  His hobby is painting, and he paints scenes' from the hunger games, not that he wants to remember them, just that he hopes it might help with nightmares.  The Capitol is very mad how they both tricked them and want to get them back.  The Capitol is the government of all the districts' and is the ones who control the games.  Too bad they are the most famous people in the districts'.  There are 12 districts', people live in them and cannot leave them unless are invited to the Capitol.  Everyone knew who they are and wanted to be just like them.  But no one knew Katniss and Peeta weren't so happy.  There little plan about faking there love relationship landed them right into the next hunger games, but maybe even worse, the Quarter Quells.  This is the 75th anniversary and is always a little twist.<br /> \\"Catching Fire\\" has an audience of kids no younger than 12 because of the gruesome images it describes, but I also think adults would enjoy this book because it has this thing were you have never really read anything like this book before, so it interests you.  I would classify it as science fiction because how it is so futuristic.  The really weird part of it is how it makes you believe that this how life will be!  Also how the slightest detail may change the entire outcome in the story.<br /> If you liked \\"Hunger Games\\" then you have to read \\"Catching Fire!\\"  It compares how the main characters think and how they act.  Also, the events that happen in the book really are the consequence of that happened in \\"Hunger Games.\\"<br /> Some of the main reasons I really liked this book are, I have never read a book like this or even have somewhat of the same plot.

0316044938|3.0|This story has an interesting premise( a young girl is killed and then watches goings - on on Earth and sees how her family copes with her murder)but suffers from uneveness. The author keeps jerking from one character  to the next without much resolution of scenes.It makes no sense that she is able to come back to Earth and sleep with her old boyfriend when one of the main themes in the book is that she cannot go back to living no matter how she may want to.Also,there is no satisfying conclusion at all for her murderer,he just literally walks away.And the investigation into her death is very unprofessional and unrealistic. And I thought Ruth was an ill conceived character that did not seem real to me.The thing that kept me reading was that Susie was very likable and I empathized with her.Also,I wanted to see her family survive this horrible murder and go on with their lives.So I would say just appreciate this book for it's good points and do not expect a masterpiece.
B001DZLAWI|5.0|For all those old school die hard Metallica fans you will be happy to hear that the old Metallica is back.  I have been a fan since I was teenager.  Gone are the over produced songs of Bob Rock.  Instead they hired Rick Rubin to produce this album.  He was able get the best out of the band without \\"dumbing it down\\" to make it more commercial.  Those 5 to 9 minute songs are back.  Also they have given Kirk Hamet the green light to do what he does best, lay down some mean solos.  This record has a similar feel and sound as ...And Justice For All.  The one improvement is James vocals.  He has always been able scream with the best of them.  On certain parts of songs he will sing with a clean voice providing dynamics in the song.  Over the years his clean singing voice has vastly improved.    Good to have the old school Metallica back.
B002N5N5MA|5.0|If you haven't watched seasons 1 - 3 of Dexter yet, you have no idea what you're missing out on.  For three days after the season 4 finale of Dexter aired on Showtime, the phrase \\"Dexter\\" was constantly in the top ten trends for most searched, most Tweeted, most blogged according to both Google and Twitter. Once you finally see the last episode of season 4, you'll completely understand why.<br /><br />Season four started in a bit of controversy among Dexter fans when it was announced that John Lithgow was tapped to play the season's arch-villain, the Trinity Killer.  For those of us who were used to Lithgow's comedic performances in shows like Third Rock and Harry and the Hendersons, he didn't seem to fit the normal profile of a Dexter guest star. However, like the casting of Jimmy Smits as Miguel Prado, Lithgow pulls off the demeanor of a \\"Normal, everyday kind of guy\\" serial killer to a tee.<br /><br />The show starts up by reminding us that Dexter is now the family man - a brand new baby, a brand new wife, a brand new home in the suburbs, but the same ol' Dark Passenger.  The struggle to constantly balance his false family facade with the urges of his darker side is the general theme of the season; and through most of the season it seems as if Dexter is doomed to failure as his family starts to fracture and his kills get sloppier.  Enter the Trinity Killer - someone, who in Dexter's eyes is another possible mentor for himself. The Trinity Killer has been an enigma for over thirty years; never caught, never seen, and not even entirely believed to be real.  Dexter finds the possibility of learning from the Trinity Killer as an opportunity he cannot let pass by.<br /><br />As with all of the seasons, there are quite a few subplots involving the other Dexter cast members, but all-in-all, other than the one including Quinn and Debra, they feel somewhat tacked on.  However the main plot line this season is such a driving force that the weak subplots are quickly forgotten and forgiven.  The subplots are all mostly of an romantic nature, including one between Capt. LaGuerta and Angel Batista, the reappearance of a retired Frank Lundy, and the romance between Quinn and Christine Hill.  This season also finds Debra digging into her past and discovering what kind of man Harry Morgan really was - which needless to say, also leads her to learn more about her brother, Dexter.<br /><br />At the beginning of Season Four, you find Dexter juggling so many faces to figure out who he really is, and who he can be.  By the end of Season Four, Dexter learns that the very act of juggling the different personas has changed his life forever.  Season five has some big shoes to fill.<br /><br />Addressing the subject of DVD versus Blu-Ray, having been forced to watch Dexter on standard definition on various occasions when the cable company had some \\"glitches,\\" I can safely recommend the high def over the standard versions.  While you won't really \\"miss\\" anything by lacking the sharpness of the HD presentation, the atmosphere just seems much more poignant and dramatic in the high def videos.  I should also mention that Dexter does take full advantage of surround sound, and it's pretty creepy when you can hear sounds off and around corners when watching Dexter sneak around to grab his next kill.subplots are all mostly of an romantic nature, including one between Capt.

B0000067L4|4.0|Not someone who subscribes to the view that Cream are musical geniuses (the only album of theirs which I think is a classic is \\"Wheels of fire\\"), I have to say that I quite enjoyed this album. Their debut album is often cited as a great album by some, but not by me. \\"Goodbye\\" seems sort of like their debut, \\"Fresh Cream\\", but more engaging/enjoyable.  If you like \\"chill out\\" music, I think that this album could fit the bill.        Best song:      Badge - perhaps it is little wonder that I liked this song the best...it is co-credited to George Harrison, who was actually part of a supergroup. It's a pleasant, easy listening song with some nice piano playing. Clapton delivers up a good, bluesy solo. A good guitar bit in this song which reminds me of the intro to Boston's all time classic song \\"More than a feeling\\". Bassy. Liked this song better on second listen.        Next best song (on second listen):      Doing that scrapyard thing - features the piano, organ, and a ice guitar lick. Nonsense lyrics are catchy at times, and the singing also sounds quirky at times too. Maybe you could describe this song as sort of being in Supertramp territory.  It sorta has a carnivale vibe to it.        Then...(also on second listen):      What a bringdown - features the piano. Catchy riff...sort of reminds me of the tv theme \\"Mission: Impossible\\", I think...or some such tv show theme (wouldn't think I a have the theme to \\"Peter Gunn\\" in mind). More nonsense lyrics. Bassy, with nice chime percussion.        The rest (the live versions of songs from earlier albums):        I'm so glad - mostly an instrumental jam, running to 9:13. Lyrics bookend the jam. Drumming is interesting at times. Drums are heard mostly on the left hand channel and the bass guitar is on the right hand side. Levels for these are fine, but sort of muffled at times. The outro sounds better...not sure, but I think that this outro may have been 'pasted' in...that stuff which is obviously live just sounds better. It's all meant to be live though.    Politician - runs to 6:20 with a long instrumental part to it. Has an extremely bassy sound, like a tuba or something...maybe it is a keyboard though? Surprised if a bass guitar could get that low. Has a circus type riff to it. Not sure, but I think at one time the word \\"follyticks\\" is used instead of \\"politics\\".     Sitting on top of the world - a blues song with an extremely bassy sound to it too, like a tuba. A jam session type of song.        Recommendations:      Cream - Wheels of fire (their masterpiece)  Cream - Disraeli gears (decent album, but often cited as an all time great album)  The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Electric Ladyland (for once I think that the critics who rank albums have got their ranking on this right...it's up there as one of the great albums)  The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Are you experienced? (a terrific debut album)  The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Axis: Bold as love (not bad, but it may grow on me)  The Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground (no one does 'easy listening' as well as these guys)  The Velvet Underground & Nico - The Velvet Underground & Nico (their easy listening debut)
B000J103PC|4.0|Yes, I said it! I hate chick flicks. I usually avoid this sort of movie like the plague. Yet, I'm giving this one four stars. That's because, surprisingly, it ended up being pretty entertaining. You know those movies you can watch over and over and never tire of? This is one of them, I learned, quite by accident. I have now seen it three times - not by choice, mind you. Both subsequent viewings happened aboard a plane, and both times my first thought was, \\"Oh great, not THIS movie again...\\" But strangely enough, I enjoyed watching it again.<br /><br />I guess this is in part because I can really identify with the main character - I have had the displeasure of working for a boss from hell in an insane corporate environment, and I too roll my eyes at people who would eagerly sell their soul for designer labels. That said, the plot is a complete unrealistic fantasy. No way would the main character be able to land a job like that, no matter how smart she is, because there're probably 20 girls with \\"connections\\" who have already been promised the job. Not to mention, prestigious fashion magazine offices usually have very strict dress codes, and she would not be allowed anywhere near one looking the way she did in the beginning of the movie. The film is mostly compellingly watchable thanks to the fantastic performance by Meryl Streep. Can't say I \\"get\\" Anne Hathaway, but she fit here. I did find her character annoying, and her actions throughout the second half of the film completely implausible. Other than that, this is an enjoyable little \\"chick flick\\". If you've ever experienced being a corporate slave under the heel of a sadistic boss, you're likely to be entertained by it if nothing else.

B0000640VO|3.0|This is a strange, silly little movie about... Well, nothing in particular. The description is misleading and just plain wrong - this isn't about a girl who does \\"benevolent acts\\". This is about one weird, introverted young girl who was raised by dysfunctional parents and is pretty much a psycho, albeit a charming one. She's not \\"doing good deeds\\", she pulling PRANKS on unsuspecting neighbors and random strangers. Some are cute and good-natured, others downright wrong and cruel (causing a guy to be electrocuted is hardly \\"benevolent\\", or funny for that matter). When she falls in love (or thinks she falls in love), she is incapable of communicating her feelings, so instead she stalks the poor bloke. The kind of person Amelie is might make you wonder if she perhaps had body parts stacked up in her freezer. Maybe that was the whole point, I don't know... Either way, I think it was the fact of the lead acress being so utterly, completely adorable that is this film's saving grace. Sure, it's whimsical, intriguing, funny, colorful, and has that goofy, surreal French flare all over it, but in the end... It's still about absolutely nothing. You expect some awesome, fantastic resolution to the events that unfold before you (even body parts in the freezer would've made it better). What you're left with is nothing. Not a bad film.... Just disappointing and pointless.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Ever notice how Pixar movies don't usually have huge \\"stars\\" voicing the characters? It's because they don't need Angelina Jolie or Chris Rock to attract their audience. They don't hope that having \\"famous\\" voices will somehow make up for the lack of great content. It's because Pixar HAS great content that doesn't need gimmicks to succeed. Their audience knows exactly what it's going to get: quality. UP, without a doubt, is one of Pixar's best. Sweet, touching, funny, tender, inspiring, heartbreaking, subtle - it's all those things, and more. It's not \\"dumbed down\\" for kids' sake, and it doesn't contain any clumsily disguised, crude content that animated movies often contain in order to make it interesting for the adults. UP doesn't need any of that. Even though it's extremely symbolic, it somehow manages the seemingly impossible task of speaking directly the the hearts of people of all ages, from kids to adults to the elderly. Three generations of my family are all in love with this film. It is so deeply poignant that even writing about it is tugging at my heartstrings. An absolutely beautiful, amazing work of art. Watch and learn, Dreamworks et al - THIS is how it's done.

B002L7TMAE|5.0|Despite reports of the imminent death of the CD format, 2009 has been an amazing year for CD box sets.  The Beatles, Buddy Holly and the 13th Floor Elevators have all finally gotten the CD reissues they deserve, and so have two of the best French pop singers of the 60's.    This collection contains Françoise Hardy's first six albums, released on the Vogue label between 1962 and 1966, plus bonus tracks from her EPs of the same period.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|I won't write a long story about this space movie. It's a story line that has been around a long time. Space crew on a mission to save earth - all kinds of interference from various crew members they find another craft with the crew gone, etc etc. Repeatedly 'one of us has to stay behind' etc.  The color was dark and the various parts of their space craft were hard to distinquish. The DVD I watched belonged to someone else. I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|Live from Royal Albert Hall (cd/dvd) by The Killers is more than a concert, it is an experience! I was so impressed with this live concert from one of my favorite bands of the 21st Century. Brandon Flowers has never sounded better and wow he sings each song with such passion, I am so happy I purchased this item. My favorite performances include: For Reasons Unknown, This is Your Life, Losing Touch, Read My Mind, Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, Bling (Confession of a King), and All These Things That I've Done. The audio and picture quality are excellent and there are some great bonus features on the DVD, interviews with fans and crew. The audio cd is pretty good, the best sounding song on the cd is Spaceman. I highly recommend this \\"killer\\" purchase!!
B002RSDW80|1.0|Very disappointed in this movie. Quit watching about half way through. The switching back and forth between the two and the switching back and forth in time frames didn't work well here. Was not humerous as I thought it would be. But my biggest complaint is the repeated reference/scenes regarding their sex life. No nudity, but I forgot how many times by the middle of the movie it showed both women and their husbands starting to have sex. Can we not have ANY movies anymore without sex?! It looks as if the movie industry has answered this question with a loud 'NO'!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I loved [[ASIN:B001IC0I7E The Da Vinci Code - 1st Edition/1st Printing]]. Read it in 2 days and even took a sick day to finish it up. I thought [[ASIN:B002CF0GP0 Angels & Demons]] was good as well, although I thought the ending was a little hard to believe. I've read his other books, but only would rate them as okay. I was looking forward to The Lost Symbol, but was worried about the book being a \\"sophomore slump.\\" This happens sometimes when it takes a while for a author (or musician) to be found; they receive fame from a later work and then after all the hype, their next work is kind of so-so.<br /><br />Oh boy did this book disappoint. It was such a waste of time that I really had second thoughts to righting a review and wasting more time. But, here I am trying to help someone avoid a huge mistake. I'm not sure if it was a redundancy in villains, over explanation of history, massive plot shifts or that the Freemason history being a little vanilla. Whatever it was, it can be avoided.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find something else to read. With all the amazing options around, I'm sure your search will be short.

B0025KVLTC|3.0|Why oh why was this opportunity missed? The remastered Revolver - arguably the greatest Beatle album in terms of shear inventiveness - is not as clear nor pleasing as it could be.    Compare, for example, the 2009 Stereo mix with the mix on the Yellow Submarine Soundtrack (YSS)  from a couple of years ago. The YSS Yellow Submarine cut is clear, with a centered vocal by Ringo, and great detail. Meanwhile, the 2009 Revolver Stereo Yellow Submarine  contains the painful right channel Ringo.    I guess this is someone's idea of fidelity to the original mix. But when the mix is poor, and non-Beatles supervised, why the homage to (bad) history.    I hope I live long enough to hear a remixed - not just a remastered - stereo Revolver - and Help! - and Rubber Soul!

B001FB4W0C|5.0|Though most on this forum have given the show kudos for the angels versus demons storyline, I have to give the writers their \\"props\\" for finally bringing Dean, wonderfully played by Jensen Ackles, to the forefront of the season. The character gets to mature, realizing his place in the ongoing battle against the forces of evil as well as being Sam's (Jared Padalecki) protector, even when the younger brother is toying with his own inner \\"demon\\".  Ackles shines in \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\", \\"The Rapture\\", the season opener \\"Are You There, God? It's Me, Dean Winchester\\", and the season-ending \\"Lucifer Rising\\".  Why he nor Padalecki have not received Emmy nominations is a further indictment against the decision makers of The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.<br /><br />Fine acting is also provided by Jim Beaver as the dependable and Johnny-on-the-spot Bobby Singer, Misha Collins as Castiel the angel, Genevieve Cortese as the \\"is-she-a-good-demon-or-a-bad-demon\\" Ruby, Robert Wisdom as Uriel, and Julie McNiven as Anna.

B002NXSRVG|3.0|***WARNING, SOME SPOILERS***<br /><br />Growing up in the 80's and being a huge cartoon fan, G.I Joe had to be up there as one of your top shows. So being that Joe fan growing up in the 80's and knowing that a movie  was being made upon it gave you something to look forward to until its release. Being a spectator of this film after having high hopes can be damaging to your health, and everything that you can remember from the cartoon show; in other words childhood memory.<br /><br />I will notate the flaws from this movie that made my stomach twitch: The dialogue and the ridiculous script that made look the Joe's (America's most badass!) like amateurs.<br /><br />The dialogue reminded me alot of what is considered one of the worst movie ever made: Batman & Robin. Cheesey lines, and unneccesary gags. In the movie theater you would hear dead silence when one of the characters 'tried' to be 'funny'. Even I felt ackward.<br /><br />I also hated the fact that the Cobras found so easily the Joe's their underground layer. Yes I know, there was a chip inside the suit case which is the only possible way of initiating such search but it was just too unreal and too easy. The writers could of thought of something better.<br /><br />Now, for the good things. Obviously the special effects, very well done, as well with the action sequences. Used to watch the 80's cartoon I found it quite astonishing how they pulled that one off.<br /><br />Snake Eyes steals the show for sure. He was my favorite character from the cartoon series and I can say that he is my favorite character from the movie. The female cast was also an eye candy, and I think them and Snake Eyes are the only reason why I would watch this movie again.<br /><br />If they are planning to make a sequel please make it less childish and remember that us real G.I Joe fans are actually adults. I was hoping for a more serious atmosphere and for an adult action movie. Kids probably left the theater happy and cheering while most of us grown ups left disappointed. It's not a bad film, it is entertaining but it does have its flaws that without them could of been far superior. I sure hope there's improvement for Part 2.film, it is entertaining but it does have its flaws that without them could of been far superior. I sure hope there's improvement for Part 2.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|There are parts of this mini-series that are similar to Pride and Prejudice and theres certainly enough stubborness in Margaret and Mr. Thornton to give Elizabeth & Darcy a run for their money.<br /><br />But where Mr. Darcy was secretive, Mr. Thornton makes no attempt to hide why he acts the way he does and is even very patient in correcting Margaret's assumptions about the Northern industrial towns.<br /><br />Much of the charm of the movie comes from the two leads: Daniela Ashby and Richard Armitage.  You're outraged at the treatment Mr. Thornton deals his worker right along with Margaret, but soften just as she does when he explains.<br /><br />It's a great story and kind of addicting.

B002R0F3Q2|4.0|I purchased this album on the day of its release and I was immediately pleased. The song \\"Love Is Blind\\" sets the mood for an emotional, spiritual and uplifting experince. The sence of effortless flow throughout the whole project almost never leaves you (except for \\"Put It In A Love Song\\" when it feel like you put a different CD  in your player).  The reason this album is not getting 5 stars is mainly because the melodies of most songs are not as engaging as the ones on her previous efforts like \\"Songs In A Minor\\" and \\"As I Am\\". There is not doubt if you were really into those albums and appreciated Alicia Keys like I do, you will love \\"The Elemnt Of Freedom\\". It might take you a few spins before you can say this is an awesome album. Another minus for Keys' latest is the lack of variety of lyrical themes. The only three songs that deal with something different other than love are \\"Wait Til You See My Smile\\", \\"How It Feels To Fly\\" and \\"Empire State Of Mind\\". That is all the \\"bad\\" (actually ih her case I should say NOT SO GREAT) and don't think it is too much at all!  As I mentioned earlier \\"The Element Of Freedom\\" is very cohesive and sounds like fine music. The album has an innovative, experimantal touch to it that works very well.   In \\"Love Is Blind\\" Alicia Keys sounds very differently like never before and she actually sounds great. I thought that was a very good opener and a stand out track.  The other distinct track is \\"Put It In A Love Song\\" where the Keys/Knowles duo works just fine. My prediction is this song will be a big hit/single/video.  My conclusion is \\"The Element Of Freedom\\" = highly beautiful and enjoyable experience!!!

First, the plot is so unique and wonderful-- a distopian society where 24 kids are forced to fight to the death in a closed arena in front of live TV. There are the Careers, kids who have been training for this their whole lives--brutal and deadly, the kids as young as 12--sweet and innocent, and then there is Katniss who we find is just as worthy of a fighter as any--she's a survivor. Then there is Peeta, the boy from district 12 who enters with Katniss--the boy who has always been secretly in love with Katniss. It's \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" meets \\"1984\\" from a YA perspective.<br /><br />There was a moment in this book, just after the games have started, after the reader has gotten to know Katniss and is of course on her side, rooting for her to succeed but also rooting for a romance between her and Peeta to form (even if that can't be possible b/c one of them must die--she must kill him, eventually, if she is to live) when Katniss sees him again in the games. I've never had such a heart-stopping moment come from a book. I can't say anymore, but this one moment was worth the whole book. 5/5 Rating all the way!<br /><br />This is a great book. A must own and a super fast read.

B00004VWAF|5.0|In and of itself, On The Corner is a classic album. Miles here got a big group--funk and straight jazz guys--and flattened his music. He used concepts from both Sly Stone and Stockhausen, reducing the frame of the music, and packing the frame with lots of tablas, saxes, guitars, and his wha wha turmpet.<br /><br />Reactions were bad in 1973- jazz people did not like funk and funk people did not understand the abstract games Miles  was playing with their music--but On The Corner is now pretty much recognized as a landmark.<br /><br />The problem is that the arrival of [[ASIN:B000TLMWMO The Complete On the Corner Sessions]] contains this music, and much more. A lot on that set shows that these sessions--and this music, was much bigger in scope than what came out in 1973. (Why no double album?) There are sonic experiments and funk that is fatter than what made On The Cornor.<br /><br />If you are new to Miles and just want to find out what, first, all the 1973 fuss was and, second, why this album is a referance point, than, sure, this is where to stick in your toe.<br /><br />But if you have already fallen in love with the black magus--and this will not take long--you really do need the whole set. Some of the Miles sets you can scrape by without owning.<br /><br />But not this one.<br /><br />Hey, give your copy of the single album to your kids. Teach them before they can walk
0756405890|5.0|I initially started this book as audio while driving, but my long trips came to an end and I just had to know how it ended. Fortunately, my library had the book as well, so I finished the last quarter by reading the physical book.<br /><br />Until reading this book, I didn't realize how much I missed science-fiction. Rothfuss and the narrator did a wonderful job weaving the story and definitely kept me on edge.<br /><br />Kvothe, the main character, reminds me of Harry Potter at times with the trouble he finds himself in, but it's definitely a different story. I don't want to compare this to Harry Potter, but it definitely drew me in like Harry Potter.<br /><br />Even if you're not a sci-fi reader, I definitely recommend this book!
B000286RKW|5.0|I never quite understood this whole deal of walking in to a pizza place and seeing paintings of gangsters on the wall--you know, those big oils with the Godfather guys, Scarface, and the guys from Goodfellas. Why would anyone glamorize these theives and killers, hang up pictures of them?<br /><br />Well, the answer might be in Goodfellas. It sees low leval mob life through Henry Hill from the 1950s to 1980, back when the mafia had sizable power: unions, construction, shipping, boxing, show biz. These guys had their hands in everything,  most of all, the piggy bank. Even RFK went after them, and some think it got him killed.<br /><br />Hill as a teenager saw the money, the cars, the mistresses, the free passes to see Bobby Vinton. Those \\"guys\\" across the street at that cabstand had everything a boy with otherwise limited prospects could ever want.<br /><br />Hill is smart as a whip and soon gets drafted--actually, he enlists. He is the kid with more money than the grown ups. He gets to park cars, hang with the gamblers. By the early 60s, he is doing airport heists.<br /><br />But soon things get more violent and Hill gets hooked on cocaine. Through the 70s, it gets a lot more dangerous to be a mobster, and the violence becomes more random as the society changes. Eventually, Hill is forced out after being busted for what the mob said they were never going to do--dealing drugs.<br /><br />What works so well about Goodfellas is the film does not give the crime or the violence an air of tragity or judgement. Scorcessee structues the film so it is like we are hanging out with the crime crew. In bars. In Caidlacs. On jobs. Crazy Tommy shot this guy. What are we going to do with him? All this to a rock soundtrack and jump cut editing, which increases the volocity of the roller coaster<br /><br />But things do unravel and the glamor unravles with it.  Goodfellas is about the price of the violence over the long haul. It sneeks up on us as much as it does Hill, and in the end, we realize what gets paid when we Scorcessee pulls the planks from under. We realize at the end the intelligent Hill has wasted his life, and hurt many on the way down. His friends are dead or have disowed him, and he gets \\"to live the rest of his life like a snook.\\" in a banal noname subburb .<br /><br />Just deserts. For Hill, and us for riding along.ulls the planks from under. We realize at the end the intelligent Hill has wasted his life, and hurt many on the way down.
