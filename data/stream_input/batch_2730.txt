B005USZYDU|4.0|I liked the mystery and the clues !<br />But I did not like the ending with the trial not ending
B00007KWHP|5.0|I would rank this album as just as good as The Yes Album, but for different reasons. This album allowed each of the 5 band members to compose or arrange one song each. This proves to be both a strength and a weakness. In the context of the album, these songs work as transitional pieces between the more substantiative tracks. They also foreshadow to later songs, or have a reprise that adds a sense of cohesiveness to the whole album. However, when we look at each track separately, these tracks leave a lacking feeling. Bruford's funk sounding composition is the only one that really stands out. But, it is great to see the musical abilities of each member and get into their heads through the music to see what they bring to the table.<br />  The four major tracks are Roundabout, South Side of the Sky, Long Distance Runaround, and Heart of the Sunrise. Each one of these is a strong song on its own. Excluding Long Distance Runaround, each has that self-contained emotional journey that the music tells; similar to Starship Trooper and I've Seen All Good People from The Yes Album.  The best part of the album is that each of the main tracks shows the band's ability to take fragmented pieces of the music such as riffs or sections and to weave them together in different combinations to produce what sounds like a constantly evolving track. It's fun to listen to each track and dissect it. You realize that each song is really only about 4-5 minutes of different musical offerings, but they are woven together in such a way that it always feels fresh and you feel like the journey is in a new, but familiar space.<br />  Overall, I think it is a masterpiece in its own right. It's not perfect, but it shows off the immeasurable talent of the band. The band is able to turn its music into an emotional soundscape for the listener to bask in. We also get a peek into the creative mind of each solo member. Yes delivers another amazing album.<br /><br />Rating:  5/5<br />Best song(s): Roundabout, South Side of The Sky, Long Distance Runaround, and Five Per Cent For Nothing<br />Least Favorite Song(s): The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)South Side of The Sky, Long Distance Runaround, and Five Per Cent For Nothing<br />Least Favorite Song(s): The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)

B006RXPSLK|5.0|The characters. Oh, the characters. Dante, Jay and Silent Bob, the customers, the Chewlies salesman, all of them. Absolutely stunning performances by just about everyone involved.<br /><br />And the quotes. &#34;The Big Lebowski&#34; didn't have this many quotable quotes. Nor did &#34;Office Space&#34;<br /><br />Watch it. If you were old enough to fake ID yourself a pack of cigarettes during the 90's this movie is for you.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|What a cute movie and it is so much better in 3D. Totally worth the extra money for the bluray!!!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It was a really great book I liked it a lot, it had a nice ending. I also love how it is written.
B000SW2F8K|5.0|I really enjoy this movie.  Total chick-flick, and extra awesome for chicks who like to cook.  The soundtrack is one of my favorites, I have it and listen to it often.  Great Brazilian music.
B000ICZD5M|5.0|Dune is a great sci-fi movie in my opinion.  Its full of memorable quotes and deep philosophy.  The movie is based on the foundational book of which several other offshoot stories sprung from.  The universe is rich and deep.
B0067RQYNW|2.0|This was too hard to use. It took too long to create the right paragraph settings. I'll just write in a notepad and then use word on my laptop when I get home.
B001N9ESQ4|2.0|Had to watch these back-to-back.  The actors seemed to be thrown into an illconceived script.  And what makes it worse is that their fingers were in the writing.  The storyline just didn't seem to have any positive direction and they just kept filling the storyboard with wonderful scenic shots.  Nice but can only hold your interest for so long.  Like watching your relatives' home movies of their Grand Canyon trip for the fourth time.  Guess I was expecting too much after the first installment.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Enjoyable action thriller while not totally plausible in the context of history.  Tarantino strikes again!  Watch for him in a cameo role.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely love this whole series and the next book cannot come soon enough. Each book is hard to put down and adds something new to the story.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A sad story but very well written. Again if you like &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;.  Sometimes tales from these locations can be very distressing but you must realize that this is the way the rest of the world lives and how lucky we are.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Good mystery til the end.  Did not care for the ending...I would have changed it.  Is there a movie yet? If not maybe they will change the end like they did with &#34;My Sister's Keeper&#34;.  One could only hope.

0061122416|2.0|How has this fact not caught on: the plot of The Alchemist was ripped off from one of the stories from the 1,001 Arabian Nights (a good story, to be fair).  When I got to the end, I couldn't believe what I was reading.  Totally unoriginal!  I looked it up on Wikipedia and the plot also appears in another Muslim text: Rumi.  If it reads like \\"ancient wisdom\\" that's because it is!!

B004MPEFBE|5.0|I don't even remember how many times I have read the Harry Potter Books or watched all the movies from beginning to end. They were great and I am old.  Had to buy this one again.  The original one I bought on blu-ray and it played on my blue-ray computer the first few times, but would not play this time. Decided to try buying it then I could also play it on my iPad when I am on trips and need something to watch. Of course now I will have to buy all of them so I can watch the whole series. Can't just watch one without seeing all the others. LOL.

B003F3FJQO|3.0|Often the second book in a trilogy is much weaker than the other two, that is not the case here. This story although not as compelling as the first was fairly well done. Do yourself a favor however and end the series here. Nothing is gained by reading the final book, it is totally without merit, by the end you almost don't care about the characters who were so well developed in The Maze Runner.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|Donoghue makes this abduction tale feel so disturbingly real, I sometimes had to put down the book, having read it so close to the news of the Cleveland kidnappings. But her fine writing, dry humor and keen observations through the eyes of five year-old Jack brought me back. A riveting read with a wonderful feel for relationships and emotions.
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|This is nothing what i expected, it is a collection of short stories from a varietyof different perspectives. Its an easy read but if all youre interested in is mowgli he only has two stories
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was intense, while Colleen's previous works have been filled with drama none really have reached the level of intensity this one had. I was honestly never expecting the entire book to played out the way it did and when I would think I see a plot twist coming it would still shock me, I audibly gasp and covered my mouth in horror at least THREE times. And THAT folks is a FEAT of veritable proportions because when it comes to contemporary romance very little can get a rise out of me.<br /><br />Here was I, expecting some cheesy drama about some boy and some emotionally stunted girl but NOOO Colleen had to basically rip out my heart and make me eat it. Here are these two lovely kids and all this terrible things happened to them and you just CAN'T wrapped your brain around it. You stared in shock and wondered HOW they are ever going to move on? HOW they are ever going to be able to make it right?<br /><br />But the ending, you just FELT everything would be alright, I mean there was closure of some sort for everything and reaffirmation of Sky and Holder's relationship. And I just... WOW! I like it.
140006922X|1.0|Media reports have introduced Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim.  His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history. \\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years.

B009B0L324|5.0|Review no. 58. So glad that I finally got around to purchasing a copy of this must-have live AC/DC 'Live At River Plate' 2-CD. As I got lucky and saw AC/DC twice during their most memorable 'Black Ice' 2009-2010 World Tour. Both times had a two-song difference in the set lists - so Angus Young and crew definitely does ~not~ play the same songs at every single gig they do. Didn't bother with the DVD - maybe later. Four tunes off the acclaimed 'Black Ice' CD - the frantic opener \\"Rock 'N Roll Train\\", \\"Big Jack\\", title track \\"Black Ice\\" and \\"War Machine\\". Can't get enough of those Bon Scott gems - that you might not hear every day - like \\"Shot Down In Flames\\" and the ass-kicking \\"Dog Eat Dog\\". Plus all the AC/DC live staples we have come to know [and love] \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Shoot To Thrill\\", \\"Whole Lotta Rose\\" (complete with giant inflatable blow-up woman), one of my all-time favorites \\"Let There Be Rock\\" and the grand finale \\"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\\". Comes with a handy CD booklet with full color photos. Essential.

0553801473|2.0|I started reading the ASOIAF books last year, so at least in my case, the disappointment I felt while reading this book had nothing to do with being frustrated because the book took a long time to be published. It's just that this book is bad: (Warning, mild spoilers ahead) despite the length of the book the story barely progresses, we have chapter after chapter filled with characters doing nothing, I struggled to read Dany and Tyrion's chapters (and some of Jon's too) because I felt like it was all for nothing, they do a lot of things that added nothing to the story and they went on for ages. Tyrion didn't need so many chapters traveling from one place to another, we didn't need so many pages dedicated to learn how the NW works, and Dany's arc is pure filler until the last two of three chapters. And the meereenese knot is not resolved yet, we still have a lot of things happening there.<br /><br />There are good chapters, Theon's arc is very interesting and the chapters focused on Winterfell are great even if the pace is slow, but they are the exception.<br /><br />To sum it up: a lot of filler, the pace is really slow, you have a lot of build up but no climax and the book is way too long. It should have been edited because half the book is unnecessary fat.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|i am a huge tom cruise fan but this movie missed the mark.  no story.  hard to follow.  lack of action.  interesting plot but then to find out its a redux of space odyssey is defeating.  wanted to like it.  sat through the whole thing but really can't recommend it.

B00425S1H8|5.0|Direct from Prolific, I bought this to replace the cheap Sabrent that required a zillion hoops to go through in order to have it work. I read about flawed and poorly made Chinese licensed Prolific chips that were used in these and the Sabrent adapter exhibited every symptom of shoddy workmanship. I've been using this serial adapter for several months now and have never once needed to muddle with configurations to have it recognized. The drivers (same as Sabrent by the way) worked on 1st install with no extra fiddling. Spend the extra buck if you need serial to USB. It will save you many headaches. And do not buy the Sabrent knockoff.

B008JFUR10|4.0|In the year 2020, a dimensional portal opens up in the Pacific Ocean, and our world is besieged by giant monsters called Kaiju (Japanese for `strange creature'). In response, humanity created large robots called Jaegars (German for `hunter') to fight these creatures. Unfortunately, the Kaiju are winning, and it's up to a washed-up former pilot and a rookie to save humanity from being annihilated. Pacific Rim is the brainchild of Guillermo Del Toro, visionary director of such visually striking films as Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth. Pacific Rim isn't a remake or a movie `based on anything' (aside from Del Toro's love of old-school monster movies), which is refreshing considering Hollywood's nauseating obsession with sequels, remakes, and superhero comic adaptions.<br /><br />First, and foremost, the CGI in Pacific Rim is some of the best you will ever see. The Jaegars and Kaiju look awesome, especially when they are beating the tar out of each other (and destroy cities in the process). It is definitely worth the 3D upcharge. Del Toro's film also features a well-developed and colorful cast that keeps the film from being `all-style no-substance', like similar big-budget action films like Transformers and Battleship. A noteworthy performance comes from Dr. Newton Geiszler (played by Charlie Day of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia fame), a very enthusiastic and easily-excitable scientist that provides some big laughs and crucial insight into the Kaiju and how to defeat them. Ron Perlman has a memorable, but brief role as the Black Market Kaiju organ dealer Hannibal Chou (whose name comes from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Chinese restaurant). Details like how the robots operate, where the monsters come from and some of their biological facts (often provided animatedly by the aforementioned Doctor) are not only clever, but they give the world a certain degree of plausibility, another feature often absent from similar films. There is also a quick scene mid-credits which is worth sticking around for.<br /><br />Pacific Rim is not without flaws, though. At points, the dialogue was hard to hear, although this may have been the theater's fault. A few moments in the film will cause viewers to think \\"Why didn't they just do that before?\\" For example: towards the end of the second act, the Jaegar piloted by the two main heroes suddenly unveils a blade attachment that can slice a Kaiju with ease, clearly more effective than punching and throwing said beast for 10 minutes (though admittedly less exciting). The fight scenes in the second act are so thrilling and over-the-top that the third act feels short and weak in comparison. While the cast is strong and there are surprisingly few cliché/cheesy lines, the rookie and the washed-up pilot (the two main heroes) are not as well-developed as some of the other characters. All of the battle scenes are a treat to watch, but they take place either in the pouring rain or underwater. This doesn't deter from the enjoyment of the film, but to watch the two opposing forces duke it out on a sunny day (or even a cloudy one) would've be nice, so we could see them more clearly.<br /><br />The good far outweighs the bad when it comes to Pacific Rim, and you probably won't ever see a more fun or intelligent monster movie. 7/10

B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I gotta hand it to you guys, A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD is still the best action movie of BRUCE WILLIS yet. His angry style still hasn't worn out, but from time to time it has gotten more powerful.

YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF DAY YOUR HAVING HUH BRUCE.

B005BQTUVI|4.0|Mimic's theatrical cut is an interesting little movie.  On one hand fans of Guillermo del Toro get to see the development of his style, and see that already in 1997 he was hitting on the tropes we know and love in his style.  On the other hand the movie was clearly hampered by meddling by the producers.  For its Blu-Ray release Guillermo del Toro has returned with a director's cut, remastered picture quality, and a buffet of special features.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro's director's cut can't clean up all the flaws created by Mimic's troubled production, but it does give us a better glimpse at what the director originally wanted.  Mimic: The Director's Cut is a more streamlined, superior in many ways to its original 1997 release while still not being enough to reach the heights of entertainment of Hellboy, or the artistic intrigue of Pan's Labyrinth.  It's a fairly generic plot of giant bugs living in the New York subway system, with a twist: the insects mimic the appearance of their predators.  The creature design of the insects is cool.  Essentially giant cockroaches that can mimic the appearances of humans from a distance, their appearance is perfectly in keeping with the creatures that would be del Toro's claim to fame in later films such as Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth.  When it switches to CGI the creatures show their age, but the practical effects are worth checking out for creature lovers.<br /><br />Now, the special features are the real reason to buy this Blu-Ray.  For anyone who has poured over the special features in the Hellboy films and Pan's Labyrinth already know Guillermo del Toro loves filling his DVDs/Blu-Rays to the brim with special features.  His effusive commentaries on his films alone are worth the purchase for fans, or anyone interested in knowing more about a film's production.  Even with the film's age Guillermo del Toro has brought us his typical Director's commentary, a video introduction on making the director's cut, a featurette on the director's cut, making of featurettes, deleted scenes, original marketing material, and other goodies for those who are interested in the film's history.  Seriously: Guillermo del Toro has made sure his basic little creature feature from 1997 has received a better collection of special features than most mega blockbusters of recent years.<br /><br />So, if you're up for a fun creature feature Mimic: The Director's Cut is worth a rent.  If you're at all interested in Guillermo del Toro's career, or film making in general the Blu-Ray is worth owning for the special features.e director's cut, making of featurettes, deleted scenes, original marketing material, and other goodies for those who are interested in the film's history.

B00AN93Q0O|5.0|So...being a hometown girl of this band...I had never heard of them.  That is until they started getting radio play.  I was hooked with \\"Holding Onto You\\" and went to the Bunbury Festival in Cincy where twentyone pilots was the performance I really wanted to see aside from Atlas Genius, MGMT and Cake.  HOLY crap was I blown away!  The highest energy and best on stage performance of the whole day!!!  So what did I do?  I of course bought the whole album and wouldn't you know I just love every track on it!  These guys are amazing!  The lyrics really speak to me and I recommend them to anyone that will listen!  So what are you waiting for?  BUY IT!!!!

B000FCKC4C|5.0|I actually read this book as part of a college level political science class. Being completely new to author Paulo Coelho I really didn't know what to expect. Without spoiling anything let me just say that this is one of the most influential books I have ever read. I'm an avid reader too; my room is stacked with books. This is kind of an adventure story crossed with a book on spirituality and self-help. I've read very few books that have really stuck with me as much as this one has. The quotes are inspirational and I feel like anyone could relate to the ideas presented. I don't mean to sound like a fan-boy, but there is a special place in my heart for this book. It evoked a new outlook on life for me. It really was like chicken soup for my soul. If you're searching for something in your life or you're almost down and out, pick this book up. It was the best required reading I've ever done. I'll end with a quote, &#34;And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.&#34; 5 stars, baby!

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Love the Maiden, Matron and Crone motif.  Do I really need to say more?  Yes, five more words evidently . . .
B00C2GJWNG|5.0|I first saw Jake Bugg perform &#34;Broken&#34; on the Graham Norton Show recently and, at first, expected more of the same thing I've heard from a slew of young, cookie-cutter artists. (Was I thinking &#34;Bieber?&#34; Oh yes I was.) Then the voice got my attention, so I knew this would be different. Shortly, with his passionate performance of his lyrics, I knew this young guy had a maturity that would indeed bring up the thought of young Bob Dylan. Norton, in his  post-performance interview expressed how surprised he was, saying that when Bugg sang, he was a MAN. Then he continued with, &#34;but you're a BOY.&#34; Awkward, perhaps, but exactly what I was thinking.<br /><br />I'm likely a jaded baby boomer that feels we had the best. Every generation will probably think the same of their own music. I maintain a constant, open-minded search for fresh and new. So when I compare him to Dylan, I don't mean he's &#34;another Dylan.&#34; Bugg is BUGG. I simply mean that he's got the complexity and unique personal style that makes me think he's worthy of comparison. I expect this singer to go places.
B000EQ5SRK|5.0|Sharon Stone at her prime, she did alot of good movies during this era.  I also love William Baldwin in this, he's hot n' sexy and both he and Sharon have a good chemistry. Everything about this movie is good, the way it was filmed, the story and the acting.  It's an original plot and if you haven't seen it, it keeps you guessing.  I also love the music, it's sexy and alluring.  Enigma has a classic song that's played throughout and sets the pace for a sexy thriller.
B00AI41PSY|1.0|This is NOT an ELO album. This is a Jeff Lynne ego project. Nothing more. The musicianship on this record doesn't hold a candle to the original. Jeff does not hold a candle to Bev Bevan as a drummer or Kelly Groucutt as a bassist. The vocals and harmonies are no where near what they originally were. As good as Jeff's voice is for his age, it doesn't hold a candle to what it was in his prime. Nor is his harmonizing with himself anything like what it was with the band originally.<br /><br />AVOID THIS RECORD!!! If you love ELO, buy the true ELO records and CD's. Ignore this sorry ego project.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|This is an epic movie, from finish to start.  It's almost sensory overload but total quality filmaking.  The acting and special effects are top notch, Naomi Watts is awesome (she's one of my fave actresses).  She plays second fidle to King Kong but she's not just a prop in the movie.  I love Adrian Brody as well, he adds to the movie for the hero factor.  It's a sad ending, I really don't like the fact King Kong dies at the end but hey if you don't like a sad ending, watch Mighty Joe Young, he lives at the end.
0316228532|5.0|I felt the Harry Potter books were difficult to read as I felt they were geared towards young readers, even though I absolutely loved the movies.  However, The Casual Vacancy is an adult read.  J K Rowling is a fabulous writer.  Great character development.  I first listened to this with Audible then had to actually read the novel.  LOVE IT!!
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|this is obviously a cheap knock off of Mario bros. it lags too much and I couldn't play it more than 5 minutes without it freezing up, causing me to lose a life. I do not recommend this game.
B008JFUO36|2.0|I don't even know what to think about this movie.<br /><br /> First of all, the trailer spoils the first major twist of the film. So already I was looking for twists. The 2nd twist *SPOILER*  directly rips off Moon and that's when I checked out.<br /><br />This movie is basically a combination of Moon, Independence day, Total recall, The Matrix, Wall-e and maybe a little 2001 space odyssey and because of that it feels completely derivative. And the more I think about it, the less I like it.<br /><br />Bottom line would be to go watch Moon, a much better film.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|I was in the market for a book that was a nice easy, laid back read and this fit the bill perfectly.  Sophie gets to the point rather quickly and entertains.  Love the main character.  It is simple, there is no great mystery or twists and turns, but it is truly enjoyable at the same time.  I would have given 5 stars if the ending had taken me a little further on the journey.
B004ETVAH0|3.0|I brought this out of curiosity more than anything else. However, not my style of Rock-N-Roll. More for the Rock-A-Billy fan.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection wraps up the most essential games of the MGS universe, leaving spinoffs like the \\"Acid\\" series behind. However, despite being a mandatory day-one purchase for any fan of Solid Snake and the legendary Big Boss, I still feel that they shouldn't have forgotten once again of the great \\"Portable Ops\\" game (for PSP). Canon or not, it's a very damn entertaining and insightful game at the same time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, besides PO not being included, I have no complaints. I absolutely loved what I received in my hands a few days ago. The packaging looked bigger in the pictures, but it still took my breath away. As many reviewers have already stated, the collection includes the 2 original Metal Gear games, MGS 1 (Digital download), MGS2, MGS3, MGS Peacewalker,  the 300 VR Missions for the MGS 1 (Digital download), and obviously MGS 4: Guns of the Patriots (In a separate disc). There's not a single game in this collection that I would recommend to avoid playing or that it doesn't deserve to be included. Each game marked a huge paradigm shift when it came to videogame engines, rich characters, graphics, level details and storylines. Each game offers a satisfying, unique experience. Each game deserves to be played from beginning to end. Each game breathes its own life.<br /><br />In addition, you'll also receive a fantastic art book with 100 pages of MGS related stuff. It features a badass cover that you will love to death since day 1. Finally, the graphic novels with the stories of the first two 3D MGS games are another powerful reason to place the disc on your Blu Ray player (Or PS3) and enjoy of a finely executed digital graphic work with more insight on those amazing games.<br /><br />If you've played any of the MGS that exist and liked it, then what are you waiting for? This is the ultimate chance of getting your dirty little hands on \\"Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection\\", which basically encapsulates the MGS mythos into onesingle, accesible package for you to enjoy from here to eternity.
B00005NTN5|4.0|It’s a bitt drawn out, but a good spin on the crime family theme. The story may have benefited from a little less violence from the Lads and a little more Ladies Loving from the Gals.
B000WS4PCO|4.0|My pastor recommended this CD in one of his sermons.  He asked us to borrow the CD and read the lyrics as we listened to the songs.  In his opinion it was one of the best music CD's ever produced.  I bought the CD and read the lyrics as I listened to the music.  I like the lyrics better than the music.  I like poetry and the lyrics reminded me of good poetry.  This CD is an old release and may be considered a classic.  Actually, this CD makes me curious to meet Bono and the other members of U2.  I would like to get to know them as people and have them explain where they get the original ideas for these lyrics.
1471304965|3.0|While I still enjoyed this CD, a lot of detail from the book seemed to be lost in is translation from written to spoken word. Somewhere in the product description are the words ‘abridged version’ no doubt. I was a little disappointed, but only just a little.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Ever since I first heard Il Divo, I have loved their music. The quality of their harmony is unequaled. I bought them as gifts for my friends and now I'm in like flint.
0061743526|4.0|Harper Lee's  \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a down to earth tale dealing with issues we continue to face today. The story begins with a young Scout Finch who is our narrator. She describes the amazing unity, and the hidden separation of her town. The real meat of the book is pertaining to a court case that opens up the reader's eyes to the story's true meaning.<br />Personally, I found this novel to be a revelation. We all already knew the concept of racism existed, but many of us do not realize that it still exists. As I continued to turn pages, I realized I couldn't put it down. The story line is so intriguing! There are a few surprises along the way, and the story always keeps moving. When I finished this sensational story, I knew I had in a way become a new and better person. If you didn't read it in high school, you should now.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I read on a constant basis but to this day no author has been able to make my imagination whirl quite like Neil Gaiman. His stories are told with such fluidity and vivid description that you are right next to the protagonist throughout the story.<br />Please read this book, you will not be disappointed.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|I love Harry Hole.  The plots and creepy serial killers are usually pretty interesting.  But Harry Hole's evolution in the series has been really riveting.  This first novel doesn't have that fully fleshed-out character yet, but the seeds are there.  It's interesting to know where the author started, and how far he's come.  I'll keep reading Jo Nesbo, just to see what happens with Harry.
B000002LFL|5.0|After this, most likely you will never listen again to the dried flower petals studio recordings. Add \\"Singles\\" perhaps, and you're done.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|It is a touching story about the power of love and about how early childhood experiences shape children's outlook on life. The Minions are the funniest cartoon characters I have ever seen in my 60 years of movie going.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|it was the best book i have read in years.  if you like flowers and gardens this book is marvelous.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really loved this game! it worked fine in the beginning but now it freezes my kindle. everytime the game loads it freezes right on my screen. then I am unable to do anything with my kindle I have to do the emergancy 20 sec powerdown. it was a great game I just wish it would work on my kindle:(<br /><br />p.s.<br />I did uninstall and reinstall; no luck at all :(
B008RA3X5E|4.0|very handy, versital &amp; comprahensive clock. The only thing else I wish it could do would be to make coffee
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|my granddaughter loves to pay with my kindle. and now she love to watch the show on it thanks she is happy
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Tucker & Dale vs Evil is, by far, the funniest horror movie I have ever seen.  It has been a long time since I have laughed that much during any movie.<br />I watched it with my brother and sisters and they all loved it, too.  I have seen many movies in the comedy - horror genre, but Tucker & Dale beats them all.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I love everything that David Baldacci writes. He write extremely well and I always get into his books. His subject matter is what I like.
B000MR1V22|4.0|l was pleasantly surprised by the heart of this movie...The grandpa, played by Alan Arkin, is wickedly candid and made the movie for me! Overall it's simply a very cute movie reflecting real life angst with a sprinkle of exaggerated situations that kept me watching and rooting for the underdog!! :)
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Excellent movie.  Samuel L. Jackson is excellent in this movie.  You won't be disappointed.  GREAT MOVIE !!!<br />Well worth watching.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My son loves this app, he especially likes the balloons and bubbles that appear after completing a puzzle. It helps him feel accomplished. He is just 3 yo and it holds his attention for about 30 min.
B006VREHRS|5.0|I have always like Buscemi as an actor and after years of hearing how great this show I decided to watch it. I was very impressed with the acting, dialogue, sets, everything. A great series, very enjoyable to watch.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is very informative and very hard to put down. Chris Kyle was a great guy and will be missed.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Candidly and clearly Sheryl Sandberg discusses issues that we all must deal with in the workplace...but most often leave unacknowledged like the elephant in the room.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This book was not as good as her other books<br />have been, not as exciting. Seemed to crawl a bit
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|A great buy if you enjoy twists and turns with a flavor of mystery in a movie. The acting was great,, suspenseful at times, and well-directed.
0812981480|1.0|This book takes a subtly slanted view toward the life of Jesus of Nazareth.  His assumptions make a lot of guesses about Jesus' life.  For example he attempts to convince readers that Jesus had to be married because that's what he's learned in his own research about Jews at the time.  While well reserached into recorded Jewish historical information, Aslan makes far too many assumptions about &#34;what applies to many must apply to one.&#34;  If you read this book, just bear in mind that he's making guesses about one man based upon what he's researched about others.  I hope that the readers of this book will exercise their own mind as they read and realize that Aslan is only offering his own opinion of the life of Jesus.  Given that there is only one historical collection of stories that document his life, it stands to reason that Aslan lacks any real substantive evidence as a historian and is thereby forced to offer a best guess about who he thinks Jesus was.  Read this book for what it is, one man's opinion of a person that nobody can honestly pin down to a single category or label.  This book isn't meant to end the discussions about who Jesus was.  It's merely Aslan's theory on who he was written two thousand years after the last historical records were penned.<br /><br />Bottom line: It makes some leaps of faith in applying fractured historical evidence to one person as if to assume &#34;all people fit into this one simple mold.&#34;
B0073XV2W2|5.0|I read the first two novels by this author, Daemon and Freedom TM, and was immediately caught up in a brilliant author's well documented supposition. Everything he writes about is referenced at the end, just like a professional paper or thesis. In a similar vein, Kill Decision brings a vision of what could happen now, not in 5 or 10 years, but now. Chilling in scope, great action sequences, believable characters (ok, in the novel not quite so rounded out, but still believable).<br /><br />I tend to cringe at ebooks that cost more than 5 or 6 bucks, but this is professionally edited, and the quality of work is worth the price.  Anyone wanting a great read will enjoy this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, i love it and my little brother n sister love it too. Although the slide is kinda hard to navigate. :) 5 stars
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Used to love this on my pc. Tried trial ver. Problems with instal. Paid for full but:<br />Amazon app store seems to keep having trouble letting me dl it. Five star when I can actually get what I paid for.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is like my favorite game  to play now that I got it and my friends love it to
034580404X|5.0|What is there to say.. if you've read the series I'm sure you loved it just as much as I did. I was literally obsessed for months :D can't wait for movie
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|The game has good graphics but it needs work you can barely aim and shoot the enemy down because it moves to fast to control
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can you escape is a very good game. they can improve the game so it would save the objects you found when you exit the game. looking forward to more escape games.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I didnt think that greys anatomy was going to be so entertaining, I ve watched house md but greys anatomy is completely different
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Can't wait for season 2 to be released.  We don't have Showtime and were told to download this show.  We very much enjoy it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new Weather Channel is truly awful.  With ad crawlers and silly games and points, this update has ruined what was once a useful tool.  I also agree with a previous reviewer that it uses up battery life.  I will reinstall once the developers have fixed these issues.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Well done, good story I enjoyed it and it brought back many memories. I would recommend this book to others that grew up in the 90s
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I like the game.  I have not started winning at NORMAL yet.  But I will soon.<br />I don't think young children should play a game with the goal of killing everyone.  My grandchildren are not allowed to play.<br /><br />The In-App purchase are not a bother since I have disabled them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show! I am super addicted. Can't wait till season 4!!! Great writing, and acting! Love everyone on the show.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire.  I love being able to do everything my computer does with ebay.  Like someone else noted it is a little hard to get used to.  I find it very easy to use now.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Prepare to be touched, laugh, cry and wonder. This book is suitable for all and should be bought so that it can be enjoyed many times over. The language may be challenging for those younger than 9 or 10 but can certainly be understood if read to.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Very buggy. Kindle fire HD version 1.9 whatever is horrible.  Can't log in easily but then won't sync my subscriptions.  Works great and love the app on other android devices running 2.0 version.  How about an update someone!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Keeps me entertained while I am on lunch break while at work.  It is becomes very addicting as I try to outdo my previous high score.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I loved the book.  I lived through it all with the remarkable descriptions and insight into human nature.  Having also read &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; it was as good as these.  There were a number of different characters and I did have to make sure that I took a mental tally of the connections.  There was no stereotyping and it was refreshing not to have to read again about a tall, attractive young woman who fell in love with a tall attractive young man.  None of these just very real people with very real lives.  I can  highly recomend this book which will leave a lasting impression on all its readers.
006114665X|3.0|This book is so good in the details that I could just not finish it. I may yet, one day, return to it, but at times it reads like a dry history lesson as opposed to the riveting war it describes. A disappointment.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Better than most recent horror movies I've seen lately. It's played very straight, very gory and very typical ending. Don't go in comparing with the original. It's not campy or comedy. The physical effects were nice, no bad CGI...and story well it plays out just as you'd expect. The ending felt like it tried to end positive which seemed odd given all that had happened. All said and done pretty forgettable but worth a watch.

B005BZQVJ8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, lot of smiles and the bigger film, sci fi fan you are the more and more smiles you'll have. Totally worth a rental!
1934030198|4.0|As a beginner, with this book you will solve all your doubts, dont buy any additional manual, regards from Chile!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Great movie. Great seller. Both arrived when promised. (Bought one for a friend) a lot of people were complaining that it wasn't a concert. It's not meant to be. Very cool.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|This album is perfect for a beach mood sunset party of two... advisable with cheese and wine... regards from Chile!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I would suggest to any of you who have seen Thor or Captain America or any of the Iron Man movies to see the gang as they're all together. The special effects, the cast, the dialogue, it all comes together well, even if you already know what you're in for it's still fun to watch again. I would not recommend letting little kids watch this as there's a small amount of violence that's directed towards humans (implied but even so) that might affect young ones. As with all movies you'll need to base that on the maturity of your child. Having said that my five-year-old watched most of the movie and she enjoyed it a lot. I did see this on the big screen (in 3D) and it holds up well on the small screen as the plot and dialogue will keep you interested even if the special effects aren't as impressive in your living room as they were in the theater.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is the most fun, entertaining, and addictive series!  I adore all the characters and really enjoy the time period and setting for the show.  I can't wait to follow another season of Downton Abbey!
B00C1LIYWM|3.0|I loved loved the book.  While the movie was good and follows the book, the color of the movie's background was lacking.  Maybe is was my tv.
0894803123|4.0|Nice book. Was what I was looking for. More written in than I had hoped for. What blows me away was the time it took to get here!! IT'S A SMALL BOOK!!! And sent from the U.S!!! Never order from this supplier again. Wow!! And the shipping charges were more than enough to get it here sooner!!! It must have been mailed Pony Express!!! Good Lord!
B000002GLT|4.0|I'm glad that I was able to find this at an incredibly low price. Having said that, I'm glad I got it in spite of the negative reviews (Including All Music Guide). To be honest with you, I like all kinds of music (I don't consider hip hop music - that's a personal opinion, so live with it), but I especially like all kinds of blues (from Charlie Patton, to Warren Hayes, and all points in between), and most Jazz (Including Acid Jazz). I had read enough reviews that I got the idea that this was going to be a primarily Acoustic Sounding set. I liked it. What happened next brought back Grateful Dead concert memories. I was playing this album on my cloud player, so I was just listening, and enjoying this. Next thing I know, Mayall's &#34;Wake Up Call&#34; album comes on (with guests like Buddy Guy, and Mavis Staples). I just left it on. It was like listening to a two set concert. Acoustic, then electric. Seriously Thinking of getting &#34;Empty Rooms&#34;, then I'll have a 3 set concert (&#34;Empty Rooms&#34;,  &#34;Jazz Blues Fusion&#34;, and &#34;Tough&#34;). Acoustic, Jazz Blues, and Electric Blues.
B001NLKT60|5.0|What a turn this book took - I couldn't put it down. I'm looking forward to reading the last of the trilogy.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a true story of two pilots on opposite sides with a German pilot showing incredible compassion on a plane that looked doomed.  He risked his career and his life to lead his American foes to safety only to be reunited long after the war was over.
0778315673|5.0|I am ashamed to admit that I have never read a Debbie Macomber book until this summer.  I've watched the \\"Mrs. Miracle\\" movies based on her novels and have started watching the \\"Cedar Cove\\" TV series as well.  This series made me decide to read one of her books this summer.  I started with the first Cedar Cove book, and I couldn't put it down.  I'm now on the second book in that series and am also reading two more of her books....I'm reading all 3 at the same time!  That's how much I have grown to love her writing in such a short time.  I picked up \\"The Shop on Blossom Street\\" at the library the other day, and now I have just felt like I have known these four women my whole life.  That's one thing that Debbie Macomber does very well....she pulls you into her characters' lives and makes you feel like you've been a part of their lives forever.  I'm invested in these characters.  I want to know what happens to them.  I want to see how their lives continue to intertwine with each others.  I can't believe how invested I've become in the lives of these 4 women in such a short amount of time. I now can't wait to read book 2 in this series and to finish Cedar Cove book 2 and move on to book 3.  I would highly recommend both of these series of books.  Now, shockingly, because of reading this book, I want to learn how to knit, too!
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Great for the whole family.  We have to small children and they really enjoy all the different segments of the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is way better than temple run and subway surfer combined hilarious as well most amazing game I've played
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book makes a woman appreciate living in America and the rights we have as a people in general.  An eye-opener to the lives of women in Afghanistan.  Incredible characters that you truly have feelings for.
B009WUBERW|4.0|This was a good movie. I like seeing the old action hero's back at work. Action scenes were good & it had a pretty good story.

B000HL09MG|3.0|Saw this many years ago.  Was looking forward to seeing it this week.  This is the third day of waiting for my two day shipping prime acct.  and looks like it is going to be at least four days shipping time.  So I'm rating this movie on my old memory of it.

1568363931|5.0|I've bought a couple different bento books and this is by far my favorite and go to bento book. There are great recipes on chicken karage, egg omelet roll, onigiri, a variety of Japanese side salads, pickled vegetables, teriyaki sauces for different meats, and sushi just to name a few. Many of the recipes come with multiple variations which is brilliant for those of us that want more options. The end of the book offers great advice on freezing rice, making and storing sushi vinegar, and different cuts for apples and sausages. I've only had this book book for two weeks but have tried around five classic recipes and have so far been impressed by the results.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is awesome its way better  than gangstar rio its got good graphics and good gameplay they just need to and damage to the car for the next update.
B00CJGP116|5.0|This might be the best salsa CD Marc Anthony has put out so far. That is quite an accomplishment, given that he is arguably the best salsa singer right now.<br />The CD has at least 5 songs that can be singles: #1, Vivir Mi Vida; #3, Flor Pálida; #4, Cambio de Piel; #7, Si No Es Verdad; and #9, Cautivo de Amor.<br />I am glad that this guy is sticking to what he does best. To me, he is up there with Frankie Ruiz, Hector Lavoe, and company.<br />This was totally worth the wait.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|The scene with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is one of the best in modern cinema.  And what a great cast.  A high point for Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.  And pitch perfect performances from all of the featured supporting players.  Why isn't this considered a modern classic?
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I was still on season 6 when this arrived (very quickly) and literally had my teeth ripping into this package I think I would have died if I didn't have this season on hand!
0143119680|5.0|It took me a couple a chapters to really get into the book but once I did, I couldn't put it down. I really enjoy this genre and am often looking for something new and different. Love it, love it! Can't wait to get the second book.

B007ZGO7EM|1.0|this is horrible! it messed up my kindle and I had to get a new one. it may say free but I spend 200$s because of it.
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|The controls are well placed. If you know a little about landing you should bring everyone in safely. The first landing I had one passenger injury. It takes some practice though.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all the craft ideas ,so many new ones to chose from, also ideas for my home and garden,I've already tried some love this app.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a fantastic game you cannot stop playing it's for all ages I know because. I'm granny only one word I can say FANTASTIC FANTASTIC FANTASTIC.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Return this app to the way it was. You people ruined it when you did this to it. It's no longer right about any thing any more.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|As a Brit living in America I am always proud when British shows make their way over the pond and become popular (in Downton's case, VERY popular). Another one of my favourites that has become extremely popular is Top Gear (shown on BBC America over here). With regard to Downton  it truly is a wonderful show. While in college I lived quite close to the estate where Downton is filmed (Highclere Castle) and had the pleasure to visit it once on my way back home for Easter break. This show does a wonderful job of encapsulating the beautiful house and grounds and is the next best thing to actually being there.<br /><br />While I loved both seasons, I do have to say that I preferred the first season. The second season has excellent aspects such as how different people in the household deal with World War I and it's devastating effects for all walks of life in Great Britain at that time, and the changing face of the country with regard to the aristocracy's stranglehold on power beginning to ebb away. The acting in both seasons is excellent. However, in my opinion all the great parts of the show are a little ruined in the second season with the somewhat sensationalist storylines which reminded me more of a soap opera than a high-quality period drama like Downton (the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5). This, however, is only a small gripe. Overall a wonderful show which encapsulates aristocratic life in England at that time well (although not perfectly). My American wife loved it and can't wait to take her to Highclere when we go over there.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I and my husband have recently become Castle fans.  We just can't get enough.  Over the past few months we started with season one and are catching up before it starts back in the fall.  I don't know why it tooks us so long to start watching it but I am so glad we did.  I hope this show goes for another few years.
B00BFUC8RC|3.0|I enjoyed playing the game for a while but ran out of interest quickly.  But I am very hard to please when it comes to these games.  Overall it was fun.
B009WUBERW|4.0|You just have to leave plausability at the door. All of the references to each others movies, and CHUCK NORRIS were awesome!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good for killing time and just like any other game it's addicting. I don't like that you have to pay to complete a lot of it
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Of course, &#34;With The Old Breed&#34; is one of the most famous combat personal accounts ever written. Who see's it all and lives? And of those, who can write this well? Who keeps a daily diary in combat? One! Just Sledge in WWII, in some of the bloodiest, nastiest, most vicious combat the world has ever seen.<br /><br />If you ever want to know what real combat is like, this is the one book you should read. I was in real combat and saw much of what Sledge saw, only in a different war. I can vouch for the authenticity.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think the app is pretty cool with its graphics and everything and how u can change from the house to the road and road to house etc. It is cool I admit it so I just want to say nice job to the creatures.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Couldn't help it. I tried to like it as much but the story isn't as interesting/compelling. There were moments, though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is just hard  but I'll  get use to it and all these games now are mostly like subway surfer that's why they're good
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|purchased as a gift for our 12 year old son. he is growing out of the lego stage but this one he loved. a little more challenging and kept him busy all day. One of the sets he takes down to show family because he enjoyed it that much!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so handy for reading for anyone retired or busy easy to find and helps along with Daily bread.
B004FV1ESW|2.0|I liked this movie but the &#34;extended cut&#34; added nothing but a lot of sexual content which did not add anything to the story.  I like extended versions of movies like Gladiator and Lord of the Rings because it actually adds something to the story but there was too much explicit sexual content which was not needed.  The language is pretty rough too.  Good story though.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Like but think families with children would use it more,I enjoy parts,I am retired so do not cook a lot anymore do like  some of the crochet patterns etc!
B00COGXX7A|4.0|While any book/movie by Sparks is a treat, Safe Haven just missed the 5 star mark for me because of its slow plot in the middle. But, it held pretty true to the book and was just as romantic as I anticipated. Not as good as The Notebook, but then I think that will be very hard to top.
193700788X|2.0|Why do I think that the last book in the series has to be the best? I don't know, but i thought that. Unless I began reading DEA. Well, the Sookie books have been going downhill for a while. i didn't like the previous two, but for some reason kept reading them. Oh, i know why i was reading. i have this attitude to never leave a book unfinished, and in this case i also wished to finish the series.<br />Not impressed. At all. The \\"feeling\\" was gone for me. I understood that Sookie was over for me. I won't be reading anymore about her (I've heard another book is coming soon).<br />As JC sings: \\"It was nice but now it's gone.\\" The books were nice, but DEA proved to me i didn't care about those books anymore. Maybe i just grew out of them, maybe Miss Harris disappointed me with the last volumes, but it's time to say goodbye to Sookie and her friends.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Very good story.Heart breaking to say the least.Cannot imagine how someone could cope living through that.I would buy his books.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Very good read ... about tragic characters in a dysfunctional family but one young boy survives by going to Canada.... through serendipity, hard work and knowing which fights are worth fighting and which are not.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Alot of fun to play. Keeps you alert and sharp on the look out for the next clue :-)  can't wait for levels.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just got the unit in the mail and set it up.  Set up is a breeze: you plug it in to HDMI, plug in the USB for power (either to the TV or to the included USB power plug), connect to its ad-hoc network via the chromecast app and then it's good to go.<br /><br />Content is currently limited to: Google Play media, YouTube, Netflix, and tabs from Chrome browsers on Windows, Mac, and Chromebook (Pixel only at this time).  Pandora is coming but not available yet.  Content must come from the internet at current and does not support local file streaming (except in a loophole where you can load local files in to a chrome tab, those will be streamed).<br /><br />The streaming functions work really well, there's a small small delay since the device acts as a remote more or less.  Web browsing, which is in beta form, is noticeably laggy.  Slower than direct streaming (e.g. WiDi, AirPlay or Miracast) but that's due to again, it working more like a remote.  It all works very well and if you have any experience with AirPlay from iOS/Mac you'll be used to how it works from an end user standpoint.  Technically it works differently as again AirPlay streams from device to AppleTV or similar device, Chromecast doesn't send content from the phone to the Chromecast directly but instead allows the Chromecast device to pull the content from the internet/cloud.  The negative of this is no direct mirroring and limits functionality to application specific implementations BUT it allows the device to be turned off or removed from the network or other tasks to be done on the device.  So it's an interesting comparison.<br /><br />So what's not so good: It's limited to 2.4GHz wireless, which is slower and more congested than 5GHz spectrum.  It does support 802.11 N at least.  The selection of content/apps needs work, but it's brand new and will get better - hopefully.<br /><br />But here's the great thing.  It only costs $35.  Not only that, but if you ordered soon enough it comes with 3 months of Netflix for new OR existing customers (although limited to one code per account so if you buy multiples you'll get multiple codes but can only personally use one of them).  When you factor that in you're getting $23.97 of a service you're probably already paying for.  The puts the net cost of the device at just $11.03 plus tax.  Eleven Dollars!!  If you weren't lucky enough to order by then - it's not as good a deal but the device is still worth $35.  If you only use this thing a small handful of times, just to quickly stream a chrome tab up on your TV or to watch a youtube video it's worth it.  But with how well this has been selling I imagine we'll be seeing more apps support it soon.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+++ Cost - $35 or $11 depending on when you ordered<br />++ Cross platform (Android 2.3 or higher, iOS 6 or higher, Chrome for Windows, Mac, Chromebook)<br />+ Easy setup<br />+ Small/portable (just need to bring the USB power and the device)<br />+ includes HDMI extension, usb cable, and usb power supply (amazing for the cost)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited content for now (no local content either)<br /><br />Overall, again it's not perfect.  I'd love to have seen 5GHz wireless support and I want more content/apps and I'd love to see some direct streaming or an easy way to get photos streamed (I hear you can do videos but haven't tested yet).  But for $11 I'll bet on the future of the device.<br /><br />-= Notes on content source =-<br />I've seen on forums that people have questions about streaming from your device or the playback of local files.  Chromecast, in the current form, does NOT support streaming of local content.  The source for all content must be online, your phone/tablet is used for content discovery and control/credentials ONLY.  There's a loop hole to this in that local files can apparently be opened in a chrome tab and then displayed via Chromecast but this is an exception (see: [...]<br /><br />See the image on this post for a visual representation: [...]<br /><br />-= Notes on power source =-<br />Also for clarity, the pictures that Google uses to show the device plugged in to the TV neglect to show the USB cable attached for power.  HDMI is not capable of supplying enough power and as such you need to use the included USB cable to power the device (some TVs have a USB port for debugging/update purposes that can be used).  Some reviewers are pointing out that HDMI can power it but it cannot.  HDMI only supplies 5V @ 50mA, you'd need roughly 10 times that power (5V @ 500mA) to power this.  The included charger is rated for 5V @ 800mA which goes a long way to supporting that HDMI alone cannot power the device.  As a side note: MHL ports could power the device but I can't find any confirmation that this supports MHL.<br /><br />To some of you this may seem trivial/obvious but I've had more than one friend ask for clarification about this so I thought it might be of important note here.  They did a good job of explaining this at the press event but apparently not as well elsewhere.<br /><br />-= Notes on comparison =-<br />Roku/PS3/360/AppleTV/etc - This isn't meant to compete directly with these, yet.  Content is too limited for now.  This is changing and should get better.  A key distinction is the mechanics of it.  While it presents itself as something similar to AirPlay it functions as more of a hybrid between AirPlay and using a remote app (Roku, SmartGlass, Remote, etc) on your smart device.  Essentially the content comes from the internet/cloud - the device is used for content discovery and control of the content but the content comes from the internet.  Another key distinction is cost.  Even at Roku's cheapest this is still 80% cheaper (after netflix cost factored out).  Even if this is the full $35, it's still roughly 1/3 the cost of Apple TV.<br /><br />If you already have one, or more, of the devices (I do) the utility of this device is a little more limited in terms of uniqueness but there's one very very key difference, one I'm excited for, and some unique overlaps.  With Roku or PS3, your account (e.g. Netflix) has to be tied into the device.  So someone visiting has to sign in on their account or use your account.  This isn't ideal.  But with Chromecast as long as they're signed in on their device (Android/iOS) they can connect to wireless and see the Chromecast and then stream from their own account.  This makes it a perfect device for visitors and will ultimately replace my use of a Roku in my guest room for this EXACT reason.  While AppleTV with AirPlay rivals this it has two drawbacks: it's iOS only and doesn't allow the streaming device to be used for anything else or to have the screen turned off.  The cross platform nature alone is a notable distinction and again a welcome idea for guests.  The fact that with Chromcast your phone/tablet can do other things or have their screen turned off will save battery.<br /><br />So while the distinctions aren't as explicit - arguably on the face it functions much like a cross platform Apple TV would in certain cases - the subtle differences add to it.  Content discovery (and account info) come from the iOS/Android device but do not require that device to be on/active/present to continue streaming and can be picked up/resumed from another device.  Again, these issues don't exist with Roku/PS3 but in those cases your account has to be used on the Roku/PS3 - Chromecast allows for easy user swapping and multiuser control.  So while it's hard, on the face, to see the distinction it's there.  It's that overlap of features included in a single device that drives this as a unique thing.  While it may not be much, for the few dollars it costs it could be of use in those specific scenarios.  If you already have multiple devices (e.g. AppleTV and PS3) and don't see specific use in that distinction or cross platform nature then it's likely not for you but I'd bet for $11 you'll find some use for it.<br /><br />-= Questions =-<br />If you have any questions about the device, technology, experience or anything I can try and test let me know in the comments and I'll do my best to answer as soon as possible.ne very very key difference, one I'm excited for, and some unique overlaps.

1451695195|5.0|Planning to read on vacation, but my friends highly recommended it.  I am looking forward to reading it soon.  Happy reading.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Slightly goofy, extremely dark, and very funny. The cast is amazing and the story is impressive, but you might need a little stomach for the very morbid humor.
B008QMMEOE|1.0|Y is only trains unlocked everything  should be unlocked this game did not turn out as planned i like challenges so
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this app! my little ones can use my kindle ans droid now without changing my bookmarks and calling people and looking at the web. wonderful wonderful
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addictive. Fun. Entertaining. My fiance and I compete to see who gets the highest score. Friendly competition. Would recommend to everyone. =)
B005544TRQ|5.0|This has been one of my favorite shows to go back and watch.  Great stories and acting which sort of reminds me Boston Legal without all of the cheesiness.  Would definitely watch over again.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|This is the second time I've seen the remake and I actually liked it better the second time.  I haven't seen the original since it was in the theaters but from what I remember it still doesn't match up.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Bruce keeps meeting nice girls and puts them in danger to save his life and fight the dreaded CIA.  This flick has lots of action and Bruce is the good guy.  lots of nostalgia for old ex-cia types.  I liked this humor.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not a book I &#34;liked&#34;, but couldn't put it down. Lots of whiplash and quick turns. Unpredictable, well written and plenty to talk about with fellow readers.
1781162646|5.0|What can I say but Stephen King has written another great book with unforgettable characters.  I highly recommend this book,  Very few authors have characters that when I finish a book I keep thinking about them.  Stephen King is a master at this.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A book that describes the science of me! Yep, I'm a quiet introvert. Great read for spouses, parents, teachers, managers, thinkers and readers who enjoy social science in tidy narratives.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Loved this movie and the multiple roles played by the well known cast. The suggestion that we have been, we are, and we will become always fascinates me. Let's me get my karma on.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so fun xD I love being able to eat scuba divers and beach goers as well as other sharks. I really love the fact that you 'evolve' and can buy bigger and better sharks :) I've got a hammer head right now!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Seriously if you have a small grill and want to not use lighter fluid, you have to go with this,
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|The graphics were great, the tasks were not so hard as to make the game impossible, and the story was fun.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This sharpener was too small to do much for my Ka-Bar Becker BK2.<br /><br />It is a pocket sharpener, so I can't complain about it too much.<br /><br />For smaller knives, I bet this thing would be great.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Another great work of art from Gaiman. He crafts beautiful writing around amazing worlds that really do exist within us as children. This seems a natural progression after Coraline and The Graveyard Book, but made me fondly recall earlier works, as well. These \\"imagined\\" worlds are so very real to those whose imaginations are alive. Gaiman's fantastical realities are beautiful and terrifying reminders of where the worlds within us and the worlds without blur.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|It's great to use for the first couple of days but it'll breaker sooner than you think! I was even trying to handle it with extra care after I read the comments, but it still broke...
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Every American should read this book. Story of a true American hero. Learn what dedication and sacrifice mean. One of the best.
B00DM0XXCM|1.0|The first half of this movie simply sets up background information....  You're on a distant planet in another universe, ok I get that...  But you don't have to do so much setup for a movie that is more likely just set on an alternate reality of earth.  It pretty much ruined any interest in the rest of the poorly executed movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, narrated by Hazel Grace Lancaster, who is suffering from stage IV metastatic cancer, meets Augustus Waters in a teen cancer support group. The sixteen-year-olds share witty, intelligent banter as they get to know each other. This isn't about living with or dying from cancer, although cancer looms with the characters--Augustus lost his leg several years prior and Hazel uses an oxygen tank as her cancer has spread to her lungs. This is a story of two people who, although cancer has shaped their adolescence, are as typical as any teen with a challenge (and most teens have challenges sometimes big like cancer, sometimes more ordinary like insecurity).<br />THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, though classified as young adult, is not just for teens. I'm an adult cancer survivor and I saw myself and my survivor friends in Hazel and Augustus--we're funny, often irreverent about our cancers, as both a coping mechanism and a way of life, because frankly, life is better that way.<br />Though at times Hazel sounds older than sixteen, she's taken her GED and in college, plus cancer seems to mature children as they are surrounded by adults during treatment, family and the medical community.<br />There is little FAULT in THE FAULT IN OUR STARS.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I found this book a very emotional page turner.  The characters were well filled out. The story was both heartbreaking and poignant. I have it four stars because I couldn't put down the last two hundred pages. However, I was disappointed in how some of the relationships developed and was looking for more at the end. I would, and have, recommended this book.
B009WUBERW|4.0|It was a very well done follow-on to the first.  You have to look at this from a perspective of knowing what it's intended to be!  Great action, average acting, and just lots of a of bit unrealistic bullets flying all over the place - if you line up to that expectation, you'll not be disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Looks like a piece of junk that I will toss after playing with it for a couple of days.<br />-You can only watch so many youtube video's before it gets old.<br />-You can probably stream 1/2 a NetFlix movie before your phone dies. Even if your device acts as a controller for this, it is still junk.<br /><br />Junk.<br /><br />--Update--<br />I think people are upset at all the 1 star reviews because we have not officially reviewed the product. Also because it is \\"bringing down the ratings\\".<br />But how about the 25, 5 star reviews that are bringing up the ratings from people who did not officially review this product?
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This was a very well done addition to the MI series!  I would highly recommend it for any MI fans out there.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun game for killing time.  Its very simple but challenges your reflexes since the goal is speed. I like it.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is one of the best written TV series of all time.  It involves well-developed characters, and excellent plots, all  evolving in real life attorney/client situations.  It is so well written, that most of the &#34;bad guys&#34; are well portrayed, if not actually enjoyable.  The writers capture current events and current technology to further increase the quality of the series.<br /><br />The Good Wife, Season 3 compares well with House of Cards in the areas of exceptional character development, and exceptional plot development.
B001HC8516|5.0|3 people told me to read this book, it was exactly what I was experiencing.  I put it off 6 months.  Wish I would have listened, they were right.  Excellent read, and everytime I wonder I remember the book.
0064431789|5.0|Just as I remembered it from when I was a kid! I gave the book as a gift and hope they enjoy it as much as I did!
140006922X|1.0|Aslan is not a historian. He gives his opinion ( from a Muslim perspective) of Jesus.  None of the media interviews acknowledge this bias.  Religious propaganda.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|There was not much new here.  It was more contemporary, of course, but that's about it.  There are better remakes.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have been using this app for a couple years. No problems. Great interface and presentation. Informative. A best pick.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I always enjoy James Rollins' books and this one is no exception. I couldn't put it down.. I also am very fond of the characters in  his  books.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Kept me wanting for certain outcomes. I was never quite right in my guesses. I loved that and learned a lot.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|We love this around the holiday and the family watches it every year. I finally bought a copy instead of renting.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|everyone is complaining about the packaging.  I cut paper rings to make up spacer to protect the disks .same quality disks
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The best of show!  So many twist and turns. watched the whole season in a few days....looking forward to season 3
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Most time I've ever spent playing an app.  Along with multiple hours of awesome fun and excitement, the game<br />will keep your interest though out.<br />One thing. Code red freezes. Software people shoot me the update to fix it...
1401232590|5.0|Batman has always been my favourite superhero, but as a kid that was because of &#34;Batman the Animated Series&#34; rather than the comics. Now that I'm finally reading the comics, this graphic novel reinforced everything I loved about Batman as a kid.<br /><br />As much as I love the Nolan trilogy — and they explored on of my favourite aspects of Batman, namely that he's a modern ninja — they missed out on an even cooler aspect of Batman. He's more than a ninja or a vigilante; he's the greatest detective in the world. He's Sherlock Holmes with a mask and a cape. &#34;The Long Halloween&#34; explores this with a great, gritty murder mystery, pure and simple, but with a lineup of the Batman rogues I loved as a kid.<br /><br />I also love the relationship between Dent, Gordon and Wayne. Gordon too often comes off as an inept idiot who exists only to marvel at Batman's awesomeness — the Watson to Batman's Holmes. But in this novel and other greats like &#34;Batman: Year One,&#34; Gordon gets his dues. He's essentially Batman on the side of the law. He's as much a superhero as the Dark Knight.<br /><br />The artwork is also beautiful. Stylized, simplistic, dark. It creates a visual film noire look that perfectly suits the tone and plot of the story. I wish all comics looked this good.
B003BKF6AU|4.0|This vinyl edition is great. It is on 180 gm vinyl split onto two discs.  That generally works out to three songs per side. It's packaged in a gatefold embossed sleeve with the band name in silver foil. The inner sleeves have band photos. No lyric sheets. High quality vinyl edition overall.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Read this book after seeing the movie.  I really enjoyed the movie, and the book is just as good.  The characters and relationships were really well written.  You felt like you knew these people.  There was one major plot point that was very different from the movie...  personally I liked the way the movie handled it better.  I would characterize this as a romance novel, but not quite.  It's more about self-discovery and redemption - for both Pat and Tiffany.  Definitely recommend.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|It's a good show, not too slow and not too fast paced. Enjoyed watching it even though I didn't think I would.
B0001I562I|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and still love it as an adult. It holds up well, even in today's fast-paced CGI world. Just a cute, family fun movie to watch.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well-written, timely, and great for anyone who enjoys legal & courtroom drama - with plenty of twist and surprises in the plot! I really enjoyed this one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is one of the coolest games on anything and I think you can make it better if you can mine redstone or even craft like on pc
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Nice to read. Elegant, deep and beautiful.<br />I would recommend on the Shantaram which is superior to this (just my point of view)
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Love these actors! Can't wait to see the second. If you like comedy/action movies, this definitely fits the bill. :-)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Same style as A Thousand Splendid Suns written by Khaled Hosseini.<br />Personally I liked this book more. The other one teaches more about the culture and history of Afghanistan which make it worth reading.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This is a poorly written book with a plot line that is more pathetic than the characters. James Patterson on his worst day is Shakespeare compared to W.L.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is one of the more elegant, deep and intellectual stories I have ever read,<br />You learn about love, courage, the Indian culture, friendship and above all he human soul.<br />Highly recommend. I've read many books of this type. This by far is the best one.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I have had this for 6 months now and I really like its durability and that inside the front cover it has a really nice soft fleece like feel that keeps the screen clean and protected. The elastic strap is very useful and practical for keeping the case closed and keeping it open. I hook my stylus pen over it. It looks classy and feels really smooth. Easy to keep clean and most of all it protects the Kindle fairly well. I haven't dropped it that many times - still very durable - no cracks on the plastic corners or frays.<br />Over all an excellent product. I am going to get another color!
B00371XIJE|5.0|I cried through a good portion of this movie.  My sweet Charlie died 2 months ago at the ripe old age of 14 and I haven't let myself cry for him.  I had a good cry over Hachi and am now starting to search for my next canine companion.  Hachi's face was so expressive I swear he was talking to us.  This is a movie for any dog lover.  Even if you're not it's a good story.  Oh, and Jason Alexander was just snarky enough to make a great character.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|Nice movie - good family fun. Nice to know it was based on a true story.<br />Nice to know there are kind people out there.
B0026O475M|4.0|I've seen Cast Away a couple of times look forward towatching again.  Beyond the fact that Tom Hanks is terrific in it, the human stories told in it always impressed me.  Being utterly alone, creating a friend when you need one, love that simply doesn't work out despite the best intentions, the promise of a new day, life on life's terms.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|I downloaded by mistake. It looks colorful and kids probably love it. Its just not my thing. Im more into  Candy Crush which unfortunately you can't get on the Kindle Fire.
B006C1DH92|4.0|This game really challenges you to be fast and to not hit the bombs.  I like the cats comments when you are playing the game.
B0060D08JO|3.0|Interesting story line. I wished there was more of the original storyline. I didn't think the CGI of Jeff Bridges face was that good.<br />The score is fabulous and  really makes the movie. Overall I did like the special effects it but felt a little disappointing at the end.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I don't play this on the computer and I thought I was getting the game for my Kindle fire. Did not get what I expected.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|The Silver Linings Playbook kept me engaged throughout the story.  I found myself rooting for the main characters to succeed and cried at the end.  Happy tears of course!

B003QTSMXE|5.0|Have seen it quite a few times and really love it - the music and the story is great. Its amazing how entertained I was especially during the first 45 mins or so there is not much dialogue!<br />Great film and good story line.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|nice app for people who likes to use their brain.<br />challenges are not that difficult, but they keep you occupied for a while.
B009HELT3C|2.0|This was disappointing!! Love the first movie...hated the second. This was a little better than the second but there was just something missing.
140006922X|1.0|I watched an interview in which the author was presented as an objective, unbiased historian whose research had shed much new light on the life and times of Jesus.  It never came out during the interview that the author was a devout Muslim. The book is probably worthwhile if you have never heard the view of Jesus as seen through the eyes of a Muslim.  The book portrays Jesus in the same light as Muslims have been proclaiming since the time of Mohammed - that he was a prophet and a teacher, but not the savior of mankind as represented in the New Testament.  It is nothing but a re-statement of an old belief. It is certainly not a \\"fact\\" of history.  I respect the author's right to believe as he chooses.  However, I do not respect interviewers who knowingly lead listeners to believe that the statements by the author are historically accurate based upon incontrovertible research.  I marvel that Christianity spawned a western culture that enshrines God's gift of freedom, including the freedom to reject Christ as the savior of mankind.  I shudder to think of what might happen to a Christian writer who dared to write a book critical of Mohammed, and then discussed those beliefs with an interviewer on Al Jazeera.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Really like Chaplin movies (originals) so this was a nice surprise. RDJ did an amazing job as Chaplin - very enthralling storyline.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Installed without a hitch. I went ahead and installed some lok-tite on the threads even though this product does come with self locking nuts, just to be safe. This product, once installed, doesnt budge a single bit. A+ quality<br /><br />EDIT 8/15/2013<br />OK, I have placed a couple hundred miles using this item and have had zero issues with it holding my cell phone. very pleased.
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|I got this and then wondered why I got it. I do like star gazing etc. But this was just a needless app there are others out there that have more options.
B007N31XTY|4.0|I won't give a plot synopsis, this is a review of the product. The extra footage and footage quality of this Blu Ray is amazing! It is an instant classic that was done right by Peter, Jack, and Adrian and company. I could talk about this movie all day, what with the breakthrough CGI that really wasn't approached up to this level beforehand... but suffice it to say the Blu Ray does it justice, and the sound is amazing in my home theater.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Love this! I can access it from my PC, Andriod, laptop etc. It's great to be able to share things with friends and family.<br />Everyone should be using this!<br />A+++
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This movie is just plain CGI HARDCORE AWESOMENESS! 70'' LED 3D HDTV with 3,000 watts of surround sound is pure audio video mega-bliss. The case arrived broken so it wouldn't close, but Amazon promptly offered me a couple bucks back to cover it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Do not buy any more zombie or vampire stories.<br />Buy well conceived fantasy like Gaiman's &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane.&#34;<br />Wonderfully formed characters brought to life in a story that can't be copied or replicated like so much trash that people are settling for these days which are mere soap operas with dead or undead characters.<br />This is all that the reviews promised it would be and more.<br />My thanks to the author.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old app was great.  If it ain't broke don't fix it!  The new version is hard to navigate and difficult to read. I thought it was a matter of getting used to the new version but after several weeks I still hate it.  Bring back my app!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Some of these movies get so convoluted as they jump back and forth in time that they forget their way. This is a great example of that. Very hard to follow, and at some point I just gave up caring. One of Tom Hanks characters was speaking in some odd dialect that you could only catch about 1/2 of what was said and Halle Berry while as beautiful as always - had a very awkward character as well. The trailers look interesting and visually it's impressive, the story just falls flat. A big waste of some very talented actors.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|this book was great, kept me wanting to read it..i recommend this to anyone who luvs a great love story

B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Peter Pan and Disney is a winning combination. I only wish I was not starting all over collecting the Disney DVD's when I had all the VHS tapes already.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing Bingo Blitz since April 2013, and of all the other Bingo Ive tried,  this one is the best in my opinion.<br />The game platform is visually stunning, and the number of game rooms available will keep one playing for hours. It's totally addictive!<br /><br />And whenever I've experienced issues with purchased credits, the app support team has resolved my problems in a timely manner.  Customer service is so important and that's not always available in the online game world. Let yourself play, you won't be dissappointed.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I watched it when it came out originally and didn't care for it. I watched the Avengers and then rewatched this on Amazon. I really liked it the second time and understood it much better. I never followed the Thor comic book, so the story was brand new. After the second viewing, I changed my opinion.
B00867GK26|5.0|I bought this movie for a friend who had been looking for a copy and really appreciated getting it from me.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great read! Author knows what he's talking about. :) I recommended it to most if not all of my friends.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This book is simply the author's opinion on the life and times of Jesus. The author is a devout Muslim and his viewpoints are colored by his religion. His views are those that have been expressed by Muslims for centuries. Anyone claiming this to be a historical book is wrong. The author admonishes us to ignore Mark's Gospel because it was written 40 years after the death of Christ but he then wants us to believe what he has written over 2000 years after the death of Christ. The book is not worthy to be read by anyone other than those who already endorse the Muslim religion.
006114665X|5.0|For years I've been trying to figure out what The Great War was about. Certainly not as clear as ww2. No obvious villains. No Hitler or Mussolini or final solutions. Clark has come as close to enlightening me as anything I've read so far. Clark describes Serbian irredentism as the tinder box that set it all in motion, and if one remembers Serb actions in the 1990s, this seems credible. I had always read that the Austro Hungarian demands against Serbia were unreasonable. Clark argues that given the specifics of the  Serbian character, the demands were not that unreasonable since Serbia could not be relied to make a real effort on its own to investigate the assassination and that there was a high likelihood the Serb Plasic government had played a major role in the planning and executions of the assassination.<br />Although the book is already a doorstop, (lot of material to cover)I would have liked Clark to have examined French politics of the time help us get a better handle on Poincare's apparent enthusiasm for war. I read elsewhere that when war was declared, the Parisians were on Champs Elysee shouting \\"A Berlin\\". Was there an anti German prejudice in Britain that some how came in to play into pushing the British into the War. What about the other countries. The Italians, Romanians, Turks etc.<br /><br />And yet, one wonders, if there had not been an assassination, would a war have happened anyway. The underlying tensions were all there. The French still smarting over the 1870 war and loss of Alsace Lorraine. Their anxiety about an evermore powerful Germany. Germany in turn worrying about an ever more powerful Russia. Mobilization timetables. Colonial appetites. The needs to firm up alliances. The Balkan power struggles. Anti German feeling in England.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|An incredible Sherlock missed it when broadcast and was so pleased to be able to buy the DVD I plan to watch it over and over
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Lavish period piece that truly transforms the viewer to another world.  Great characters that evolve as the series moves along.  Wonderful, witty, incisive writing.  Very talented cast that is pure fun to watch.  Filled with surprises that are character driven, not obligatory or conveniently sensationalistic.  Very beautifully filmed.  Can't wait for next season!!
B004132HZS|5.0|An incredible Sherlock the update was fantastic, missed it when broadcast and was so pleased to be able to buy the DVD I plan to watch it over and over
B008QTV3X0|1.0|great subject  - terrorism.  Demonstrates some evenhandedness by expressing culpability on both sides.  However, a good subject doesn't necessarily make a good series.  The writing is not very interesting, the characters are two dimensional & at times it tries too hard to tug at the heartstrings and comes off trite and corny..  altogether I find it annoying, humorless and essentially uninteresting.  Why is it that Mandy Patinkin has taken to whispering some of his lines?<br /><br />OK - just saw the last three episodes when the bi-polar symptoms come into play - Claire Danes is amazing - the writing became interesting  - suddenly it's not so bad.  Hmmm<br /><br />Will give season 2 a shot

0770437400|5.0|This sci-fi thriller of a zombie infestation of Earth and the results of the war against it is a great read. It is told as an oral history through the eyes of numerous survivors. If you passed this one by because you saw the movie, you might want to give the book a try because it has little in common with the flick.

B003XF1OK4|5.0|When I first read The Hours many years ago, I was impressed with how Michael Cunningham weaves together stories of three women of three different generations and a man who is son to one, dear friend to another, and literary progeny of the third. I've always been intrigued by writing that shifts perspective (my first encounter with this was in Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet). Now there are many books that devote alternate chapters to different characters, but that was not common when The Hours was written, nor in my opinion has any other writer so successfully echoed key phrases and experiences among all the characters.<br /><br />During April 2013, I was among 85 poets who each wrote a found poem a day from one the 85 Pulitzer Prize-winning works of fiction for Pulitzer Remix, a National Poetry Month initiative sponsored by the Found Poetry Review. My source was The Hours and I spent a delicious month reveling in Cunningham's poetic language. Poems here if interested: [...]

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I never was big on these games on any of my devices but since I was persuaded by a friend to just try it once, I have been stuck ever since! Extremely addicting, but a lot of fun! I do wish that on that first run they helped you get the moves figured out more than just once! For a new \\"gamer\\" like myself, some of it can be quite challenging and often frustrating!
B002XXPNXG|5.0|This movie continues were Before Sunrise left off, but nine years later. The same snappy dialog and endless walking this time the streets and allys of Paris. You can't help relate to this couple as we've all had or wish we had that relationship that started with a magical night and went astray. Leaving you with that wondering what if and what now. I just watched these first two movies after seeing this years Before Midnight were the story continues you guess it nine years later and still as good. Can't wait till the next one.

B005QYKE2Y|5.0|This movie was the best of the trilogy. Most movies get weaker as the saga continues but with Dark of the Moon it was the best thus far. You never know what is going to happen next and you are always on your toes. It's a movie that you would repeat because there is something you probably didn't catch the first time. Love, Love, Love!
B002KS1IJC|5.0|I love this and have watched it many times on DVD and on my Ipad, the story keeps you interested the entire time you are watching
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I wasn't really sure what this was, when I first started reading it. I loved that it's set in Oregon (I live in Washington so I know about the weather!).  I was intrigued and drawn into the story almost immediately.  I was crying at the end of the story, and I really wanted it to go on!  I have to admit, it reminded me of &#34;Before I Fall&#34; by Lauren Oliver, even though the premise is different.  I really liked that book and this one was on par to that one.  A great story, and even a tear jerker in some places!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked the book.  There is a bit of suspension of disbelief needed to really enjoy it fully because I keep thinking as I'm reading that these are high school kids and this is a lot of drama for young people to go through.  It is also such an unbelievable coincidence that the main characters happened to move to a different state and live in the same city within minutes of each other...  That being said, it is a book of fiction and I like to escape my own reality, but prefer to escape to somewhere a little less dark than where this book lead me.  I'm starting to realize that Colleen Hoover likes to write about kids going through very grown up and difficult situations.  I've been on board up until now, I'm not sure if that is my cup of tea going forward.  All-in-all, the book was well written and I don't regret reading it, just would prefer something a little less dark, I guess.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This novel is very pertinent to our society at this time. It does make one consider all sides of some important issues. Everyone can relate to at least one character is this book.

B00499NHLC|5.0|Really good writing along with very well done production values and throw in some characters that have admirable qualities along with just enough flaws that they seem real. If you like a good detective story with well thought out twists and turns then I'd like to recommend this BBC production. My family and I are fully caught up with this show and now have to wait until next year before we can enjoy the next season. Can't wait!
0440245915|3.0|The 20th Anniversary version of `A Time to Kill' includes bonus material - nothing fancy, just a three page introduction from Grisham and a two-page Reader's Guide that contains twelve open-ended questions for discussion suitable for a book club or discussion group.  When John Grisham first released `A Time to Kill' in 1989, his publisher printed 5000 copies and `we couldn't give them away.'  Much in the way that Dan Brown found interest soared in his first three books after the runaway success of [[ASIN:B000FA675C Da Vinci Code]], Grisham had renewed interest in his first novel after his legal thrillers captured the public's fancy.<br /><br />Grisham expected to write a series of Ford County novels, with stories based on the characters introduced in this novel.  Poor sales of his first novel and the success of his legal thrillers caused Grisham to change his plans. Grisham did write [[ASIN:044024157X The Last Juror]] in 2004, a novel that is based in Ford County during the 1970s, and [[ASIN:0385503822 The Summons]] in 2002, a novel with various Ford County settings including the Atlee home in Clanton.  [[ASIN:0440220602 The Chamber]] in 1994 has scenes in Ford County, though the bulk of that story occurs elsewhere.  Grisham released this 20th Anniversary version of `A Time to Kill' to coincide with  [[ASIN:0553386816 Ford County: Stories]], a collection of short stories that Grisham published in 2009.  The best reason to read A Time to Kill is to set up the main characters of [[ASIN:0385537131 Sycamore Row]], a sequel to Grisham's first novel.<br /><br />While I am a fan of Grisham's legal novels, reading his first novel was more like killing time than enjoying A Time to Kill.  Three times early in the story the disbarment is mentioned, as if it is some state secret, until we meet Lucien Wilbanks and his history is explained. Three was also the unlucky number of times that we read about Carla's almost perfect legs.  Had she not stayed with her parents in North Carolina for the second half of the novel, we might have heard about them again.<br /><br />Did Jake Brigance have a fight with his wife and have an affair with his new legal assistant, the comely Ellen Row-Ark?  I'm not going to spoil the story, except to say that it is a secondary part of the plot.  It will be interesting to see in the new novel if Brigance is still married to the almost-perfect legs, and whether Roark is still in Clanton.  Maverick lawyers Harry Rex Vonner and Lucien Wilbanks also have major roles in the sequel.<br /><br />The main story is Brigance's defense of a father who killed the two men who raped his daughter, leaving ten year old Tonya sterile and psychologically confused.  Grisham's first novel has a heavy theme of race, involving not just the people of trial but the Ku Klux Klan, the NAACP, and even all of Ford County.  Today, Southerners would like to forget the promises of `massive resistance' against integration after the ruling of Brown versus the Topeka Board of Education in 1954.  Actually, the days of civil rights being only a Southern issue were shattered in the second wave of civil rights demonstrations, from the late 1960s into the early 1970s.  Chicago, New York City, and Boston were the sites of significant civil rights demonstrations during that second wave.<br /><br />Jury selection and the M'Naghten case are the two legal principles introduced in this novel.  M'Naghten was on trial for the murder of a British civil servant.  His lawyers were the first to use the legal defense of temporary insanity.  A few years later, the Civil War general Dan Sickles became the first American to use the defense of temporary insanity in the United States.  Sickles killed the son of Francis Scott Key - a man named Philip Barton Key II.  A lawyer argued that Sickles was temporarily insane after learning that Mrs. Teresa Sickles had the affair with Key.<br /><br />Brigance offered the argument of temporary insanity as a plausible excuse for thejury to acquit Carl Lee Hailey, the father of ten-year old Tonya.  Other sidebars that add suspense to the story are the rivalry between Brigance and the prosecuting attorney, the threats against some members of the defense team, and the reaction of Ford County to the `trial of the decade.'<br /><br />Grisham's novels usually have a long list of characters, but in his first novel that list is particularly large.  There are too many disposable characters in the novel.<br /><br />My interest in this story had more to do with obtaining a better portrait for some of the characters in this novel that appeared in Grisham's other novels.

B0015T6G2G|4.0|Went looking for this after encountering the CBC's synthesis of the 50 hours of tapes recorded by Nelson Mandela before writing the book broadcast on Ideas. As in public life so in his own private biography Madiba is self-effacing, candid about his own short-comings, loyal to his supporters over the years. As the story continues we meet many of the people who would be active in the African National Congress in the future and his partners seeking freedom for Africans in South Africa.<br /><br />At 658 pages in paper binding this is no light read but Mandela's writing style is engaging and serves to carry one along. We see his growth from a rural tribal background to life in a tribal chief's home. His friendship with his adopted brother, their mutual escape from their home to Johannesburg where Mandela begins his struggle to become a lawyer, copes with being an African among whites, and becomes politically aware. Any great man makes it to the top on the backs of others; it is good to see this man remember and acknowledge those who helped him reach that pinnacle.<br /><br />By page 150 or part 3 we have reached Mandela's political awakening and the beginnings of his involvement with the African National Congress, the ANC. Mandela expresses his own reluctance to get actively involved in politics and the advice of his legal mentors to stay out of it. His writing style somehow reflects that reluctance as at this point the book becomes clinical and less engaging.<br /><br />Things pick up as we enter the middle section of the book. His political internship over he swings into gear as an orgnaizer and speaker. The screws of apartheid are tightened on Black South Africans and on those who would oppose it. It would seem the authorities were smart enough to realize that actually killing leaders would create martyrs so they `ban' them restricting their ability to travel and attend meetings. Over 150 ANC members are rounded up and their trial for treason takes years to unfold. Mandela's first marriage breaks down and he meets Winnie. Interestingly a man who promoted non-violent resistance practiced boxing as a means of blowing off steam and keeping fit.<br /><br />The print version of this book obviously has dense text, after reading for hours one makes little headway percentage-wise in e-Book format, I note it is printed in two volumes in PB. Mandela goes on the lam to promote the militant wing of the ANC. Even before prison he suffered long periods of separation from his family. It is when he goes abroad in Africa that he learns that it is not enough to have good intentions, the perception of others is equally important. The competing PAC, Pan African Congress, are winning the publicity war because South Africa's Black neighbours are suspicious of the ANC's association with Whites, Coloureds, Indians, and the Communist Party. On the other hand a freedom fighter takes aid from whatever port he can obtain it and some of his neighbours are despots, they just happen to be Black despots. It is interesting to see how he describes these people.<br /><br />Mandela is finally caught and imprisoned for 27 years or 10,000 days as the song goes. On Robben Island in solitary confinement, under hard labour, and in the company of fellow political prisoners he suffers isolation from the outside world and limited visits with family. Finally he is brought back to the mainland where a damp prison cell leads to tuberculosis. Finally he is released to less confined locations and allowed contact with his family and supporters and begins his negotiations with the White Apartheid Government of South Africa. However calculated or humane this process was when he is finally released the press of his cheering supporters scares even his military prison driver.<br /><br />With the start of negotiations traditional tribal rivalries come back into play and in particular the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party it is suspected supported by White Minority Police stage attacks on ANC townships. Mandela finally acknowledges the breakdown of his marriage to Winnie. While struggling to reach a consensus within his own party Mandela faces the divide and conquer tactics of the DeKlerk Government. Oliver Tambo dies of stroke and Chris Hani is murdered.<br /><br />After all that reading the story seems to come to a rather rapid ending with Mandela's election as president. After some reminiscence the book ends without covering his period as president. I had been hoping to discover if there was any veracity to the storyline followed in Clint Eastwood's Invictus.NC townships. Mandela finally acknowledges the breakdown of his marriage to Winnie.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Didn't want to put it down.  It wasn't just about the mission that killed UBL but about the makings of a Seal - how they sacrifice and it makes you realize it wasn't just a day but decades that made this mission a success.  We all owe this brave group of people more than we will ever  know.  Thanks so much for sharing.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I know he will always get out of any bind he is placed in. I also know that the things he uses to get out of those binds are truly improbable, yet it doesn't stop be from being on the edge of my seat wondering how he will use his pocket knife, tape and paper clip and water to get out of it-smile.<br /><br />Love, love, love Mac!
B009MO5E10|5.0|If you like bikes, even if you don't like bikes this is a great movie.  A quiet little sleeper at the box office that critics and audiences loved.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt nails the role of a bike messenger who is carrying a much sought after parcel.  Michael Shannon (Man of Steel) plays the best bad guy we have seen in a long time.  We have not seen the last of him in the movies!  See this, really.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I was pleased by this purchase. However, it'd be pretty onesided if I didn't point out its pros and cons, right?<br />CONS<br />First off, the graphics quality isn't as good as other games, like minecraft's.When I say that, I am referring to the texture quality. The textures don't quite render right, and thus the world looks gridded and inorganic. The world generator is slightly flawed as well, mainly in the area of water (literally AND metaphorically). Beyond that, the worst thing is the noticeable framerate hiccups (On my kindle fire 1st generation, but I don't know about other tablets) There are also a few typos, but that's a minor issue and therefore of little importance.<br />PROS<br />The gameplay is fantastic, with well played out rpg elements, questing, and a simple crafting system. There are a wide variety of swords and sword-like stabbing devices, too. Beyond that, there's a considerable emphasis on adventure as well, with the vehicles a player could use to dominate land, air and sea that can be crafted in survival. Another thing I'm fond of is that your inventory is universal in all your survival worlds. So with that, I usually have a world just for mining. As for controls, they're ok. Not the worst but not the best.<br />CONCLUSION<br />If you don't mind a couple of bugs in the world, some typos and the occasional lag, then I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a minecraft style RPG. It's fun, and I would say it's worth the 2$ I got it for.
B006LSZECO|4.0|They ending was very disappointing.  I felt angry and sad at the same time.  Guess I am a sucker for a tidy conclusion.  Would however like to read a sequel to see how the author would develop the characters.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|One of the best books I'v read, also the sequel is pretty good... can't wait for the third one :)
B004TI5N38|4.0|I like this author.  Have read probably everything he has written.  I would recommend this authors works and this book to everyone who enjoys mysteries.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|An excellent mystery - with some great insights into the lives of people far outside the confines of Norway.  The tales of the Australian natives are fascinating.
B007SGM084|3.0|Never thought I would be saying this but with each sexual part I became less and less interested.  The actual story could have been told in one book.  Found myself thinking enough already just keep on with the story and forget about the sex.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I loved Hootie and the blowfish, but Darius is SO awesome as a country artist. This alb beautifully shows off that deep, melodious, clear voice. I have listen to it over and over.  Love \\"Wagon Wheel\\". A must buy for your country collection'
B000FA5STS|4.0|Wow! David Baldacci's ability to weave a complex plot populated by fascinating characters is truly genius, but then, that's well documented, isn't it.  What I felt as I worked my way through this complex story is wonder.  I wondered how he could ever pull this together at the end.  There were SO many twists and turns that I just leaned back and enjoyed the ride.  Trying to 'solve' the case myself simply wasn't an option, so I simply rooted for the heroes as if they were friends trying to do the impossible.  Thank you, David, for the passion you have and the skills you employ to entertain and educate us!
B000FC146C|5.0|The story is engaging, the writing is terrific. You get swept into the lives of these characters and you can't put the book (kindle) down! This is a story you and re read many times...gets better each time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i think this game is interesting and it keeps me on my toes. i like that i have to think in order to get to the next level. this game uses brain power and i enjoy that.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Absolutely loved this story! Everyone should read it. Was sad but also very inspiring. Mitch Albom did a great job with this story as well as some of his other books. Have not read all of his books yet but I fully intend to.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love English history.  This is very well done. Hate to miss any of it so I got all three seasons.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and so much fun. I cant wait for updates. While you are playing be patient! Come back and keep on playing and you will complete the level eventually.  I'm afraid that I won't patient while waiting for updates with more levels.  Please hurry!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is absolutely adorable. my 5 year old and I love the movies and this game is fun for all ages! cheers!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has more action than the previous two seasons.  It is still realistic and viewers can definitely relate and picture themselves in the situation.  Cannot wait for Season 4, it's a family event for me.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I turned this off  within the first 2 minutes. Very gory and disgusting.  This movie has absolutely no redeeming value
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this series- so rich, such depth, so full of life! Reading it transports me to this make believe era. So well written you feel you're there. Thank God Game of Thrones is being done so well. I'm sure the series will entice many others to read the book series. A masterpiece!
B002GORUF6|2.0|It wasn't the movie so much as the streaming.  The movie took 45 minutes longer than necessary.  When I first began using Amazon movies, they streamed with little hesitation, but now watching an Amazon movie is worse than having commercials.  I had hoped movies would be a big plus with Amazon Prime.  I'm very disappointed.
B002ZG981E|5.0|got it in perfect condition... show it to friends and family and it is always entertaining...it's still fantastic to watch
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|At last I finally discovered another writer who enthralls me as much as Laurell K Hamilton. And even better, she is from my beautiful (but tiny) country. I think I prefer her angels series but the psi changling world caught my heart as well. Loved the book
B002QY9RMA|5.0|I f you like Sasha Fierce you'll love this DVD for sure, one of her best... good quality and sound. It arrived in perfect condition and shipped well packed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A steamy hot novella sized love story with a powerful alpha male. Can't wait for next book. Go out and buy.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I f you like Taylor Swift you'll love this DVD for sure, one of her best... good quality and sound. It arrived in perfect condition and shipped well packed...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Amazing story to read. I read this after Kyle's death and that puts a different perspective into your reading. A must read for everyone.
B007AFBYYY|5.0|Love it... good movie, great scenery,  good story,  nice cinematography,  rented it several times years ago.. and finally it became available on dvd at amazon.. of course I had to buy it.. worth the money for a climber or hiker.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|It's a great series.  I can't wait for the next season when it comes out.  I would definitely buy the next season.
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|I have since I was a kid(born in 1984). I Will Not Get Old Of This Movie. The Rock Is Great In This Movie, Road Block Has Always Been My Favorite Next To Snake Eyes.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is really fun. Can play for hours. Just one draw back and that is you do not earn a lot money , it takes awhile to build up coins and Jems ,but you need a lot to feed and buy things for the horse. But otherwise great
B007HO392S|5.0|This was a gift for our granddaughter. SHE NEEDED THIS BOOK TO COMPLETE THE SERIES. And was she ever surprised,she loved it.
B001XUH69Y|4.0|I've known about Humphrey Bogart most of my life.  I'm a big fan of the old school movies and actors such as Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, and Audrey Hepburn.  This is an great example of how acting with no special affects and no flashy camera ticks are need to tell a good story.  I would recommend anyone who hasn't seen thic classic movie to take the time and check it out.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|Well directed story of probably the greatest race horse of the 20th century.  Historically accurate and enjoyable to watch.  Worth adding to your movie collection.
0875428940|5.0|This deck is more than just a Tarot Deck, these cards are each individual artworks that could easily stand on their own. Wood has a penchant for drawing beautiful imagery that match the various cards and accentuate their images and meanings. Based largely off the Rider Waite deck, Wood incorporates the traditional elements in each major and minor arcana card while giving them a more realistic quality that the Rider Waite deck falls short on. The Wood deck is very inspiring and resonates with readers and clients alike.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I really love this game, the puzzles are fun, and it gives you the option of having the available tiles highlighted or not. Highly recommend!!
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|While A Star is Born and the Funny Girl/Lady movies are her hallmarks, Mirror is one that has more of a personal appeal to women as it addresses the misnomers of appearance and outer versus inner beauty. The acceptence of both within is of higher importance and the ability to rise above the conventional ideas of sex, beauty and romance all come together in this film. However, males be warned is the uber chick flick, men can also learn a thing or two about their potential influence on the women in their lives and how their judgments and/or criticisms can be so damning and upsetting for females. It is already bad enough we are critical of ourselves, add the males' negative opines and then you have a real mess.<br /><br />Wile her makeover merely shed baggy clothing and cut/lightened her hair, the Sandy moment from Grease at the carnival was priceless and it is obvious that Streisand has seen that seen a few too many times as her actions were verbatim what Newton-John did in that finale. Which did lend the 'cheese' factor.<br /><br />All in all the morals are there and on target. You can't miss them as they smack in the face but well worth noting.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Absolutely loved it! I definitely recommend this whole series. Cassandra Clare really brings the characters to life.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good book with lots of twists and turns and Iiked how it was written from both the husband and wife's perspective. I expect a different ending though
B00000J2PH|5.0|Few albums are as well done as Carole King's Tapestry.  We all know the lyrics to these songs because they speak to us.
B000I9W08I|5.0|What can I say.  This is one of the greatest musicals of all time. There is no need<br /> To say anything more.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game really enjoy playing this game, and the best thing about is you can literally play with your friends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game.  My eight and five years old enjoy it.  However,  I am enjoying it more than them.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Sometimes I can't stop myself from going back to this game. It's easy to play and entertaining. Sometimes things I buy disappear at other times it almost seems I'm getting reimbursed for the loss with a new collection of coins and added items it leaves in your (I think it was called) stash.
140006922X|5.0|I'd loved Aslan's award-winning history of Islam, \\"No God but god\\", so had high hopes for this book as well. It delivered and then some.<br /><br />Make no mistake: this book is first and foremost a carefully researched history, written by a widely respected scholar. I am not a believer or a religious person myself but I do love an informative history lesson and a good story, both of which are contained in \\"Zealot.\\" Aslan treats the historical Jesus as less an object of faith - although he certainly acknowledges this - and more the product of the complex, turbulent politics of the 1st-century, Roman-occupied levantine region we today call Israel.<br /><br />This is a story assiduously told by one of the few scholars whom you can trust to both do it justice and to tell it well. Engrossing as well as informative, suited for students of history and the religious faithful alike.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Aslan has been targeted by a far-right hate group that believes he should not be permitted to write about Jesus and has, among other things, flooded the reviews section here with one-star comments in an effort hurt sales. This is, unfortunately, quite common with histories of the historical Jesus, which seem to offend some ultra-religious Christians who see any scholarly study of Jesus as somehow anti-religious. In fact, the book is a delight for those who want to learn more about the political roots of their faith. I'd advise you to ignore them.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|All the songs are catchy, hard and have good lyrics, and they are most certainly Alice in Chains songs.  But it almost makes you miss Layne Staley all over again because you want to hear what they would be like if he were stll the frontman. Nothing against DuVall...it is what it is.  I gave it 5 because it is as good as it can be...and it's in steady rotation for me.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Action.  Adventure. Fantasy.  Mystery. Romance.  This book has it all!  Not to mention killer plots and well-developed characters.  Love it!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Enjoying this show which I never got to watch when it aired.  Good performances, hard to shut it off!!  Looking forward to more.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Easy to use. I like to track my device usage. I'm  very satisfied with this ap.The end and thank you.
0618918248|4.0|As a rather new agnostic, I found his ideas and philosophy made excellent sense.  As a logical thinker it appealed to me as a<br />distrinct contrast with religious &#34;believers&#34; who continually try to convince others by reasoning.  Great writer.
B0093SK2MQ|5.0|Normally I can't stand watching anything that's more than 5 years old.  I just don't have the attention for it.  Movies are just so much better now.  Charmed is one of the few exceptions.  It doesn't seem old.  The stories are fun and I enjoy re-watching these episodes with my kids.  We all love Chris!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This a gud game for all ages if u love village games this is a game for u .....me and fam love this game. Ugh I am bk with a update I am starting not to  like it this game is to expensive u gotta pay to play games,gems,coins, and on top of that I can't earn no hearts it should have away u can visit random villages... Also u never earn enough of nothing because everything's to high including removing roots and rocks smh........
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product. Enables casting videos from chrome including from the websites that do not (and likely never will) have an app for more traditional streaming devices.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|What's not to love about Finding Nemo!?!  Beautifully crafted animation.  This movie is great for all ages and has many teaching moments in it... for all of us.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Always curious about Lincoln--Movie is mostly about his push to abolish slavery. Good movie for history buffs-and interesting to see how politics hasn't changed all that much!
B000J025AE|5.0|This movie was great.  Most remakes seem to be a bit cheesy and are a let down after seeing the original, but this one holds its own against the past stabs at a remake.  Special effects are up there with the best.
140006922X|1.0|Nothing new in this book that uses traditionally held Muslim mythology to cast doubt on \\"Christian Mythology.\\" If you believed the fictional writings of the Da Vinci Code this will be an enjoyable read.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book but was somewhat disappointed.  There were just too many characters to follow and just as I was really getting into a character's personality, the author switched to another's story.  Somewhat frustrating.  Tracing the lives of the brother and sister alone would have been great...wanted more.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The book was a sad but then thrilling to read book. This was originally a summer reading book but then I got really into it. I highly recommend this book
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Story was interesting..character were not well developed.it in Grisham style was a page turner! Early on it held my interest but after half way through it lost my interest ! It was unrealistic.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game.  The only problem I have with it is sometimes it locks up while loading on my Kindle.  That being said I still play it a little while everyday.  It is so cute and fun!
0425263924|5.0|I loved this one. Absolutely couldn't wait for it to come out and couldnt put it down once I started reading.Can't wait for the next one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I play it a lot it is a really great game and I suggest this game to everyone
B009C7ZQM4|2.0|i donnot think it is useful. I find no difference between before and after clean caches or i dont know how to use it?!
B0086700CM|5.0|Just when you think you have the hang of it...you don't. Hours of entertainment for both adults and kids.  Great app for all.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|So good I couldn't put it down. Left me begging for the next book in the series. So sinical and dark.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much better then Subway Surfer , and Temple Run. I LOVE IT PLAY THE GAME AND RATE IT
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Our daughter, 5,  and niece, 3, love Sofia the First.  The show has Great lessons for all children of all ages.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I hate a different alarm clock app and exuse my language but it sucked. It would just play classical music to wake me up. I love this app because you can set it to a playlist so it will play your own music from your phone. Absolutely love this app and it was free also definitely recommend it 100 %
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just recently, I started watching more of the Masterpiece offerings on PBS.  This is the first one that I have seen through.<br /><br />The presentation is so well done that I forgot the fact that there was the British accent to consider.  Previously, it was difficult following because of the heavy accent and I had to strain to decipher what they were saying.  This was not the case with Downton Abbey.<br /><br />The story was well written without being overpowering.  The various facets of each character enhanced the story line.  They were more than one dimensional vehicles to carry out the &#34;plot.&#34;  Facial expressions and nuances of actions told a lot about the character him/herself.<br /><br />I was more than pleased and have been watching more of these presentations.<br /><br />This is the first thing I have watched on the Kindle Fire and was disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the graphic in the game the games looks wonderful and is very fun to play better then temple run in my opinion but gives it a 4 stars because I had to press menus every time I die to restart the level.
B007BLUD30|3.0|This movie was Ok. It had it's funny moments. A good cast that could have made for a better movie, but was worth watching On Demand.
B0031RS42K|4.0|As a fan of Dan Brown this was the one I had yet to read. No regrets as a great story with many twists and turns.
B00CXQL828|5.0|One of the best cds to come out in a LONG time!  I expected a technically impressive performance from each of the guys, but was blown away by the quality of the songs and how catchy they are.  And Richie's voice sounds incredible and at times sounds like one of the greatest rock vocalists of all time, Chris Cornell.  There's no way someone can buy this and be disappointed.  It's got incredible chops, great vocals and catchy songs.  It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a cd this much after just one listen.  It's been playing non-stop since.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game it is so fun thumbs up to the creators also I love the characters and their looks great game
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Doom & Destiny is an excellent old school JRPG. It's full of charm, personality and most of all humor. If you're like me and like old school jrpg's like final fantasy then you'll definitely find something to like about Doom & Destiny. So stop reading reviews and go buy it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Great acting, great story. I've watched it 4 times already. Great Parisian scenery too if you're American. Have to watch it at least twice.
B000I9UA8A|5.0|Classic ... Just love it ... Can watch it again & again !!  A must see ... They don't make them like this anymore !!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|100 times better than the book. Should say &#34;based on...&#34; Acting is great. The film is truly exotic, bringing the sights and sounds of India to your home. You can almost smell the curry!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!I love this game its just like the movie! the only thing bad thing is its slow
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This story is set in a society which is vastly different than my own, but due to the characters who are rich with flaws and emotion, their world is feels truely close to home. At its core, this is a story of a family who struggles against their own expectations in a rapidly changing country. I enjoyed every moment of the book asI traveled from generation to generation.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very nice, loads fast, changes a lot of thing every time you play so it keeps entertaining, very lovable characters, really funny and colorful
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you are looking for a moving story that keeps you on the edge of your seat, READ THIS BOOK!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was a fun challenge and different from the usual game downloads. I would definitely try more levels if they become available.

B00DU74U74|4.0|Loved this movie! Some parts were a little slow but overall very good story line and acting. Entertaining and inspirational.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed the first thee books, however i'm so mad that I had to wait for the last book.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Review originally posted here: [...]<br /><br />The Commencement: I've heard a lot about Graceling, but I only read it now and I really loved it. It was simply amazing. I've been holding onto my copy for weeks or months now because I didn't have a copy of Bitterblue yet. I find it hard to wait for books of a series so I like completing them first. Well, I still don't have Bitterblue because my local bookstore does not have a copy of the cover I want. However, I was running out of books I haven't read yet (although I just stocked up recently) so I decided to just read it and figure out how to read Bitterblue some other time. And wow, was I in for a big surprise.<br /><br />The Cover: The Graceling Realm series has two kinds of covers for the english versions, as far as I know anyway. The first one was not so eye-catching to me so I never really bothered with it. What can I say, I like pretty things. But then I saw this cover at the bookstore, and I simply HAD to have it. It is just gorgeous! I bought this along with the second book of the series. It would have been nicer though if they showcased her supposedly really beautiful eyes, but that's just me. I still love this cover either way.<br /><br />The Composition: It was simply riveting. I think that this book was gracefully written. (pardon the pun) The humor and dialogue really worked for me. The synopsis does not even begin to describe how good this book is. I would not have let go of this book if I didn't need to do other things to the point that it got me distracted from some of my responsibilities. The story was set in a place with seven kingdoms where a selected few were gifted with abilities. Each kingdom reacted differently towards the Graced, and I think it shows a lot about how people have their own perceptions. The storyline just kept me holding on. I had to keep on knowing what happens next and what happens to the other characters. There were a lot of twists and turns in the story that I did not expect to happen. Most of all, the ending was quite satisfying. It doesn't feel like there are other books to the story though, but I liked it anyway. This is one amazing debut novel.<br /><br />The Characters:<br /><br />In Graceling, we have another strong female protagonist. Katsa, the main character, is feared by many because of her Grace, but she soon figures out that there is more to her gifts, and that she can use it to help others. She struggles with finding herself, but becomes more than anyone could expect her to be. Despite being strong and brave, we still find a loving and playful character that will truly engage you.<br /><br />And then we have Greening Grandemalion, aka Po. I really cannot get over how silly his name is. When he revealed his nickname, I had to pause for a minute to just laugh. But there is so much more to him than his name. Because he is Graced, he is able to understand and support Katsa better. He is a great prince and loved by many. Oh, and he's pretty and he knows it.<br /><br />One of my favorite side-characters is the sweet, smart and caring cousin, Raffin, who is funny, too. I also liked Helda, the handmaid, who took care of Katsa like a mother/sister/girlfriend, although she didn't really show much in the book. I think that most, if not all, of the characters enhanced the story, conflicts, and emotions. I easily connected with the characters. It also helped a lot that they were all amusing.<br /><br />The Couple: Katsa and Po are such an ADORABLE pairing. I like how their relationship progressed along the way, figuring each other out and understanding each other. I loved their own personal moments. I don't really want to say more about this so that you can fall in love with it for yourself. Well, I did anyway.<br /><br />The Charm: I personally think that everything about this book was simply wonderful - from the intriguing beginning to the (i-do-not-have-enough-words-to-describe) development until the much-awaited ending. All the elements in play just worked for me. My favorite part is in Chapter 17, the 2nd part (for my copy it's page 147). I won't really tell you what happens, but I just loved it! Highly entertaining.<br /><br />The Conclusion: If you want to laugh, cry, and fall in love, then this is the perfect book for you. It even has a lot of action to boot. Set in a new world of fantasy, with a whole cast of interesting characters, Graceling is a force to be reckoned with.ents in play just worked for me. My favorite part is in Chapter 17, the 2nd part (for my copy it's page 147). I won't really tell you what happens, but I just loved it!

B001N3GUIE|4.0|This favorite film for Sci-Fi fans and Baby boomers in particular, who would have known this movie from the 1950's explosion of out of this world flying saucer invasions, and exploring outside our own planet themed stories...will love this one...nicely done all way round...great cast of some very well known actors of the period. Top notch monster nemesis vs. humans...the great looking Anne Francis as the &#34;Girl&#34; who got a lot of attention from the crew of United Space Cruiser...with Leslie Nilson as commander...the set building and use of sound effects were all very skillfully applied...this is a top ten pick for 50's vintage sci-fi....&#34;Monsters from the ID&#34; ! You'll love it folks !
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I was shocked at the ending as I just love the chemistry between the two of them.  Such happiness and sorrow at the same time!!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|It still crashes immediately upon opening on my all fine fine 7 android ver 4.1.1<br />Please also link to an earlier unimproved version
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I would give no stars on this one.  It is written by a Muslim.  Does that give me the OK to write a book about Muhammad?  Sure if I want a price on my head.  This is a blatant attack against Christians and our belief systems.  This book should be on the dust heap.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have been using this for a couple weeks now. I have a T989 GS2 phone with a 2000mha battery.  It will charge my phone full 3 times, or I can keep it plugged into my phone as I play ingress.  It does not get hot at all, nor does it make the battery on the phone hot if it is just sitting and charging without the phone being use.<br /><br />It is also possible to carry this in the same hand as my phone.  I can one hand both devices without a problem.<br /><br />I am very happy with the purchase.
B00BJW6YW6|5.0|A supremely listenable album.  One of my new favorites to chill out.  For music comparisons, i would group this with Iron & Wine or Bon Iver but obviously, this has it's own wonderful style.
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|they killed my favorite character, and other characters werent even in it. very very very disappointed un the whole movie
B002BI6SMI|2.0|This is a movie for sensation seekers, not adults looking for interesting drama. It could have been different because there are a lot of good points about it - the graphic portrayal of sex trade, government indifference and corruption, etc. But the \\"action\\" sequences are right out of a video game. Absurd, full of impossible scenarios, and made for the 17 to 22 year old set.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Delightful read.  Story told from a dog's perspective mixed with life insights from car racing.  I found this to be a great summer time book.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Many things could be said of this great album, I will just say this: I love the rendition of &#34;New Favorite&#34;, Jerry Douglas does one hell of a job with the dobro.
B003W77TPC|5.0|One of the great albums performed by one of Jazz history's greatest pianists.How could I not love this wonderful concert?
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl was a quick read, with a great style of writing where I really felt I was hearing both sides of the story.  And just when I really thought I knew what would happen, there was a twist and then another.  A mystery/police drama kind of book, but also about love/marriage in a real way.  There were some slow spots but they were short -- definitely worth reading. I'll be checking out other Gillian Flynn books now.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved reading this story, hated coming to end knowing there was not a fourth book.  I thought it was a great story!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Plays Magic, works great, looks great. Only complaint is that there are some visual glitches, otherwise it's a great app.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I did not get much down in my home until I finished the book.  The author kept me interested to want to read more.
B005UT29Z0|2.0|A waste of Kevin, Demi, and other starts abilities. Great title, maybe I will use it for a dog name.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Highly recommended. The young kids in the movie played great parts. The old nanny was a nasty piece of work
B00CDTSFF8|2.0|For the \\"History Channel\\" to produce a piece with so many historical inaccuracies in truly amazing.  The Vikings didn't know about the British isles? -Hah!  9th century anglo-saxon \\"kings\\" in England live in stone castles and dress like 11th century monarchs?--Hah! \\"Jarls\\" ruled their Things with an iron fist? --hah!  Viking society would look down on a risk-taker that successfully raided and plundered--hah!  And, one has to love the costuming.  \\"Ring-mail\\" 2 inches in diameter hung over your crotch?--really?<br /><br />My fav. part has to be when Ragnar finally \\"comes to power\\" and agrees to \\"allow\\" an old warrior on next year's raids.  Despite the very small tribal community and Viking society's hero worship culture, he has no idea of this man's identity or the previous deeds of the \\"old warrior.\\"<br /><br />As to the acting, I really dislike the actor playing Ragnar.  And, for good reason.  He was a male model.  His \\"acting\\" abilities seem to be limited to 3 different forlorn glances of his bright blue eyes.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Dave and the boys deliver the goods on this long awaited album consiting of a lot of early Van Halen tunes written in the late 70's and revitalized here. If you love Early Van Halen, you'll love this...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the game. It's really fun and challenging. No problems but I JUST CAN'T PASS LEVEL 6!!! Otherwise the game is really fun and challenging.

B00AR1G3FS|5.0|My wife and I were at a Parade of Homes.  One house had a movie room/theater and was showing the Eagles' video &#34;Farewell Live From Melbourne&#34; (FLFM).  We thought it was incredible.  We have the blu-ray of &#34;When Hell Freezes Over&#34;  (WHFO), but this seemed better.  More songs on the FLFM, but not all songs on the WHFO are on the FLFM.<br /><br />Viewed it on our Panasonic 65 inch TV.  Incredible and long - approximately three hours.<br /><br />Would highly recommend this blu-ray.  Group is also about 10 years younger on the FLFM.
B005DJREJS|4.0|The Characters are great. It's an interesting and addictive watch for even adults. It is funny and entertaining. Sometimes a little shocking and eye opening.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|What? Didn't you read my title? haha  Seriously, my teen son loves this movie. He wouldn't let me cancel Netflix just because he likes to watch this  every night before going to bed. Sooo, I bought him this for a couple bucks and &#34;goodbye Netflix&#34;.
1596177373|3.0|I was expecting a little more.  What you see is what you get. I love Tim Burton, so I like them but I thought there would be more designs, they are only on the face cards.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I am sooo addicted to this show. It's definately a guilty pleasure. I'll probably miss it once it's over. It's a must-watch!
B0017TYPIG|5.0|This is my favorite Paul Newman movie. It's a classic. He's so great in it, and there are so many memorable moments and lines.
B000SEGQNS|5.0|Easy to read and right to the point! It was very clear and concise explaining basic principles on web usability.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love both the Nashville CDs I purchased recently. I was excited to receive them so quickly and they were packaged well enough to be fee of damage.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|I love this movie which deals with true life history; a woman's strength and fortitude.  My mom is strong too.
B007XAYKX8|5.0|Dramatic, informative, fantastic.  It is Perfect for motorcycle enthusiasts and newbies alike! Cannot wait for Motogp to continue in Indy!

B00005JKZV|5.0|I love the movie plays great doesnt skip thanks for the movie. It came on time too which is a plus
B003UYV08E|4.0|I would recommend this. Loaded with action and it holds your interest.  Naturally, a little romance is good as well.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I had already watched the 2nd season not realizing that it was the 2nd season. Although i thought i was missing something. Anyhow i am not starting to watch the 1st season.  I wish they hadn't canceled the show.  I fell in love with it.
B008602KQI|4.0|Pretty good, J Law is something else. Good premise, looking forward to the next movie to come out. Considering reading the books.
B001HHDW1O|5.0|Except for the lack of a dust jacket, I would think this was newly printed. It is in excellent shape! Undamaged cover, beautiful unmarked green endleaves, crisp pages, no scribbles or highlights or grease spills. I'll do all that when I start using it. I'm quite pleased with Hawking Books. Great edition, great condition, great price, great service.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I had heard a lot about it and only watched it recently.  Was totally hooked after one episode.  Well done, Netflix!
B0019HQIFE|4.0|the way a concert should be shot. nice clarity (no pun intended) and sound. Personally would like more songs from the full band- but I'm pickier than most.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It's really a funny and smart show.  I have been hooked since the pilot. They do a great act of walking that thin line between love and hate for everyone.  The characters are well balanced and all have a good and bad side.  It was worth loosing the sleep so I could get caught up in time to watch the season 3 premier
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the best game ever! U should totally buy it... but that's where it gets better you don't need to buy it it's free!
B001BANK32|5.0|I heard that this was a must read, even if you saw the movie. I guess I heard right.<br />Classic King Horror.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Really good movie. The actors are great. Love the plot twist, it's a really good move. Will recommend it to friends.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a very fun game to pass the time with.  The story line is educational and entertaining.  Real money can buy fast complete on most plants so parents beware.  Would be better if you could expand , but once you get the reef to a certain size all you can do is sell and replant .
B007TK77QE|2.0|Not my cup of tea at all.  Did not like the narrative style and just couldn't get into it. Tried till chapter 4.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Useful and was quick to get used to. Just put the battery in, snap on the 3ds and and play.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|Was kinda slow paced in the beginning. A star studded cast. CIA agents come out of retirement. Lots of action, fair bit of comedy. Marvin's home is cool. You'll love Warm Bodies, Burn After Reading which star John Malkovich. There's a William Moses character taking out various people on a list. The soundtrack features classic rock. Interesting special effects. I'm sure the cast members may have worked together before. Red 2 is coming to the cinema and later dvd.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|This movie was everything I wanted it to be and more!  I had problems at first playing the Blu-ray on my Samsung Machine but realize I needed to update the software.  Worked perfect after the update.
B007ED9FIY|5.0|Original, thoughtful, well-acted, poignant, and funny.  I probably enjoyed the movie partly because my personal circumstances are similar in some relevant respects to the George Clooney character, but even so, I think anybody would enjoy this movie.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love the funny Ben the dog because he relates to my Popop .<br /><br />I am now going on 14 and still play and enjoy this game.<br />.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I watched the first season on Netflix and was hooked almost immediately. The second season did not disappoint. Although it seemed to take forever for a certain couple to get together, it eventually happened and the adventures in-between were great to watch.
B004XISI4A|5.0|if you liked the other books in this saga you will not be disappointed... it just gets better,<br />you won't put it down!!!!!!!!
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|If you are a fan of Super Bad - like humor and want a hilarious movie to watch with the girls or your boyfriend I would definitely recommend this movie. If you get offended easily by crude humor don't click play. It is great, but there is no way to avoid it.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|On my HD screen, this 3D picture is very nice. The content is your typical IMAX quality material, not too dramatic or edgy. I was pleased with it and would recommend it for anyone interested in the Hubble and space. Although this program is about the telescope, one cannot watch this film without recognizing the immensity and beauty (I hope!) of the environment within which the Hubble operates.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have been waiting to find this season - well worth the wait! New characters and storylines, never gets stale.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun game.  I was surprised the game had so much exploring, secret areas, hidden gems and the like. All in all a fun casual slingshot chimp game.
B009WUBERW|4.0|It was typical action packed movie sequel. I enjoyed the movie very much . I'm waiting on the Expendables Three.
B00555X8OA|5.0|The chapters are set out as a commentary on research either done by or reviewed by the author. Excellent discussion but with a writing style that is interesting to follow.
B007SXB498|3.0|This was a hard read.  I may not have taken everything in that was actually written.  It was somewhat hard to follow although it was a great story.  I believe if I had read it in a completely silent atmosphere with no interruptions and a straight through read, it would have been more enjoyable for me.  I would recommend it to other readers.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Such a cute movie! If you love funny zombie movies (uh hello Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland fanatics!) this movie is a must watch!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|What's not to love about this show!  It is amazing!  Non stop laughing! Cant wait for next season to start.
B002NOH7G6|5.0|I watch this movie every time I need to get my fitness routine pumped up.  How can you not feel like a warrior when you watch this!?!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Enjoyed learning at that time & made me appreciate more what our pilots did in WW11. Appreciated the details of the events.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Well written and wonderful cast. So very glad I found it. Enjoy watching Brendan Coyle in a role different from Downton Abbey.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|It worked so well I'am thinking about getting another one keep them coming guys good job<br /> Thank u so much.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|A spectacular video game in the visual novel genre.  A game that strays from anything you've ever played before.  It tells the story of 9 people who must escape from a sinking ship within 9 hours by solving puzzles and finding the number 9 door.  Their kidnapper has forced a watch with a number on it on their wrists and if they brake any rules of the game, they will be punished.  It's a life or death situation when this 9 strangers must find a way to trust each other and fins a way to escape with their lives.  Plat this game, I doubt you'll be disappointed.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I really love this movie, it is one of my favorites. I really love Kate Hudson and Jennifer Goodwin together in this movie, they were simply delightful.

B00BI73CVI|5.0|Hugh Jackman is astounding. I didn't realize it was a musical, what a pleasant surprise. I will watch again and again.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I recently purchased a 2013, 13 inch MacBook Air. As a long time fan of Macs and Apple products, its hard to admit that sometimes I do not know what they are thinking at times. The new MacBook Air uses dual USB 3.0 inputs, I am sure this was done to keep the MBA light and thin, so I was not that surprised to see that they left out the Fire Wire 800 ports, which are very important to most users of Macs. However I was relieved to see that they thought of the Fire Wire crowd, by developing a Thunderbolt to Firewire cable solution. The adaptor itself resembles something that could have come standard with the MBA, it is well made,of quality materials, it connects easily and snugly to the Thunderbolt port and the Firewire male end without loosening or feeling insecure. The hard drive mounts easily and stays mounted. Depending on your hard drive and computer, you get quick transfer of data via the solution without the hard drive dismounting on its own, I did find that the Firewire end did get a little warm to the touch when transferring a large amount of data, but it never got uncomfortable or hot to the touch and it did not affect data transfer or cause the drive to dismount. If you still utilize FireWire drives and you plan to stay with the Mac platform, this is a worthwhile investment, because the Firewire port as we knew it is probably gone forever.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this series.  I have watched it from the beginning on tv, and now I am watching it again on my Kindle.  It is very well written, and the actors are fabulous.  All of the characters have great depth.  I enjoy watching the court stories unfold, but even better than that is witnessing the intermingling of family members and co-workers.  We should all aspire to be as loving as Alicia, as clever as Kalinda, or as graceful as Diane.<br />I would highly recommend this series to everyone.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Pretty good so far my city is looking good I love city games so I like this game a lot I would totally recommend it for a friend
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Stands up and has a strap to hold shut for a great price. Satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it

B001UTW7QU|3.0|I like some of the characters, but the plots are pretty &#34;out there.&#34; I guess that's why they called it &#34;Fringe.&#34;

6305949980|5.0|Looking at a store shelf and seeing both Halloween Decorations and Christmas decorations together, I believe, may have been the premise for this wonderfully offbeat holiday movie. Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King and the ruler of Halloweentown where all the Halloween nightmare figures live, work and plan for every Halloween since the beginning, but Jack is slowly beginning to feel tired of the same yearly routine and is starting to wonder if there isn't something more. As he is pondering these thoughts, he does encounter something new in a stretch of forest just outside of HalloweenTown. There in a grove is a circle of trees where each holds a doorway, and each doorway is marked differently. One, however, intrigues him more than the rest and he opens it--and is pulled into a completely different world, so unlike his own.It is then he discovers that there are other holidays-and towns like his that celebrates their own days and he has entered ChristmasTown.So enthralled and delighted with his discovery he takes back all that he can find to share this news with the rest of HalloweenTown and ponders his discovery further, especially how to share this holiday. Instead, he decides to take it over and has Santa Claus Kidnapped as he and HalloweenTown prepare for Christmas. The three henchmen who kidnap Santa However, decide to take Santa to Oogie Boogie, who is delighted with the prospect of throwing a wrench in Jack's plans, while Jack proceeds to carry out his plans of delivering toys and treats for Christmas, but with a decidely different twist on things which is not appreciated by the population he visits, prompting an attack on him by the military. Sally, a lovely young creation of Dr. Finklestein, has only Jack's best interests at heart and when her warnings fall on deaf ears tries to save Santa herself, only to be captured by Oogie to join Santa in his own impending demise.Only Jack can save them both--if he can get back in time. This is quite a fascinating romp and there are wonderful catchy tunes and while the figures in HalloweenTown are somewhat nightmarish looking,they are quite likeable in their own quirky way, and seeing Jack play Santa Claus is definitely worth a laugh. Oogie Boogie though is actually quite scary, but has a way with a song which is also quite memorable. While this might scare the toddler set, others would find it fun. It is quite a quirky treat for either Halloween-or Christmas.and there are wonderful catchy tunes and while the figures in HalloweenTown are somewhat nightmarish looking,they are quite likeable in their own quirky way, and seeing Jack play Santa Claus is definitely worth a laugh.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the level of play by the computer opponent. It allows me to better my game. Major props to the coders.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A unique story that transports you to a romantic magical adventure. Richly drawn characters that immediately engage you in this delightfully imaginative story.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|This remote control app does just what I was looking for. It is easy to connect with and the remote computer program that you download generates its own password for security. The password changes every time you start the remote computer program so there is no stored password on my tablet that can be possibly hacked.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a classic that is a must for family library<br />Classic series<br />Terrific acting<br />A series that will be worth viewing years into the future
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I watched this on a plane (oddly, going to Philly after breaking up with my bipolar boyfriend, and I had no idea what the movie would be about), and it was good enough to keep me occupied the whole time. Great story, well done. I would recommend.

B005544V6A|5.0|Love Amazon Prime for offering such a great variety of free shows. Suits is such an entertaining show. My husband, an attorney, and I can't get enough.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I was looking for a good substitute for The Walking Dead, since I like post-apocalyptic tv shows/ movies. The walking dead just started to drag on me because the characters don't behave like a rationale person would in the zombie apocalypse. In Falling Skies, the characters, overall, make intelligent decisions for their similar situation of an alien apocalypse. Im only taking off one star because the pacing makes the plot somewhat predictable, but everything else in the show makes up for that (character development, visual styling, etc). I'm now completely caught up to the most recent episode of the new season and I haven't lost interest yet. I actually preferred watching the episodes on Amazon because there are no commercials. When you watch it on TNT, you start to realize that the pace is a slave to commercial breaks and advertisements for product placement in the show.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This series is very interesting, fast-paced, thought provoking. Watch it all the time. Acting is superb. Interaction between main characters is clever.
B00AEFYS8G|5.0|I picked up details watching this Blu-ray DVD that I had not seen when watching on TV.  From the scene with the fly on Jack Elam's face at the station to the color of Henry Fonda's eyes throughout the film.  I did not get bored watching this movie and I will watch it again.  It will not be a dust collector.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nice to see the other side of Krycheck. Though the &#34;revelation&#34; of him as the &#34;ghost&#34; wasn't a surprise, but glad to see beyond his bad-boy, evil-cast character.
B000MF4O82|1.0|Are you looking for a movie with terrible special effects? A movie with god awful dialogue, incredibly obnoxious characters you hope die at every turn but continue to live, and nonsensical plot points that do nothing but push the obnoxious characters into certain doom that they nonsensically escape? Then this is the movie for you! I couldn't take much of it, and ended up skipping through the last half. There are even some very recognizable actors in it, and it may have been good at one point (maybe?) but this film has not aged well. You're taking your chances if you pay more than $0.73. Good luck!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I knew I would like the books after I saw the movie. I was one of those people who didn't sit down and read the book until after the movie came out. I enjoyed the movie but was blown away and brought to tears many times by the books. It was a journey I'll never forget and am saddened that it is ended. At first I wasn't happy with the way the ending was going but now I feel content. I recommend this book to everyone who hasn't read it yet. This is the type of story that needs be read rather then that mindless twilight drivel. In this trilogy you find a strong and extremely well built character and story.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was pretty good I really liked it and I would most definitely read it again. Thanks for reading my review!<br />Sydney
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game because it tells me I'm &quot;perfect &quot; when I do it right. The competition is all with me, which is very relaxing. A great stress reliever!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book has unusual documentary-like writing style -- and that's the main reason why it's so interesting. It doesn't have much action, or central plot, or one or two main characters, running and shooting, surviving against all the odds and saving the world in the process... It's like reading a post-report -- a bit dry, but realistic.<br /><br />Usually zombie apocalypse horrors miss something that maybe interesting to the reader: how the epidemic start, how it progressed in different countries, how different people survived in big cities, small villages, oceanic ships or even polar stations... Not this time. It's all here. If you read some zombie apocalypse book constantly thinking «stupid characters, they should have hide in the skyscraper / board the ship / ride to the Alaska» -- you'll like the World War Z.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|I couldn't get it to play off of my computer, but found that it played off of a dvd player...
B003G4W49C|4.0|The first part was really interesting: education in the battle school, Ender's brilliant ideas of solving problems, Peter's and Valentine's blogging… The story is interesting, but it alls suddenly ends — just when you except that the action will begin shortly, the author tells you «okay, let's just skip few chapters and tell you that there was a happy end — those kids are geniuses so everything they do go smoothly». Meh.<br /><br />On the same time, I really enjoyed Card's writing style. The book is mostly engrossing, characters are believable. Overall it's very simple and easy to read — maybe that's main reason why the book was so overhyped lately.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Season 6 was filled with intense highs and heart crushing lows and was truly masterfully told.  I felt this season represented the Dr Who series quite well but to be fair I am new to the Dr Who Universe having only seen the New Who and none of the Old Who.<br /><br />That said, bravo to the cast and crew, writers and staff who made Dr Who Season 6.  I really feel as though this season really gave the Eleventh Doctor great depth and allowed Matt Smith to really own the character.

1932735410|5.0|Amazing! :-) Passed my PMP exam today on first try with three &#34;Proficient&#34; and two &#34;Moderately Proficient&#34; markings. The only books I used were Rita's PMP exam prep and chapters 2-4 of PMBOK! I also purchased and used Rita's PMP Fast Track exam simulator (expensive...).<br />BUT! saved money on other books, courses and boot camps!<br />Rita's book teaches you ITO's by understanding the logic rather than by memorisation. I red the book twice, second time made notes. PMP Fast Track questions are more difficult than the actual ones, but are structured in the same way.<br />WOW! :-) I'm so glad I trusted Rita by choosing her book as my only exam prep guide!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a very fun and addictive game. Of all the bingo games out there to me this one is by far the best. And it's free!! You get to add people through Facebook and they can help you out with free items or items to finish a room. There's different types of rooms and also slots. Also there are groups you can join on Facebook and they can help you with completing a room. I suggest Guardian Angels of Bingo Blitz. This app is a must-have for any bingo players!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had watched the first 2 seasons on Amazon Prime and my parents sent me the 3rd.  Unfortunately, the sent it on Blu-Ray and we don't have a Blu-Ray player.  So, I was thrilled when it came out on Amazon Prime.  It is a beautifully filmed series and the characters draw you in.  I only wish that Season 4 was sooner!!
B007HACDLK|4.0|It was good and entertaining but I've read better thrillers. Still would recommend it. If you are into CIA and FBI and The &#34;stans&#34; you'll like it.
0201485672|5.0|Not many books on software engineering that were published in 1999 are still worth reading. THIS BOOK IS. I lend this book to my software engineering students more frequently than any other book in my library. Most students who borrow it buy a copy for themselves. Fowler's explanations are clear, his material is well-organized, and his tone fosters enthusiasm. The book has been helpful to undergrads in their second semester of programming and to advanced graduate students. Many students will find it helpful to work with this book in conjunction with Wake's Refactoring Workbook.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I love it. As a longtime fan (I bought the cassette version of \\"Please\\" as soon as it was released, way back in the day) I have to say this is the most consistently enjoyable release they've put out in years. Even the track that I didn't like at first (I'm looking at you, \\"Shouting in the Evening\\") is growing on me, and I think \\"Thursday\\", \\"Vocal\\", and \\"Fluorescent\\" are clear home runs.<br /><br />\\"Electric\\" draws on themes and sounds that have worked throughout their career, and incorporates contemporary EDM elements as well. It feels both timeless and current: all killer, no filler.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|I am generally no fan of Hayek and/or Schumpeter, but these authors show how some of the thinking offers a refreshing alternative to Reich and Krugman by showing that policy need not be configured for cataclysmic austerity to support innovation and growth. They encourage investment in education and infrastructure as well  as a sturdy safety net, while pointing out that the realities are that some jobs and benefits are gone forever.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|I will preface this by saying I have never been a superman fan-I found the movies starring Christopher Reeve silly and dated. There are some movies that are timeless (star wars), and other that, to me, just come off cheesy and reek of the time period they were made in. I guess it comes down to taste. I know others who are staunch fans of the Reeve Superman films and I wouldn't try to convince them otherwise. They just never appealed to me.<br /><br />I loved this movie. I loved Henry Cavill as Superman, and the story IMO was very involved and a bit darker to match today's taste. The special effects were top notch, Amy Adams was adorable as Lois Lane, and I really enjoyed Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe as Kal El/Clark's two fathers. Michael Shannon was a great villain who had motivation for what he was doing, something I often find lacking in these super hero movies. The villain often has some lame reason for chasing our hero, but here it was justified. I saw it in IMAX 3D and was amazed, especially at the final showdown.<br /><br />I guess it depends on your taste-there were some older people in the theater I was in who left-there is A LOT of violence/fighting in the last 1/3 of the movie, so if you are looking for the innocent comic book fare of the old movies this might not be for you. But for me it hit all the right notes, an I can't wait for the sequel.

B00005QFE5|5.0|This is a film about never giving up and reconstructing lost hope in the face of seemingly impossible odds. A primary role is played by Li Bin, Di's old and blind \\"grandmother\\". She tried to dissuade Di from pursuing the teacher, considered to be too elevated in society for a simple family like hers, but gave her wholehearted support when she fell in love. When Di broke a bowl of dumplings she was taking to her loved one, grandmother had it fixed at great expense, even though it would have been cheaper to buy a new one, because THAT bowl was important to Di.<br /><br />Di learned from her grandma. When a funeral cloth had to be woven for her husband's procession, it was by now old Di who insisted that the only traditional loom in the village be fixed for the purpose.<br /><br />It is also an interesting film to understand the changes of China from the time of Maoist extremisms  and poverty in the 1950s to the relative freedom and much greater prosperity of the 1990s. In the film we see thinly veiled criticism of the political climate during the \\"anti-rightist campaign\\" that takes the teacher away from his school and also symbols of the new China like private cars, a poster of the film \\"Titanic\\", the importance of money. (Fundraising for the school took the old Luo out in the cold and caused his death. In previous times it would have been the government's task to find the money.)

030758836X|2.0|The book was pretty gripping most of the way through. There were a few bumpy moments where it lost rhythm but most of it was good until we got to the end!  Quite cross over the ending it was absolutely ridiculous and seemed utterly disconnected from the story. A real disappointment. I feel it was a wasted read!
B001TR6ZSE|5.0|This film plays like a sort of intoxicating dream through much of it.  Mundane events to an idealistic young man at the start are transformed into a surreality of temples, buddhism, lies, second chances and the nature of honour with the unforgiving wash of a wave.  A combination of the exploration of the inner life with regard to duty and a man's word mercilessly marooned in another world--a sort of Shangri-la but not without its own heartbreaking challenges, complete with a touchingly sincere and stunning enchantress.  A place to be lost and to find oneself in the watching.
B000001DV2|5.0|Adrenalize is a 1992 album by Def Leppard five years after their maga hit album Hysteria was released. As Hysteria stayed on top about three years, the fans may not have felt like such a long lapse. Although this album topped Billboard album chart and produced three top 40 hits such as LET'S GET ROCKED, HAVE YOU EVER NEEDED SOMEONE SO BAD, and MAKE LOVE LIKE A MAN and some rock chart hits, it was outshined by previous masterpiece works such as HYSTERIA and PYROMANIA. To 80s rock fans, however, this album marks the last glorious days for mainstream rock getting replaced by darker, cynically toned alternative rock movement. Overall quality of the songs in this album are never worse than predecessors. They are refined, crisp and radio friendly but when they tried to hit big their works are not highly appreciated just as you have seen in X album. With the exception of I WANNA TOUCH U, a bit cheesy song, I love all of the tracks. My top favorite is HEAVEN IS. WHITE LIGHTENING, 7-minute opus is also outstanding.<br /><br />Verdict: Not as huge a hit as HYSTERIA but it is still great.<br />Rating: 91 out of 100<br />Recommended for: 80s pop rock fans

1926778537|5.0|This book has a generous serving of art and drawings by Joe Madureira. You can be assured that all art; even the sketches in there are in the leagues of the best entertainment art out there. Words are little in this book. It is purely about the art. The consistency in the style is staggeringly superb from sketch to finish. Print is of high quality and art is well organized in the book. The book is a great size of slightly bigger then letter size and an inch thick! The price for a book of this caliber on amazon is a bloody steal. Highly recommend artist an fans of the Joe Madureira and the game to get this book immediately.

The ending was even better so it makes me wonder what order reviewers were expecting.

Each character is great in their own way and the world that has been created within these pages is so vivid. An excellent read  the only con is there are not enough hours in the day to keep up with the hunger I have for more of these books.

B00AS88FKG|5.0|It was exceedingly difficult not to call this review \\"Greatest Superhero Movie of All Time\\", even though as of this writing it unquestionably is. Its predecessor in every way, The Dark Knight, held the title all the way up until the final scene of the final movie of the Batman Trilogy. It was there that Christopher Nolan crossed the line, took us to where no superhero movie director dared go. Doubtlessly there will be a slew of imitators after this, but we will forever remember this flick for Nolan having said \\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\\"<br /><br /> This one picks up where we least expected it, and psyched us out every scene thereafter. Bruce Wayne (Academy Award winner Christian Bale) is at the end of his athletic career as the Caped Crusader, with brain, liver and ligament damage after just a couple of years of Batmobiling. He finds himself the victim of an identity scam by Selena Kyle (Anne Hathaway), aka Catwoman, who trades Wayne's stolen fingerprints for a bogus criminal record expunction. Bruce's prints are used by corporate raider John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) who usurps control of Wayne Enterprises, backed by the mercenary force of an ex-League of Shadows assassin called Bane (Tom Hardy). Both Bruce and wealthy philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) suspect Daggett's ambitions to extend far beyond the Wayne empire. They are proven correct as Bane cripples and imprisons Batman en route to taking Gotham City hostage under threat of a nuclear weapon. Batman manages to overcome Bane with the help of Catwoman (who does a face turn after nearly helping to end Batman's career), and Batman saves the day...well, unless you've been living in Iran, you know how this went down.<br /><br />  This flick begins and ends with Bruce Wayne's death wish, knowing that Batman's luck will one day run out. Alfred (Michael Caine) knows it is coming, and resigns as Bruce's butler in anticipation of an imminent no-win scenario. Bruce loses his fortune, wrecks his body and nearly loses his life in a remote prison fortress, but forges ahead in search of that final blaze of glory. We heard the rumors but couldn't believe it, and even director Nolan leaves us some fantastic `what if' strands of hope in the final reel. Not happening, people. With four seconds to detonation, only Superman and the Incredible Hulk (and maybe the Philadelphia Flyers) survive a nuclear explosion.<br /><br /> Anne Hathaway's Catwoman was an incredible stroke of genius by Nolan, who (it was rumored) nearly train-wrecked the series by bringing in Eddie Murphy as the Riddler. Catwoman (who was already flushed down the toilet by Halle Berry) promised to be as dismal a character as Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy, but Anne Hathaway made the save with the best female  performance in the genre since Margot Kidder's Lois Lane. Never once did she seem hokey or contrived, and her romantic interest in Batman went head-to-head with Nicole Kidman's unforgettable job in Batman Forever. As for sex appeal and the credibility of her fight scenes, Hathaway's performance is second to none.<br /><br /> Granted, Bane was no match for the Joker, but Tom Hardy's swaggering, supremely confident arch-villain was superlative nonetheless. His soulless, unblinking determination put him in a Terminator class of mindless automaton self-programmed for one purpose: the mutual assured destruction of himself, Batman and Gotham City. Even though Bane was not the ultimate anarchist that the Joker was, his suicidal imperative resonated even more with the 21st century terrorist than the Clown Prince himself. Having Catwoman delivering the coup de grace to the Beast Incarnate has to rank right up there with Lois Lane taking out Ursa in Superman II.<br /><br />Greatest Superhero Movie of All Time? Perhaps. But, for damn sure, it's gotta be the greatest Death Wish movie we may ever see in this generation (i.e. those of us left who saw Death Wish on the big screen...damn few left).s body and nearly loses his life in a remote prison fortress, but forges ahead in search of that final blaze of glory.

B001AEF6BI|5.0|I remember first seeing this movie when I was like six years old. My Daddy used to watch it every time her found on TV. I must say I use to hate this movie so much. Why? I guess it was because I didn't understand it when I was younger. But since I have gotten older, I see it in a different light. I can relate to it more now, especially when I became a high school freshman, it shows me that there are many walks of life. And who says we can't I be friends?<br /><br />The Breakfast Club has a very simple plot: five high school-aged kids are sentenced to a Saturday in detention. Each character personifies a clichéd, but somewhat misunderstood stereotype. We have the jock/athlete, Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez); the nerd/brain, Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall); the popular girl/princess, Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald); the bad boy/criminal, John Bender (Judd Nelson); and the outsider/basket case, Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). The adult characters include Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason), the strict school assistant principal; Carl Reed (John Kapelos), the goofy school janitor; Brian's strict mother; Andrew's controlling father; and Claire's dimwitted/rich father.<br /><br />So why would this little teen comedy-drama be so long-lasting? I guess just because it shows us that all children, from all walks of life, have challenging home lives and are under a lot of pressure. It does also show us that everybody can get along with another, if (and I stress IF) we put our minds to it. I mean why do we think we shouldn't get along? Just because someone is different in their looks, personality, sexual preference, why shouldn't we respect them and at least try to compromise our differences? Society is the answer. The public that has surrounded us has in a way \\"brainwashed\\" us into believing that we shouldn't get along. This movie shows us we can.<br /><br />Besides from the lessons this movie does offer, The Breakfast Club has sort of became a cultural phenomenon. It has beenparodied (most recently on Nickelodeon's Victorious) and has consistently dominated popularity polls for best teen films of all time, and as one of the best films of the 1980s in general. It finds new audiences in a new generation everyday. I mean come on, if this doesn't tell people this movie has \\"something\\", I don't know what will.<br /><br />The movie has often been noted as the quintessential \\"Brat Pack\\" movie. The most famous Brat Pack members, Ringwald, Hall, Nelson, Sheedy, and Estevez, are all represented in this movie. Other members of the infamous \\"club\\" include: Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, and Andrew McCarthy, although they made far less appearances in so-called \\"Brat Pack movies\\".<br /><br />In general, The Breakfast Club has a lot to offer. Comedy. Drama. Lessons. And just about everything else. It is a perfect film I think a lot of young people should see. The edited versions (which cut out the inferior language and sexual references) could be shown in High Schools and still have the same affect. The Breakfast Club will not disappoint you. It should not anyways. I must say, though, if you have negative or snobbish feelings about the movie already, odds are you won't see what the fuss is all about. It's a movie. A great movie. A movie that should never be forgotten. Long live The Breakfast Club.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|This is a fun movie.  You can't beat Bruce Willis and Jai Courtney was perfect as his son.  With these kinds of movies I leave my brains at the door and just go for the ride.  And this was a ride that never ended until the final scene.  Believe it or not it's really a feel good movie.  Wish it had been in 3d.

B005LJITS0|2.0|I've never been a big fan of Green Lantern, and this mediocre adventure only reinforced my opinion. It features a lackluster storyline , drab acting, poor character development and a feel-good ending. I realize these types of movies aren't intended to be taken seriously, but there should be a some sense of believably present, and this movie had none. Along with this, the visual effects and CGI looked far more outdated than 2011. They reminded me of the 2003 Hulk movie in quality.

The family dynamics of this book will tear your heart out.  The parents of the young man, his denial of his past, and his way of expressing himself will make you think twice about mental illness and the ramifications of such.  The girl is delightful in her own way.

B003CH9PV8|1.0|It's disappointing to pay money for a TV series only to find it has been re-edited inexplicably for distribution, presumably on Amazon.  (?)<br /><br />While I can live without the F-words and frontal nudity, it is exceedingly annoying to have paid for this without a single hint of this modification to the production as it was originally intended to be viewed.<br /><br />Plus...complete silences inserted over adult language?  Really?<br /><br />My Vote:  Do NOT spend your money.  Purchase the DVD, BluRay or get it through NetFlix.<br /><br />:-)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My kids love memo the movie so when we got this for them they were very excited to listen to it. They listen to it all the time. Great price too thanks for that. We are going to get monsters Inc also.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Following in the same vein as his analysis of the early history of Islam in 'No God But God' Reza Aslan has done it again. His context and insight into early Christianity gives us a remarkably vivid picture of Jesus that has existed for years in academic scholarship, but has been inaccessible to non-historians. Fantastic read that will have you question your assumptions while appreciating the power of Jesus.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is great to play while waiting or to pass time. It provides a challenge and makes you act quick the longer you keep running. It is a game worth having!! An improvement since the first one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like subway surf but better. It is funny when the minion dies. There is a house you can run to and even battle meena and victor
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun. I enjoy it. But as most free apps if you spend your money you can unlock more and go farther. It is fun for fans of the movies. I recommend it to them and lovers of the temple run games.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Maggie Smith is brilliant in every role.  Supporting cast top notch. Melancholy. Watch for Maggie's big &#34;bomb&#34; untypical for British women of refinement.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It is a little hard to use the controls but I found that in the settings you can set how you want the controls. also a great feature that I personally like is how you can use the gyroscope turn around in real life so that the person can turn.(you don't have to use that feature) well I recommend this to people that like call of duty or just 1st person  shooters.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend's daughters.  They loved it!  I put it in a box with microwave popcorn and some boxes of movie candy and voila - movie night at home :)

B000I8G5GW|5.0|One of the best movies ever!  Alec Guinness and William Holden are exceptional!!!.  I never get tired of this movie
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Running Time Approx. 1 hr. 30min, 5.1 DTS-DH, High def. pic wide screen.  This movie was very impressive and reminiscent of \\"Silent Hill\\". All acting, sets, props, and wardrobe were very good. Beautiful cinematography .The storyline was very well written, and the (production time)was well managed by producers. They packed a lot of information in this movie in such a short amount of time; there are no dry or dull areas in this movie. This movie has a lot of action, and is very gross, bloody and gory, so don't eat anything when you watch this movie. You have been warned. Buy on Blu-ray.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr. Hosseini is a great author.<br />His stories are beyond fiction. They are the reality of life. Tragedy and sometimes a bit of content and happiness.<br />So familiar with every day occurrence.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have wanted to read the entire bible for quite sometime. This app allows you to set up a study guide with the flexibility of a timeline which I choose
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I expected the visual effects to be great, and they were. I was also expecting a so-so story, and here I was pleasantly proven wrong. It was engaging without being overly complicated. Although its primary audience is intended to be children, it achieved this by being simple rather than dumbed down.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|this is by far the best book i read this year, its easy to understand and overall its very entertaining whit nice and enjoyable examples, it change my life, in personal and professional levels, i totally recommend getting the audio book version

B000GCFY0I|5.0|This trilogy shoud be the next Hunger Games! So much fun to read! Scott Westerfield really delivers. A post-apocalyptic world in which an operation makes everyone into a perfect, superficial and nonthreatening citizen is the backdrop for this page turner. The female heroine of this novel is the best part of the story. Don't miss it!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Watched this VIA Amazon on Demand, the streaming was excellent, no pauses or skipping.  For me it was better quality than NetFlix.  Movie was great!

B004W1GD4A|2.0|I watched 3 episodes. I tried to like it. I love Downton Abby! This was full of characters I couldn't like. The acting was good, but I was bored to death. Shallow people with no redeeming qualities. I quit and will not watch anymore. I forgot to say the ONLY characters worth watching were the monkey and his Indian friend!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This narrative should be read by believers as well as skeptics of an afterlife. One of the arguments against an afterlife is that there are scientific and medical reasons for the experiences related by those who have had near death events. However, Mr.Alexander as well as many of his colleagues, have thoroughly analyzed his experience and concluded that his brain's serious condition at the time made it impossible for him to have &#34;imagined &#34; what happened to him. In other words, it was impossible for him to have imagined what he experienced because his brain was so dysfunctional it was not capable of anything while he was in a coma.
B001EBWIPE|5.0|Life is about choices that individuals make regardless of social and economic positions in life.  This is the main point of the story.  The other is that regardless of the amount of posing that individuals do, they tend to remain true to their character.  Why should we care about the Tracy Lords and C. K. Dexter-Havens of the world?  Because a part of their lives, the important part, strikes a chord in our own lives, choice and character.  The story centers around what these individuals (and others in the film) do about these choices and how they come to bend such choices to their own characters.<br /><br />The film is a masterpiece of script and photography, one that needs no special effects to sustain the story.  Some may complain that it is not in color and yet if it were it might lose some of its dramatic quality.  Even comedy has its moments of drama just as drama has its moments of comedy.  The film is the right mix of actors, script writes, set designers, director, and so forth.  One can still marvel how it all comes together.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|Me and My grandson liked this move very well.  We went to the movies to see it and then watched it on Amazon Prime.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Like most of the other reviews state, this sharpener only gets the edge moderately sharp.  It will get it done if you are need of a quick sharpening sometime with limited resources.
B0011IO45W|3.0|I really thought he would stand out a little more than he did. He's pretty but, just not what I expected I guess. But he did arrive very timely and the sellers are very good, would do business again. Thank you  Robin
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|FOB is back with a bang! They do sound more mature, but not in a boring or sellout way. They have a nice variety of lyrics and melodies. Not to mention, if you keep up with their videos for each song on the album, it provides a much richer experience as you listen to it.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|It came in and my first thought was, this thing is nice. I went to use it on an iPhone which is mainly why i bought it and the Pentalobe bit for the iphone did not work. I contacted iFixIt and they sent me another one no questions asked. Great cust service. Get this kit if it fits your needs, you wont be sorry

B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I have this on my Samsung Galaxy Note II, which is a pretty good sized phone.  I think it would work best on a tablet - it's easy to hit the wrong tile.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I finally watched this film on DVD after it was released in the Spring. From the previews and trailers that I saw months prior, I was really looking forward to viewing this complex film. I'd have to say that this isn't your typical movie where you can go into it without any prior knowledge. This film is from a complex novel with six mini-stories all wrapped into one work. I will admit that I didn't read nor did I even know much about the novel but I am fascinated with the concept of reincarnation. And this movie covered that topic beautifully. I plan to purchase the DVD and watch it multiple times and my feeling is, I will learn and acquire more from it every time I see it again.<br /><br />I will admit, I found myself confused in the beginning but I couldn't help but stay glued to the screen the entire duration of this nearly three hour film. It starts to pull together shortly thereafter and as another reviewer expressed, it's highly advisable to stick around for the ending so that you can see the actors's credits with short clips of the movie additionally displayed; showing their multiple different characters. They are, for the most part, unrecognizable in a couple of their roles. The wardrobe and makeup were both incredibly amazing.<br /><br />Since this story has six subplots (technically seven with the brief prolouge and epilogue), I can see how this might turn quite a few people off. It gives the impression that there is no protagonist and therefore, no sense of perspective by a main character. Technically that would be correct to assert but after all; this movie is about reincarnation and how multiple lives are connected. And that topic is a complex one indeed. Creating a presentation of this nature is a huge feat but one that I think the writer/diretors of Cloud Atlas captured stunningly.<br /><br />What I also loved about this movie was how it prompted the viewer to ponder and think of controversial topics; possibly challenging current day beliefs. For example, one that comes to mind is the idea that clones are nothing more than soul\\"less\\" genetic material to be harvested and/or exploited for human use. In the case of Sonmi-451 (fabricant/clone) from Seoul, Korea in the year 2144 we see that her character not only had past lives, but she's also spiritually evolved and enlightened to the point that she's mistakenbly believed to be a Goddess by the inhabitants of the Big Island in a couple hundred year's time in the year 2321. Of course, it's just a fictional movie but I really thought it was amazing that a movie of this nature could make a viewer think and ask, \\"What if that were true...?\\"<br /><br />This movie kinda reminds me of Mulholland Drive (2001) only in the sense that it is quite complicated but you get more and more from the film after seeing it again and again.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's even better now that your Rovio account can sync the game achievements across devices. Now, I can play on my Kindle, then pick up iPhone and see all of the same levels, and achievements.  I wish this feature had been available earlier.

B005HSL626|4.0|I like it because it's fun and makes you keep alert. A good game for children and adults, finally a game suitable for all ages.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I really want to like this little knife sharpener..I really do.  Its not that I don't like it, I don't like what it can't do.  I have several..how shall I say this, over sized knives, well, more than several actually.  I found using this sharpener with those blades, a little inconvenient to say the least.  Now, on my folders, mostly no problems, if I use my large every day carry, I might run into a little difficulty.  Not that this is a bad knife sharpener..its not, it is a very good knife sharpener, just got to use a little common sense when using it is all.  You are not gonna take your Winchester Large Bowie that I reviewed and use this knife sharpener..well you could if you really wanted to, and took your time, and watched your fingers, and..well you get the idea.  It is small, fits in a pocket, bag, what have you to carry your gear in, this would go well in your bug out bag, or in a pack to take camping or hunting, there if you took your time and watched your fingers, you can go ahead and use this sharpener, but most hunting knives are don't have such large blades, I would feel comfortable using this sharpener with most hunting knives.  That said, the sharpener arrived as advertised, as I say in my reviews shipping was very fast, and in all probability will get another one of these nifty little pocket sharpeners, to throw in my other bug out bag.  Thank you all for taking the time to read my review.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I bought the book on Saturday (4 days ago) to read on a long weekend/vacation.  I had meant to buy it last year but got too busy.  I was reminded of its best-seller status in this week's People magazine.  It was one of the best character-developed books I've read in years. I was riveted. I finished it this morning and could not have been more disappointed. It's like she (the author) gave up. The last quarter of the book was a regurgitation of the previous 3/4 and the actual ending was - for lack of a better term - unfulfilling.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|very sophisticated series. I wish I didn't have to pay for every episode. I will not be able to order thru season 6.
0307744434|2.0|I thought the author spent too much time on the visual rather than developing the characters. A very confounded story - felt like I was reading a teen novel.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits has been such a great show to watch. The characters are well-developed and the plot is involving. I haven't had this much fun in a long time. I find myself really caring about the characters and the situations they are in. Very entertaining.<br /><br />The only downside to the show is that the language is definitely PG-13. Not suitable for younger viewers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yeah, a lot of the same stuff over and over, but in general, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and read all three in a week!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Jo nesbø is the best!  Take my advice, and read everything he's written.  This is the first, so start here.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I never know what's going to happen from episode to episode. Definitely not predictable! Can't wait for the next season to be ready.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The show moves fast and is not drug out like most shows.  Also you never know what to expect. Main carecters getting killed off!!!!  Unreal.  Can't wait for the next season.
B00CLMA3HK|4.0|This tale takes off at break-neck speed and doesn't stop until the final page. The action is wrapped around the idea of aliens inhabiting earth and time travel being a reality.<br />Jesse and her brother, James, along with her boyfriend, Marcus are thrust unceremoniously into a fantasy world through a portal in their backyard which conveys them into the Bermuda triangle.<br />In a quest to discover the truth behind her mother's disappearance, Jesse is driven through danger, discovering a side to her which she had not known existed. Her character is realistic and the reader is propelled along by her adventure.<br />Lovers of science fiction will find plenty in this novel to whet their appetite.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Pendergast series.  In this book, we see Pendergast as never before.  The plot line is more intricate than usual but easy to follow.  I have about half of the book yet to read and I only have a suspicion of what is meant by the second of two graves in the title.  The first is obvious after the first 30 pages.  If you choose this as your first to start the series, don't worry as the authors do a great job bringing the reader to where he/she needs to be to enjoy the story.
B00APB79ZI|4.0|Pok&eacute;mon/Pocket Monster plastic kits (or \\"Pok&eacute;pla\\") are extremely easy to build, requiring little to no experience in modeling whatsoever. My first model kit I built myself was the Kotobukiya Rockman, and then Ho-Oh right after. Rockman wasn't difficult at all, even for an absolute beginner such as I was back then, and Pok&eacute;pla is even easier. But that makes sense since they're targeted really at children.<br /><br />I'm sure people rushed to get this particular Charmander evolution set because of D-Arts Charizard. Since none of the D-Arts starters come with any of their pre-evolutions, this kit had to make do for everyone's favorite fire-type Pok&eacute;mon. Like all other Pok&eacute;pla, the box came with a few sprues, and the pieces all fit together snugly, like any Bandai kit would. Since this is an easy kit, there is no painting required, nor are there decals. Instead, you get stickers, which could be a good thing or bad thing, depending on your skill level.<br /><br />Charmander is two pieces, Charmelion being about double or so that amount. Charizard, obviously, takes the most amount of parts, but, as I mentioned, he's not difficult to assemble at all. The bonus about Bandai's kits is that the larger the figure the more likely they'll include some articulation. Unlike Charmander and Charmelion, who have fixed poses, Charizard can move his head up at down at the base of his neck and at the top of it, his swiveled legs, and his shoulders. When you move one of his wings, his other moves in accordance, so that's the bonus feature there. Oh, and his jaw opens and closes, and you can slide the base of his tail a few centimeters.<br /><br />The figures are smaller than the D-Arts Charizard, so if you want scale-perfect pre-evolutions, this ain't for you. I don't have OCD, so I don't mind. The stickers are okay, but I didn't apply mine and plan to paint them. I didn't like the way the stickers set on Ho-Oh, so I don't think I'll use `em here. They do have seams across their bodies, especially Charmander who's cut in the middle, so you can seal `em with some Tamiya cement if you desire.<br /><br />Great kits for youngsters, and I recommend importing them from Japan rather than paying in the States.ies, especially Charmander who's cut in the middle, so you can seal `em with some Tamiya cement if you desire.<br /><br />Great kits for youngsters, and I recommend importing them from Japan rather than paying in the States.

B000SEIDR0|5.0|I recently read a sentence by Michael Pollan, in which he very succinctly tells us how to manage our diet:  &#34;Eat food. Not too much, mostly plants.&#34;  Those seven words made me really think about some of the crap we eat, and I wanted to read more.  Mr. Pollan has lots of books out, including a very recently-released one. I chose The Omnivore's Dilemma to start with because it seemed to be a bit of a primer, a nice introduction to this author.  He starts out with a huge section about corn...how it became the entire world's primary crop, and how it has insinuated into every facet of our life, and not just food: for example, it takes twice the energy to create a bushel of corn as that bushel of corn provides. A lot of that energy comes from petroleum, which is used to create the artificial fertilizers to grow the corn (so much for freedom from oil dependence). I learned also that cattle are fed massive amounts of antibiotics (animal farms are the largest consumers of antibiotics in the pharmaceutical industry). To keep them disease free? Yes, but also to force their systems to be able to digest corn, which cows' are not meant to eat.  Their stomachs have to be chemically altered to process corn, which destroys their stomachs in about 150 days.  Next, Pollan follows a calf through its short life from beginning to...well, you know.  Anyway, I'm reading this book a bit at a time, so I can't say how it ends. What I can say is that I'm enjoying every page. It's well-written, humorous, and easy to understand without being condescending. I want to know more about the foods I'm putting into my body. I don't promise to adhere to a perfect diet (not even close). But knowing what I'm eating and where it comes from (and the political ramifications behind it) can help me to make decisions. This book isn't threatening, and doesn't look down on its readers. It's written in a light, conversational manner. Michael Pollan leaves the conclusions to the reader.  Highly recommended.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I wasn't even much of a Leonard Cohen fan before, but this album is fantastic.  What a great artist and poet, who put together a great band and - even more important - a great musical director who knew how to showcase Leonard Cohen to bring out his best.  One of the best albums ever.
B006M4F67A|5.0|awesome game for the kindle fire.  I would recommend  this game for those of you that like to play mahjong.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Great stroll down memory lane both in style and pop culture my kids loved it too. I'm sure they will want to watch it again. I forgot however that kids say day sh!# s lot so my kids got a kick out of that.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I watched this again after not having seen it for several years.  The one thing that immediately popped out at me more than anything else: that kid can't act!  Most writers have trouble writing convincing dialogue for kids (I know this from personal experience), and Lucas is no exception.  Kids just don't say things like \\"Yippee!\\" and \\"Woohoo!\\" and when you try to make them say that stuff, it comes off as ridiculous.  But bad writing aside, this kid should never have been cast in this part.  I don't think he says one truly believable line in the whole film.  They also made a mistake in terms of his age; they should've made this character a few years older.  That would have also made more sense regarding the future romance with Amidala.<br />The second major problem for me is that Lucas tries way too hard to be cute.  It's nauseating.  Did he really think most adults or sci-fi fans would find this kid intriguing or be tickled by Jar Jar's escapades?  You think he would've learned from Return of the Jedi.  Ewoks might sell toys, but you lose a big chunk of your fan base in the process.  Star Wars wasn't a phenomenon because little kids liked it.  It was a movie for grownups...that kids also enjoyed.  He took everything that was wrong with Return of the Jedi and increased it a hundredfold for Phantom Menace.<br />All the way back in the '80s Lucas talked about his long-term plans for the franchise, and for decades we looked forward to its fruition.  What a disappointment.  But taken on its own, what I find sad is that I really do think this COULD have been a good film.  A little better directing, a little better writing, take out all the cuteness and get an older kid who can act...and this might've been something memorable (for good reasons).  The elements are there: the Jedi, the Sith, the Republic, the origins of Darth Vader, and I even like Queen Amidala.  I wonder if Lucas had such a mystique at that point that no one had the guts to tell him what he was doing wrong.  It seems so obvious in hindsight; it's hard to imagine that everyone involved thought, \\"Hey, this is really fantastic!\\"
B005IF7HNA|3.0|Am a fan of Doctor Who and had seen the Torchwood Episode. Started to check out the series. It's okay from what could watch because half of the DVD/Blue Ray Disks didn't work. From what could see it just had a dfifferent vibe and Most Certainly for Adults Only!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game keeps you thinking just wish there were more levels. cant wait for more. it was fun. but only 10 levels sucks
B009IH0ICG|5.0|If you have a charcoal grill you absolutely need a chimney starter. This one is small, making it perfect for a grill such as Weber's Smokey Joe; there are larger chimneys available for larger grills. To use the chimney starter simply stuff paper into the base of the chimney, and then load the top of the chimney with charcoal, and then place the chimney on the lower grill rack and light the paper with a match. The chimney will flare, ignighting the charcoal. Once the charcoal is covered in ash, simply tip the chimney up to empty the charcoal into the grill. This product is a must-have, and is so simple to use, and so effective, that it would be crazy not to. Highly recommended.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|I always like Bonds, especially when they.go off formula, which this one does, yet still stays faithful to the basics. Classic villain here. One less star here because I wished it had gone even deeper than it did on all the characters, even if it made the movie longer.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A good fun game.just enough challenge to keep your interest but pretty logical at the same time.some clues need multiple items to solve which is great. Looking forward to more levels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game! At the end of each game you are shown your current score and your best score. You can take your time or try for speed. Either way you WIN.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|It was a very enlightening book that has given me new insight about an unfamiliar culture. I am so<br />glad I read it and its message will stay with me.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|sticks to the story line, more entertaining to children, and predictable; but overall ok.  I couldnt finished watching it but my 8 year old loved it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't stop thinking about this book - it's one of those books that makes you look at the world different.  What I appreciated about this book, though, is that although it is about a heavy subject - it has many heartwarming and even &#34;light&#34; moments.  The characters are developed in a way that makes you really care for them. Mind you, there is some predictability, but I don't feel like it detracts from the book.  Definitely recommend this one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I do not want to give away.. And make the story less impressive or twisting for you as it was for me. So I will be brief! This was different and twisted, both in plot and character! I was hooked and didn't let go until the end. And even then I wanted more....<br /><br />Can't wait to discuss this in book club!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I just love Suits... Everything about it is just great!!!... Can't wait to start watching the new season... I love these guys and everything about them :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the better Solitaire game apps. totally enjoy playing to past time while waiting for appointments and other places.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was not nearly as good as his first two novels. However, it was interesting up until the last chapter.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. I also showed it to my students after testing and even though they are teenagers they really enjoyed it.
B00B5ARKDE|4.0|Even having played the game and seen many of these cut scenes during it, the movie is put together well and enjoyable for both children and adults.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Just saw this movie last night. It's great seeing a suspense/horror movie that keeps everyone in the audience on the edge of their seats. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are great leads. James Wan has established himself as one of the best directors in this type movie genre.  First Insidious and now The Conjuring.  A must see and buy for everyone who enjoys these type movies.  Hey - the soundtrack was good too!
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|Network is a classic example of why Sidney Lumet is considered one of the greatest American Film Directors. While certainly a film for its time, Network's theme of media over-saturation is even more poignant today than at the time of its original release.<br /><br />The driving force of the plot is The Howard Beale Show, where disgruntled news anchor Beale (Peter Finch) raves prophetically on the desensitization of the American people, however his wide-spread popularity cripples his own message, as people are too enthralled by his speeches to follow his advice to turn off the TV and get involved with the world again.<br /><br />Giving a comprehensive review would ruin the movie for any who are truly interested in seeing it, and as the importance of Network, especially today, cannot be overstated, I would simply recommend that everyone see it at least once in their lives, if not multiple times to fully absorb everything the film has to offer.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Great movie, came in great shape and my kids watch it over and over again!  Can't wait for a second one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Why people write review about the idea, not about the actual product? Is Amazon product review the right place for that?<br />I am giving it 5 star, simply because it sounds so brilliant on paper? I am so in love with the product I don't even have yet, and I highly recommend it to the world. nuff said.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a great action movie. Not only do you have the fast pacing of all of Bruce Willis movies, but the plot is well thought out and funny.  I would recommend it to all.  I can't wait to see the next one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So fun and shows kids responsibility!!!!!!!!! This game is the best of them all! I love it!!! I love it
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Pretty good, not a bad movie for the family to watch lots of action and decent story, I'd say C+ to B-
B008476HBM|5.0|3 times and love it more than ever!  Love it!  A masterpiece of her time and ours, one that will never go out of style!  Love it!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Nice to have the whole trilogy for about the same price as one of the movies cost when they first came out.  Kids have watched them quite a few times already!
B000FCKBCU|5.0|This book is a light and easy read for book clubbers. Its so much fun and wonderfully written characters and scenarios.
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|This is not the kind of game I play as it really is not something that interests me..<br /><br />I know there are millions who do like this type of game and based on my limited time playing this is a good version of the genre.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I wish I could rate it zero stars.<br />What a truly uninspired let down of an end to the series! How disappointing Ms Harris.<br />My advice - don't bother!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Kids liked it, I didn't watch it but they were happy to watch on AmazonPrime 2 or 3 times before the rental was over.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the best my 8 year old loves it she plays the game every time she gets on her kindle fire :)-
B000FC1HQY|5.0|The accent isn't heard as much as it is part of the voice of the story.  I read her novel Under the Tree of Forgetfulness before reading this one and I thought I might have missed a better understanding of the author and her second novel. However, I feel like either novel can be read first and explain the second novel you read with more of what you want.<br />After the first novel I wanted to read more by the author and I still do.<br />She is a wonderful writer with a sense of humor and truth for life that cannot be hidden in history of any kind.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman perfectly captures the uncanny that haunts every childhood. He makes magic seem as real as rocks. I devoured this book and it hasn't left my thoughts since. Enormously satisfying, sad, loving, and lovely.
B00AK57N00|5.0|OK so I told myself I would play for 5 minutes so I could at least review it if I got around to writing a review... so 2 hours later.... I knew I liked the challenge...  it is a no brainier to figure out... and easy to \\"almost master\\" hence you keep playing... clever well don game with the perfect level of graphics simple yet elegant.
B00631VJIC|4.0|I thought this CD was pretty good, there is a good variety of music on it.  However, Volume 2 is my favorite of the two.
B002LANLDK|3.0|it was ok, I tried to watch it with my son, too much bad language for me these days, he liked the cars and the racing
B005V4ZEY2|5.0|Working very good. The webadmin portal is a little poor, but is functional. work just great. 100% recomended. good price
1582406723|5.0|This is a great for anyone that love zombies movies or just always ask the question of ,what would you do if zombies come? My son loved it and he avoids reading as much as possible. Good book
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you are a dog lover and or a racing fan this book is a great read and even if you're not its still a good read
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|A family's life takes a detour when a bad decision is made.  A fascinating look at how events can unspool whether we are in charge of them or not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a perfect app for all ages. My one and a half year old son loves to play this game.It works great to cut out a tempertantrum before it starts. It also is highly addicting to play which is great when you got a little on the way that kicks you awake all night long. it was well worth the time to try it. the only thong that I don't care for is how fast it kills my battery compared to lower graphics games bit I still wouldn't change it a bit.
B00563K3DA|5.0|this is a book I will read over and over.  I am buying copies for the special people<br />in my life.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Like most other comments - who is this book for, I must say I completed reading the series - just to see what happened.  Really over the top but I guess the author got his point across and well I read the series.
B005544TRQ|5.0|GREAT Show! definitely worth watching, it is one of the best shows I have seen in a very long time
B008Y73940|4.0|was very entertaining.  really like matthew mcconaughey I also enjoy lawyers stories. especially when it has a twist,my husband enjoyed it too.
B000Y90VO2|5.0|Excellent! One of Val Kilmers best films! Hilarious dry humor and great laughs! Would recommend to anyone looking for that funny movie to watch over and over again!
B008MM9630|4.0|I love this game! And the fact that I DONT HAVE TON HAVE A WIFI CONNECTION TO PLAY makes it great! It is fairly easy to earn the crystals, so no need to spend real cash, whichbI wouldn't do anyway.  Great game for adults and kids alike!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I like getting what I want when promised ! There are times brick and mortor is the way to go,but with gas prices and little time I have some weeks if I can get the same thing brought to me for cheaper in A day ? Why not save the time and money !<br />Thank You So Much
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Yes, relationships on and off, marriage and money......  Did have some interesting story lines but repetitive and interesting waiting to see what was going to happen.  A bit disappointing
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book! I read through it in 1 1/2 days because I couldn't put it down. I loved the historical context and the characters.
B009WUBERW|4.0|lots and lots of action.There was a humor too. Husband loved car chases-explosions.  Couldn't fall asleep when this movie was on
140006922X|5.0|As a Christian, I am excited to learn all I can about Jesus.  My faith is not threatened by a professional historian and a talented author who has frankly spent much more time and energy learning about the life of Jesus than any Christian I know.  Zealot is fascinating and engaging, particularly as it reflects C.S. Lewis's idea of \\"true myth\\" - truths that transcend facts.  I waited anxiously for months to read this book and have not been at all disappointed.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's an excellent product, has been the best. if I'll buy any product like this repeat with you all the times as necessary. thanks a lot!
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Very good movie about corruption in the big city. Good story line, and great actors.  Really enjoy movies with Mark Wahlberg.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Well I had heard so much about this book - but really I was disappointed.  I guess to much feedback can affect the actual book.  Yes I kept reading to finish the book.  Some things were repeated far too many times.  Definitely not a book that I would recommend.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|this is nice to have app. I love reading free e-books that are available on amazon.com. This is a perfect e-book reader app.
B004IPPINW|4.0|I haven't seen the movie (nor do I plan to), but the book was very good.  It was shorter than I expected, but really draws you in.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|this is one of the funniest movies around. Peter Sellers is so versatile in that he plays 5 roles in it. George C. Scott is absolutely over the top playing the Air Force chief that is a direct play off his role as Patton. And Slim Pickens riding the nuclear bomb down to the target is absolutely priceless.  You just gotta love it.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This whole series was well crafted with really excellent character development - you really got to \\"journey along\\" with the characters and this opening book got me hooked for the other two.  I went through the whole series very quickly, quite absorbed along the way.  Sanderson has created a very thorough and complex magical system, and he does a great job of unveiling new elements, creatures, characters in the way a known character would experience them, vs. explaining everything fully as he goes.  Has classic story elements, but his imagination is just amazing - really turns the known world on its ear.  I loved it.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|It's not often that I will like evey song on an album. In fact, it's not often that I will buy an album in general. Glad I did!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This would make a good movie or a pilot for a series.<br />There could be conserving an educational,my grandson was like this he was isolated for  the first 2 years before he came to us and had a difficult childhood but now at 25, does he have any regrets?
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|This book is insprational and should be read by any one in business. We be taking &#34; many walks &#34; in the future.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was hilarious and engaging.  Five stars!!!  I think that it may have been made into a movie, but this book is far better than a movie could ever be.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was excited for the release of this product.  I was able to get a pre-release version of it. What was being touted was that it was an alternative to cable, however once I got it, I realized this was wholly untrue, I was disappointed at the lack of functionality that it had.<br /><br />You can't replace cable with the Chromecast. No basic cable channels. That truthfully wasn't that big of a surprise, however there isn't even Hulu. There's not Amazon. There's not local media. There's no original content. No gaming. There are basically no services... yet. It's a $35 AirPlay dongle.<br /><br />Also it doesn't support ANY apps.<br /><br />And it no longer comes with free Netflix, as Netflix canceled their contract with Google today.<br /><br />So overall, quite disappointed.
0425263924|5.0|Love, Love, Love this book. I, of course have read the others in the series. If you havent read the other 2, then you need to get them. This is the last book in the Crossfire series. I am in the middle of reading this book and I cant put it down. I highly recommend this book if you are into this type of book. Thanks Sylvia Day for writing this series.
B0094LUH4A|5.0|It's a great movie with a little of everything. It's both sag and happy. Barbara is a great actress and plays this role perfect.
B003UESJF6|5.0|great movie great quality everything that i asked for and more. this was perfect to have and enjoy. also.. tina fey
B005VPRFSY|5.0|I always find legos to be inexplicably expensive.  However you do get excellent quality with the high price tag.  This set is no different.  It has a good assortment of parts for the children to play with and was easier to put together than some other sets that we have.  My son especially loves the robot figures.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I read this book because of Barbara Kingsolver's enthusiastic review.  She was absolutely correct to praise it.  Ms. Fowler is an excellent author.  Her book is amusing and also thought provoking and sad.  I highly recommend it.
B0000CF35G|5.0|I really loved this album. This vinyl looks and sounds great. Classic album sounding the way it should. All the best songs.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton, once again wove an intricate story which I almost felt as though I was a bystander.  I rarely want to read a book a second time however, The Secret Keeper is on that very short list!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I enjoy listening to Taylor! I've been wanting this CD for awhile and I finally got it! I would recommend it to my friends.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|This movie was too long.  If I had known it would be more about alcoholism than the events surrounding a plane crash I would not have watched it.  I think the movie trailer was misleading. Denzel did a great job, though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its challenging better than temple run and who doesn't want to crush vector and it was a good movie both 1&amp;2 despicable me--&gt;awsome
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This movie teaches us that no matter what our circumstances are in life NEVER EVER give up on your dreams their beauty far surpasses any other reality.  I would give this movie a 10 but there are only 5 available stars!!!
B007LYB0PC|5.0|I really loved this album. This vinyl is looks and sounds great. The instruments on this album just sound way better.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|There is a reason John Scalzi can be considered one of the foremost and most interesting science fiction authors currently publishing. His ability to capture the humanity in the most inhumane of situations makes his stories transcend the average space opera or close encounter genre novel. However, that said, Redshirts falls flat. The premise of meta-narratives, the &#34;redshirts&#34; who simultaneously inhabit a real world similar to that of Star Trek, and also a television show is interesting and compelling. In execution only the first third of the three acts really comes together in any meaningful way, with the last two acts succumbing to the very cliches  this novel begins with in parody.<br /><br />For fans of Scalzi this novel will probably leave a big &#34;meh.&#34; To those who are new to Scalzi's work, the far superior Old Man's War series is a better reflection of how engaging Scalzi can be in the space opera genre. If you were drawn to the idea of a more humorous parody of science fiction, Scalzi's &#34;Agent to the Stars&#34; also superior in this regard. Overall Redshirts is merely okay. Not great, not bad, just okay.
B0000669JL|5.0|Includes all of my favorite Marley songs, I listen to it over and over and never get sick of it.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I've read or listened to several of the Jack Reacher books and I enjoyed this movie.  Reacher is supposed to be 6'5&#34; and Tom Cruise certainly is not....but he did a good job.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Another Die Hard movie to add to my collection...... Great!!  Could have used a bit more comedy in it, but the action was great none the less.  Recommend for anyone who really enjoyed the Die Hard Series
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I loved this game! Simple and fun at the same time! Hope to find similar games to enjoy as well.
B000057DON|5.0|I really loved this album. This vinyl looks and sounds great. Classic album sounding the way it should. Definitely worth it.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Too much intro/outro and just a fair outline of Tesla. Very<br />Fast read. Would also make a great term paper...
B001MSMULG|2.0|I was intrigued by the idea of an art restorer as a secret agent.  But there was little about that.  The characters were not appealing and the story was slooooow.  I kind of forced myself to finish it since I paid for it.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|I did not enjoy this movie.  Just a lot of F this and F that and variations of the F word.  I really like the actors but the movie totally bored me.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|Haven't even seen the movie, and this movie feels like I'm transported to the circa era. Yet tells the story of love and amazement.
0060001941|5.0|I've read this so many times, and decided I had to own a copy again.  A classic I want to possess.
B0015FQZJE|5.0|I really loved this album. This vinyl looks and sounds great. A modern metal album sounding the way it should. Not over digitised.
1433502410|5.0|I purchased the ESV Study Bible because I wanted a literal translation that was readable. The study notes, articles, maps, and charts are excellent and second to none. This hardcover bible is fairly big and heavy, and I  wanted a bible cover that would fit, so I went to a local christian retailer near my home found that this Zondervan cover fits perfectly, with a little extra to spare: [[ASIN:0310815665 Leather-Look Dark Earth XL]]
B008K8VDPU|4.0|We had a sing a long at a recent picnic: ukes and guitar but hard for the singers to get a starting note, My Ipad friend suggested that I download a keyboard - so next time I'll be ready!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so addicting and really fun. the minions are the best. I love how they change the theme
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome it has insane graphics and is also a really fun game to play, it's really fun!!!!
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Disturbing, but a good read which continued to lead you in to not quite the right direction! Worth exploring this author again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I just got it today, Friday.  Amazon delivery has been great!<br /><br />It's true, I was able to setup in less than 5 minutes from my Android Phone.<br /><br />Wifi proximity determines how 'choppy' your performance will be. (But mostly for the BETA Chrome tab casting).<br />The kind of device you use affects performance and features, too.<br />My phone has no Chrome browser casting, so it was the most limiting.<br />My slow Apple laptop was slow at browser casting.<br />My PC i5 laptop- everything was golden.<br />My Ipad has no casting for it other than Youtube.<br /><br />The \\"apps\\" are limited to 3: Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play.<br />Although, any Chrome laptop browser can stream almost anything through one tab.<br />Of course the better your connection, the better the streaming.<br />On one TV I have downstairs, the Wifi is only 30%, but fast enough to stream Youtube directly to the Chromecast, but Chrome browser tab casting was awful.<br />On another TV upstairs that has 90% Wifi, everything was smooth.  There is slight lag when scrolling, but it's a solid streamer.<br /><br />Be sure to use the HDMI extension- it improves Wifi reception a hair.  And the Chromestick has a big butt which can get in the way of other cables.<br /><br />So, a few apps, but apparently many more to come (do Picasa, and all the video apps and everyone will be happy).<br />You can view local files by dragging the file to the web address line.  It views most anything.<br /><br />It seems limited until you realize it can do almost any type of entertainment you normally do on your TV.<br />Some thoughts: It really feels simple, almost too simple, like having an HDMI cable attached to my laptop.<br /><br />I really don't want to use my laptop to control it because that feels so arcane right now.<br />If I could use my phone or Ipad to fully control it that would be nice.<br />Also, an app to share photos and videos without using a browser would be great.<br /><br />====================================================================================================<br /><br />Older pre-review:<br />Ok, I haven't got mine yet, but it says by Friday.<br /><br />I have them all: PS3, Roku, Sony Media Player, Apple TV3, Vizio Costar, Android TV Stick.<br /><br />If you want to web browse, then only the PS3 and Google TV (Vizio Costar) have it.  Only the Costar can play flash.<br />If you want Amazon Instant, Apple TV doesn't have it.<br />If you want Youtube, the Roku doesn't have it (well, no officially).<br />If you don't want to hack, then the Android TV stick and Apple TV2 are out.<br />If you want to stream your MKV, DIVX, whatever then only the DLNA players can stream/play it: PS3, SMP, Costar.<br />The Sony Media Player is discontinued.<br />So, out of that bunch, only the Vizio Costar can do everything, but it is only the best of the worst and it is infinitely more capable because of the Chrome browser.<br />But you might not like learning a new OS.<br /><br />Google got it right- you can use whatever you already use to control it.  Simple.  And, the big deal, it will handle the streaming, your device only controls it, meaning little lag.  I'm guessing the chrome browser mirroring will be slower.<br /><br />And, heck, if you want one for work and home and the room downstairs, you can get 3 for about $100.  EVERYONE has been waiting for this simple device.<br />You don't need a giant Apple Television to do this.  This is the next big thing that everyone wants.  Here comes a new wave of couch potatoing.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Life changing!!!!!!!! I would recommend to all ages. Well written and easy to follow. Have read other books of hers also.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had to sleep on this book before reviewing it. Now that I have, there are really only three things I can say without completely giving away the storyline.<br /><br />1. I am in love with Dean Holder. (Don't worry, he's 18 so it's legal.) He can hold my pinky anytime.<br /><br />2. I want to kidnap Colleen Hoover and tuck her away in my pocket so she can keep writing stories for me on demand. (Pretty sure that's illegal. Unless I don't get caught... ;-) )<br /><br />3. I knew Colleen could write (have you read Slammed and Point of Retreat?), but I didn't know Colleen could WRITE. Dang. I think I need to pick my panties up off the floor before I can read another book. Never has an 'almost' first kiss been so hot!<br /><br />Holder and Sky's relationship is so full of emotion and heartache that I honestly didn't know if my heart could take anymore. Just when I thought it would be okay, Colleen would throw another curve ball and it would break all over again. I 'live' these two characters so much. They provide a sense of balance for each other through all the crazy f-ed up situations they had to face.<br /><br />So one more thing I know for sure, Colleen has got some sort of magic going on up in her head to be able to write this way and capture the reader's heart. She is simply amazing.
0553582038|5.0|This one's about palace life. Others have complained that it's slow moving, but I thought it was great. The characterization of Cersei in this one is very well done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love playing it but it freezes on me and my brother samsung glaxay s3 because its something with the updating thats messing the game up
B008C20TDG|3.0|I like it so far!! We shall see how it goes in the next month and if I can stick with it! Very educational!
B00BW6SOIQ|5.0|I was recommended this title and was pleasantly surprised. Very hot and right on the spot. For those of us who are not living a  vanilla life, this movie will be a good time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A relative recommended this book to me -- and I'm so glad she did. It really is a spectacular work of fiction. I'll detail a little bit without leaving spoilers.<br /><br />Perhaps most interesting about the book is the entire concept of the story -- people living in an underground silo with this ritualistic means of law and order... Whenever I finish a book like this, I think, \\"I wish I could think of an idea that great, I'd write a book about it.\\" So even if the writing weren't so great, the concept would be interesting enough to keep me at least interested for a while<br /><br />Well, let me tell you, the writing is not an issue, either. The author does an excellent job particularly with setting descriptions and with characterization, lending to the reader a feel of who a character really is. There isn't much in the way of physical descriptions (of characters), except the unique elements (Knox's beard, for example, is mentioned several times in his descriptions), so I think a lot is left to the imagination of the reader -- which I enjoy. From a technical standpoint, the material is flawless. I am always impressed with fiction when I have to look up words -- sure, we can infer meaning contextually, but there were several words within the text that I literally had never seen before, and I'm well read.<br /><br />There are some twists and turns in the plot that, while not entirely unpredictable, build and build and build suspense, really keeping the reader engaged. In several instances, I guessed (accurately) what was going to happen next -- but the author strung me along, flipping pages as quickly as I could. In the second half of the book, I very much liked the structure of the novel regarding chapter organization -- interrelated storylines taking turns every other chapter.<br /><br />It's a terrific read. If you like the dystopian/post-apocalypse genre, this is absolutely for you. It's not an action thriller, there aren't tons of brawls or gunfights (though violence does occur in the book), but in stead a journey towards the great revelation that... Well. Read and find out :)nce does occur in the book), but in stead a journey towards the great revelation that... Well. Read and find out :)
034580404X|3.0|I'm a liberated woman but parts of this series was way over the top and some times unbelievable. Almost to the point of domestic abuse. Having experienced first hand some parts of  the series brought back some unpleasant memoeries. E.L.. James' imagination was way out there.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Its a must see, a must own, and share with your friends kinda movie. Very intriguing until the very end.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A grand finale to an extraordinary journey. Brandon Sanderson did Robert Jordan proud. An epic tale that unfortunately had to end.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are incredible as Kirk and Spock. The Star Trek series never fails to amaze. Recommend.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|You would think that the \\"buddie cop\\" angle couldn't be improved or changed, but did and it's gold. A plot deep enough to make the jokes gold yet simple enough to make the laughs amazing. They done it again and I couldn't be happier.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|well I am waiting on it to download and I have waited 3 mind or so and it is not even half way done.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game. It can be challenging, but not bad. Even a little relaxing. Would recommend it for sure.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Living in the tropics it's helpful to know what's happening with the weather. I use this app frequently. Very helpful app!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It was fine before. Now it's ruined. I used to be able to glance at the weather in the morning but now it takes too much time to figure out and navigate. Sad to say but I wouldn't recommend
B001JP5JRY|4.0|Good laughs and some rules to abide by. Alot of good laughs and understanding of what it means to be a Bro.
B00A27X972|4.0|Very interesting and creative story.  Mr. Haig uses his imagination in new ways.  For instance, who thinks about prime numbers being keys to an evolving species?
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Every 5 minutes the movie stopped and loaded for a few minutes so it took 4 hours to watch. Amazon, can you fix this?
B00C8USQEM|5.0|Great buy! I was a little skeptical about my purchase because some other reviews, but I loved it!!! No 'Bazinga!' on purchasing this DVD set ;)
B009CG29RK|5.0|This movie is just so cute.  My two year-old doesn't get the whole thing, but loves the Minions.  So worth buying!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Includes all episodes, less disks than the SD, but no additional bonus features. Love this TV show too! Anyone who hasn't watched it yet, allow yourself to get addicted
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|A much better Mahjong than the others I have. You can highlight all the letters or put a graying effect on the ones that can't be played currently. I like it better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A must watch! Loved the entire series thus far. Once you sit to watch it you won't stop until you've finished all three seasons.
0307200477|5.0|The mom-to-be was ecstatic to receive this book at her baby shower!  It's a timeless classic that anyone will enjoy with their baby.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun you can't ask anymore from a run type game has all the essential s and more. I think it's big for the despicable me franchise to. I highly recommended it
B00AESN8XY|5.0|You really need to sit down and beat each of these levels, don't cheat and buy them all. I have to say, I've lost multiple hours on my ipad and iphone with this app. For the record, the iphone one was a little small for me, sometimes you miss little details on specific countries or find yourself trying time and time again to select them. The iPad version though, is beautiful. Great game for those strategic minds!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is my favorite game, I am addicted to it. The music, the scenes, it is just the best. My grandson will be happy that I bought it
B004EF65QA|4.0|If you like social history based fiction, you may just like this mini-series.  The acting was believable.  The scenery and costuming was wonderful.
B005LAII80|5.0|If you regret not seeing this in 3D at the theaters when you had the chance, this is one of life's few \\"do-overs\\".<br /><br />The Movie:  5 stars, of course, one of the best Urban films ever.<br /><br />The 3D:  This isn't post conversion nonsense.  This is the way 3d was meant to be!<br /><br />So make sure there are no sensitive people in the room, turn down the lights, and pump up the volume.  It's 3D movie night!  This is why 3D HDTVs were invented.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app lets u listen to music but the screen goes black: / dont download this app unless u just want to listen not watch videos
B002JXK5VU|5.0|it pushes the boundaries of reality everything you imagined as a child they got it and it all goes wrong. luckily Jack Carter is always there to save the day
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the series and the interesting characters.  Would recommend for everyone who likes historical fiction.  We can hardly wait for the next season.  Thanks to Amazon we were able to catch up and share with our family and friends.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|If you've read at least 10 other reviews before you began to read this, you'll notice there's very little middle of the road on this CD. Lover or Hater ? Well I absolutely Love this. If you saw A Serbian Film and thought that it could have been toned down in a couple of places but overall it was a pretty decent flick and much better than what you were expecting then this CD is just as Uncomfortable to listen to but just as surprising, you just need to disregard all that Phil has accomplished before, he is now well and truly off the gravy train and this is as honest, genuine and brutal as we've heard him for some time.<br /><br />Im comfortable with the lack of traditional (easy on the ears) groove, verse chorus, groove and so on. This CD requires just as much effort on your part as came from the band and if you can achieve that then you 'get it'.<br /><br />It aint Workout Music, its grab several beers, multiple shots, your herbal ciggys and grab an ice pack because you're about to be punched right in the face.<br /><br />Heavy, Brutal, Unpleasant, Headache Inducing, Confusing, Challenging.......and oh so very satisfying.<br /><br />Thank you very much Phil & Co see you on tour.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I love watching this movie, I have recently gotten into watching these classic comic movie renditions and am glad I did so.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series is very gripping and interesting at every turn and its realistic in the sense that it could happen and that's great :)
B00BESM14U|5.0|I never saw this movie before. It was one of those movies where I see the commercial and say \\"Oh that looks different\\" and never mention it again. My friends either watched it or read the book.<br /><br />Honestly, i didn't even understand what it was about. I knew it was about being an outcast and him trying to fit in but I still didn't understand.<br /><br />I read tweets and statuses saying \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower changed my life\\" but I didn't understand why until i saw it. and man, I didn't only see it, i cried over it for an hour.<br /><br />The acting: perfect<br />The characters: relate-able<br />The message: empowering<br />The movie: one word = BEAUTIFUL<br /><br />I fell in love with this movie during the hour and 43 minutes I watched it, and that hour and 43 minutes it made me want to help people like Charlie. Because at the end of the day i learned that, in some ways, we are all wallflowers.
159463176X|5.0|I love this book! Khaled Hosseini is an awesome writer and I have read his other two books and love them as well. Great book and great author!! Thanks

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it's like the only game I play its awesome and I love it I play it all the time
B00992CF6W|5.0|What do u have to say about this game it is so fun I could play it all day long
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An exquisite story of love and loss. The fault in our stars is exactly what this book is about. The love of these two is what we can only hope to experience just once in our lives. Beautifully written..
B009WUAK2M|5.0|great action along with greats stars! well worth the time to watch without leaving your house! great use of my prime membership.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and fun game.  Only down side was there are only 10 levels and I finished them too fast.  Hurry up and add more.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this is one of the finest games that I have plaied so far on my kindle. I would really revoked it to other plaiers that are looking for a fun exiting game that can get you out of boredsome.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The plot of this by Suzanne Collins was hard for me to wrap my brain around. I watched the first hunger games on DVD .It was good but I thought brutal and hard to except kids killing kids for entertainment. So I was hesitant to read the 2nd book catching fire. But to my surprise I was caught up in it,found it hard to put down. I have trouble finding books that hold my attention, but I really enjoyed reading this one. Just when I thought I had it figured out it would take a different angle . I'm looking forward to reading the 3rd book. I'm eager to find out what happens to Katniss n Peeta .
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is one of my favorite books I have ever read. it has everything! Original characters, a unique conflict and a suspenseful ending.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|My teenage boys, husband, and I really enjoyed watching this film.  Of course we liked it much better than Red 2, which always seems to happen with sequels.
1612680011|5.0|On Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert generously illustrated how rich people view money.<br />Strikingly, his view is very different from what most of us were told by our parents.<br /><br />Since Robert wrote this book in 1999, we have faced economic ups and downs.<br />Future global economy seems even more unpredictable. In order to weather the turmoil,<br />it is critical for us to improve our financial literacy.<br /><br />I have strong academic background. However, none of my fellow alumni have any<br />confidence in what we should teach our children. Nobody believes that academic<br />achievement will secure our children's financial success.<br /><br />To the contrary, I know several seasoned investors who said that their family will<br />continuously be successful at least in three generation due to their skills and knowledge in investing.<br />They started their investing journey because of Rich Dad Poor Dad.<br />This book certainly has transformational power.<br /><br />Robert has a great skills in selling. That is why some of the topics are very controversial.<br />If you do not like Robert just because he said that your house is not an asset but a liability,<br />you will miss the important lessons Robert gave you. You are not the only one who can<br />generate money. There are several assets which can generate cash flow. We should think<br />about how to increase cash-flowing assets.<br /><br />Some also argued that there are not sufficient info on how to become rich. However,<br />as Robert pointed out, \\"how\\" does not matter if you do not have a right mindset and \\"why.\\"<br />It is much important to develop right mindset than to learn knowhow.<br />Knowhow will follow if you persistently pursue future success.<br /><br />Must read for all of us and our children.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is so cool I play it every day of every second of every day so so so cool
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|So cute, sweet, and funny. I watched it over and over and I'm an adult. This movie is great for all ages.
1781162646|5.0|engaging from the moment I started reading.......couldn't put it down.....hopefully he continues writing more stories like this.....a very fast read
B006LMMN8I|5.0|I was hipped to Gregory Porter by watching Tavis Smiley, then I found out that my boyfriend had the CD (of course after I purchased it).  It's real good music.  Good soul music that you don't always hear anymore.  I love the CD, the music, the lyrical content, all the way through.  If Gregory Porter must be put into a category then,  good jazz music.  I'm sad that I just found him.  If you want an album that's good all the way through please take a chance on this album.  This is music you can sit with, ruminate on, sip and enjoy through the night.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Because you need to be on the internet to do anything with the bible.if l could have read this without having to be on the internet it's would have been better and the ratings would have been highter.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Thanks for the book. It's really helpful. More people should use dictionaries, but unfortunately they don't. It's sad. Well, I guess I'll review on another sometime.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|I hate it when someone gets shot in a novel and yet seems to be able to carry the day. When you get shot it ruins your entire vacation.<br />Also, the science was stretched a bit too much for my liking. Where they operating in our own universe or some parallel one?<br />Maybe it doesn't matter. But to paraphrase the Chesire Cat: If  where you want to get to doesn't matter, then it doesn't matter which way you go,
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so great I love it . It is totally my new favorite just download it<br />I love my horse and I am obsessed  with the application lol I love it
B0091VTISO|4.0|I loved the original as a kid.  This was actually done really well.  The same premise as the original, but alot different.  I loved the scenes when he was a kid.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I have read them all up to number 6 waiting for 7 and they are all really good and i would mark this series for young adults

140006922X|1.0|Reza Aslan's book \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" is an attempt by a faithful Muslim with credentials to portray Jesus Christ as his faith dicates. If you are a Christian, you shouldn't be surprized when he portrays Jesus as a zealous prophet who didn't claim to be God, Muslims have been teaching this for 1400 years. If you are a Christian, or if you just want to learn about the historical Jesus of Nazareth from a Christian perspective, a much better selection would be Jesus of Nazareth by Pope Benedict XVI[[ASIN:0385346409 Jesus of Nazareth: The Infancy Narratives]][[ASIN:1586171984 Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration]].
160788657X|5.0|My wife was driving 3000 miles back home to Pennsylvania from Oregon with the two dogs and a tent for camping. She ordered this audio, and she found it very entertaining. She recommends it.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Invaluable resource for all who will be obliged to confront and survive ravening hoards of mindless undead horrors in the years to come, by which I mean, of course, everyone.  The z-poc is REAL. Thank goodness this author is brave enough to blow the lid off the vast international conspiracy to cover up the truth of the ever-growing zombie menace.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game. I have to play it every day. But, I broke my kindle fire and had to get a new one. I lost all of my progress. I was on level 23! Anyways I love this game.
B0051E9INK|5.0|I loved this movie since the first time I saw it (a really long, nonspecific time ago). It has a hero you can identify with, a villain that seems real enough to be unnerving, Sean Connery (what's not to like?), and of course the Highlands of Scotland. What does make a long life appealing? How you live it? Or who you live it with? Maybe a complex mixture of the two. When you have only one life--you value it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love the game. I can make Zombies, Kids, Vampires, Maxwells, Swords, and you get the point.Best game of this PLANET
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great value. If you need to know what is going on with your battery look no further! Tons of information at your fingertips.  Very easy to use and understand.
140006922X|1.0|What no one will tell you is that the author of this book is no religious scholar or historian.  He is as a matter of fact of the Muslim religion who wants nothing more than for you to believe that Jesus was a radical.  His only purpose is to discredit Jesus.  If you buy this book, read it knowing what the authors real agenda is.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Little frustrating, has this happened to anyone else? All I get is  a blue screen and then it closes and goes back to my home screen.....
B003VANOFY|4.0|Let me give some pretext. Prior to using this headset I primarily used the microphone attached to my Logitech 1080p webcam. Prior to that I used one of those cheap Logitech stand mics and prior to those I used some no-name thing.<br /><br />My primary use is of course chat servers (Teamspeak, Mumble, etc.) and last week after a bunch of guys told me how much of a pain it was to listen to me I decided to do some shopping. Originally I found this but wasn't sold on it. I've owned plenty of Logitech but I'm usually not a wireless fan and the price was a bit hefty. However, one of the guys I talk to actually uses this and when I thought about it...I quickly realized that his voice was perfect. No static or jittering...just perfect. So I bought it (I was also looking for a headset so I could avoid using my speakers late at night).<br /><br />As for the review:<br /><br />Audio Input/Output:<br />It's a fantastic headset. The second I started using it everyone thought someone else had joined our server. The audio came through fine and I could hear them just as well. So in terms of what it is...a \\"headset\\" it's definitely got that part down.<br /><br />Wireless:<br />Also, the wireless doesn't really seem to affect sound quality or latency. It's also pretty nice now that I can get up from my chair and walk around without having to take it off.<br /><br />Fit:<br />I can't see this not fitting to anyone. It adjust over the head, around the ears, the ports swivel, etc. I have sat with it on for hours on end with no \\"ear pain\\" (some may know what I'm talking about).<br /><br />Range:<br />I'm not sure about the 40' range, but I can walk around the upper floor of my house without an issue.<br /><br />Build:<br />This is why I don't \\"love\\" it. It feel pretty cheap. For something this expensive it's entirely made out of plastic. And since it has so many moving parts (to make it fit so comfortably) the plastic is a little thing. On top of that it's very shiny so it just \\"looks\\" flimsy (and feels it). However at the same time, the ear ports and boomstick are very sturdy, but I'm not gonna lie...I am a little cautious about where it adjust over the head.<br /><br />Other Features:<br />I like how you can move the boomstick and it will mute. It also blinks when it's muted to let you know (even though I have caught myself talking many times with it up). The side buttons are nice and can be mapped to anything. I map one of them to my PTT so that if I'm up and about I can still talk to people.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's a fantastic headset...just wish it was a little bit more sturdy (maybe if they used a little metal around the adjustable top band it would be perfect).<br /><br />EDIT 01/22/2013:<br />So after a few months of having frequent disconnect issues I seem to have found the culprit. I didn't realize until actually looking at the product details that the wireless communication is done over 2.4GHz. Although they claim it as \\"interference free\\", 2.4GHz spectrum is probably one of the most crowded frequencies out there. Combine that with the number of routers that default to \\"automatic channel switching\\" as well as proximity to some of these devices and it will cause disconnects with your headset...lots of disconnects.<br /><br />My specific router is the Amped Wireless RTA15 (dual band + WiFi AC). It resides about 3 feet away from the wireless receiver and would cause frequent disconnects. The second that I disabled the 2.4 band on my router the mic worked wonders. No disconnects, crystal clear audio, superb range, the works. I'm not sure how far you would need to be away from it but I can imagine most people could move the receiver to the other side of their desk or the router elsewhere (assuming you are running into this problem). I happen to have the luxury of not needing a 2.4GHz band, but I can imagine not everyone does.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Wonderful book, skilfully written.  Took me back to my origins so I enjoyed it more than the average reader.  We need a sequel as it ended with the reader guessing....!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book had intriguing twists, but the ending drug  on all too long and seemed unrealistic and unsatisfying to me.
B000R5N1MC|5.0|As the title says, this is the most economical way of getting 2007's hard to find collectors edition.  The Blu-Ray and DVD editions frequently hover around the $200 mark for a new copy while this one is a slick $50 bill on a typical day.<br /><br />Yeah, you'll have a version that contains a discontinued format but you'll have the goodies on the cheap or a nice piece for your movie shelf.

0385366752|4.0|I'm lazy and everyone knows the plot to this already, right? Wealthy girl and handsome boy meet. They fall in love, marry and live a charmed life in NYC until reality hits them hard and things start unraveling in a really bad way. The wife turns up missing on their fifth wedding anniversary and as the story is revealed in different POV's and flashbacks nothing is what it appears to be on the surface.<br /><br />This story surprised me in a good way with its twists and turns but I have to admit that I had a real love/hate relationship with it. I enjoyed the mystery and I'm nosy so all of the dirty secrets and malicious intentions and devious goings-on kept me reading even though I detested nearly every character in the book. Especially the two main characters. The more I learned about them the less I liked them but I think that was the point of this whole book so I'm okay with that in this case.<br /><br />Anyway, this was a well-crafted book. I can see why it's so popular but I think the less said about it the better. If you like devious twists you should read it to experience them yourself.<br /><br />I listened to this as an unabridged audiobook and both the female and male narrator did a fine job voicing Amy and Nick in all of their narcissist glory.
B0030ZOYHC|1.0|The movie is fantastic content wise and picture and sound quality is great. The problems lie in the sleeve; you do NOT get a booklet. This is technically a publisher issue, but the least Amazon could do is put a note on the item's page. Also, the blu ray case that mine came in was so badly damaged that it literally fell apart when I took it out of the shrink-wrap. I can guarantee it didn't get that way in transit, which means that it was shipped out with its terrible condition recognized and it was shipped anyway, and I find that unacceptable. I should have read the reviews, but I usually have no negatives to say about Amazon purchases at all, but this purchase really disappointed me.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I have to say that Greg really got himself into quite of trouble. The fact that Greg wrote his own newspaper, put green blobs on the school walls, and put the hero unmasked to save himself from getting into trouble! I am impressed with this book, it was funny. It brought the next funny generation in my own personal information!<br />I just don't know what I would do without Greg. He makes it so interesting. Especially his mother, always into this bonding. His father took a vacation that lasted until Christmas Eve! Manny learning to work the electricity!  :p<br />  I love how Manny ended up with all the heating,food,games, etc.<br />  Those cookies that Rowley brought over looked good in someway on paper! I just keep reading this book because it's so good!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Well, it's free and it calculates correctly, that's really all I need and all I want in a calculator, right?
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is truly a wonderful film for people of a certain age - or well beyond it!  The acting, by some of Britain's best, is perfect, and the setting is indeed &#34;exotic.&#34;  I've seen it twice now, and intend to see it often!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|My seven year old and three year old like it too.<br />Good graphics. New and old versions of tile stacks.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Cool construction. Comes with extra book let and bonus stuff. Worth every penny. Paid $200 for almost new. Great show its a must see and this is the special collectors set.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Michael Connelly has not failed to keep me on edge and at full attention.  This book was a good read just as the other 4 or 5 books  of his that I've read have been.  Harry Bosch is a difficult personality but someone you can't help but want to root for when he gets into his many troubles with the system.  He is a good detective however who can always solve his case in amazing and exciting closures.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|It was alright, just too bloody for me. I thought it would be allot better than it was, sorry. bye
140006922X|1.0|OOOOOOPS ! !  It seem the networks and the here listed reviewers forgot to mention that the author is a life long devout Muslim. He is not a trained historian and is totally anti Christian. The book is full of anti Christian rhetoric, lies and distortions disguised as facts. This is just old \\"warmed over\\" Muslim \\"crap\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Don't stop with the first book, read all three to see the story develop.  It's worth a read even if you saw the movie.

B009CG1YZ8|5.0|This is a great funny movie. Is there any more movies like this? Funny, funny, funny. love it thanks. bye
B000IZA9PI|3.0|As a big episode, I guess the movie was ok.  But, it left me feeling unfulfilled.  It's somewhat of a preposterous premise with too many &#34;just in times&#34; and &#34;left too late&#34;.  Particularly the man-on-man fistfights; they always seem out of place in Star Trek, yet there are plenty to choose from in this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Don't stop with Book One, read them all and see the relationship develop.  It's not just the sex but there really is more to the story.

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Oops, that's not tolerated by the author.  Why is the author's religion hidden?  His chosen religion (well, political design) not talked about on the reviews of his book?  Islam hates Christianity, it's followers destroy churches and Christians whenver they can.  This propoganda piece is right out of the Muslim Brotherhood playbook.<br /><br />Atheists, anti-Christians will love this hate piece.  Just don't let people get away with pretending a muslim didn't write it who hates Christianity.<br /><br />Now about muhammed...

B0071XO8RA|5.0|We all know a highly rated book ain't necessarily something we will like.  Do any of us really believe that we will be lucky enough to find a top 10 book here?  We can only hope so.  I just want something that's worth picking up.  Different.  But maybe not too.  But if so, and I like it - even better.  You never know what is going to happen when you pick up a book.  But you want to remember putting it down.  I was glad I read this book.  You can read alot, but you can't read everything. I think this read will be worth it.

B006PGL7OQ|2.0|I was hoping to see a dramatic entrance of tornedo or so-called apocalyptical storm, but at the end all turns out to be a mere fuss.<br />The shelter which cost 2 jobs, almost shattered their marriage did not justify its worth. Watching 2 hour-long slow acting made me a half-mental patient.

0307719774|5.0|I just started writing in this. I saw it in a magazine because a movie star used it and was talking about it. I thought it would be a fun thing to do as well. I'm looking forward to see how my answers change over the next 5 years. I'm going to start giving it as a gift too.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|The amplifier works great. I use it on the blue light setting, which I believe sounds the best. The red light brings out too much bass on my headphones that already have too much base. Definitely worth the money if you're buying good quality headphones and want to get the best of them.<br /><br />Fun story: I was on a plane with my mother and she claimed to be unable to hear the in-flight movie well on the supplied headphones. I plugged this into the seat and cranked up the volume. She loved it! ;)
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Story is a great adventure. An interesting way of family therapy for a disfunctional family. The only tie to 'Ender's Game' is the use of Ender (and Val) as characters, and referral back to the killing of the 'Buggers'.
B009GED3HS|5.0|A great show for a night at home with dinner in the lap and pups by your side, easy to get into and always a good laugh.
B001RPIYV4|5.0|I love this movie! It's also great for teachers to show in high school because students actually like it! They use all of Shakespeare's words, it's just modernized.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|There is to much information and advertisements. Get spam mail from people using my address.Tired of the same people putting silly things on FB.

B000P0J09W|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and bought it for my own boys.  They loved the whole pirate them and it kept them entertained the entire time it was on.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is one of our all time favorite movies.  I am a Jane Austen fan and this movie is a great tribute to her and especially pride and prejudice..
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This is the one game I come back to time and again.  It has a large number of sets to choose from with varying levels of difficulty. All in all it's an excellent choice and I would definitely recommend it.
0785153942|5.0|If you have seen ot planning to see Pacific Rim, get this prequel. A wonderful compliment either before or after the movie.
B001T6PXFG|5.0|Another amazing story of WWII heroics.  The leads are excellent.  The music was a bit odd at times.  The historical setting was interesting.
B0087ZG7NO|4.0|My son loves the Jurassic series, This one was the only one he hadn't seen so we bought it on here for him and to no surprise he loved this one too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was really fun and interesting, but I thought the ending was a cop-out.  Still worth the read, but somewhat disappointing.
0312944926|4.0|I have read all of his books. He is very good. I would recommend him to anyone. Very easy to read
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I got all eight pages and the last one was hidden. Very well. This game is worth the price and it gives me shivers. I love this addicting game.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|Excellent quality of the movie and the goodies within the package are great! Loving this special edition of Enter the Dragon!
1611761115|5.0|This book helped me identify why I am not comfortable in certain selling positions even though I am an excellent salesperson.  It helped me understand the new dynamic of sales in the digital era and how to harness it's power in a helpful way that doesn't make me feel like a slime ball.  I highly recommend to everyone!  This knowledge can help you in every single job out there.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I love to read but don't have the time to sit with a book, I have recently been downloading Audio Books and are able to listen to them on my iphone while I am at work, in the car, making dinner etc.<br /><br />I have read a few Sparkes books and thought this sounded like a great story. It wasnt horrible, but it wasnt great either. I think there were too many characters, it might have been because I was listening to it and not reading it, but they seemed confusing and I didnt understand why they were in the story until the end. Throughout the book I kept longing for a twist-does someone have a secret child? Was Dawson really Tuck's son? I thought the ending was predictable, I figured it out right away.  A lot of people hated the way it ended, but I was ok with it, but my issue was the book seemed drawn out and too many details for things that wornt important. I almost gave up in the middle of the book, but like I said, I was hoping for a great twist. If I would have spent the time actually reading the book, I think I would have been more annoyed, but becuase I was able to go about my day to day activities and hear the book, it was ok.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Basic calculator, works as one would expect. Easy to use and a very quick download, no issues or complaints thus far.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Just saw Red 2 with a freind who hadnt seen the first. We then went back watched it. Actually, i thought it was a bit better than the second. Guess that is pretty much to be expected.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was well written and very interesting. I enjoyed the twists and turns<br />in a genre I do not often read.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|I just finished reading the book and the movie followed the story very close.  I enjoyed the acting of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.  It was a very good movie.  Oh Kevin bacon was a dream!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Had a great time with this with my grandsons. We enjoyed playing this together . Tricky,but kept us busy for the evening.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|works like a charm. as soon I got it on the mail open it and try the sharpener on a couple of dull knifes I had. with in a few seconds I was filleting a fish that I had just caught the night before. love the size I can throw it on my hunting bag or fishing bag and ready to go.<br />would defiantly recommend to my friends.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The AWESOMENESS in the game is so.....EPIC  me,my mom,my two brothers and my aunt play this my mom is the highest &gt;_&lt; and.....it just I can't explain how cool this game is it....it.....u should play it yourself=)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|easy to follow and the ending is suprising!  I enjoyed this very much.  The end was a real surprise. that is all
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Really good movie and was entertaining for both the kids and adults. Looking forward to watching the sequal to this one.
B0061S073A|5.0|So far so good!! Keeps my girls right where they need to be, I am not worried now when they want to play. I don't have to hover over them constantly to make sure they don't buy something or mess something up.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great,read! Could not put it down, found myself reading while waiting in line to complete a purchase at a store. Stayed up late to finish a chapter, fast paced, suspenseful. Great suspense, did not figure out the end until the very end!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a light read but I really rather enjoyed it.  Although it was a light read, I enjoyed the story line and felt it was well written - would happily read another of her books if I could find one.
1465408746|3.0|What would any good Star Wars product be without a shiny new Special Edition every few years? I haven't considered myself a Star Wars fan in a long time, but I love the Incredible Cross-Sections books. I've spent hundreds of hours poring over them, laying out the floor plans and systems in my head, often just marveling at Richard Chasemore's and Hans Jenssen's attention to detail.  I bought \\"Star Wars: Complete Cross-Sections\\" for convenience sake, and for the four new cutaways and the making-of material.<br /><br />\\"Complete Vehicles\\" incorporates all of the material from CCS and adds four new two-page cutaways - Luke's Landspeeder, the Medical Frigate, Home One, and the Imperial Speeder Bike. Along with the four new illustrations, each cut-away is accompanied by a number of screenshots from the movies. Some of the more iconic vehicles also receive an additional two-page spread with additional photographs and a couple paragraphs of information.<br /><br />The new format is obviously more kid-friendly than the original ICS books (which were already written for 9-12 crowd) but the smaller format hurts the impact of many of the cut-aways. The pages are two inches shorter than they were in CCS, and many of the cut-aways have been shrunk to fit the busier format. Oddly enough, \\"side\\" cut-aways that were smaller in the original books, like the Tantive IV escape pod and the AT-RT, are bigger this time around and receive their own page.<br /><br />If you already own \\"Complete Cross-Sections\\" you don't really need to buy \\"Complete Vehicles,\\" unless you're a die-hard fan who HAS to have the four new cross-sections. The frequently awe-inspiring level of detail in the cut-aways, and the charmingly simple format which allowed the reader to focus on the illustrations, seem kind of lost in this shinier and more compact triple-dip.<br /><br />Oh well. At least we still have the originals.
0345529057|5.0|Gives insight if you watched the television program. My household loves the show.  When we read pages, it brings up discussions on the character's backgrounds and adds depth to this World.  Must read if you are a fan of the show.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great,read! Could not put it down, found myself reading while waiting in line to complete a purchase at a store. Stayed up late to finish a chapter, fast paced, suspenseful. Great suspense, did not figure out the end until the very end!
B00622B3MY|4.0|My 2 year old daughter LOVES the original Cars movie. I like this movie because the plot was a little more &#34;grown up&#34; however, my daughter picks the first movie over this one.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Very good book.  At first not sure about getting it but it turned out to be a good story.  Worth the time to read and buy.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I believe James Franco was miscast....but overall great story, hoping the 3-D version gets released soon. Meant to be seen on big-screen 3-D.
B001C46P2K|5.0|Great movie!  One you can watch over and over again!  Recommended for any household!  It is a tear jerk-er!  Enjoy!
B00447G2PM|5.0|When I placed these two videos in my cart they were only 9.99 each.  When I checked out they rang up over thirty dollars each.  I was in a hurry and did not review my order so this one is on me, but your trust level has fallen severly from my standpoint.  I will be watching closely for now on.  Screw me once more&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;
193700788X|5.0|I love the Sookie Stackhouse series. I wished this one wasn't the last of the series, but I will enjoy reading them over and over again.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|There is so much going on this this book, at times it is difficult to keep track of all the people involved, but I found it facinating and couldn't wait to see what happened next.  I am really looking forward to the next book.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|It's not only large, it has soft sides and a small little wading pool.  It comes with Three toys and 3 rings, so no need to buy water toys, really.  It has a sprinkler, and it's all around a really great purchase.  If you have small children it is definitely a great pool to get! It'll keep them entertained for hours.  My 22 month old is in love with it.
B002NNA9N0|2.0|With this All-Star cast I thought it would be worth my time to watch a movie I missed when it came out years ago; wrong! I gave it a chance but after 45 minutes couldn't take anymore.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I thought the show was amazing, my only complaint was fox's ads at the start and finnish... Why did i have to pay for those?
B003498SDA|1.0|I enjoyed the film; however, the video was snowy during the many night city scenes!  I wish to return the Blu-ray, but I will not waste my time with the shipping.  I may just toss this Blu-ray!  What a horrible disappointment!
0470913029|5.0|Book is very easy to understand and diet very easy to follow.  Recipes are inexpensive to prepare, after stocking up on herbs and seasonings.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|8 year old loved it-I did too!  Loved the voice of Will Ferrel and all the music. Good story line too!
B009NY43NY|3.0|the last few books in the series have seemed to be losing it's focus and energy, or maybe it's Sookie who is getting tired of all the drama in her life. Either way it was time to say goodbye.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|could not get this and don't know why, said my kindle was not compatible for this service so I went with norton
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Whether you suffer from frequent power outages, need something like this for after a storm/hurricane/winter snowstorm, often forget to charge your cell phone/iPad/iPod, or are traveling and can't find a power source readily, this battery backup has been a godsend! With two ports, I can charge my phone and my iPad simultaneously, the adaptors pretty much let me charge anything, and it really juices the devices up quickly. Worth the money. I've bought 3 so others in my family had this in case of emergencies! I highly recommend it!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I couldn't wait for these book to come out on hardback so I downloaded the book and devoured it quickly. I loved the entire series much more than the show, but I love the show too. Some of the characters in this book I forgot about and may need to 'reread  the series. The person plotting against Sookie was not who I thought, but  I liked who she ended up with when everything settled. Would recommend this book
B00005JPCF|3.0|I wouldn't want to watch it over and over (but the grandkids seem to like to). It's a fun little show.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Gets hard but but keeps you entertain!  Hard to obtain stars as you go on but very enjoyable for all ages
0785153942|5.0|In simplest terms the graphic comic establishes character development/ background for elements of the film/movie.  Who was responsible for the development of the pons system.  Where did Raleigh Beckett come from and what drives him.  Where did Stacker Pentecost come from and what are the events in his life that led him to be the leader he is for the movie.  Mako Mori's story and her relationship to Stacker Pentecost for the purposes of the movie.  Quite frankly I'd like to read more tales from this universe.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Watched it when I was a kid, still love how MacGyver used everyday items to get himself out of a jam.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Great storyline! Dumal and Hough were both great in it. Some twists and turns that are unexpected, but still good to re-watch. Loved it!
140006922X|1.0|This book has one purpose: To deceive, which is why the media is gushing over it and promoting it. This individual claims to be a christian but denies the Word of God and that Jesus is the Christ. In an age of massive pseudo Christianity, sadly this trash will be devoured by those with itching ears.<br /><br />I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and an antichrist. 2 John 1:7;  For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 2 Tim 4:3
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I liked the book, but I really didn't get to know Harry Hole.  This may have been the author's intent, because I will read more before I decide Harry is a hero.
B00006LI4S|5.0|What a perfect way to spend the evening by listening to David Gilmour in concert. This is an excellent concert with some great vocalists and musicians backing up Mr. Gilmour. He will definitely take you back in time to some great songs! I just wish I had this on a CD so I could listen in my car.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Though this is my first backpack, I gave it 5 stars because it really does meet and exceed my needs so far. I've been doing research on other backpacks and the Koolerton backpacks caught my eye because they are rugged and don't look bad either. The price was a bit more than I wanted to pay though. Nikon brand slr bags were expensive and I knew I'd be paying for the name and I didn't want to go real cheap and end up buying another bag in a few months. ALL ROADS POINTED TO THE AMAZONBASICS BAG!<br /><br />The backpack isn't AS small as most would think. I am 6'2&#34; and the backpack looks fine on me and has room enough for my lenses (Nikon 70-200mm, Nikon 55-210mm, and the stock lens for my D3000)<br /><br />This bag also fits my Nikon 1 J1 and stock lens plus my 30-110mm lens for the J1. The J1 lenses are small but still need room and I've been able to create it with the padding provided.<br /><br />The bag is comfortable and the back padding plus shoulder padding is really good. I've had this bag for a little over a month and I've taken it with me to roughly 3 shoots and 2 out of the 3 times I've had my tripod attached to the side and its held the tripod firmly.<br /><br />Pretty much everything I need and have fits in this bag. My usb cables, SD card case, both chargers for my cameras, lens caps and covers, laptop if need be (macbook pro 13&#34;), 1TB EXT hard drive and whatever else i can think of. Overall, this bag is a great start if you are working on becoming more professional (looking) and need a bag to hold all of your equipment or you're semi-pro and don't want to spend the money for whatever brand you prefer.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game! I've been hooked since the first time I played it. Lots of vehicles to &#34;earn&#34; as well as settings. Well, I have to go play now!
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I bought the book because it was cheap and had an excellent rating and I was incredibly surprised. This book keep me enthralled until the last page. It also wasn't really gorey consider
140006922X|1.0|Why would I waste my time or money on a book written by a Muslim who bashes Christianity?  He simply wants to push his Muslim agenda on American citizens.  He has a right to his opinions but people should know who he is and why he is writing this book.  I wonder what would happen if a Christian wrote a similar book about Mohamed while living in a Muslim country?<br /><br />I have enough intelligence to know that reading a book by an anti-Christian Muslim is going to be biased just like reading a book by a klu klux klan member would be biased against blacks.  Doesn't take a Rhodes Scholar to figure that one out!<br /><br />You have a right to know which political agenda this book is supporting.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Boz Scaggs' distinctive voice is richer and grainier than it was when I first became acquainted with his work more than 30 years ago, but some features remain the same. The soul tradition, the emphasis on quality supporting musicians and great production are evident in this latest release. There are some very memorable tracks here -- some of them covers, and to me that speaks to the distinctiveness and superiority of Boz as a vocalist. It's pretty hard to take Loce on a Tow Way Street and make it your own.<br />My 7 YO daughter found this sitting around the house and popped it into her CD player to fall asleep to. And we've been going to sleep with Boz for more than three weeks. As a result I've only heard the second \\"side\\" a few times but am on the whole delighted.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|I bought it for one song, and got a few good ones. I love most of Dave's stuff, and admire his spirit. He sure has mellowed as an old man. I met him once, and had no idea it was him. I figured later it out when I saw an interview of him. He looks totally different, with short hair, and a hat, and sunglasses. Plus he was just talking to some people I knew like we all were just some guys hanging out. They knew it was him, but didn't know I didn't, so they didn't tell me.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|this is a great movie. it was a great book set as well. we liked it when it came out and still enjoy a twilight movie night.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Entertaining and interesting, not remarkable or groundbreaking, but a good time and as good as I could have expected.  I enjoy this type of movie and this was no exception -- pretty solid work.
B006LSZECO|3.0|**Spoilers are contained in this review**<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's latest book comes with many shockers with completely unexpected connections, but the underlying theme that women are better than men even if [SPOILER ALERT] the woman is a psycho who can justify a year of planning to frame her husband and then take him back as if he was the one who was wrong is a little annoying. That's not to say men are perfect; adultery isn't the best. But [MAJOR SPOILER] with Amy having no repercussions for her craziness, it gives off the feel that if you're psycho enough, you can pull anything off. And it's not the best message to send to any women looking to get revenge.
B0001MIQHQ|4.0|These guys were a little less than obvious about the region this was from. Luckily we had just purchased a DVD player that plays any region a week before.<br /><br />this is the DVD player just in case anyone else has the same problem<br />[[ASIN:B007Y76JAM B007Y76JAM]]
B005UKK4Y2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! There were lots of moments that I was literally laughing out loud! I think most people will appreciate their bosses after watching this =)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is crazy awesome!<br />The quality and reliability of this app is out standing.<br />The performance is unreal. It gives you accurate weather reports and it douse more then just that. You can watch weather and Brink videos on it + it has this really cool map! If you are thinking of buying a weather app the weather channel is definitely the why to go.
0439023491|5.0|I enjoyed the first book, now the second one is great, the next is the third all before the movie comes out.
B001AEF6C2|5.0|Great film, great soundtrack, nice and clear picture. I have missed this movie, and I'm glad I finally got it on DVD.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this movie as the story line stayed on track with the book. Good acting<br />And happy ending.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|This a great story of a great man. Thanks to this documentary, Rodriguez' legacy will not be lost in the shuffle.  I would recommend this for any music fan.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I expected a warmth that I received from the authors first two books which I found lacking in the novel. There were too many d<br />ifferent stories to digest till they all blended in at the finish.  The story could have taken place in Brooklyn with minor exceptions.Personally I was dissappointed.
B006MPKD54|4.0|I am afraid I am a fan of Michael Connelly so  this is not an unbiassed review. I love his attention to detail and the plot twists keep me interested and alert. I found The Black Ice hard to put down as I have found in other novels written by him. I thought of rating it 5 stars but balked at giving it a perfect score.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very representative of the movie, fluid motion and cool graphics. Enjoyable throughout each scene. Keeps my boy intrigued and captivated.
0802473156|5.0|I love this book. I have bought several copies over the years. I pass it on to people all the time. It arrived quickly and great condition!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I love E-Bay but the format is very difficult to use on the Android phone. Nothing like using a computer. I really wanted to like it but find it is to dissimilar to the computer format I am used to.
140006922X|2.0|Originally published on my blog westmetromommy.blogspot.com<br />2.5 Stars<br /><br />I am truly conflicted about this book.  On one hand, there is much to recommend it.  On the other hand, I feel that Aslan missed his mark on many points.<br /><br />One of the best things about this book is Aslan's skill at recreating the world of first century Palestine for the modern reader.  Israel/Palestine/The Holy Land has never been a place of calm, but it may have been at its most chaotic during that time (even more so than the modern day).  I've read many books about the history of Jesus and Zealot is the first one I've come across that takes the time to explain the world of Jesus as Aslan does.<br /><br />Another area where I think Aslan excelled was in his discussion of the theological battles between James and Paul.  I don't quite agree with all of his claims, but it was one part of the book where I learned something new and it did leave me with a new outlook on some of the Epistles.<br /><br />For the most part, Aslan has a very readable style.  I have a high tolerance for \\"academic\\" writings, but I really felt that Aslan wrote at a level that most people would find accessible--most of the time.  There were about 4 or 5 sections of the book where Aslan allows himself to get so bogged down with details that I had to keep referring several pages back to see what his original point was.<br /><br />All that being said, I found some serious flaws with this book.  When a book is written about any historical and religious figure, there is a very thin line the author must walk.  There have been authors who have successfully navigated this when writing about Jesus (Marcus Borg is one that comes to mind), but Aslan trips spectacularly over that line with his own assumptions that he fails to back up with any sort of actual proof.<br /><br />There were three instances that really stuck out to me, which I will address in reverse order.  The last of these was when it came to Saul/Paul and his conversion experience.  Aslan's argument is that it never happened--it was a creation of Luke when he wrote the book of Acts.  Aslan argues that it must not have happened because Paul never talks of it.  First of all, that's not exactly true.  While Paul does not precisely recount the incident, he alludes to it several times in his letters.  Secondly, why would Paul write about it? He's not writing a record of his life.  He's writing letters to congregations who have met him and know about him and would definitely have been aware of his conversion experience.  Not only do I believe Aslan to be incorrect on this point, but he uses his assumption as fact.<br /><br />The second instance is in reference to the Resurrection.  Aslan states that it is a matter of faith and can not be proven in history--which is completely true.  But he then goes on with the assumption that it never happened, which can't be proven either, making the rest of that section meaningless.<br /><br />The first instance, and the one that totally knocked me off my feet, regards the miracles of Jesus.  Aslan spends little time talking about Jesus' parables and miracle.  For the parables, he only addresses the ones that he can make fit into his thesis and ignores the many (and more famous) ones that do not.  As for miracles, Aslan writes it of as....magic.  Yes, magic.  And not magic as in David Copperfield-like illusions, but honest to goodness Holy Harry Potter magic.<br /><br />Aslan's greatest problem is that he mistakes his own assumptions as fact.  He leaves no room for the possibility of anything.  When he has no proof for or against that Jesus and John the Baptist were relatives, he immediately assumes that they weren't.  Why not go with, maybe they were or maybe they weren't?  When Aslan says (page 121 of my ARC), \\"Yet if one wants to uncover what Jesus himself truly believed, one must never lose sigh of this fundamental fact: Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew and nothing more,\\"  what makes that a fundamental fact?  Because Aslan says so?  He also said Jesus was \\"magic.\\"  Ignoring what you cannot explain does not create facts, it creates opinions.<br /><br />Beyond the \\"facts\\" of his own creation, there really isn't anything in this book regarding Jesus that I haven't read elsewhere.  I do feel that Aslan's constant assertions that his assumptions are facts very quickly become patronizing to the reader, which colors the positive aspects of this book.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book?  I don't know.  If I were to recommend it, it would be to someone who I know reads with a discerning eye who would be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to say.  I do think that there are parts of this book that are valuable, but other sections (well, the large middle section) which are questionable at best.<br /><br />Aslan's thesis seems to be that Christianity misses the point of Jesus.  However, I think it is Reza Aslan who is missing the point.kes that a fundamental fact?  Because Aslan says so?  He also said Jesus was \\"magic.\\"  Ignoring what you cannot explain does not create facts, it creates opinions.<br /><br />Beyond the \\"facts\\" of his own creation, there really isn't anything in this book regarding Jesus that I haven't read elsewhere.  I do feel that Aslan's constant assertions that his assumptions are facts very quickly become patronizing to the reader, which colors the positive aspects of this book.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book?  I don't know.  If I were to recommend it, it would be to someone who I know reads with a discerning eye who would be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to say.  I do think that there are parts of this book that are valuable, but other sections (well, the large middle section) which are questionable at best.<br /><br />Aslan's thesis seems to be that Christianity misses the point of Jesus.  However, I think it is Reza Aslan who is missing the point.

B002OMZTSK|5.0|The Geography Club is the first book in the Russel Middlebrook Series by Brent Hartinger and sets the stage for what's to come. The story is engaging and well written making it a highly enjoyable read.<br /><br />The author does an incredible job of capturing the timeless high school experience faced by teens of past and present making it simple to identify with the situations faced by the story's characters. Geography Club is a heartfelt reminder of just how tough life is for teens and even though they differ as individuals they are all simply seeking to fit in and be accepted for who they are.<br /><br />I found Geography Club to be an encourage story of teens stepping outside their social boundaries and cleverly finding a way to be themselves. I highly recommend picking up a copy of Geography Club

B004SEUJBE|5.0|This is a really fun movie with great acting and great music. There are so many wonderful actors in this movie.
0553386794|2.0|I've heard so many good things about this book and the show, so figured I'd had to give it a read. I originally started it 2 years ago. Would get bored of it and then come back after done with other books and then get bored again.<br /><br />It took till the last 5-6 chapters before it finally got halfway decent and I got interested. Overall I felt most the book was just boring. May try and read 2nd book to see if it gets any better. But as of now I wouldn't recommend the series to anyone. If interested would be easy and quicker to watch HBO series.
044661758X|5.0|I toggled back and forth with the audio version and the print version, but had to finish it quickly. As for the audio, the narration was superb,Dick Hill does a great job, I just like to switch around with both versions.<br />This is one of those books that grabs you from the start, and won't let go. The character development is fantastic, and you love to hate Honey Chandler, as she tears Harry's court case to shreds.  Harry fights a few inner demons, as he tries to commit to Sylvia, along with the stress of court and a new found serial killer.  The whole book, is a fabulous \\"who done it\\" which you may or may not figure out. (I thought I knew, but didn't)and that's one thing I loved about the book, it just wasn't easy to solve the case. There's a whole group of juicy suspects out there, that Harry speculates on, with a few stumbles along the way. It's an all around great crime story, with plenty of suspense and a few chuckles thrown in.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I really like Freecell solitaire so thought I'd try this.  It took a few games to catch on to how it works &amp; the underlying strategy: this is more than a game of luck or just matching pictures.  Once that clicks it's s lot of fun.
B00BB8PWSK|5.0|Awesome movie, especially if ur a little inebriated...  If you know what I mean! i need 6 more words.... blah..

B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game isn't for just a kind of group of gamers ANYONE can play it for example say you like dinosaurs you can make all your favourite dinosaur s<br /><br />Also it's just like the console or DS version it has features like the magnifying glass and you can choose different avatars graphics are pretty good everything looks like it's been knitted together I don't really use the missions much I use the menu sandbox unlike missions you can make what ever and make it fight or interact with it if your a parent your kids will love it if they can spell it it can teach you lots of new words one of the best games ever
1401235425|5.0|I've been having problems getting into a new series lately so I gave this one a try and I have to say it was very good read. One thing that bugged me a little was the art, most of the people looked very similar, but it was easy to identify. This is something that never really bothered me, overall though I have to say it was great.
B00CXQL828|4.0|The Winery Dogs is a fine project with a very good debut and room for improvement as well, so I'm hopeful.  I can't bring myself to the full-five star gushing that the album is largely getting, nor am I pulling back from that as a reaction to the praise.  I'm simply not the type to levy undo criticism merely to counter-point.  In fact I'm ecstatic that it's being received so well by listener and critic alike.  No, this really is a very good record, but it's not perfect.<br /><br />The good is obvious: the band is of enormous talent and that's on display here.  Richie Kotzen now has a chance to be known to more than 8 people across the world and good for him because his degree of prowess deserves a broader stage.  The vocals are largely terrific, aside from the occasional big chorus that isn't entirely necessary.  Sometimes I think just Kotzen's voice would suffice.  Billy Sheehan's lead bass style may not be everyone's cup of tea and far from the traditional role on that instrument, but I've always been a fan and he's on full display here.  Mike Portnoy, well, I'm just not a fan.  I've never much dug his over-the-top histrionics in Dream Theater, but to his credit he's pulled back here considerably.  I really thought he'd be the proverbial bull in the china shop, and while I largely deem his playing on this debut album to be nothing spectacular, it's also not the train wreck I fearing it would be either.  So props to \\"Silent Bob\\" (pick another visual style, Michael) for exercising much appreciated restraint.<br /><br />The songs are a bit hit-and-miss with me, none of it owing to the playing or the album's sonics, but rather the writing...which is occasionally just at the rock blandola level.  Only on one occasion does the album dip into the skipable area and that's on the unfortunate We Are One, which musically is fine enough, but whose lyrics are so bad I ultimately deleted it from my playlist.  I'm not normally a lyrical guy (especially rock wordsmithing), but bad lyrics and a cheesy chorus can tank a tune if you're not careful.  On an already indulgent album, this definitely should have gotten the boot.<br /><br />The good news is that beyond that cut, the songs range from very listenable to downright excellent.  Elevate, I'm No Angel, You Saved Me, Time Machine, Regret, and the incredible The Dying all make my best-of-show and easily worth the purchase price alone.  Criminal (overseas release only) is also a choice cut if you can acquire it.  The others are serviceable, although I'm not blown away by the others, except in fits and starts (ooh, I like that solo; ooh, I like that bass line there, etc).<br /><br />I'd really like to see these guys work with an involved producer, talented as they may be, for focus and direction and to avoid the pitfalls of self-editing.  I think with touring and maybe some writing on the road, they can have their Black Country Communion 2 equivalent because I believe there's still room to grow as a unit, maybe over multiple albums if they're blessed enough to not self destruct or let egos or boredom get in the way of a promising thing, also a BCC reference, but also a nod to the journeyman nature of these three guys and their many projects.  If they make an album that matches their potential, watch out.  So far that hasn't happened and I'm actually glad.  It's nice to see a band make a record that likely isn't destined to be the best thing they ever did right out of the gate.  Nowhere to go but lateral or down if you blow your load right from the start.<br /><br />Personally I'd like to see The Winery Dogs get a little edgier, dirtier, and a bit more dangerous in their writing.  Heavier too.  Their Fair Warning, for lack of a better description.  Somewhere between Kotzen's solo song You Can't Save Me, Elevate, and Time Machine  -- mixed in with a dabbling of the types of moods reached for on The Dying - lies an ideal album.  I'd be for kicking the arena choruses and oooh-ahhh backing vocals to the curb to get a bit nastier as well.<br /><br />4-stars
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Just thought I try this &#34;Cold Fact&#34; cd out since seeing Rodriguez on 60 Minutes. Very impressive to say the least, especially back then. Lyrics are great and the music is short and sweet and stays in your head for days and months to come.
B008XGW1CI|5.0|It was a relief to know that J.K. Rowling decided to to write a completely different kind of novel after her success with Harry Potter. Her first venture into the adult market has proved that she can write and entertain us in the real world as well as fantasy. I am actually not sure if I would have chosen to read this novel from the blurb had it been by an unknown author, but because it was written by J.K Rowling that was a different matter. She has always claimed that she uses real people as the basis of stories and this comes across with totally believable characters in 'The Casual Vacancy' which is an interesting bird's eye look into life in a small town in the UK, sadly probably pretty near the mark when it comes to home truths about society today! I was not surprised to read that the BBC are already planning an adaptation of the novel for television, where its realistic drama will come across well. The character development is excellent but the plot is purposely slow so it takes time and patience in your reading as you need to get to know the individuals personalities in this character driven novel.<br /><br />The cast of characters is indeed long but then this is a story about an entire community and how the death of Barry Fairbrother, local councillor relates to the problems, personalities and politics of the different individuals. Everyone seems to be at war with someone highlighting the prejudices that truly exist in small towns all over the country. Set in the fictional village of Pagford, the story hinges on a council election, the outcome of which will decide whether a whether a council estate called the Fields remains part of the village or becomes part of a neighbouring town. Rich versus poor, teenagers versus parents, married couples versus each other and teachers versus pupils. There is indeed plenty of anguish to keep you entertained in this 503 page novel as the inhabitants of Pagford face up to each other over this Casual Vacancy. Be warned though that there are not many light moments, there is lots of bad language and no happy ending, so in conclusion another great read from J.K. Rowling but definitely for older readers.that there are not many light moments, there is lots of bad language and no happy ending, so in conclusion another great read from J.K.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|It was better than I expected by a million miles. I highly recommend setting aside any notions of what it might be like. Warning some areas are mature and not for the &#34;Disney&#34; moms out there. But if you want real feeling propped up by great writing and some of the best television acting I have seen in quite some time this is the show for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is simply amazing it runs so smoothly and just WOW I love it!! People need to get this game! I wish it would update for more features but its still a good game overall!

0486275590|4.0|Considered by some critics to be both RLS' best novel and the last word in pirate adventure TREASURE ISLAND has captivated readers (children of all ages) for more than a century. Stevenson's range of literary genres is impressive, to say the least: adventure novels based in Scotland, gentle verses for youngsters (A Child's Garden of Verses); a peek into California history (Silverado Squatters and drawing inspiration from Point Lobos for this story); plus short stories dealing with mystery, intrigue, and gothic horror (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde). There is something for everyone in his literary catalogue, yet this proves the novel that first comes to mind when Stevenson's name is mentioned.<br /><br />Sometimes criticized for his implausible coincidence and excessive use of foreshadowing, RLS skillfully unrolls a story which reads like a map of pirate treasure. Here he has served up a composite pirate stew--complete with mutinous traditions, intrigue, dastardly plots and counterplots, betrayal, and blood thirsty mayhem. All of which is guaranteed to capture the imagination of youthful readers and fireside armchair swashbucklers. RLS' characters verily leap from the pages and the rigging into our hearts and imagination!<br /><br />A naive boy named Jim Hawkins is forced to serve aboard the<br />HISPANIOLA--a ship with a brutal captain, a cutthroat crew and a secret but questionable destination. Leery of the peg-legged Long John Silver Jim is quickly initiated into the duties of cabin boy, where all hands seem against him. Mysterious Benn Gunn and Flint, the parrot (come on--what self-respecting pirate ship would set sail without poll?) might offer him respite. If it comes to taking sides, where is Jim's young conscience or--more to the sword point--his desire to survive the vicious schemes and fathomless avarice of the nefarious Silver?<br /><br />Stevenson scatters pearls of symbolism throughout the briny tale and Jim proves surprisingly psychic at the end--predicting future fates for many on board. This is no low-tide bedtime read for landlubbers. But would we really expect, or even Want, Long John Silver to be reformed? To paraphrase ACGoV: What were boyhood--wanting you?
