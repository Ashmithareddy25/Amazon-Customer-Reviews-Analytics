B004ZGI1V0|3.0|'Unknown's' plot involves a series of unlikely deviations from an implausible (overly complex) assassination plot aimed at giving seed companies patent control over a professor's newly developed version of genetically-modified corn. Yet, even within this unlikely/implausible setting, viewers immediately also sense the eventual separation of Neeson from his 'wife,' and joining forces with the female cab driver that saved his life in the beginning scenes. Overall, the film is tolerable, but sometimes irritating because of its implausibility and complexity.

B0051CSIKQ|5.0|I love horror & suspense movies but I have to admit that sometimes the storyline and acting can often be typical or just plain bad. This is especially true when you get into vampire type movies. This is a vampire movie that will take you by surprise. It has a good storyline, good acting, intelligence & emotion. It's your typical horror movie in the sense that there are vampires, they only come out at night, you must stake them to kill them, they want blood, have fangs, etc. The only difference is their appearance & the way they act is more zombie like. The movie starts out typical. Vampire plague has taken over, few survivors, no government and a teenage boy who is taken under the wing of a lone man who loves to kill vampires. They head North, to where they believe there are no vampires, the rest of the story is their journey together. There are various people introduced along the way, some good, some not. I found myself bonding with the characters, developing emotional ties, and I never once got bored. This is the movie to watch if you want to see what it probably would have been like in real life if a vampire like plague took over the world. For the true horror fan, there is plenty of blood & gore.
B004RC8NXI|4.0|I was actually quite surprised at how good `No Strings Attached' was. I was expecting it to be quite disappointing and a lack lustre affair, but it had some good laughs and a reasonably good plot too.<br /><br />Featuring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher this follows two characters called Emma and Adam as they try to have a relationship where they have plenty of sex, but don't fall in love. Emma, who has intimacy problems, finds this concept easier than Adam and that is when the problems start.<br /><br />This has some decent jokes in it and it had me laughing out loud a few times. Both Portman and Kutcher play their roles well and you tend to feel their was genuine chemistry between them. Kevin Kline as Adams father also has some great lines and raises some laughs.<br /><br />I loved the soundtrack, which features one of my favourite bands (The Temper Trap) and the songs match the scenes very well. The story was also quite good, with some great dialogue and it didn't feel overlong or tedious at any point.<br /><br />All in all this made for just under two hours entertaining viewing and it is an easy going and reasonably funny film. It is well worth checking out and whilst you won't be rushing to watch it again straight afterwards, I didn't regret watching it at all.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

1439102724|5.0|Jodi Picoult may be the most fearless bestselling author of our time.<br /><br />In \\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" she told the story of Anna, who was conceived solely for the purpose of harvesting blood from her umbilical chord and her bone marrow so they could be used to save her older sister, Kate, who has leukemia.<br /><br />Picoult went deep into the minds of those involved in a school shooting in \\"Nineteen Minutes.\\"<br /><br />She shined a light on organized religion and the death penalty in \\"Change of Heart.\\"<br /><br />Rather than sensationalizing her subject matter, Picoult explores all angles of the issues she tackles, leaving it up to her readers to decide their point of view.<br /><br />In her latest book, \\"Sing You Home,\\" Picoult takes on the issue of same sex marriage and gay rights.<br /><br />Music therapist Zoe Baxter and her landscaper husband, Max, tried for years to have a child. The emotional and financial strain of in vitro treatments and a devestating miscarriage destroy their marriage.<br /><br />After the divorce, both characters hit bottom. Zoe goes catatonic. Max seeks comfort in a bottle.<br /><br />A chance encounter with Vanessa Shaw, a colleague, leads to a much-needed friendship for Zoe, as she begins to put her life back together.<br /><br />Max's wealthy brother and sister-in-law, Reid and Liddy, let him live in their home. The couple faces issues of infertility, too.<br /><br />They're members of the Eternal Glory Church, led by charismatic preacher Clive Lincoln. They believe Max needs a good dose of God to counter his alcohol addiction.<br /><br />As time passes, Zoe develops a physical attraction to Vanessa, a school counselor who has been \\"out of the closet\\" for a long time. The two fall in love and want to make their relationship permanent. Since their home state of Rhode Island doesn't recognize same sex marriage, they travel to nearby Massachusetts for their nuptials.<br /><br />After their marriage, Zoe and Vanessa decide to try to have a baby, using three frozen embryo left over from Zoe and Max's final attempt to conceive. Zoe needs Max's approval to use the eggs.<br /><br />All hell breaks loose when Clive Lincoln finds out what Zoe wants.<br /><br />He calls in lawyers and, before they know it, Max, Vanessa and Zoe's lives are put under a microscope, sensationalized and played out in a Rhode Island courtroom.<br /><br />After so much heartbreak, Zoe just wants to live happily ever after and raise a child with Vanessa. Having every moment of her life exposed in public is more than she ever expected, and is almost more than she can handle.<br /><br />Vanessa knows what it's like to live an alternative lifestyle. She loves Zoe unconditionally, but  there are secrets in her past she would rather not confront.<br /><br />Max is confused by the radical reaction his church and family have to Zoe and Vanessa's request. He fights the urge to pick up a bottle, with some days being a total loss. He's also dealing with a secret that could have devastating consequences should it come to light.<br /><br />In less accomplished hands, this storyline could have become preachy and petty.<br /><br />Picoult, however, lets the action unfold by using each character's point of view to drive the plot. Just when your mind is made up about the dilemma facing Zoe, Max and Vanessa, someone else's voice chimes in and makes you think again.<br /><br />This is the brilliance of Picoult. She gives her readers every side of the stickiest issues, all the while teaching us the importance of compassion and understanding for those who don't believe as we do or live as we've been taught to live.<br /><br />By tackling some of society's hot button topics with such intelligence and insight, Jodi Picoult allows the rest of us a safe place to enter the dialogue. She gives equal weight to all sides of the issue, then steps aside to let her readers figure out where they stand.<br /><br />Picoult's stories stay with you long afterthe final page is turned. And, to me, that's one of the most important earmarks of a great story, well told.

She also believes her banker was caught in a deadly Mafia double-cross.<br /><br />And, she has hired another attorney to handle all the publicity and to shop a possible movie deal around Hollywood.<br /><br />As evidence against Trammel mounts and a murder trial looms,  Haller has a hard time getting to  the truth.<br /><br />But after he's beaten to a pulp by two thugs, Haller begins to explore the possibility that the murder victim was indeed involved in something other than just fraudulent lending.<br /><br />Did the former schoolteacher really deliver a fatal blow to the banker with a household hammer in a public garage on a sunny California morning? Or did hired guns frame Trammel for the crime?<br /><br />In a YouTube video, Connelly talks a bit about the plot.<br /><br />\\"The Lincoln Lawyer is back,\\" says the author who has sold over 42 million books. \\"The erstwhile criminal defense attorney is at his usual scrapping and scrambling best in the lower trenches of the justice system. What happens outside of the courtroom is equally important as what happens inside the courtroom.\\"<br /><br />The courtroom scenes are first-rate. However, after a lot of twists and turns, Connelly wraps things up with a never-see-it-coming ending that feels just a little too self-righteous to be real.o self-righteous to be real.

0553386794|1.0|I bought this book after finishing everything I could find written by Brandon Sanderson and Patrick Rothfuss. I have found their books thus far to be extremely well written, creative, and full of heart.<br /><br />I will not deny that Martin is an engaging writer. His plots are interesting. BUT the spirit underneath is incredibly depressing. I have zero desire to read the appalling scenes of rape and child incest/abuse that he describes, sometimes with what seems to be joy. I refuse to think that the \\"comfort\\" he describes in various characters is actually \\"realistic\\" as many reviewers seem to think. Horrible things are horrible. I think he is out of touch. I would like to vomit after reading his \\"she wants it\\" description of a 13 year old in a forced marriage on her wedding night.<br /><br />Personally I much prefer to read a writer who, in the words of a reviewer of Rothfuss' The Name of the Wind, deserves the following accolade: \\"It's not the fantasy trappings (wonderful as they are) that make this novel so good, but what the author has to say about true, common things, about ambition and failure, art, love, and loss.\\"<br /><br />I am truly appalled that this is the kind of book that the American public finds fascinating and that this is a best-seller.

Bone Burnett (Of \\"Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" and \\"Crazyheart\\" fame) produced and helped with song selection.<br /><br />Allman's put together some fabulous songs and a tremendous roster of talent for the record.<br /><br />Allman's clean and sober. He underwent a successful liver transplant this summer.<br /><br />In a promotional video for the CD, Allman says, \\"I liked one of a kind stuff. I still do. I love Muddy Waters. I have everything that Howlin' Wolf ever cut. Same way with Lightnin' Hopkins.\\"<br /><br />Allman grew up listening to the Delta Blues on radio station WLAC in Nashville.<br /><br />\\"They played old blues stuff,\\" Allman said. \\"That's when I first heard Little Milton and that's when I first heard Jimmy Smith.\\"<br /><br />When it came to cutting this record, Allman was at a loss for a producer. His long-time collaborator, Tommy Dowd, died in 2002.<br /><br />Allman found a kindred soul in T. Bone Burnett.<br /><br />\\"We seemed to have the same outlook on the same things,\\" Allman said.<br /><br />According to Allman, Burnett had a modem full of songs,he wanted Allman to hear.<br /><br />\\"He said,' I'm going to peel off about 20 of them and send `em to you,'\\" Allman explained.<br /><br />Once they picked the songs and sat down to record, Allman added the Muddy Waters' tune \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\" to the set list.<br /><br />\\"These are songs that your average Joe hasn't heard,\\" Allman said.<br /><br />The CD includes \\"Floating Bridge,\\" (Sleepy John Estes); \\"Little by Little,\\" (Jr. Wells); \\"Devil Got My Woman\\" (Skip James); \\"Blind Man,\\" (Bobby Bland); \\"Please Accept My Love\\", (B.B.

Newfound sobriety has obviously calmed his spirit and soothed his restless soul.<br /><br />\\"In my younger years, I thought a couple of shots of brandy would get me in the mood. Wrong,\\" Allman says. \\"Or a shot of cocaine. Wrong.

I hope the book helps her heal and serves to help others through her foundation. A very sad statement of the probation system and how this country so poorly tracks and punishes child predators.  Jaycee describes in detail about her captor, how evil a man he was along with his wife and how our legal system failed miserably in contolling him with multiple opportunities to do so.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This is another one of those books that has great promise - with an inventive plot, interesting characters and unusual magic like a house that reacts to it's inhabitants, but it falls short. When Diana a witch in denial meets Matthew, a powerful, learned and (natch) gorgeous vampire, the story is compelling. Witches, daemons and vamps are all in search of an ancient manuscript when in the course of her own doctoral research, it literally falls into Diana's hands and Matthew is there to witness it. The ensuing story arc brings them together but then all manner of hell breaks loose with myriad characters and changes of venue. The author has a talent for creating magical events but I wished there had been more of that and less of the muddled brew of a storyline that ensues. Obviously, this is just the first in a series and one can only hope that in the sequel the author recaptures some of the magic that she created early on.
B001TIQTFC|3.0|I know, Nick Cave is a demigod and all that, novelist, screenwriter, director, collaborator with Marianne Faithful (who also knew how to do maudlin to death), but seriously? Seriously? He's hamming it up all over this album. If you read the liner notes, you'll think he invented music out of nothing, like some Nordic Prometheus from Down Under. I prefer to think these kids got high, turned off the lights in the studio, lit flashlights under their chins, and cranked out this noise. Which should sound like more fun, now that you mention it. I guess guilt is harder to purge than we all would like to admit... though if you want to hear the audio equivalent of having sex while trapped in a cramped metal locker in a hot desert warehouse, I suggest Track 2.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|When considering Yes, one needs to be careful about being pigeon hold into what a number of old time Yes fans consider the classic line up from the early 70's which included Jon Anderson on vocals, Chris Squire on bass, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitar and Rick Wakeman on keyboards. These five represented a snapshot in time that produced two beloved recordings, Fragile and Close to the Edge. The reality is Yes has had no fewer than 4 lead singers, 4 guitarists, 2 drummers, 6 keyboardists and only one bass guitarist, that being Chris Squire. The latest 2011 line up is in a sense a resurrection of the 1980 band which produced the recording Drama. Anderson and Wakeman had left the band signaling what might have been the end of Yes but a chance meeting with two young musicians, vocalist Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes of the then emerging late 70's techno progressive rock band, the Buggles, lead to life for Yes. The Drama album fused new elements into the band with a heavier sound along with a touch of the 80's with a great treatment of the Buggles song I am a Camera, reworked here as Into the Lens. Songs like Machine Messiah, Tempus Fugit and Into the Lens provided a bridge from the 70's into the 80's. Sadly the adoring British fans were very critical of the changes. Geoff left after Drama to form the wildly popular Asia, along with Steve Howe, and Trevor went on to become a highly sought after producer working with a wide variety of artists including Yes when they released Owners of a Lonely Heart.   Many personnel changes have taken place since 1980 to the present, leading us to the current Yes line up of Squire, Howe, long time drummer Alan White who replaced Bill Bruford after Close to the Edge, the return of Geoff Downes on keyboards and new singer Benoit David who has toured with the band for the last several years.     Fly From Here in a sense picks up from 1980. Trevor Horn has returned, producing Fly from Here, and Geoff is once again handling the keyboards. The new recording features the title song that was originally written back during the Drama years and Yes had kicked around having it included on Drama, but feeling they had enough material, Fly from Here was tucked into the vault. Yes had not produced a new studio recording in 10 years and it was unlikely that a new recording was going to emerge from the touring version of Yes. But add Geoff and Trevor to the core of Chris, Steve and Alan along with Benoit, and all the pieces where in place for the first new Yes music in a decade. For the recording, the original title song has been reworded into a large 6 part piece in the tradition of many long Yes compositions. This piece is followed by 5 additional songs. The title song starts with the instrumental Overture that introduces us to the musical themes that will appear throughout the following 5 parts. Steve's guitar and Geoff's keyboards are front and center and are aptly augmented by the solid bass and drumming of Chris and Alan.  After Overture, Benoit makes his first vocal appearance on Part 1. In a sense we are seeing the birth of this singer who was hired because he sounds so much like Jon Anderson. Interestingly, Trevor has him sounding more like himself than Anderson on much of the songs. The music and vocals are lively and refreshing, reminding me of what made Yes so popular back the late 60's. Steve's playing is wonderful throughout and it becomes evident with repeat listening that he poured a lot of himself into this effort. Geoff, one of the finest progressive keyboard players around provides great piano and synth playing with some occasional organ, all in the grand tradition of the Yes sound. This sound transported me back to the Drama period which is, in my opinion, the most under rated period of Yes. What they started back then was actually too far ahead of its time, fusing the sound of two different, yet pioneering bands. It is a mistake to dismiss what The Buggles had created, andwhen you combine Yes with what they brought to the table you have a sound that is enjoyable and satisfying and groundbreaking in its own right. The title song comes to a grand close with the sweeping Reprise featuring soaring keyboards, punctuating bass and wonderful guitar.    Next up is the new The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be which opens with acoustic and electric guitar. The lyrics still have that esoteric 70'sYes feel yet they seem to be more meaningful. Alan's drumming provides a backdrop with some mellow and tasteful chops accompanied by some nice bass from Chris. Steve continues to shine with his playing and Benoit provides a nice vocal touch. I really enjoy Trevor keeping everything in a somewhat dreamy balance.    Life on a Film Set written by Downes and Horn opens with mellow acoustic guitar and vocal. Geoff joins in and then Chris and Alan to create a really great sounding song. Midway through the song, Steve puts down some nice acoustic guitar followed by Geoff's keys. At this point this actually reminds me of the sound of a great newer progressive sounding band named Magenta. Benoit's vocals are excellent throughout showing off this talent singer.    Hour of Need, written by Howe opens with some great guitar and a balance of vocals and the rest of the band. A nice keyboard riff adds a progressive feel. The lyrics have the typical positive Yes message and all in all, one of the nicest songs on the recording.    Solitaire, written by Howe shows off his fabulous guitar playing.     The closing song, Into the Storm, is a harder progressive rocker which does remind me again of earlier Yes. Benoit's vocals are solid along with great keyboards and guitar. Chris and Alan are rock solid again showing why they are the best rhythm section in progressive rock. Steve lays down more great riffs over Geoff's keyboards as the song comes to a satisfying close. All in all, Fly From Here is a solid effort by a great band. I only hope that they can continue for a time with this line up and with Trevor returning to produce. It would be worthwhile for them and us.
B00351YEVC|5.0|This is a really easy to read simpy written and relatively short book. There is nothing gross in it, that is written, but it somehow lets your mind do the work. In my opinion, at nearly 60 years of age, this is one of the half dozen best books i have ever read. It gets a clear story across to the reader that is unmistakable. If only adolf hitler had read it around 1939 the world might be a better place. Love it, 10/10.
1451629184|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews on this book, both from Amazon and other places and some of the reviews mentioned lack of detail,missing 'blocks' of time, bad repetition, poor writing, and her 'obsession' with cats.  To those reviews, I'll say this: The lack of detail might be a good thing.  Does the public really want to know the ugly details of 18 years of cruel, sick behavior and rape? I don't really think so.  As for the missing 'blocks' of time...come on, if she were to have written on every detail, every moment of 18 yrs, the book would be longer than than several versions of the bible.  While I did not think the book was repetitive at all, it occurred to me that it could come across like that, because her days were essentially the same much of the time.  She mentioned her boredom and lonliness over again, which tells me there were maany many days that somewhat blended in together, nothing happening, nothing new.  Her love of cats? well of course she had a love of cats.  At that point, she would have loved a friendly spider.  She was locked away for days at at time with no real interaction or stimulating experiences, she turned her emotions towards cats, pets who she loved and brought her no harm.     Overall, the book was excellent.  Anyone expecting an excellent writing, must remember this woman had her education stolen as well as her life, at the age of 11.  That being said, I thought it was exceptionally well written.  Perhaps I took that into mind when reading, thinking of how a fifth grader would write, but it was much better than that.      I was overall inspired by the book, with all the petty things we as humans tend to get upset over, it definitely puts things in perspective.  There was some talk about why she didn't try to escape.  The same concept of why a zebra will stop trying to find a way out of a zoo cage after some time: the knowledge that the confinement is bigger than the concept of escape.  After some time, Jaycee had 2 children she knew she had to protect. In her mind, that meant going along with it as best she could.I think she is incredibly brave and likely one of the strongest women of our time, given what she's had to endure.  I do hope she'll continue with inspiring others to simply survive.
1401207529|4.0|Frank Miller wrote and illustrated what's widely considered to be the apex and the ending of Batman with the \\"Dark Knight Returns.\\"  And now he bring us Batman's beginning with \\"Batman: Year One\\" (which has been used as inspiration for the latest Batman movie.)  The introduction explains that DC in the 80's decided to reboot it's three big franchises and redefine where they came from.  But Batman's beginning was perfect.  But they decided his beginning could be fleshed out a bit and that's what we find out in this novel.  Where Batman came from.  Where Gordon came from.  And how together they began the team that is taking back the streets of Gotham from the criminals.<br /><br />Miller concocts a brilliant story that makes the characters human.  We don't meet the Joker or any of the other slightly crazed villains of Batman in this book.  Instead it's the type of characters that you can imagine meeting in real life.  Corrupt politicians and cops are the villains in this story allowing Batman and Gordon to be the heroes that they are, not because of theatrics.  But because they are human.  They admit their faults and come close to admitting defeat on occasion, but they get back up again and continue the fight.<br /><br />Dave Mazzucchelli is the illustrator on this venture with Miller and his pencils are fantastic, especially when you look at the drawings in the back.  He captures the gritty nature of Batman perfectly and how the characters move.  The colors though leave a bit to be desired.  I know they aren't as over the top as some of the other works produced in this era, but it seems like they obliterate a lot of detail that the pencil drawings had or should have. The artwork still works with the story, I just wish the colors had been less over powering.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Batman or wanting to introduce people to who Batman is then this is a great introduction and I highly recommend it along with Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns.\\"

Because I had barely ever heard of White Collar before I saw the pilot episode on the Season Four DVD set of Burn Notice, another USA show.  It was there, I had 45 minutes to kill, so I watched it.  And ordered White Collar Season One on my next Amazon purchase.  Genius, give people a taste of something, seemingly for free, and get them to spend some money later.  Give that person/people a raise or a promotion.  Or both.    White Collar is another of those charismatic cop shows that have started popping up since The Mentalist came out.  I would imagine that White Collar was in development before that happened, but you can't say that Simon Baker and company didn't grease the skids.  The premise is simple:  Neil Caffrey (Matt Bomer), a forger, theif and all around 'white collar' crook offers to help his FBI catcher, Peter Burke (Tim DeKay).  The deal is this:  Caffrey helps Burke with his cases, Burke keeps him out of prison.  But Caffrey has another agenda as well, his missing ex-girlfriend Kate (Alexandra Daddario), who may or may not be under the control of elements in the FBI.  His search for her, abetted by his friend Mozz (Willie Garson), tends to complicate his professional relationship with Burke, though Burke's wife Eleanor (Tiffani Thiesson) is in Neil's corner, mostly.    Neil might just be the smartest TV cop there is, other than Simon Baker's Patrick Jane from The Mentalist (technically they're both consultants), and that's part compliment part problem, as both characters are geniuses whose personal obsessions are often their undoings.  But they're right a bit too often and easily for realism's sake.  Except that you like both of them so much that ultimately you don't really care.  That's what Matt Bomer brings to the role, he's convincing as a crook with a heart of gold, and is so smooth that it makes me wonder why it took him so long to break out as an actor.  He's got a ton of talent, this won't be his last star vehicle.  Tim DeKay's Peter Burke tries to be the by the book FBI agent, but Neil is not the best influence on him, though they get the job done.  As the season (14 episodes) goes on, he looks the other way more and more often, showing a nice gray area as the two of them become friends and learn to trust each other, a bit.  What I didn't like about him was his constant threatening to Neil to put him back in prison if Case X didn't get solved.  Memo to the writers:  No FBI agent/team solves every single case in a couple of days, or else.  DeKay seemed to overact at times, but I wonder if it was just the contrast to Bomer's smoothness, I'm conflicted there.  Thiessen plays the loving wife, and her byplay with Neil and Mozz is hilarious when it happens.  Mozz is the loyal best friend and wingman for Neil, and Garson plays him humorously, but not slapsticky.  He gets most of the best lines, but that's his job.      The episodes are part single stories, combined with the overall 'find out what happened to Kate' subplot that runs through each of them.  The crimes are highbrow, given the title and theme of the show, and while murder is involved sometimes, it's not that kind of show.  The season ended on......not a cliffhanger per se, but a 'What the......!??!' kind of moment that was not what I was expecting.  That's a good thing by the way.  Yeah, I'll be getting Season Two.    Interesting plot(s), good, sometimes really good, acting, and a fast moving pace.  White Collar is a winner, and while I had a couple of quibbles, it doesn't take away from a 5 star rating.  Maybe more networks should put pilots of their newer shows on DVD's for their hits.  Worked with me, my hard earned dollars are on their way to them.    Five stars.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|At first, this product was great, but after all those time playing COD: Black Ops, it decided to break on me.  This product was cheaply made, or at least the design.  There goes my money down the drain.  And to top it off, the duct tape won't hold it together.  I also duct taped the right side so it will prevent it from breaking.
B004RL9T50|5.0|this is the best animation i have seen in a while. or ever. there was a segway with spikes. karate kid was referenced. the superhero died, but that made the plot very down. it was only a little too over the top, but was voiced well by will ferrel. and i love how jonah hill is destroyed as a character, how he abuses his powers and plays video games.
030746363X|5.0|This book arrived before the estimated date of arrival and it is so informative,  non boring,  and it gets results. Tim's hard work gave results we can actually benefit from. This diet is amazing and has an amazing support group on FaceBook.
B004EPZ08O|1.0|I came with my gf, and was only able to watch the first 20 mins.<br />The only thing this movie did well was gross me out twice. The only good scenes were the ones shown in the trailer... all i have are complaints after. Here is a list of what i did not like:<br />1. the plot is the same as all the other movies<br />2. the CGI was not too good, though it might be intentional<br />3. everything was predictable<br />4. the laws told were disregarded in the end<br />5. it was too violent, but not comparable to the quality of saw.<br /><br />thats all.
B0000C1733|4.0|My wife spun this CD when we were traveling recently via car, and I really liked it. The Chili Peppers have a sound all their own, for the most part; it's hard to classify it at times. I of course recognized many of the popular songs, but was introduced to some others that were equally as good. My personal favorite is BREAKING THE GIRL, which sounds a lot like XTC from the early 80's. Even the vocals sound like Andy Partridge from XTC. For those who want to get to know this group, I recommend this CD. It's consistently entertaining from beginning to end. 8/10
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I'm going to write a very brief review of this book, so I'll just cover a few bases.  To begin with, I think the first three Song of Ice and Fire books are top-tier fantasy novels that easily contend with the likes of Lord of the Rings and the Wheel of Time.  The fourth book, however, A Feast for Crows, left ol' Martin's fanbase decidedly divided.  The book, to me, was basically a well-written intermission of sorts that served to move playing pieces into their places.  I did rather enjoy it, though.  Since that book covered the characters from a certain geography only, then A Dance with Dragons covers the characters who were not in Feast for Crows.  Now, since nothing momentous happened in A Feast for Crows, and nothing momentous was reported from the other characters offscreen, then it should have been a logical conclusion that A Dance with Dragons would be of a similar pace and low-impact plotting as A Feast for Crows.  This turns out to be the case.  A Dance with Dragons is really well done, but it's just very slow and not much happens to advance the overall plot.  There are some really intriguing events being set up, however, and since the book is so well done I found myself really enjoying it, albeit it not nearly as much as the first three books.  I can see why some people are disappointed, though.  Nothing happens in this book that you would want and expect to happen, and since A Feast for Crows was basically a plot doldrum, everyone seemed to hope that A Dance with Dragons would be a fireball of epic grandeur.  Its my opinion that since the last two books were basically huge intermissions of plot organizing, it stands to reason that the final two books of the Ice and Fire series will be mind boggling in scope and action.  In any case, this book leaves me looking ever more forward to the next installment, and let's just hope the intermission phase is over with.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|i LOVE this artist, this album.  Highly recommended.  I'm a musician, video music editor, technical artist and I give this one of my highest ratings.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I'd seen many of the episodes on TV, but recently had the chance to see the entire series from the first episode to the last -- and what a treat it was. The quality of the writing fell after Sorkin left the series, and the following season was the weakest. But after that, it managed to pick up the pace again, and ended up with a bang. The West Wing managed to make politics compelling, funny and  patriotic without being jingoistic.
0857680986|5.0|I wish I would have had this book back in college when I took figure drawing.  The lessons that Loomis teaches here are timeless and invaluable.  I have owned and read a LOT of books on the figure, but once this arrived and I began reading it, I gave all my other books away the next day.  The only other books on the figure that are worth owning are by Michael Hampton and George Bridgman.  But, if you could only buy one book on the figure, this is it!

1599219751|3.0|This is a great story -- it may not have happened exactly the way the author told it, but it has historical truth nonetheless. For a similar story, but one that's true, read COMING OUT OF THE ICE, by Victor Hanson.
B005EPFA8I|3.0|The first 5 minutes of the film are the most interesting, where you are shown the cave for the first time.  The next 90 minutes is dedicated to re-showing the cave, which isn't that large.  There's a lot of analyzing of the cave paintings and much of the film is dedicated to close-ups of the paintings.  There's only so many ways to film this cavern... so, it's a little boring and I found myself beginning to fall asleep after a while.    But still.  Director Werner Herzog is mesmerizing.  As I watched, I began to really appreciate the cave paintings and dream with him about ancient times.  He asks very thought-provoking questions, almost magical ones.  The pacing and music are nice.  So, I still enjoyed the film in the end and feel it opened my perspectives just a bit on being able to appreciate all the histories of a cave.  It helps that this cave isn't just \\"any\\" cave, but one with some of the oldest paintings ever found.  That makes for interesting discussions.    This would be a nice film to watch over some wine on a slow evening.  It's a great way to relax and ponder about life.  You'd need to be in a certain mood to really enjoy it.
0756404738|5.0|I wasn't sure exactly how this book would stack up to the original. It turns out that its just as good as the original. It builds on the awesomeness of Kvothe from the first book and goes into more detail about his adventures. I am concerned whether the last book will be able to cover everything that needs to be covered, but so far Rothfuss has not disappointed so I have faith he will continue the greatness.
B004WESFZW|4.0|This is a good movie, without the gratuitous violence that Hollywood often adds to Philip-K.-Dick-based scripts.  We only watched the DVD version on a laptop so far.
B002AS466O|4.0|It's the '90s and wise cracking, worldweary detectives are going out of style. Bruce Willis is stunned to learn that his newfound buddy, disgraced Football great Damon Wayans bought a 650.00 pair of leather pants.<br /><br />It's the '90s and although Football has surpassed baseball as the national pastime, the salaries and lifestyles of the athletes make it hard for the industry to keep up with its' own popularity! The answer: legalize sports betting for the whole family. Just as Vegas went \\"clean\\", so should professional *sports*. And don't worry about organized crime. They handled losing Cuba and the Nevada casinos.<br /><br />Wayan's girlfriend is an exotic dancer who somehow manages to be the girlfriend of both a major football power-that-be *and* its' one-time King, Wayans. She (Hailee Berry in a rather truncated role) is gunned down. What did she know?<br /><br />Willis' first best friend transfers the case: she had contacted him regarding protection as she felt unsafe. When Willis arrives home he finds the reason his \\"pal\\" doesn't have time for the new assignment. He is having an affair with Willis' wife, played well by Chelsea Field. She injects the expected, long-suffering, exasperated waiting-to-be-liberated woman element without obliterating the romantic feeling she still has only for Bruce. Stuff happens and he sees that he's in alot deeper than the 500.00 gig originally suggested.<br /><br />A few explosions, mad chases, face kicks, lethal punches dispensed with and now Willis and Wayans are a team: both one-time heros, will they regain their titles?<br /><br />Tight direction and a literate script keep it all going. Perhaps a healthy dose of satire may have helped in a few spots where some innocents get thrashed around but this is not a \\"who done it\\" detective story - a fun vehicle for Bruce Willis, at his fightin' weight; for Damon Wayans, more of a chance to showcase his drammatic side.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I blew through The Hunger Games in 1 night so was a little apprehensive about this book; The \\"middle\\" books of a trilogy are notoriously slow and long on exposition... NOT THE CASE HERE!! I was thrilled with this book. I even felt it was paced a bit better than the The Hunger Games. It moved along at an exciting pace and I never felt a lull. A fantastic follow up to THG and a great set up for Mockingjay (which I'm loving already!). This is a phenominal series for all ages and I'm really glad I got sucked in!

0393340244|5.0|After reading this book, I felt compelled to write a review for it. Dr. Fine approaches the delicate topic of gender differences without excessive use of anecdotes and unrelated studies, and maintains throughout the book how relatively new this whole science is. She debunks \\"fact\\" after fact in Dr. Louann Brizendine's book, \\"The Female Brain\\", sometimes sardonically mocking the horrific stereotyping that this type of gender \\"science\\" has caused. Instead of simply blaming everything on society, Dr. Fine acknowledges that some differences may be innate, but that we are far from linking brain structure to mind function and that humans, to a great extent, are influenced by society.     While this may seem like a kind of Captain Obvious claim, I recently looked up a talk that Dr. Brizendine presented at Google. She states \\"In my opinion, the debate between nature and nurture is over [in the favor of nature].\\" Now, with such theories dominating the popular science universe, how do girls ever manage to acquire PhDs in math, or how do boys ever learn to socialize with other human beings?     But I digress. Delusions of the Mind is a tactfully argued, well researched book that takes care not to overstep its limits (in acknowledging that there is much research to be done in this field). The writing is clear and concise, and the pace is admirably fast for such a fact and study-heavy book. The writing, I felt, did not leave much be desired!    Finally, in an effort to minimize the damage done by books like \\"The Female Brain\\" (and its new counterpart, \\"The Male Brain\\"), and \\"Why Men Don't Have a Clue and Why Women Always Need More Shoes\\", which clearly pander to the current social stereotypes, I will be buying copies for myself and my friends.     Highly recommended!
B00192IV9U|4.0|I was undecided at first, on whether or not I would purchase the CD based on mixed reviews. After purchasing just Hold My Hand (MP3 download), I decided to get the whole CD. I'm glad I did. In response to one of the criticisms I most often read, Does MJ sound \\"different?\\" If you are comparing him to his earlier albums then yes. And I would expect that someone's voice would change over the years. Does he still sound fantastic? Absolutely.
B004UHPU5E|5.0|How wonderfully surprised was I by this newest Fripp/Crim ProjeKct.  I must admit that I was beginning to find the Adrian Belew fronted Crimson to be getting both stale and creatively adrift after THRAK.  But this was a breath of fresh air, a \\"fusion\\" between Islands-era Crimson and the more modern work Fripp created with David Sylvian.  While Jakko Jakszyk's voice may not be the strongest, we never listened to Crimson for top-shelf vocals anyway, right Boz?  It's the music that counts, and Mel Collins beautiful and deft saxaphone and flute flourishes steal the show.  I hope this turns into more than a one off ProjeKct and another, somewhat heavier version of this line-up appears.  But if not, this is head music of the highest order.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I have watched every movie rendition of this novel and find some startling and some interpretive differences with almost every one. The latest is very good overall with much of the acting, both spoken and physical, superb. The Bennett house and Donald Southerland as Mr. Bennett were the highlight of the movie as both gave you a true feeling for the time and class structure. It is a must see and for us, a must own.
1591843790|5.0|I have the kindle version and the audio book version from audible.com. I wanted to listen to it while working so I bought an audio version. They say one will not understand someone unless we walked a mile in their shoe. The shared stories gave a glimpse of that. The audio book narration was excellent. Guy reads the introductions. Overall, it is a delightful book, and I know I will recommend it to my friends.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|I heard so much about \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" (2011 remake) that I eventually had to watch the movie myself to see what all the hype was about. Much of the controversy over this movie centers around the level of brutality and torture within the film, and to be honest...I saw the \\"Rated R\\" version rather than the \\"Unrated\\" version, so I am not sure how much of it has been trimmed down and edited from the uncut version. If you have a weak stomach, then at least check out the \\"Rated R\\" version because their isn't much gore, and certainly much less than your average horror movie.    This is a really good movie that was shot as an independent film on a low budget. The acting is quite good, the setting is eerie, and the plot centers around a very real evil in society (rape). In reality, this film is almost like two separate films - The Rape and The Revenge. The Rape (first half) is the true strength of the movie...Sarah Butler (as lead character Jennifer Hills) gives an outstanding performance as the lead character who is emotionally harassed and ultimately violated by a group of redneck thugs while renting a summer cabin in rural Louisiana. The Revenge (second half) centers around Jennifer's attempts to gain vengeance against the perpetrators, and while there are some creative torture/kill sequences, the second half just seems weaker than the first half. In my opinion, the first half of the movie was extremely realistic and, as a male, gave me greater insight into the fears and concerns that all women probably face at some point in their lives over the risk of being a rape victim. It also made me sympathize with all victims of rape, by further raising my awareness of the cruelty of this violent crime. Rape is an act of control and domination, not sexual pleasure, and this film definitely conveys this point.     ***SPOILERS BELOW***  The movie slips somewhat in the second half because it starts to follow the conventional horror film cliches of a killer who defies rationaleand logic. 1) How did Jennifer survive weeks on end without any money, food, clothes, etc? When she returns, she is not any thinner from hunger, has two sets of clothing, and like Freddy or Jason - she can telepathically appear anywhere in an instant. 2) Jennifer would opt to remain secluded in the woods for a month just to murder her rapists once they have forgotten about her, rather than to go for help or attempt to contact her family/friends? Yeah right!  *** These things are what I felt detracted from the storyline, and while I know this is a movie - a horror movie, at that - I was a bit disappointed because the first half of the movie was so outstanding.   ***END OF SPOILERS***    Nevertheless, the movie is absolutely worth watching! It is definitely not for children, though! The film allows the characters of the five rednecks to be developed to a point where you see into their perverse, hypocritical worlds and their twisted viewpoints (regarding their phony Christianity, reverse-elitist attitudes about the alleged superiority of rural vs. urban lifestyles, sexist and demeaning views of women, etc). This doesn't make you sympathize with these rednecks, but it does give a context for why they feel justified in violating Jennifer. I just wish the film makers would have devoted as much time and effort towards developing Jennifer's character as well. Overall, you definitely should check out this film!
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I've been using this chip in my workstation for several weeks now doing intensive video editing and CG production. Thus far I've had no issues with the CPU. With a Spire Thermax II heatsink and Cooler Master HAF X case, I've managed to overclock this thing to about 4.5GHz with temps around 30 Celsius idle and 70 Celsius under full load. I managed to clock it to almost 5.0GHz, but I found my chip started to heat up into pretty dangerous territory.     Previous to this chip, I was using dual Xeon E5600 series chips at 2.4GHz with 16 threads. This chip absolutely DESTROYS those chips. With 3D rendering I've noticed an increase of about 40% in speed in identical renders. In After Effects I'm able to scrub through pretty much any of my projects with minimal to no wait times. Rendering video is also pretty fast. HD footage doesn't quite render in real time, but it sure doesn't take long.     For just over $300 this chip is an absolute steal. Without forking over $1000+ for an i7 990x, I doubt you'll find a better CPU on the market today.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|I Love this CD,  Almost every song on it gives me Chills when I listen to them,   I have played guitar for over 8 years and This is the most awesome sounding guitars that I have heard in my opinion.  I would reccomend this CD to ANYONE that likes Rock music of any type.  The only thing that I did not like about the CD was the song called \\"God Hates Us.\\" I was not real pleased with the name or the song. It is more Death Metal. (Not my type of Rock) Even though the song was awesome. If the title was different and it didnt talk about God hating us then I would have no problems at all with the CD.     My most favorite thing about the CD is that AX7 had the best intros on almost every song of this CD. I loved them and has to be the highlight of this album. just about ever song starts off slow and quiet, and  then all of a sudden...... BOOM, a crazy guitar and outrageously awesome double bass drums rattles your inner organs!!!!!!!!!!    awseoms CD, I have let three people borrow it already and they too have went out to buy it.

0307716511|4.0|Sister  Rosamund Lupton  ISBN: 978-0-307-71651-4  2010  320 pages  When Beatrice's mother calls her to tell her that her pregnant younger sister, Tess, is missing she drops everything to return to London.  Days later Tess' body is found and her death is ruled a suicide.  Beatrice knows that it cannot be true so she takes it upon herself to investigate her sister's murder.  The clues lead her in many different directions all with realistic possibilities but no one will take her seriously, so she is dangerously on her own.  This is written as a letter from Beatrice to Tess and at first I didn't know what to think about that but as I got further along I decided that it felt necessary.  The characters and the family dynamic are very realistic in their dysfunction as well as their bonds, and underneath the mystery there are stories of personal transformation and progression that can look familiar to a reader.  Ms. Lupton added enough twists and turns to keep the pages turning without it being overwhelming.  This is a novel that I think many people will enjoy so it comes with my recommendation.  via goodreads

B0034G4OVS|5.0|I love \\"What would you do?\\" movies.  Throughout this intense flick, I found myself trying to think up alternate plans of how to get out of this terrifying jam.  A lover of horror flicks, the only flaw was leaving out some of the gore and putting it in the \\"deleted scenes\\" video.  For the sake of not spoiling the film, I won't mention any specific scene.  This was very well done and Zegers, Ashmore and Bell did great acting jobs.
0345472322|5.0|I have never posted a review on Amazon before, and I think many of the 5 star reviews capture much of what I feel, I write this only to those swayed by the reviewers claiming this book is poorly written, or that it is repetitive, or any other (petulant) critique of the book, do yourself the favor of ignoring this inane babble. Mindset is without a doubt one of the most interesting books on human thinking I have ever read, and I had to read many during my Psychology undergrad degree. It changed the way I viewed not only intelligence, but learning itself for many of the reasons listed.     I was stunned to read the brazen, hypercritical attacks that many of the 1 and 2 star reviews made. It is most certainly not repetitive in the latter 2/3rds, it expands competently through different contexts on the core concept, and by going through how it applies to these very specific cases it can be applied to, demonstrates how to develop the concepts personally. Some reviewers might have required a more dumbed down method, but ironically it would have been that approach that would have slowed down the pacing of the book. It occurred to me that many reviewers' malice came from something much deeper. To fully embrace the \\"growth mindset\\" as truth, to reject the paramount importance of \\"naturals\\" and to believe that greatness is available to all, this presents a real threat to the world view of those unwilling to change from their \\"fixed mindset\\" view of achievement. I would contend that virtually every review whining that it wasted their time I read here stems from their apparent underlying fear of the central concept; that they were in control of their lot in life, and this book, for all its positive tone, leaves them without excuses for failing to be as awesome as they think of themselves. Ironic, considering the book touches on that concept as well, if only they'd read it closer.    For my part, I've bought this for 4 different people, and the concepts have come up in discussions with many more, I wish everyone could understand the innate power contained in this book.
B004SGWYVA|4.0|H.O.T.D. is very funny for a zombie series. The action is good, realism is miminal, fan service is a little too much, but fun.
B000069HKH|5.0|I do not love every song on this album, but there are some very different, interesting sounds on here and most of them work. Some of the songs I \\"got\\" right away...\\"Further on Up the Road\\" is absolutely one of THE hardest rocking Springsteen songs ever..... other songs take a few listens to warm up to .... especially \\"Worlds Apart\\".  I got alot of \\"this is not Springsteen\\" vibes on a few songs for the first 5-10 seconds.... but they still work.  I really like at least 50% of the songs on here, 1 or 2 I can't stand..... still beats buying an album on the strength of 1 song......  and getting burned realizing it's the only song worth listening to.  Not another \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\".... but then again, Bruce already did that.
0446560073|3.0|Simon's Cat first and foremost is a series of videos, and the diversification into print media had the feel of a cash in. That said the first book was funny and the second has just as many laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />The issue with this title is that the first book was more grounded in everyday things cats do and thus relates to what we see. The premise here is what we do not see, what our cats get up to ... well ... beyond the fence.<br /><br />One of the fundamental appeals of Simon's Cat is that we can relate, and whilst this is still there, it is much more subdued. As such the comedy focuses not on what we know is odd behaviors cat's engage in but on what we might hypothesize this extends to in a less familiar setting. However this extensions is going from the familiar / plausible to the ridiculous / implausible very quickly, and far too often.<br /><br />That is not to say this is a bad title, rather it is trying too hard and although the origins of the extension beyond the fence can be seen, it just is hard to accept them as realistic, and thus clashing with the original charm.

B003UESJEM|5.0|At first I didn't know if I could watch this movie.  Being \\"older\\" and having gone through a couple \\"lay off's\\" myself, it was so realistic and really affected me.  But then I couldn't stop watching.  Excellent movie, and as usual, Tommy Lee Jones is fantastic as well as Chris Cooper.
B004V5QWU2|3.0|Sounds range from 30 to 40 sec long then repeat, sometimes noticeably.  could of been a little longer imo.  mixing this with mp3 has neat results though.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|Battle Los Angeles is a great alien invasion movie. Great special effects and the acting was pretty good, this movie is in my top 10. Good story line, this movie is about meteors landing in cities and how they came for our H2o. They use our water as they fuel to the air support. But this movie didn't have a lot of action it's a survival. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes alien invasion movies.
B003QSOE0U|1.0|Arguably the worst war movie ever created, I mean it. It is so historically inaccurate as to solicit outright laughter. This movie is an insult to the \\"Day of Infamy\\", the director must be a high school dropout or something. I will remind everyone that after the premier, which took place on a carrier at Pearl Harbor there was a curious lack of reviews from the Pearl Harbor survivors that were flown to Hawaii for the premier. The director and the producers did a good job of insulting the survivors and the sacrifice of approximately 2600 dead. I would avoid this trash at all costs.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Just wanted to say how much I liked this album and it came at the perfect time. It was different and refreshing. Kid Rock is the revival of Rock N' Roll and while we don't see his known badass attitude as much on this album,he has definitely earned his acclaim as Rock N' Roll Jesus. This album is a relieved transition,a change,a revival of his own freedom. In the past,combining rap,rock,country and blues,Born Free,has a distinctive Mid-western sound. While also providing social and political insight to his hometown,I think he is a great muscian.  I too associate colors,days,feelings and emotions to pride,passion and freedom. I felt the greatness of a true rock n' roll hero on this album. Born free: A must have album of the year.
1451629184|5.0|It's important to bear witness, not only to the positive, joyful moments in the lives of others, but also to the horrors and atrocities man commits against man. Or in this case, one small, defenseless child. It's not easy to read but Jaycee Dugard tells her story in a clear, honest voice. A voice that was silenced by shame and fear for 18 years. That she survived such an horrendous ordeal, protected her children and reclaimed her life is a testament to her resilient spirit.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is a lovely take on the love story between Queen Victoria and her Prince Albert. I would have liked their story fleshed out a bit more but I very much enjoyed the scenes with the child Victoria discovering her destiny at the age of 11, and of course her meeting and falling in love with Albert.
B000002URV|5.0|Love Enigma...
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I'm a big fan of the zombie genre so you may find this review to be biased. Anyway, \\"The Walking Dead\\" for Blu-Ray has been my second blu-ray purchase, the first being \\"The Wolfman\\", and I have to say that its by far the best purchase I've ever made. Most of my family has already watched the show with me when it aired last year, but that hasn't stopped us from rewatching it over and over. The first season comes with two discs, the first having episodes 1-4 or 5, and the second disc has 2 episodes on it and special features. I haven't watched the special features yet so I can't comment on them, but at $20 or so, this is a very good price for such an amazing show (and for it being a blu-ray as well!). There isn't any extended episodes that I'm aware of so don't purchase it thinking there will be more to the show. The quality of the video and audio is crisp and clean, absolutely no problems there (that you may or may not have experienced watching it on cable or satellite. If that was even an issue to begin with.). All in all I definitely recommend this product for any fans of the show or fans of the zombie genre in general.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avatar a great moving with deep meaning.  Effects were outstanding...watched many times.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is the best presentation of Les Miserables ever and the return of the original cast at the end to sing with the present day cast was outstanding.
1451629184|5.0|I loved being able to see what Jaycee went through as she saw it.  I had questions that were answered through reading the book.  In spite of everything this young lady has gone through she doesn't possess hate, which I think could be a valuable lesson for all. Looking at the reviews, some people thought she spoke too much about the animals, being an animal lover myself, I didn't feel that there was too much time spent.  The animals, after all, were all she had. All the loss she had experienced was absolutely heartwrenching to me. At the end I felt a kinship to her and I am grateful that she shared her experience so that I could better understand and maybe even become a more loving person myself.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|To understand how Clint Eastwood do his movies you have to watch these movies . They are not simple in ists stories but they have something that keep you in your seat till the end of the movie.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Overall, a very solid gaming headphones.  Only problem comes from the size of my ears.  Since my ears are relatively large, they sometimes feel slightly pinched when wearing the headphones.  Quality of sound and microphone is very good, especially for the price.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|The first three books were great.  They moved and I couldn't put them down.  Book four was a disappointment, slow pace and not a thing about DT who was one of the most interesting characters.  \\"Dances With Dragons\\" is a disingenuous title...not much DT here either and not much about dragons either.  I had anticipated this book with high hopes only to be sorely disappointed and the only thing draggin' was the pace.  If the next one takes years I'm not sure I'll remember to read it.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This movie fulfilled the majority of my expectations. It was somewhat similar to the 2009 film The Taking of Pelham 123. Not just because both starred Denzel Washington, but because both films were really in your face non stop suspense, and the title really says it all. Great price, and great item.
0062060554|3.0|Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the narrative style. Of course, its repetitive but that's the essence of the story: a woman wakes up each morning with no memory of the day before. Its an interesting premise despite being highly implausible. I was able to suspend disbelief and to try to make sense of Christine's life...understanding things that she could not possibly understand. I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book.     But then we started moving towards the climax. Too many silly plot devices. Too many conversations when characters don't answer the question asked of them. Lots and lots of coincidences. What should have remained suspenseful ended up being trite. Some plot points were completely illogical, some were predictable. It was not a satisfying conclusion.     I'm not sure that this story knows what it wants to be. It began as a psychological thriller that has you questioning the role of memory and imagination. It ends with a need to tie-up everything with a neat bow - to conclude things that cannot be concluded.     Its too bad - it seemed to have a lot of promise.
B005D67OJG|5.0|I came to Dexter late. The first four seasons were history when I finally caught season one on Netflix. I don't think I slept much over the next few weeks as I devoured seasons two through four. If you are new to the series, go back to the beginning and catch up, if (like me) you've been waiting with baited breath for season five, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />After five years the characters have been well established. One of the great joys of this series has always been the dialogue. Starting with the pilot and carrying on till the finale of season five, the major players speak to each other like real people might actually do. By now the actors are so comfortable in their roles that they relate to one another in a very natural and logical way. Couple that with great writing, skilled camera work and direction that ties the whole thing together brilliantly and you have a real classic.<br /><br />In season five Dexter is fighting to overcome the scars and complications caused by the totally (at least on my part) unexpected and shattering end of season four. Many series these days follow the trials of professionals trying to juggle family and career. Trying to mesh the life of a single father and serial killer turns out to be even harder than you might imagine. While I will avoid any major spoilers here, suffice it to say Season five of Dexter is full of the same tension and pacing that made the first four such a joy to watch.<br /><br />According to the powers that be, a sixth season is in the can and on the way.
1450400957|5.0|Very thorough and explains how each movement affects the muscle.  I like that there's a variety of exercises for one muscle to combat getting bored with one routine.  The sample workouts in the back were helpful.  Excellent book overall!
B001DHXT6G|4.0|I had to wait a long time before I could buy the Star Trek original series. When I received my copy of the remastered set, I enjoyed everything about it,except one thing. The outer packaging stated the captioning was in english and spanish. I liked seeing this because even though I'm not hearing impaired, I still use captioning to help follow what is being said. However, when I opened up the first season box and put in the first disc, I found out the captioning is in spanish and french, and does not have english captioning.        It's a shame, CBS Paramount put in a great amount of effort to recreate this remastered set, only to miss the bullseye by not having on the disc what they print on the package.
B000LB9QL2|5.0|I must admit I'm still reading the book even though it's not too many pages.(188 pages) There is so much going on in the world today and this is simple another avenue of trying to understand things we cannot comprehend.  Although to me it makes sense.  I always try to read everything I can about something that intrests me and I take what I can use  and leave the rest.
1594202710|4.0|I am a history buff and love Chinese history, and naturally I enjoyed Kissinger's latest book.  On China is well written and full of historical facts and events dated back from Huang Di, Spring-Autumn and War Era 1200 B,C, The book is interesting enough to keep me engaged 90% of the time. I specailly like the part when he talked about his visits to China with Nixon in the 1960s. His depiction of Chou En-Lai and of Mao are interesting. Most Chinese mau not agree, but His point of views are fact-based and relevant. On the whole I'd recommend this book to Westerners who want to learn more about China.  GOOD READ!
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Very good acting by both Sean Penn and Naomi Watts. There are many questions about the Cheney administration that have to be answered. There's no closure for anyone until these question are answered. Ambassador Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame were two people who were deeply affected by the analysis to go to war done by the people in the Cheney administration. In this case, particularly in Joe Wilson's case, things just didn't add up. He KNEW that the information was not only cooked, it was completely fabricated. There's a lot more unsaid in this story, and countless others that occurred during the Cheney years. There's a reason he can't leave the US.     I also recommend the Pentagon Papers, a fine movie dealing with the Ellsberg case. In both cases, the government attempted to lie to the American people in order to pursue a certain agenda involving American military involvement overseas. Ellsberg knew, as did Plame and Wilson, that our involvement was predicated upon complete fabrications.
1442419814|4.0|I wasn't a big fan of dystopian novels when I began reading this, but I am now. He created a believable world filled with misunderstanding, mixed messages, and teen angst even for an adult reader like myself can relate to. The MC's journey to the discovery of the truth is an interesting one to follow. There's a message that reflect the current view of what teenagers and adults find attractive and how important it is to our self-esteems. But he didn't do symbolism to death. Also, the author did an excellent job of writing the voice of a 15-year-old girl. I'm his new fan now. I'll be reading his books again.
030726999X|3.0|For me, much slower reading, did not like it as much as the other books, but glad to have read it.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|Imagine the old Mary Tyler Moore television show with a glossy remake and you've got an idea of what to expect from Morning Glory. Rachel McAdams plays Becky, and this girl has grit and moxie and perk, and boy does that grate the cranky settled folks at a dying morning show. Through pure heart and the aforementioned moxie, things change...but for the good or the bad? That is the question. Family friendliness?  A couple iffy PG scenes, a few words (including one or two F Bombs), but for the most part good, clean fun.<br /><br />Entertaining, cute, fun and neatly tied up at the end...a lot like the MTM show.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I wanted so much more of this book and was completely let down.  I won't spoil anything but I guess I just wanted the superhero ending or the fantasic revenge is the best medicine ending or even the one that makes no sense at all but would have simply been karmic justice.  Instead I feel I got just another dose of bitter reality.  Not what drew me into this series and what kept me reaking the whole series over the course of a week. I guess I'll have to finally read the last \\"Harry Potter\\".  I've been putting it off for years but now I need a perfectly complete ending as I am still disappointed about what Susan Collins wrote for Katniss and Peeta and Gail.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I love Colin Firth and had this film on my radar. The royal life is always fascinating and of course the time frame, pre-WWII was of interest, so I finally took the plunge and rented a copy. I knew it was about a stuttering monarch and had read just enough to know that he used some inventive tools to overcome his situation when required to speak publicly.<br /><br />I didn't expect the movie to be so charmingly quirky though. And quirk is a hot button for me so I ended up loving this flick. Firth as Bertie is spot on. His frustrations, his heart, his sensitivity show throughout the span of the movie. The film begins with Firth's Prince Albert Bertie filling in for his father, the king. And the distress at stuttering his way through the simple announcement is all over his face, and throughout the listening audience as the camera pans over them. Humiliated and frustrated he seeks help and finds more frustration and humiliation. Until his wife finds Logue, Geoffrey Rush, a \\"doctor\\" with a flair for the dramatic. The two men begin to form a friendship and it's a beautiful thing to behold. Bertie's story was heart-breaking but his heart for the people and his family and his drive to overcome this challenge were inspiring.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush is a delight to watch, and is perfectly cast as well. The cinematography and editing are well done. Overall, the only thing that could be offputting for family viewing is two bursts of language. Bertie doesn't stutter when cussing. This becomes an exercise. Preview it if it concerns you, the two (I think) sections could be muted for family viewing.
B003UYUP58|5.0|I picked this book up mainly on the strength of its prior reviews.  I didn't have any particular prior interest in cancer, but thought I might learn something about a topic I admittedly knew virtually nothing about beforehand.  My wife thought I was crazy - she asked me \\"why on earth are you reading a book about cancer on our vacation?\\"<br /><br />But this book delivers way more than I expected.  This is a complex, difficult subject rendered accessible and interesting to any reasonably intelligent layperson.  You will learn an awful lot in this book, he doesn't dumb down the topic for general readers.  Instead, through the extraordinary clarity of his writing, he lets you get a detailed look inside a world that is usually off-limits to non-specialists.<br /><br />You don't have to be somebody who has lived through cancer or been close to someone who has to get a lot out of this book.  If you are curious about the world around you and how it works, that is all the reason you need to pick this up.  It will pay back the investment of your time handsomely.  And should you ever find yourself or a loved one diagnosed with cancer, I would definitely read this book first, simply because it will provide you with a broad, overarching framework of understanding that will allow you to make a far better sense of everything else that follows.  It really is that good.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|I scratch my head often when I listen to this woman and wonder why \\"some\\" people give her so much credit for doing and singing about absolutely:  \\"NOTHING\\"...First off, her voice is so annoying she sounds like she's yodeling and it's always an aggressive sound like she's trying to prove something.  This cd just doesn't work for me as does any of her cd's particularly.  I think that she really needs to grow up and sing about things that are more relevant to her age, as we know she is much older than she claims, her music is stuck in a child-like mode as if she's trying to compete with younger artist.  There just isn't anything about this cd that is worthy...Thumbs down!!!
0060763280|3.0|This is a very motivating book with a refreshing take on \\"rich\\" thinking and what has gotten in the way of many people who \\"want\\" to be wealthy, but still are poor.    Yes, a lot of it is recycled, but I do like hearing it in a new perspective.    It was hard to enjoy the book and not feel like I was in a car dealership with the non stop references to his Millionaire Mindset Seminars, he was always either giving an example of how it helped someone or was suggesting that the seminar can help you further.    I didn't buy this book to get a \\"taste\\" of what he has to offer, I was hoping that he would be generous in sharing the \\"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind\\".  Is it too much to ask for a book to be completely genuine, helpful with NO agenda for backsales or seminar selling??    Great guy but......  too turned off by his relentless promoting.
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|I love this cd, Kelly has definitely outdone herself on this one.  I think that she should've dropped Matthew Knowles years ago because he was only helping beYAWNcy with her career.  No sooner than she let him go, she gets her hits, now she needs to just get from under beYAWNcys' thumb and stop letter her deter her from being who she is as an artist.  That BET Performance showed the world that Kelly is a contender and so does this cd.  Promote, Promote, Promote Kelly.  You did your thing for sure.  Love It, Love It, Love It.
0553801473|2.0|...cloves, mace and tamarind, served in a hollowed out trencher of black bread, followed by a brace of kakapo, roast dugong garnished in Myrish snail butter and Dornish wafflepepper, and fried ostrich cakes, with freshly baked cinnamon gorilla tarts for dessert.<br /><br />And griffin pudding.  And platypus kabobs slathered in lemur brine and melted purple onion cheese.  And rainbow speckled oatbeans.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />UNICORN POT PIE.<br /><br />So it's come to this.  When I first read A Game of Thrones several years ago, I was instantly riveted.  I hadn't read much fantasy before, viewing the genre as consisting primarily of clich&eacute;d stories featuring impossibly noble heroes that never died, fighting dumb teeth gnashing villains who were evil for evil's sake.  But this... complex and morally ambiguous characters, a richly detailed world, a subtle and mysterious take on magic that really made it feel special when supernatural things happened, and a completely unpredictable story, as ANYONE could die at ANY time.  Nearly every chapter piled on the intrigue and excitement and left me wanting more.  A Clash of Kings was every bit as good.  A Storm of Swords was also fantastic, though by that point I was beginning to wonder if the realism of the story had given way to nihilism, and was worried that the author might have gotten carried away with killing off main characters.  And then Feast of Crows, widely and justifiably viewed as a bomb.  The most interesting characters from the previous three books were nearly all absent, and the ones who were featured just didn't do much of anything for the novel's 900+ pages.<br /><br />Like so many others, I had high hopes that this novel would get the story barreling forward again and leave us craving more.  How could it not?  After all, the characters we all really liked were back!  Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon, Bran... how could it possibly not be better than Crows?<br /><br />But... it isn't.  If anything,it's worse, because it manages to take these interesting characters and drag them through stories every bit as tedious and uneventful as Brienne's torturously long search for Sansa was in Crows.  Like the fourth book, most of the chapters involve people either slowly making their way to some remote destination, where hopefully they'll finally start doing something of note, or sitting around and debating what they should do next.  Tyrion, widely hailed as the most interesting character in the series, spends most of his time inching across the eastern continent, asking himself where whores go over and over again.  Jon putters around the Wall, talking to Melisandre and talking to Stannis and talking to Queen Selyse and talking to wildings and never DOING anything worth mentioning until the ridiculous yet oddly ho-hum final event in his last chapter.<br /><br />And Daenerys... what a colossal waste.  While she may not be the most interesting character in the series, I've found her story to be the most exciting, and have up to this point viewed her chapters like the hot fudge on top of a sundae.  I mean, what a tale!  She begins as a terrified girl, abused by a monster of a brother and wed to a barbarous warlord, rises from near-ruin by birthing three dragons, then spends the next two books amassing a near-unstoppable army and a horde of near-worshipful followers.  The book's title hints that this is when we finally, after thousands of pages of buildup, get to witness her returning to Westeros and nuking her enemies into submission.  But instead the dragons are virtually absent, literally stuffed away for the majority of the book, while we get to watch Daenerys plant herself down in the East, pine after some blue-haired goon, and ignore all the people telling her to go west and do what we, the readers, want to see happen.  Yes, at the end she seems to finally wise up and realize that she's been wasting her time, but that doesn't erase the tedium of the many chapters that came before.<br /><br />But the disappointment doesn't just lie with these three characters.  It's also found in the many new character POVs introduced throughout the book, none of which are particularly gripping and many of which feel almost completely unnecessary.  Who cares about Connington?  Or Quentyn?  Or any of the other people in Dorne, for that matter?  And was the chapter with the previously mysterious Melisandre really necessary?  Or half of the Barristan chapters?  These new POVs just don't cut it compared to the chapters of characters now dead.  Plus, some of the signatures of the series are becoming annoying.  Yes, Mr. Martin, anyone can tell by looking at you that you're a fan of the culinary arts, and the descriptions of both simple meals and sumptuous banquets throughout the series have often made me hungry, but we don't need a paragraph-long description of increasingly exotic food in every chapter.  And how many times can you use the phrase \\"mailed fist?\\"  And does every street in Westeros (and that boring Eastern continent) have somebody with filed teeth?  And how many times can people turn their heads and spit?<br /><br />What's most frustrating about all this is that it could have been avoided.  I don't believe for a moment that, with a little discipline and a good editor (WAS there an editor?), the two mammoth tomes that were AFFC and ADWD could not have been compressed into one massive, much more readable book.  But even then, I don't know if it would have changed the downward direction in which the series seems to be headed.  It's starting to feel like Martin has lost control of his own creation, and no longer knows how to keep his once colossal-yet-lean epic from turning into a bloated, bloviating mess.  I'll keep reading... I liked the first three books so much that I'll probably keep going even if this series turns into another Wheel of Time... but the magic is officially gone.
1904633293|5.0|MANSFIELD PARK is one of my favorites; this is not the first time I have read it nor will it be the last.  Austin's last three novels, MANSFIELD PARK,  EMMA, and PERSUASION, are by far her best, the work of a mature genius.  They are not for the intellectually lazy as they demand some effort of the reader, but the enjoyment is far worth it.  The Collector's Library edition is well-printed, well-bound, lightweight, and small enough to carry around in a pocket or purse.  It is also a very pretty volume, making it a pleasure for the bibliophile to handle.  One caution, though.  The print is on the small side, so if you have problems with your eyesight you might prefer something with larger print.
1594202842|5.0|Whether you agree with Amy Chua's parenting techniques or not, you can't read this book without being inspired to be the best person you (and your children) can be, and her determination and inherent convictions will make you believe that anyone can do anything with enough hard work and repetition. I also encourage you to check out her website [...] and read Sophia's blog as well.
B002S9DRA6|4.0|The album is a wonderful flash from the past. A little redundant on the second CD, but I love Enigma so for me it is double the pleasure..The third CD..could have been left out, but all in all, it was worth the purchase

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I read all the bad reviews describing how wonky the Kindle version of the 4-book bundle is, and I decided to risk it anyway to save some bucks over buying the books individually. I found it worth the price. Yes, the maps at the beginning are small and hard to read, and when I bookmarked them and tried to go back, they didn't bookmark exactly right, forcing me to hunt for a few pages to find them. However, I did not have any problems returning to my last spot in the text. Aside from that, if you want to start at the beginning and read straight through (pretty much all I ask from a novel), it functions perfectly. At least it did for me. I can't speak to searching or highlighting because I didn't use those features. Well worth the $30. Now I just have to swallow the $15 price for book 5! :-(
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is a great classic Disney movie that should be on every DVD shelf. The musical score especially adds a lot to this film, and doesn't every girl at some point dream of having Belle's yellow dress?!
1932907009|3.0|Yeah, the rest of the book pretty much sucked.<br /><br />The first few chapters were awesome and witty, and I felt somewhat enlightened.<br /><br />But, after that, the rest of the book was self-aggrandizing, redundant, and overall boring. I gave up, and didn't continue reading. :(<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed because it had so many great reviews. I guess I should have listened to the minority of the reviewers that gave it more negative criticism.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes do an excellent job in this movie, and are supported by an all star cast including the hilarious Geoffrey Rush. The movie makes allusions to a variety of Shakespeare's plays, including Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night. I also first saw this movie in an English Literature class in high school, and as long as you edit out the R-rated parts, it is a great film to show in a classroom setting to show what theater life was like during the Elizabethan age.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this story. Filled with fantasy and mystery and several page-turning twists it was a great easy read. While I thought the pictures were hard to view on the Kindle they were still fantastic and added a lot to the story. It was interesting to find out that they were all apparently \\"real\\". Fun, magical, story that takes you away from reality.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I&apos;m in level three and am enjoying the game so much I finally decided to review it. Great for killing time while waiting in line or... Creative puzzles and concept and definitely worth a buck.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|Great show, lots of funny one liners and a very quirky cast.  sort of original X-files edge to it.  I really enjoyed it
0670022411|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I found myself captivated by the first page. It's been a long time since I settled down to enjoy the writing of a book almost more than the characters or the plot.     Reading the negative reviews of this book helps me understand what I loved about it. I found myself immersed in this world; paced as we might live it with time to drink fragrant teas and eat massive breakfasts!! I sat in an ancient library and smelled the manuscripts, admired the architecture and people-watched. I haven't been a scholar in 20 years (Shakespeare was my first love) but this book brought it back powerfully. I also revisited the old world of Europe with it's antiques, furniture and buildings but especially it's manuscripts. (So no, this is not a fast paced action thriller).    And as a bonus, we have plausible vampires, witches and daemons - and a haunted house with as much character as a temperamental pet!! Oh yes, and by the way, a love story and, for a change, a woman not the least self-absorbed beginning a journey of self-discovery and learning about real relationships.    I enjoyed every word, all the classical allusions and glancing references to great people long dead. Real literature takes the time to research and build settings, characters, connotations, allusions... Most books I skim read but this one was worth sitting down and absorbing.     It's a keeper that I'm adding to my library. No doubt I'll read it a few times before the sequel/s come out!
B004Y1USJE|1.0|I will buy it because I am a huge Yes fan and I love  \\"Into The Storm\\".   Notwithstanding, this is definitely the worst music the band has ever made.   The band doesn't have to hang it up, because I just fired them from any future studio work.   Who gives me the authority to fire them from future debacles?  Well, I do , of course...   This should be  1/2 star for quality rating.   Yes, i have listened to the Whole  CD on YouTube.   And. let me tell you, it is BEYOND AWFUL.   Go ahead, Geoff, get on your BLOG and complain, but it is still BLOODY AWFUL...
B00498SDN0|1.0|I spent 1+ hours trying to get this stinking video going (after ordering many the same way in the past without trouble).  What a miserable experience.  Amazon's system is all messed up.  They have no way to restart an HD movie without cancelling the order and reordering.      I am really frustrated, I need a new on demand option.    I can't comment on the movie yet, just Amazon's system.

1442419814|5.0|Tally Youngblood is about to turn sixteen, which means she can finally become pretty, like all of her friends before her. At sixteen, everyone has an operation to turn them into beautiful people and tally is the last. But until then, she has to kill time in Ugly Town, without her friends for company. Desperate to see her best friend Peris again, Tally sneaks over to New Pretty Town to see him and in the process meets Shay, another Ugly who is waiting for her sixteenth birthday. The two become quick friends, but when Shay disappears before her surgery, everything changes for Tally. The authorities insist that Tally help them find Shay, or she will have to stay Ugly forever.    Westerfeld does a masterful job of taking society's obsessions with beauty to the extreme. He is particularly good at showing how flawed the obsession with beauty is and how brainwashed people are about it.    Tally was a realistic character who, unlike most book characters in these types of dystopian societies, is not a rebel. She likes to play some pranks, like any Ugly does, but at heart she truly does want to become a Pretty. It is only circumstances out of her control and the friends she meets that makes her begin to question this chosen path. (This makes her somewhat passive in the beginning, but she grows into an active character.)    The weakest point of the novel is a stretch of time where Tally is on her own. Having no conversation and companionship, though important to the story, makes things go a bit slowly for that section. However, any loss of pace there is quickly made up in the excitement that follows.    I would like to find out more about the country as a whole (we get a little bit of it, but for the most part we only really see Tally's community) and what adulthood is like in this dystopian world. Since it is a four book series, I am sure there is more to come and already I have begun reading book two. This is definitely one of the better dystopian novels out (and came out slightly before this new obsession with this genre) and I highly recommend it.
0525422943|5.0|This book is the continuation of the story If I Stay.    This is told from Adam's POV and takes place three years after the car crash that killed Mia's whole family. She is in Julliard and he is the lead singer of the very famous rock band Shooting Star.    I loved this book! I had to read it right after If I Stay. Mia and Adam's lives have gone on in different directions but on a day before each one are set to go on tour separately, they meet again by chance.    This tale is about their day spent together resolving the ghosts from the past. Healing from the tragic events that have happened to them. It's about love and second chances!    I highly recommend!
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This is a laugh a minute film that kept me smiling from start to finish. If you're after a detailed movie review, skip this and read other reviews; I rarely write reviews but in this instance I feel I should, so open minded Christians won't miss out.  There are a lot of negative reviews for Paul, due to it bashing Christianity: this movie doesn't bash Christianity, only fundamentalist views. If you believe that carbon dating and science are lies and part of a conspiracy, then this movie isn't for you. However, if you have a strong faith in God, can laugh at yourself and people with extremist ideas, then don't miss out on what is defiantly one of the funniest movies I've seen in years because of the negative reviews.
0525421033|5.0|This is story about Mia, seventeen year old girl who gets into a car accident with her parents and her 10 year old brother. She survives the crash but is unconscious in the hospital and in critical condition. However, she is able to see and hear everything around her, even her own body. The story revolves around her making the decision to stay and live or let go and die.  The story is told in a serious of flash backs where we get to see that Mia is a normal teenager, living in Oregon, with a bright although conflicted future ahead of her. She is a brilliant cellist with the prospect of going to Julliard, across country in New York, once she graduates. She has a boyfriend, Adam, with a common passion for music, albeit opposite genres. If fact, if it weren't for music they probably wouldn't have got together, Mia starts noticing him stare at her while they practice. Her with cello, him with guitar. Adam's future is also on the rise but in a very different direction. He is the lead singer/songwriter of a rock band on the verge fame.  Mia's family also plays a large part in the flashbacks. They are a close, quirky, lovable family and Adam fits right in with them.  I have to say this book was sooo hard for me to read. I loved it but I wanted to get through it as quick as possible. I am not the type who loves sad, bittersweet tales and this was one of them. It was heart-wrenching, heart-warming and funny all in one. I was crying one minute and laughing the next. But, I'm a firm believer in having my entertainment be free of tragedy. I think we get enough of it in real life. That being said, I still loved this book! I can't stop thinking about it. It's one of those that you can't get out of your head and heart.  If you are at all like me about these kind of stories, I highly recommend reading the sequel, Where She Went, right after. Don't even start this book unless you have the second also. I don't want to give anything away but is has a very satisfying conclusion to thewhole story.
B004CR5TD0|5.0|This guy has amazing talent--a blow-your-mind voice, great piano playing, and the ability to push the limits of what music is. He can even use an auto-tune (which he doesn't need) and make a real instrument out of it. This record will go down in history. Every song is breathtakingly beautiful. He has created a unique sound with electronics. The way he cuts in and out of a song and changes directions without warning seems very difficult to make as musical as he does but it is truly groundbreaking. You won't hear anything like this from anyone else unless they're playing copycat. What a debut! I have a huge collection of records both old and new and this one has made it on my turntable more times than any since I bought it. I can't recommend this artist enough.
B003RNU8KY|5.0|I have always enjoyed music from The Roots, but this is the album I listen to from start to finish without skipping any song. I just love it!!!
B0051GOB26|2.0|Universal took an old outdated HD transfer (same as released on HD-DVD) which had already issues and then applied generous doses of digital grain removal and some digital sharpening to it and fiddled with the colors and contrast till it \\"popped\\". And there is your remastered version that looks nothing like the original film it came from. Poor release, poor policy. To see how it's done properly check out the new Cohen Brothers Blu Rays for \\"Raising Arizona\\" and \\"Miller's Crossing\\". Why do these look much better, more detailed and like film with a texture of grain? Because they are new transfers made on modern equipment and unnecessary and destructive digital tinkering was abstained from.   Universal has probably the poorest record of all major studios when it comes to catalogue titles. And Lebowski is another victim of this cost cutting strategy (no new transfers, recycle and overprocess old ones instead).
B001LF4ARC|5.0|Excellent book about Apple and Steve Jobs. Considering how difficult is to get information about internal activities in Apple due to Jobs obsession to protect Apple  of the competition, this book reveals very interesting facts and situations through top managers and confidential fonts.    After reading this book it has born into me a great desire to buy all Apple gadgets in the market, thanks to the passion with which Leander describes the ways to do the things in the company.     The only inconvenient of the book is not be updated to Ipad. It finishes in the launch of Ipod Touch, but in my opinion, it doesn't make the book less interesting.    Congratulations Leander. Excellent book!
B0027BOL4G|3.0|My wife and I watched the documentary Food, Inc. on PBS. We both enjoyed the first hour of the film, but we felt that it slipped off track during the last 30 minutes.    The first hour focuses on the massive changes that have occurred in the ways that food reaches the American consumer. While our food packages often picture small farms on their labels, much of our food comes from a few large companies. Food, Inc. comments on a number of alarming practices that these companies use to increase food production and cut costs. Viewers will not look at their food in the same way after watching Food, Inc.    Unfortunately, as mentioned, the filmmakers try to cover too much ground and Food Inc. loses focus in its final 30 minutes. Among other topics, the film covers the use of illegal immigrants in the food industry and includes a long segment on Monsanto's attempts to corner the market on certain seeds. These topics are worthwhile, but the filmmakers \\"bit off more than they could chew\\" by including them in Food, Inc.    Food, Inc. is worth a look, but I can give it only a qualified recommendation.
0817439390|5.0|Explanations are simple and clear.  His analogies are wonderful!  My understanding of photography has surged forward since reading this book.   I would STRONGLY recommend it to anyone trying to move off the \\"auto shoot\\" button.  Very well written.
0241141125|1.0|I thought I was ordering a \\"hardcover\\" book of the Very Hungry Caterpillar along with a caterpillar toy.  What arrived was a little BOARD book (Yes it is hard but different to me than hardcover book.) and a tiny hungry caterpillar.  Knowing what the traditional, original hardcover book size is (11 1/2 x 8 inches), I thought that is what I was ordering.  Pictures don't tell you the true size unless you have something next to it that you know the true size of that object.  Therefore, I thought the caterpillar would be bigger.  I hesitate to rate this item low because it is fine for what it is but not fine for what I thought I was ordering.  For the amount I paid ($20.65) you would think it was the bigger book not the tiny (7x5) board book that I received.  The video that was included in the product description shows Eric Carle with the size of book in his hands that I thought I was ordering.  I should have been more careful because in the description it does say \\"sturdy board book edition\\" but in the title it says \\"hardcover.\\"  I also should have read the reviews because they all said what arrived were smaller than expected.
0553801473|1.0|After being told that the books are much better than the TV series, I just finished the series of 5 in one 'continuous' sitting. So I didn't experience the 'waiting with abated breath' for this book, as many other readers/followers had to. Fortunately.<br />As a lover of fantasy, I was very 'chaffed' with the first 3 books. Interesting characters that may be pushing daisies unexpectedly, witty and robust narrative, very promising storyline with some sideshows, but with no predictable good vs evil result. Total reading time of the first 3 was about 30% of the 'sitting'. An easy 4/5 stars. Not an 'American Tolkien', but very enjoyable.<br />But then Martin lost the plot. AFoC lasted for the next 30% of the reading time and left me confused. Multiple new characters and variations on the theme similar to a symphony, but with very little harmony and reason for existance and with no finale/s. Perhaps 3/5 stars. A need for clarification forced me into the 5th book.<br />Alas, ADwD got worse. The Babilonian confusion turned into a torture rack of deaths, resurrections, cul-de-sacs and multiple subplots for no rhyme or reason. Storyline? - very ephemeral. I endured it for the last 40% of wasted time, for no other reasons than curiosity and tenacity. Perhaps stupidity too. It has a bitter aftertaste with very little substance for the tummy. A reluctant 1-2/5 stars.<br />The future finale, or probably several of them, will be read via summaries from the internet for personal closure on some characters with their roots in the first 3 books.<br />No more money for greed.
B0058DRUV6|1.0|I have been a customer of Amazon and Audible for many years. I have purchased many many books and audibooks since the 90s.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|When Lady Gaga first appeared I honestly didn't get the appeal. She took off so fast here in Australia, but when I listened to her first album I will admit - I wasn't all that impressed. I started changing my tune when Alejandro came out and by the time Born This Way was being released, I was just as eager for this album as most of her fans. Before I write my thoughts, I will say that I'm curious about how the opinions of those who reviewed this album when it first came out might be different today, some months on. I say this because my opinion of this album has definitely changed since I first heard it back in May, when I probably would have given it 3 stars.<br /><br />I was less than impressed after my first listen, with only a few songs having caught my attention. And now? every single song on the album is, quite simply put, a joy to listen to. It takes quite a few listens to really pick up on everything, most importantly being the heart-felt, intelligent, and meaningful lyrics. I grew up on pop music from other female artists like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, and while their music excelled at catchy tunes, the meaning behind the songs was often quite shallow. And that doesn't fall back on those artists, simply because it was others writing their music for them. It wasn't them baring their souls for all to see. That's what we have here with Lady Gaga, who does contribute to her songs - she is baring her soul, who she is, and giving us someone real to connect with. And she does it well.<br /><br />While I said I love and listen to all the tracks, I do have my favourites of course, being Heavy Metal Lover, Bloody Mary, Scheibe, Hair, and Marry The Night. I would really urge people to take their time with the album, not just take it at first listen or prejudge based on any assumptions you have about her as a person or artist. There is a deeper message beneath all of it, and I think Lady Gaga is an amazing inspiration with her acceptance and tolerance of diversity - there needs to be more of this in the world. I've heard her older fans express disappointment in that this album sounds different to her earlier ones, but I think it's important to realize that artists are typically put in shackles when it comes to their music and image, and Lady Gaga seems to have been able to break away from all that and speak/sing freely of things that are important to her. It's all a matter of taste of course, but people thinking about buying this album shouldn't expect it to be the same Lady Gaga sound as before and to judge it (or her) before even listening means potentially missing a very special experience.needs to be more of this in the world.

B000V7B90C|5.0|I never knew I liked AC/DC until a couple of years ago. I'd somehow written them off as cliche, as \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" and \\"Back In Black\\" have just been too over-played on rock radio. But there are reasons why bands remain as popular as AC/DC as long as they have been - it's because they're good! It's because they're very VERY good!! I gave the masterful guitar work of Angus and Malcolm Young (they're an inseparable team) another listen, gained a new appreciation of the whiskey voice of Bon Scott and his astounding anthem \\"Let There Be Rock\\" (just one among sooooo many), and fell in love with \\"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\\", along with all of those other Brian Johnson-era masterpieces.<br /><br />And then I saw this DVD compilation. Wow!! For those who like rock `n' roll, until you actually see AC/DC in action, you really ain't seen nothing yet. I can't believe I've lived 42 years without beholding the magnificence that is this amazing powerhouse of a band. Most people would wonder what planet I've been on, as millions have been to this band's shows (this DVD is testament to that) but now my eyes are open!!! And this is only the 2-DVD set, there's also a 3-DVD version of Plug Me In.<br /><br />The first DVD is one hour and 46 minutes long and has 18 live and TV appearances of the band with Bon Scott from 1975 to 1979, with nine bonus features that runs 37 minutes long, with TV interviews, live shows and other goodies. The second DVD is two hours and 12 minutes long and has 27 live tracks from the Brian Johnson era, from 1981 to 2003; there are only 17 minutes of bonus material on this disc, five items including a Beavis and Butthead and AC/DC cartoon, some interviews, and a clip of Angus and Malcolm playing with the Rolling Stones in Germany in 2003. The menus and sub-menus have a weird Space Invaders arcade game theme to them, and you get to see Angus duck walking below the barriers shooting at the Space Invaders. Groovy. There are also two booklets that match the DVD themes of a Bon disc and a Brian disc. The first one has a few pics, but it is mainly song credits and a David Fricke essay; the second one is jammed with photos, including a great one of Angus and Keith with contrasting Gibson Casinos (Angus' is red, to contrast his black shirt, Keith's is black, to contrast his red shirt).<br /><br />Funnily enough, while this collection has all the appearances of being a career retrospective, combining videos from the Bon Scott era (1975-1979) and the Brian Johnson era (1981-2003), it misses a lot of important band history. First of all, Angus and Malcolm Young's older brother George had already enjoyed a bit of an international career with his band the Easybeats when they released the hit \\"Friday On My Mind\\" in 1966 that's not mentioned anywhere, despite George being an important part of the band's production. Then there was the period with their first singer Dave Evans when not just Angus but the whole band had character costumes of their own (check out the AC/DC dice logo on the bass drum in this video). Finally, the \\"retrospective\\" seems to conveniently forget about some of the footage that exists that shows Angus in his \\"Super Ang\\" costume, and only shows his schoolboy gear. It also doesn't show Brian Johnson in any of his pre-AC/DC incarnations, such as with his awesome UK rock group Geordie. Rock `n' roll!!<br /><br />(For the completist, there are plenty of other nuggets to dig up, which I took an interest in finding some of them after seeing this - there's Bon Scott singing for the Spektors, as a backup singer for the Valentines [check out those awful outfits... and the guitarist's Gibson SG!!!]  The Valentines also did a very nice Coca Cola jingle. Then there's also a bearded flute- and bassoon-playing hippy Bon playing spooky prog rock in Fraternity [once again... a Gibson SG!!!!], before finding his rock `n' roll destiny with Acca Dacca).<br /><br />But hey, who's complaining - there's over five hours of great archival video footage on this, plus some cool extras. Disc one's 18 songs shows the band coming of age and \\"maturing\\" (this is AC/DC, they can only mature so much), and as the years progress you see the band playing bigger and bigger venues (the Brian Johnson disc pretty much only has them playing huge venues). What strikes me is the energy of the band, and also the same-ness - Angus always bops in the same way, he always does something goofy (a striptease, running into the audience to play a solo, jumping from the amps at the end of a song), and Malcolm always stays in a wobbly hunched position, while Phil Rudd doesn't gain an ounce from 1976 to 2003 (neither do Malcolm or Angus, more or less), and his gummy jaw action as he plays is really quite... weird. Aside from the beginning of their career, when they were experimenting with their stage duds, they hardly ever vary their clothes either (how many years has Brian Johnson been wearing that cap anyway, for example?).<br /><br />I also seriously wonder what's in the schoolboy's bag that Angus used to have at his back at all times onstage.<br /><br />The first video on disc one is from October 1975, from TV Week's King of Pop awards, and the band is playing for a TV audience. The first image is of Angus' guitar, then Malcolm's guitar, and the we see Bon in a... tuxedo and bowtie! The song is, of course, \\"High Voltage.\\" The audience is a bunch of well-dressed white young Australians.  One of them bares his chest for Bon when he gets near. Bon has a bit of trouble with his mic cable as it snarls his legs. Malcolm looks tasty in white pants with a red sweater, red guitar and red knee-high boots! Bon is on fire, loving the audience.  At the side, the orchestra waits for the next numbers. Bon doffs his tuxedo jacket.  Angus is such a wee fellow, his legs so skinny in his knee-high socks. Angus soloing on his knees in front of Bon, like David Bowie and Mick Ronson (almost). Wow! \\"It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock `n' roll\\" has the band playing for a studio audience of a lot of boogying teens, Bon in a Superman t-shirt with his bagpipes at the ready. The Seventies Austrlian teens are cute, but the fluorescent and lime green summer dresses are pretty weird. One skinny hot chick wears a tank top that says \\"Rome\\" in what looks like AC/DC font!  Bon really wrings it out in the bagpipe solo.  Cameras are on Bon, drummer Phil Rudd and bass player Mark Evans, but none are on Angus!  Bon's lookin' mighty tasty in those jeans. The TV show announcer comes out all perky... and it goes to a black and white clip from a show at High School Hall in St Albans for two songs - \\"School Days\\" (which is a ripoff of Chuck Berry's \\"Hail Hail Rock `n' Roll) and \\"TNT\\". The hall is packed, and the crowd engagement is fantastic. Bon is a master of ceremonies, and he and Angus look great in matching striped shirts (Angus is without his schoolboy garb for once). The show is very much like what you'd get these days from someone's mobile phone, it's rough and raw and when one girl hoists a big ANGUS banner towards the stage, you see it from the back! Plenty of shots are of Bon's fore-arm, or his stomach. Pretty basic screwy setup. Angus looks like a little boy. The song goes into crowd call-and-response mode, and everyone goes crazy. Maybe the last time they played a small venue. July 13th, 1976, they played on \\"Super Pop/Rollin' Bolan\\", Bon shirtless but wearing a collared leopard vest with tails (?!!?!!). He loses the tails midway, and the band rocks into \\"Live Wire\\". Mean and nasty sex via a microphone. \\"If you're looking for satisfaction/ I'm satisfaction guaranteed.\\" Great Orang amps onstage!!!  Cool song - Angus barely plays throughout the first half, it's all Malcolm's rhythm guitar. Angus' schoolboy uniform looks like crushed velvet!! Great drownout and Angust spazzzz at the end, with full squeal and hop. That's followed in the same set with \\"Can I Sit Next To You Girl\\", and Bon is all sweaty pecs and abs, Angus in full bluesy stomp - this is one of their oldest songs and they know it well. Bon is pure horniness as he says \\"Can I sit next to you - YOU SMELL NICE!\\" Seems like an innocent question/statement... but it definitely isn't. The December 26th 1976 show at the Sydney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourn, Australia is a real treat - it's a hellacious (albeit blurry) version of \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\" that never ever stops... except for an interlude when Angus comes out and does a bit of a striptease... he takes off his striped shirt, walks around the huge stage shirtless, takes his shorts down, walks around in his bikini briefs, does a bit of a moon (with some assistance from Bon), we see his skinny white butt, he suggests showing off the other side, then shuffles off to put on his shorts, and Bon comes back out... vocal thunder for the ladies in the front row, and some wicked soloing, and a rare word from Angus: \\"come on, let's hear ya, let's hear ya, c'mon - play me, c'mon.\\"  The song has the disc's first real guitar spazz-out with real floor-shredding madness, with Angus in his shorts stalking the stage on his scabby knees and shredding around in crazy pinwheels. Really nutso!!! (Don't you dare compare it to the version they do with Bon Scott dressed as a school girl... that is, a school girl to Angus' schoolboy). The next two tracks are from Sight And Sound, recorded in London, the first one, \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\" on October 29th 1977 seems to have come up by accident, as it seems from the intro by host Peter Drummond.<br /><br />Hello, and welcome to Radio 1 Sight and Sound in concert. Tonight, you may have seen in your Radio Times we were billed to have the sensational Alex Harvey Band. Well, you may or may not know that a couple of days ago, Alex Harvey decided to retire from the world of rock `n' roll, which I think is a great tragedy, and I hope it isn't going to be a permanent thing, but anyway he's decided that, so unfortunately we can't have him on tonight.  But in the meantime, let me introduce to you a band that has recently released a brand new album called `Let There Be Rock', and that's the title of their single as well. And they're going to rock and roll for us right now. (sound of feedback coming from onstage) Hehh.. I don't know if that's part of the sound, but would you welcome please - AC/DC!!<br /><br />So... who's Alex Harvey? (Well, whoever he was, his guitarist played a Gibson SG!) The show is, of course, totally awesome. An unruly Angus comes out with his schoolboys clothes asunder, a wild-eyed Bon has his hairy chest and his denim vest and his big balls tight jeans in full locomotion. That's followed by \\"Rocker\\", which has Bon shirtless now and Angus in just his shirt (no jacket or bag). These guys go nutso! Bon is a rival for Robert Plant at this point. \\"Boogie woogie!\\" A grinning Bon winks drunkenly at the camera as Angus walks up into the audience (and the camera pans across all the '70s polyester and bad mustaches), Angus rubs hips with one woman, there's an Angus imposter in the audience that he goes to hang out with, then he steps dangerously up on the balcony (this guy has no fear of heights) before running back around and then going back onstage. Then he's back spazzing on the main stage. Angus gives it another nutty onstage spinout, fighting and kicking, down on his knees and flailing like a nutbar. April 30th, 1978 they are in Glasgow at the Apollo doing \\"Rock `n' Roll Damnation\\", great big giant stage action. Angus' schoolboy cap has a big red circle on it - why? Bon has a nice mullet. \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" is nice, but nothing beats a full-on smoking version of \\"Let There Be Rock\\", probably one of the greatest rock `n' roll songs ever written. Little Angus, at the end of the song, does a great crowd-raising solo from on top of a Marshal amp, and then... jumps off of it, and then falls on hit ass for a spazz-out, not once but twice! SMASH!!!!!  This is as pure rock `n' roll as it gets. In the \\"Rock Goes To College\\" songs played on October 28th, 1978 at the University of Essex in the UK, the band plays three songs, starting with \\"Problem Child\\". Peter Drummond introduces it again:<br /><br />Hello and welcome to Rock Goes To College. This week we come from the University of Essex in Colchester. We've got a band that's pretty powerful, as you've just heard. They are, of course, AC/DC, who've just completed a four-week tour of North America, which went very well for them, they're just about to start, a tour of...<br /><br />The band cuts him off, with Bon's \\"Thank you Peter\\", before jumping rabidly into\\"I'm hot, and when I'm not - I'm cold as ice.\\" The crowd goes wild. Bon's got white socks on. Kids in the audience look like Harry Potter. \\"Sin City\\" is a nut buster, with Angus falling on the ground, the band picks up, and moves quickly into a stompin' \\"Bad Boy Boogie\\". AC/DC!!!!!!!!!!!  The whole crowd is bopping at this point, amazing. Angus starts the song off soft, then hard, then he solos spinning on the floor. Check out the scabby knees! Midway in the song in the small Colchester club Angus starts to strut around, takes off his jacket, his bag, removes his shirt, rubs it over his body, hangs it on a mic stand, and carries on with the guitar shenanigans, a bit of mellow blues, then some massive stomp. The next show is in Arnhem at a festival, where some weird Dutchman comes out an introduces the band. Bon say \\"Hey, you're on TV now, so I want you all to smile,\\" slurring his words a bit. Angus' hair is very long now, he looks like a shaggy seven-year-old tomboy as he jumps into a rough, fairly regular version of \\"Highway to Hell.\\" The band's swampy rendition of \\"The Jack\\" is sweet and nasty. Malcolm Young and Mark Evans stroll up to the mics to sing \\"she's got the Jack\\", and then robotically return to their spots at the back of the stage. Weird how three of the members of the band are like sidemen, while Angus and Bon tear it up with their theatrics, total contrast. The audience sings the whole chorus the second time around. Angus' solo is pure blues. Love his powder blue socks. \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" stomps along the same stage, and the disc ends.<br /><br />Disc 2 opens with five songs from a February 1981 show in Tokyo, and Angus' hair is longer than ever. Brian Johnson doesn't wear his trademark cap, and he's looking pretty chubby in his red t-shirt. A show in Maryland is a lot of fun, the stage is wide and the lights are bright. \\"TNT\\" is interesting, because you hear how the two guitars interact - Malcolm starts off the song, Angus just struts around the stage, but when he comes in you hear it clear as a bell: the two guitars sound very different. While many of the clips are pretty standard and show the workmanlike band rocking out but without any flourishes of interest, the November 17th 1983 Detroit show is a bit more interesting as it includes backstage footage of the band jamming on some blues, having drinks and smokes, with some shots outside the Joe Louis Arena (where they played with Fastway) before getting into \\"Guns For Hire\\". Angus starts it off with some crazy guitar soloing audience call and response, the dark audience is a sea of cigarette lighters, he jumps off a huge amp, and the band kicks into the song. Very nice. One of the main points of interest on the second disc is the September 28th 1991 show in Moscow, which took place one month after a failed KGB coup on Boris Yeltsin's government with tanks laying siege to parliament. The clip starts off with interviews with young Russians, who mourn those killed in the resistance. AC/DC are not political, and it was all a matter of coincidence timing their show around these events, but it's still exciting for the band, and Angus has a few thoughts:<br /><br />It's strange being here, so close to the time, you have to admire anyone who puts up a battle for what they want. It allows things like this to go on, where they getto see rock music, and they're entitled to that freedom as much as anyone else in the world. To the youth, you've certainly got to take your cap off to them for making a stand. It shows in them great courage that they stood up. It's like any country in the world, rock music is a bonding, it's something that they can share with their friends. You see the kids today at this show, and they're going to become one big voice.<br /><br />The disc shows four songs from that festival, and the band rocks the place. Great audience shots of guys in Soviet era official green uniforms with the little pins on them and special official-looking brimmed hats. Chris Slade, a big bald guy, is the band's drummer as Phil Rudd had been temporarily evicted from the seat around this time (considered by many as the band's major creative lull, incidentally). Great shot of a backlit Brian Johnson who looks like he's got steam coming off of him. It must have been a great show, and I do know one person who was there - my band's drummer Val. When they launch into \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" you get to see the big ole Rosie inflatable figure going up behind the stage - crass as hell. And when the last power chord of the song rips out, they pull the plug and the whole thing deflates. Brian Johnson has a few words about the Moscow show:<br /><br />Four weeks ago we were in London, watching events on television, and we saw these bad things happening, and all of a sudden this wonderful thing happened. People had just had enough, it's a new beginning for rock `n' roll and for the Soviets.<br /><br />The song goes into \\"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\\" with a video collage of Russian AC/DC fans partying and flashing the devil horns. Guards flashing peace signs. One uniformed guard, though, puts his hand against the camera, but not everybody's that uptight - you can't stop rock `n' roll. Nice to see the AC/DC logo painted across a USSR flag. Fireworks go off at the end of the song instead of cannon fire, awesome. Unfortunately, for the whole song, you always get the feeling that choice bits have been edited in from all parts of the concert into the flow, so you never know if you're seeing what's being played at the moment. But hey - it's all good.  Next up, the \\"Gone Shooting\\" bit is done in the VH1 studio in London, the band works out the song, lots of shots of Phil Rudd hitting the drums as his gummy mouth jaws wordlessly with the beat. Malcolm's hair is long again, and somehow it's nice to see the band playing in an intimate setting, not some giant festival stage somewhere, and Brian Johnson sort of has this cool, loose shuffle as he sings along. For \\"Hail Caesar\\" they show the band in Sydney, and deliver a little video clip of a Roman centurion riding up and giving a Hail Caesar - he takes off his helmet and we see it's Angus, ha ha. There are other clips where Angus is edited in to a clip from a Rudolph Valentino movie, a news clip of Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, Spartacus, Margaret Thatcher and Dennis at 10 Downing Street, a clip of Thatcher and Reagan taking an oath with their hands over their hearts, or him duckwalking through old monster movies. \\"Ball Breaker\\" has Brian Johnson swinging from a wrecking ball hung over the stage, singing away (looks exhausting). Phil Rudd has a smoke as he works the drums, gumming away as always. \\"Rock `n' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" is okay, and the ultra-crass crotch-gripping \\"Hard as a Rock\\" is just that (although we get something special here - Angus croaking \\"Harder than a rock\\" into Brian Johnson's mic during a lull...). Then, for \\"Hell's Bells\\", Johnson takes a running jump at a big bell chord hanging above the stage, and the bell chimes in to open the song. But then, suddenly, for \\"Ride On\\", four of the five guys in the band appear wearing Adidas sports jerseys. WTF? \\"Thunderstruck\\" is good fun, and then the collection goes into the final three songs, which were performed in Toronto on July 30th, 2003 Rocks For Toronto event to a crowd of 500,000 on a programme with The Rolling Stones, Rush, The Guess Who and tons of other bands. \\"If You Want Blood, You Got It\\" is a great savage rocker. \\"The Jack\\" doesn't go off as well, given the demure Canadian crowd that probably doesn't really appreciate such an explicitly macho song, and Brian Johnson tries to get the audience to sing along... and then Angus does his little striptease ting too. With the pantomime hand motions and all that. Of course his boxers have a giant Canadian flag. He jumps into a beautiful bluesy solo, and off it goes. \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" has a new lyric (\\"knockin' me out with those Canadian thighs\\"), and there are some disturbing shots of the shirtless `n' sweaty fat man pit, but also some nice pics of pretty girls in the audience sitting on their boyfriends' shoulders, swooning to this romantic ballad of a rock `n' roller to a groupie he actually stuck around the whole night with!<br /><br />The discs come with some cool bonus material. Disc 1, the Bon Scott disc, starts off with an interview with the band at Sydney airport in April 1976 to talk about releases and singles, but the interviewer also asks whose idea it was to put bagpipes in \\"It's A Long Way to the Top\\" - George Young's. Angus speaks/slurs! Then a July interview in London, Angus is in his striped shirt, Bon is wearing cutoff jeans and a black belt (and nothing else, really). Bon says that they're better than the Stones and the Beatles. \\"Who needs them, they're last year's model.\\" The interviewer asks if they're rich, he says \\"if you poms learned to pay people, we'd get rich real quick.\\" Wow, the band looks so fresh-faced. \\"Keep your eyes open for words and images and pictures and ideas,\\" some good songwriting advice. Eating a banana. \\"I think it's time we stopped this endless chatter,\\" says the interviewer. The band run into a \\"saloon bar\\" to illustrate their song \\"Jailbreak\\", ha ha ha... A grainy version of \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\" from Germany in September 1976, Angus does another strip tease (has a bit of trouble getting out of his shirt). Another grainy ill-lit view of \\"Problem Child\\" from Melbourne in December 1976. They do a radio promo on video (?!?) for \\"Dirty Deeds (Done Dirt Cheap)\\", and then there's the November 1st 1977 interview on Count Down. It's a serious interview about touring in the US and the UK, Bon sipping from a drink the whole time, lots of takes it seems. Talks about AC/DC as a punk/new wave band, the interviewer natters on with a long question. Bon natters on with a long answer.<br /><br />Aw, we're pulling bigger crowds than they are. I mean, we've got our following here, it's not new wave and it's not punk, it's people who like our band. We honestly thought that punk and the new wave thing might spoil it a bit for us, but it hasn't at all.  It was a big fad for a while, like everything else, and there are some who are still hanging on to it, but the main thing about it is it gave rock music a real kick in the gut. And even though we started the whole thing over here - we played here before the Sex Pistols were even thought of - we've always been here, and people are beginning to realise that they want more than just someone up there screaming [affects Johnny Rotten voice] \\"anarchy and rape\\" and some sort of crap; and we're it, we're doing it right.<br /><br />History had perceived punk rock a bit differently, but I guess in 1977 things were only just taking shape. Bon talks about singles bands that don't tour much and their fates. Talks about recording in Australia and going home and enjoying holidays (sad - the band is well known for retreating to the Caribbean to record Back in Black as Bon's epitaph album). He talks about his America tour:<br /><br />We're going back there in a couple of weeks to tour with Kiss, supporting Kiss, and to play with a band called Rush you might not have heard of out there [doltish interviewer agrees - he's never heard of Rush]. We're doing12 dates with those bands, and a few of our own, and some co-headlining with a band called UFO. The guy that... what's his name, tell me the bass player from Kiss... he's a popular guy. He came along to one of our shows in the Whiskey in Hollywood to see us play, he came up to us and said \\"I dig your band, and we're touring in December and we'd like you to tour with us.\\" And they play to 80,000 people, so the show should be amazing.<br /><br />Funny how neither Bon nor the doltish interviewer could remember the nane \\"Gene Simmons\\". Then there's the Top of the Pops clip from June 8th, 1978, where they follow Guy Marks and \\"Loving You Has Made Me Bananas\\", to play \\"Rock `n' Roll Damnation\\", all the members looking polished in nice shirts... and then there's Angus. Of course it's all lip-synched. Boney M follows AC/DC. Then there's a short documentary that hypes the band's overseas success overseas. Angus Young and Bon Scott talks about how they're the only band that's playing rock `n' roll. The band is up and talking about all of their great riffs and ideas. Bon gives his sad last words: \\"It's gonna get better and better. I can't see an end to it. It's like infinity rock `n' roll.\\" the last clip is taken from someone's Super 8 footage, showing Angus with his devil horns cap. It cuts in and out, since the camera holder's available film was limited, but it shows parts of \\"Sin City\\",\\" Highway to Hell\\" and a few other tunes.<br /><br />Disc 2 has only 17 minutes of bonus material, and it starts out with something from the Beavis and Butthead show, which was an intro to the Ballbreaker tour. The clip shows Beavis and Butthead hanging out at the AC/DC backstage door and try to pick up the groupies that are passing through. Of course they get frustrated and they demand chicks. Angus opens the door for them and passes a dominatrix with a power drill their way. Then there's a January 21st 1981 interview with Brian and Angus. They talk about how to do a show of old Bon Scott songs with new Brian Johnson songs. At least he's still got a \\"good set of knees\\" Angus jokes. Brian talks about \\"when the boys first telephoned us and asked us to come down to have a sing with them and we got through all that and asked us to join the boys, I said yes immediately.\\" I don't really get the \\"royal we\\" thing, but hey - it's cool. There's some interview with Angus and Brian about the Donnington festival and a rivalry with Van Halen. \\"They're more of a pop band, I suppose, than we are.\\" There's some goofing around in the studio warming up record \\"Gone Shooting\\" for VH1 as mics and cameras get fixed. The sound moves around and around, earphone to earphone, and Brian Johnson's mic doesn't pick up, but it's all good. Oh, but then it does. Phil Rudd's beat is unbreakable - it continues metronome-like throughout, totally workmanlike. A cool glimpse into a band warming up as the studio comes alive and gets hooked up around them. The final six-minute clip is of Angus and Malcolm playing in Leipzig in Germany with the Rolling Stones on June 20th 2003 as part of the Rolling Stones' Licks Tour, singing \\"Rock Me Baby\\". It's cool to see Mick and Angus onstage together, as Angus is sort of like a mini version of Mick Jagger anyway (doesn't anyone else think that they look alike? Of course, Mick is at least a head taller than Angus, but still...). There's a nice guitar pit shot, with Angus, Malcolm, Keith and Ron hanging out, but then Angus comes out and does a cool little solo, playing a red Gibson Casino with a Bigsby vibrato. Mick stands aside and wails a bit, but he doesn't really have much to do. Keith comes out for his own solo, also on a Gibson Casino with a Bigsby vibrato (but his is black), and it goes back into some singing, with plenty of honky tonk piano and some horns.<br /><br />The DVD has a few cool extras, like a seven-minute \\"Scrapbook\\" video clip of various articles about the band drifting towards the camera one after another, most of them with cool titles like \\"AC/DC: Sex and energy combined\\", \\"AC/DC - Australia has punk Rock bands too, y'know\\", \\"A giant dose indeed\\", \\"The fastest knees in the west\\", \\"AC-DC punk rock invaders\\", \\"The lusts of AC/DC\\", \\"AC'DC boast of sex orgies\\", \\"Sex, snot, sweat and school kids (Or, AC/DC are back in town)\\", \\"Going deaf but loving every minute of it\\", \\"AC/DC's life on the road: no home, no rest and no pants\\", \\"AC/DC plugs into primitivism\\", \\"Dirty deeds delight US dodos\\", and \\"Destroy your brain with AC/DC\\". There's a great picture of Angus mooning the audience in one of the newspaper clippings, you can quite clearly see his nuts there. The article talks about The Damned hanging out backstage with the band after their gig at the Hammersmith Odeon. The scrapbook also has plenty of album ads, ticket stubs, magazine covers and concert bills One shows a line-up of Aerosmith, Foreigner, Pat Tavers, Van Halen and AC/DC! A Monsters of Rock bill describes Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Mahogany Rush at Oakland on July 21st, 1979!! Then there's The Who, AC/DC, Nils Lofgren and the Stranglers at Wembley on August 18th 1979!!! AC/DC play with Judas Priest December 7th 1979 in Reims in France!!!! Then the ugly articles come - Bon Scott found dead on February 20th, 1980. Oh man... The \\"Scrapbook\\" on the second disc is less interesting, with articles declaring the search for a replacement for Bon Scott was over, and then backstage passes, flyers for shows, ticket stubs, and other memorabilia. As the years go by, articles come with lame titles like \\"AC/DC - they just can't stop touring\\", \\"No power shortage\\", \\"Highway to heaven\\", \\"Giving the fans what they expect: rowdiness\\" and \\"AC/DC - the last rock `n' roll heroes\\".th, you've certainly got to take your cap off to them for making a stand. It shows in them great courage that they stood up. It's like any country in the world, rock music is a bonding, it's something that they can share with their friends.

B0055SWM08|3.0|its ok, I got bored with. I&apos;m am angry birds player myself so its not really my kind of game. it does have nice graphics though
B002T9H2LA|5.0|It'll take something fiendishly brilliant to supplant PULP FICTION and KILL BILL as the top two in Tarantino's oeuvre, and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS - an alternate-reality World War II fable - almost done it. Don't fall for that bit of misdirection in which the film is promoted as a Brad Pitt starrer. Brad Pitt isn't the lead as much as a key cog in a rather remarkable ensemble cast. Yes, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is partly about a gritty commando unit called the \\"Basterds,\\" comprised of Jewish-American soldiers and led by Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine. On the surface, one questions whether the square-jawed American government would actually deploy such a mean and nasty terror team behind enemy lines to inflict brutal just desserts on them swastika-bearers, but we're all worldly folks here. Pitt plays his character as an unabashed caricature, and, in a weird way, he provides the brunt of the film's comedy. I say \\"in a weird way\\" because Lt. Aldo Raine happens to be a no-nonsense Southern-drawled gent who never backs down from his unsavory mission, nor does he shy away from inflicting torture on the Nazis. But he's got a way about him. There's an irrepressible glint in his eye when he remarks: \\"We're in the Nazi killing business ... and let me tell you cousin, business is a-booming.\\" Brad Pitt is having fun spreading inhumane terror.<br /><br />But it's not all about the Basterds and their ruination of the German soldiers' beauty sleep. The Basterds get more screen time than the Howling Commandos in CAPTAIN AMERICA, but it's not by much. Tarantino has always had this knack of picking out actors who end up being perfect for their roles. And sometimes it means going out and finding a French actress to play a French character or a German actor (or, in this case, Austrian) to play the Nazi big bad. Christoph Waltz could not better be as Colonel Hans Landa, the slimy but fiendishly clever \\"Jew Hunter.\\" Waltz turns in one of the year's most memorable performances, and it's even more impressive once you realize that he does this while speaking in three - almost four - languages. There's a sustained element of danger about him. Waltz imbues Landa with such serpentine intellect. The Colonel seems even more deadly when he's engaging in small talk with the other characters. You're rendered all nervous, wondering just what he's figured out and when he'll spring his trap on them unsuspecting targets.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place in Nazi-occupied France. The film is segmented into chapters, several of which feature the hard-bitten young Jewess Shoshanna Dreyfus who three years ago was Emanuelle Mimuex, a fugitive who witnessed the slaughter of her family. Nowadays Shoshanna is minding her business which happens to be running her own movie theater. But when her cinema becomes the site of a propaganda German film - an event to which the most highly ranked German officers are invited (even a certain failed artist) - Shoshanna sees a chance for get-back. I'd never seen French actress M&eacute;lanie Laurent in anything before, so I don't know if she's this routinely captivating. But her arc is the most heartbreaking. One of my favorite bits in the movie features Laurent in a showstopping sequence serenaded by David Bowie's \\"Cat People (Putting out Fire).\\" Others may say the inclusion of a Bowie song is jarring. I say it's friggin' brilliant.<br /><br />All the plot threads converge at Shoshanna's modest little theater, but not before Tarantino gets to play a little bit. He peppers his picture with compelling vignettes, treats us to colorful side characters. Michael Fassbender is very good as a British officer who goes undercover in France. Fassbender exhibits a cool steeliness which may have in part won him the part of Magneto in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS. Diane Kruger gets maybe her meatiest role as German actress and double agent Bridget von Hammersmark. Til Schweiger and Eli Roth make their mark as, respectively, the Basterds' sadistic German recruit, Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz, and the baseball bat wielding Sgt. Donny Donowitz a.k.a. \\"the Bear Jew.\\" For trivia buffs, Eli Roth directed HOSTEL and also the film within this film, NATION`S PRIDE, the German film which has its special screening at Shoshanna's theater. You can see this short film in its entirety in the DVD's bonus features.<br /><br />Tarantino's trademark cinematic flourishes are still present, although they may be a trifle subdued. His flair for dialogue isn't as in your face, mostly because sub-titles grace huge chunks of the film. But there's still a sense of suspense and the unexpected in the conversations. Anytime that Christoph Waltz chats up a potential suspect, or that tension-fraught sequence in the bar downstairs, the dialogue plays out like a high stakes chess match. I will say that I think this is the most disciplined that I've seen Tarantino in a while. Or maybe DEATH PROOF and its talky excesses lingers that strongly in the brain. That's not to say that INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS isn't talky, because it is. But Tarantino stays on point with the words. The script stays relevant to the plot. And while the action isn't at all as constant as that in KILL BILL, the violence when it arrives is chilling stuff. Lt. Aldo Raine's mandate is one hundred Nazi scalps from each of his men. They gleefully set about filling their quota. And if you're looking for a virtuous protagonist to pin your allegiance to, well, keep looking, brother. Tarantino delivers a strange, pulpy, morally-askewed war drama. INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS may come off like an arthouse film, but it's not for sissies.Hugo Stiglitz, and the baseball bat wielding Sgt.

B0054TKBBA|5.0|When I first heard MTV was going to be airing a television show based loosely on the characters from the Michael J. Fox movie I was very hesitant to watch. I expected the show to suck. But I was pleasantly surprised at how well it's turned out!<br /><br />I would do a real review, but the two previous reviewer's did an excellent job summing it up. All I can say is take a chance, watch the show and drink it in.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|It's good news for the world that my local apothecary doesn't produce batches of these mind-enchancing pills. Because, no doubt about it, my end game would involve nothing less than total world domination. So it's maybe better all around that it's Eddie Morra what ends up with the almighty brain boost. Dude seems more altruistic.    As LIMITLESS opens, Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) - unfocused, unkempt, and rocking a despicable haircut and a sickly pallor - is getting dumped by his more successful girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish). Eddie is a writer suffering one of them horrid writer's blocks, and this is as kicked to the curb as he's ever felt. So who can blame him for ingesting a panacea to his woes - a top secret pill which supposedly unlocks 100% of one's brain power? (Well, yes, you can blame him; kids, don't do drugs, or whatever).    And the pill performs as advertised, a happenstance director Neil Burger couldn't wait for because, on cue, he lets loose his first salvo of hyperkinetic, ridiculously inventive visual effects, translating on screen what Eddie must've been experiencing as his IQ is uplifted (to four digits, natch). And, best believe, while Eddie is under the influence, his perspective shifts to that of a warped, sharper-imaged reality. The film's first half is crazy awesome as we track Eddie's segue from hapless slacker to motivated genius. Eddie now can access all the bits of information that have lodged in his brain down the years. And he does what you and I would do. He lives out his wildest fantasies. He tackles foreign languages and tricky math equations and sordid philosophy. He takes on Wall Street with a ferociousness even Gordon Gekko would admire. He even finishes that book, and it looks to be a best-seller. Now, women are easy gets, money accumulated with the alacrity of belly button lint, respect and admiration raked in like leaves on a lawn. Eddie's meteoric rise in high finance soon gets him eyeballed by a ruthless Wall Street baron(Robet DeNiro). And DeNiro's no match for our guy, providing Eddie keeps on digesting them smart tablets on a daily basis. It's sweet that Eddie would want to get back with his ex-girlfriend Lindy. You like him better for it.    And then the side effects begin manifesting. They aren't pretty. He begins suffering migraines and memory lapses. Director Neil Burger unveils a passage which breaks down one such memory skip, giving us a distorted quick edit taste of Eddie Morra's out-of-body experience. Maybe the best bit in there is when Eddie is accosted by thugs at a subway station, and Eddie uses memory aid gained from watching Bruce Lee films to whup some butt.    And there's a scary Russian gangster.    LIMITLESS is one of them films in which I wasn't sure what to expect, but it turns out to be a really good movie, a highly charged, twisty kind of escapism. Bradley Cooper had been in a bunch of ensemble casts; I think this is his first really lead role, and he doesn't waste the opportunity. He turns in a charismatic, self-assured performance. I think it's key that he's able to keep his character as a genuinely nice guy throughout the picture.    The third act comes off weaker as the plot degenerates to routine chases and  confrontations. And, honestly, the film lost some of its humanity when it went away from Eddie and Lindy's love story. However, the coda - featuring Bradley Cooper's final run-in with DeNiro - brought back the bravado. I'm not sure how faded Robert DeNiro is from his glory days, but I will say that he and Cooper provide some really watchable moments in their scenes together. Mostly, you can't peel your eyes away from LIMITLESS, with its outrageous premise, its imaginative style and high wire act, and its sheer swagger. It's probably okay to give Bradley Cooper more leading roles.    The DVD includes both the theatrical version and the Unrated Extended Cut of the Film. Bonus stuff as follows: audio commentary with director Neil Burger; an alternate and less satisfying ending (00:05:14 minutes long); \\"A Man Without Limits\\" - focus on Bradley Cooper and what he brings to the role of Eddie Morra (00:04:27 minutes long); and the theatrical trailer. The back of the DVD case also lists a \\"Making of LIMITLESS\\" featurette, except I couldn't find it on the Extras menu.
159420229X|5.0|Notwithstanding the quite stunning story of the author's success itself, this book is quite an enjoyable read in itself on remembering - the history, personalities, and  more. This is not a handbook on memory-enhancing tricks and techniques though, be forewarned.<br /><br />It is easy to forget. If it weren't, we would likely all have gone mad a long time ago. However, not being able to remember is also a curse. Remember where you kept the car keys? And then you have people, normal enough, who have stunning powers of memory that inspire awe among us. People who can perform feats of memory we would consider outside the bounds of humanly possibility. We consider such people to be savants, geniuses, different-from-us. However, that is not necessarily the case.<br /><br />The advent of industrialization and the faux feelings of omnipotence that machines inspired among humans led to a devaluation of the powers of human memorization. The ability to develop one's memory was seen as a vestige of a less-developed era. The power of the internet is ensuring that such thoughts are  only being perpetuated further. This book then also serves as a timely reminder about the powerful mass of jelly that sits atop.<br /><br />\\"<br />\\"<br />Once upon a time, every literate person was versed in the techniques Ed was about to teach me. Memory training was considered a centerpiece of classical education in the language arts, on par with grammar, logic, and rhetoric.<br />...<br />\\"Ancient and medieval people reserved their awe for memory. Their greatest geniuses they describe as people of superior memories,\\" writes Mary Carruthers, the author of two books on the history of memory techniques.<br />...<br />But then, in the fifteenth century, Gutenberg came along and turned books into mass-produced commodities, and eventually it was no longer all that important to remember what the printed page could remember for you. Memory techniques that had once been a staple of classical and medieval culture got wrapped up with the occult and esoteric Hermetic traditions of the Renaissance, and by the nineteenth century they had been relegated to carnival sideshows and tacky self-help books<br />...<br />The externalization of memory not only changed how people think; it also led to a profound shift in the very notion of what it means to be intelligent. Internal memory became devalued.<br />\\"<br />\\"<br /><br />I first saw and heard about the author on the The Colbert Report in March of this year (link to video). It was a fascinating story. They author, Joshua Foer, a journalist, went to cover the US Memory Championship in 2005, was intrigued, challenged, eventually trained by one of the competitors, and then went on to win the championship. One year later. Yes, he won the 2006 US Memory Championship. This book, then, is an account of his one year journey from regular journalist to memory freak.<br /><br />So what kind of memory muscles does the memory championship test? Different kinds of tests seek to test different kinds of muscles, so to say. Can you memorize a deck of playing cards in a minute. No, make that under a minute. Memorize a sequence of random numbers - hundreds of them, in a few minutes. Memorize a number of random faces and then identify them by their names. Memorize an unpublished poem. And so on.<br /><br />Rather than make this a linear narrative about the author's travails, what makes this book far more interesting than it otherwise may have been is that the author delves into the human brain. Specifically he seeks to understand how the brain remembers, forms memories, and then retrieves those memories. Since the topic covers how memories are formed, it is but natural that the book also cover the two extremes of the scale - people who had super-human memorization capabilities on the one end, and people who could not remember at the other end. The sufferers in this second category have been well documented and also made famous in such movies asMemento (DVD, Blu-ray) and the Hindi (or 'Bollywood' if you please) blockbuster 'Ghajini' (DVD, Blu Ray), and more recently in the book, Before I Go To Sleep.<br /><br />The secret to building an Arnold-like memory physique, it turns out, is in training. In deliberate practice. In being focused. Simple as that. Anyone willing to put in the time, and that too not a huge amount of it at that, can improve their powers of memorization by an order of magnitude. Yes.<br /><br />\\"<br />\\"<br />I was willing to believe Buzan when he said there were techniques that one could learn to marginally improve one's memory around the edges, but I didn't fully believe him (or Ed) when he said that any schmo off the street could learn to memorize entire decks of playing cards or thousands of binary digits. The alternate explanation just seemed a whole lot more plausible: that Ed and his colleagues had some freakish innate talent that was the mental equivalent of Andr&eacute; the Giant's height or Usain Bolt's legs.<br />\\"<br />\\"<br /><br />The interesting thing is that even as we have got to learn more about our brain and its incredible complexity, our respect for its abilities seems to have devalued. We keep comparing it to a computer, initially, and then to the connected web that is the internet, and the amazing vastness of the Internet causes us to believe that the human brain pales in size, complexity, and capability. Which is not the case... The number of connections that the neurons in our brains can make with each other is so vast a number that it truly approximates our notion of infinity. And this is not a static piece of jelly that we are talking about either. What we see, learn, and remember itself can change the brain. The brain, its actual physical structure, can change in response to our learnings and memories. This is truly an astounding insight that we do not fully comprehend.<br /><br />\\"<br />\\"<br />The three-pound mass balanced atop our spines is made up of somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 billion neurons, each of which can make upwards of five to ten thousand synaptic connections with other neurons.<br />...<br />The brain is a mutable organ, capable--within limits--of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity.<br /><br />As I was combing the scientific literature, one name kept popping up in my research about memory improvement: K. Anders Ericsson. He was a psychology professor at Florida State University and the author of an article titled \\"Exceptional Memorizers: Made, Not Born.\\"<br />In 1981, he and fellow psychologist Bill Chase conducted a now-classic experiment on a Carnegie Mellon undergraduate, who has been immortalized in the literature by his initials, SF. Chase and Ericsson paid SF to spend several hours a week in their lab taking a simple memory test over and over and over again.<br />...<br />At the outset, he could only hold about seven digits in his head at a time. By the time the experiment wrapped up--two years and 250 mind-numbing hours later--SF had expanded his ability to remember numbers by a factor of ten. The experiment shattered the old notions that our memory capacities are fixed.<br />\\"<br />\\"<br /><br />The narrative proceeds along basically two parallel tracks. One is an account of the author's efforts as he worked to improve his memory, his ability to memorize what would essentially be random sequences of numbers, or faces, or lists. The other track is what the author digs through and finds about memory. The history of it, the people who have studied it, and its extraordinary achievers and equally striking sufferers.<br /><br />It turns out that we actually cannot remember more than a few items for more than a few seconds, unless, that is, we make a conscious effort to memorize those items. This effort can be byway of repetition, by association, or by some other means that allows this memory to become entrenched in our brain for a longer period of time. This magic number, of the number of items we can retain in our working memory, is seven. Give or take two.<br /><br />\\"<br />\\"<br />In 1956, a Harvard psychologist named George Miller published what would become a classic paper in the history of memory research.<br />...<br />His paper was titled \\"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information.\\" Miller had discovered that our ability to process information and make decisions in the world is limited by a fundamental constraint: We can only think about roughly seven things at a time.<br />\\"<br />\\"<br /><br />So what about chess players - grandmasters, for example, who can play twenty or more players at the same time, and usually end up beating all of them? And some even play these games blindfolded?! How on earth could they memorize the hundreds of positions on the chessboards, and then figure out what the situation is on each board, cogitate and calculate the next move to make? Fascinating? Yes.What is even more fascinating is the insight that the way these chess players approach these multi-player games is not by memorizing the position of each piece on the board, but by associating the chessboard with a similar board from their memory. They would have likely come across such a position of the pieces on the board at some time in their careers, and when they come across this same position again, they simply recall it from their long term memory and figure out the next move to make.<br /><br />\\"<br />\\"<br />But the most striking finding of all from these early studies of chess experts was their astounding memories. The experts could memorize entire boards after just a brief glance.<br />...<br />Using magnetoencephalography, a technique that measures the weak magnetic fields given off by a thinking brain, researchers have found that higher-rated chess players are more likely to engage the frontal and parietal cortices of the brain when they look at the board, which suggests that they are recalling information from long-term memory. Lower-ranked players are more likely to engage the medial temporal lobes, which suggests that they are encoding new information. The experts are interpreting the present board in term of their massive knowledge of past ones. The lower-ranked players are seeing the board as something new.<br />\\"<br />\\"<br /><br />In conclusion:<br />--------------<br />People looking to read this book to get a how-to compendium of steps to follow and supersize their memories  will be disappointed, because this book is not it. What this book however is is a lucid dive into the structure that is the human brain. By understanding our brains, and how we form memories, we can perhaps learn to respect its capabilities, and then harness it in a positive manner.

B000002N1E|3.0|Some of the songs on this album make you wanta go hmmmm. However,  if you LOVE his PURPLE BADNESS as I surely do, it is a MUST. There is a version of SHHH, previously done by Tevin Campbell and although it's not quite as soulful as his version, it's still worth having! Love The Most Beautiful Girl in the World ( who doesn't) and p control is one of those in your face kinda songs. If you have sensitivity to Prince's \\"I'm doing it cause I can \\" lyrics this one probably isn't for you. Over all, they try to gouge you for this one, be careful, you can get a good used one. If you're a collector of the still ever so funky baddest man on the planet, don't pass it up.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Having followed the guys for a few years now, I have to say, I wasn't particularly impressed with '[[ASIN:B000RJO578 Hot Fuzz]]'. Yes, that production had all the Wright/Pegg/Frost styling, but the energy - the juice just wasn't there; the laughs few.<br /><br />With 'Paul' the boys finally recaptured the essence of '[[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]]'. That creative spark of taking an iconic symbol and completely turning it on its head. Loved every minute of it!<br /><br />This flick can so easily become the 'Geek Test' of the new decade. A test I embarrassingly passed with flying colors - having seen and/or noted at least two dozen classic references. The best of which is the Mos Eisley Cantina scene. But there are so many more, I'm certain I must've missed at least a few. Director Greg Mottola did such an amazing job of working them all in. Kudos dude - you rock!<br /><br />Could Seth Rogan's smartass extra-terrastrial be any funnier?! Insanely hilarious! The guy had me tears with one liners that cannot be submitted here on Amazon - or repeated at your grandmother's house. But one bit, which occurs at the very end of the film, comes from Jane 'I Thought You'd Be Taller' Lynch. After a throwaway joke about seeing the female lead, Kristin Wiig's character naked, she responds completely deadpan: \\"I'd like that.\\" The look on Kristin's face! BWAHAHAHA! Priceless!<br /><br />And perhaps in his best big screen gig, Jason Bateman. He showed a maturity that I've never seen before. Having lived in the shadow of his smarmy former child star career for so long, I believed that he could never get beyond it. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. My view changed a bit when he did '[[ASIN:B001F76PDS Hancock]]'. But playing cold-hearted MIB Agent Lorenzo Zoil (say it out loud a few times &lt;laughing>) he truly felt like a zombified state functionary bent on success at all costs. Completely fantastic performance.<br /><br />I won't reveal too much of the plot - it would spoil it for new viewers. Hopefully, even non-geeks will \\"get\\" this film.<br /><br />My very deep appreciation to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost - you guys have made my year. Thank you. All in all an outstanding comedy/action flick and well worth the time and funds spent.

0553386794|5.0|In the Seven Kingdoms, winter is coming. Summer has lasted over 10 years and autumn is finally approaching, the harbinger of a long winter. North of the Seven Kingdoms, a supernatural force is gathering to battle against men. In the kingdom, the Hand of the King mysteriously dies, prompting King Robert Baratheon to ask his friend Eddard Stark to fill the position. Before he leaves, Eddard's son Bran has a tragic accident and he leaves not knowing whether his son will live or die. He enters King's Landing and a court where words and whispers are as sharp as knives. Treading carefully, he investigates the previous Hand's death and tries to run the kingdom despite empty coffers, a drunken, complacent king, and treacherous advisers. While he is away, Winterfell is in distress. An assassin tries to kill Bran, leading Catelynn, his mother, to suspect the Lannister family had something to do with his accident. She rides out to seek justice, leaving her 3 sons to rule. Can the Starks find out who their enemies are? Can Eddard save the King from the same fate as his Hand?<br /><br />I started out watching the television series, which I enjoyed, but the book makes it pale in comparison. I'm honestly not typically a fan of high fantasy. The stories seem very similar and rip-offs of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. I didn't expect to like Game of Thrones at all and I was pleasantly surprised. This series is completely different from most others in its genre. Magic is usually a large aspect of fantasy, but the instances of it in Game of Thrones are few and far between. I even forgot I was reading a fantasy at times. The plot is very detailed and complex with many story lines and subplots in each chapter. I love Martin's writing style and he manages to be detailed without being overwrought or slow. My summary of the plot doesn't do this book justice at all because there is so much more going on besides that one plot line. The story is also realistic and gritty. There is no romanticism nor is it an idealistic view of the Medieval era. Life is hard and it gets progressively harder as the book progresses. No character is safe, which George R. R. Martin demonstrates by the end of the novel.<br /><br />These characters are incredibly detailed and unique in their own way. My favorite are Eddard Stark, Tyrion Lannister, and Arya Stark. Eddard is honorable, serious, and reserved which can be mistaken for coldness by those who don't know him well. Arya is supposed to become a lady that will marry and bear heirs, but she's more interested in sword fighting and getting into trouble. Tyrion is a deformed dwarf and the shame of his noble family. He makes up for his lack of looks and height with cunning, intelligence, and humor. They don't fit into typical archetypes popular in the genre and seem more like actual people. These characters are not always clearly good or evil, but rest in shades of grey. Sometimes there isn't a clear hero or villain to depend upon or blame in each situation. Each chapter is told from a different perspective and Martin clearly captures each voice. Some chapters may even cover the same event and each character involved has a different view of it and a different version of the truth. This view of each character challenges the reader's views and sometimes even makes immoral or seemingly evil characters likeable.<br /><br />I haven't felt this sense of urgency when reading a book in a while. I felt compelled to read at every possible moment even though I knew what was going to happen. If you like realistic characters, mystery, intrigue, and aren't easily offended, I would highly recommend Game of Thrones.nor is it an idealistic view of the Medieval era. Life is hard and it gets progressively harder as the book progresses. No character is safe, which George R. R. Martin demonstrates by the end of the novel.

Arya is supposed to become a lady that will marry and bear heirs, but she's more interested in sword fighting and getting into trouble. Tyrion is a deformed dwarf and the shame of his noble family. He makes up for his lack of looks and height with cunning, intelligence, and humor. They don't fit into typical archetypes popular in the genre and seem more like actual people. These characters are not always clearly good or evil, but rest in shades of grey. Sometimes there isn't a clear hero or villain to depend upon or blame in each situation. Each chapter is told from a different perspective and Martin clearly captures each voice. Some chapters may even cover the same event and each character involved has a different view of it and a different version of the truth. This view of each character challenges the reader's views and sometimes even makes immoral or seemingly evil characters likeable.    I haven't felt this sense of urgency when reading a book in a while. I felt compelled to read at every possible moment even though I knew what was going to happen. If you like realistic characters, mystery, intrigue, and aren't easily offended, I would highly recommend Game of Thrones.
B001NESPHC|5.0|I first heard of Melody Gardot on the radio in 2008 and immediately wanted to hear more, so looked her up on Amazon and listened to \\"sample\\" tracks on this album.  Couldn't wait to receive the CD and when I did I played it and played it.  Her voice!  Her music!  I was speechless - that in itself is unusual for me!  If you like Diana Krall or Madeline Peyroux you should love this ... BUT she's not like either of them.  Don't know where she fits in genre-wise ... some say jazz. But in my humble opinion, Melody Gardot is a real standout original musician and singer in a genre all her own.  I have since bought her Worriesome Heart CD - also absolutely fabulous!  Love it, love it!  You need to listen to the sample tracks cos I just can't describe the \\"type\\" of music she writes and performs.  Just that it's COOL, SEXY, SAD, WARM and some great melodies and lyrics. Both great CDs!   Okay ... finished raving now.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Yes' sixth studio album entitled Tales From Topographic Oceans was released in December of 1973 in the UK and in January of 1974 here in the United States.<br />By 1973, the British progressive rock quintet Yes (which by then comprised of singer/songwriter Jon Anderson, bass player Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboard player Rick Wakeman and newer drummer Alan White) were one of the biggest British rock bands in the States (only rivaling Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, Emerson Lake and Palmer, The Who, The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd (who finally became superstars in 1973 with The Dark Side of the Moon)) as Yes' last four albums (1971's Top 40 charting The Yes Album, the double whammy from 1972 which was the Top 5 masterpiece Fragile and the Top 3 classic Close to the Edge and the triple live Top 20 charting disc from earlier in 1973 called Yessongs) had all been million sellers and the group had gone from playing theaters to sports arenas. When it came time for Yes and producer Eddie Offord to come up with a studio follow-up to Close to the Edge (and Alan White's first studio album with the band), the group decided to take the Close to the Edge approach ONE STEP FURTHER by having a double album which consisted of only FOUR SIDE LENGTH 20 PLUS MINUTE PIECES. Also, they wanted to record it out in the country but in the end decided on Morgan Studios (where Pink Floyd did much of Meddle and mixed Obscured by Clouds and Black Sabbath recorded Sabbath Bloody Sabbath) but had the studio decorated with toy cows, toy horses, hay bales and so forth. When Topographic Oceans did emerge, would the album either make Yes fans embrace the band more or drive those who wanted another Fragile and Close to the Edge away? Read on and find out (as I did when I first got a used cassette copy and eventually CD version of this classic in November of 1996).<br />The first epic (which was Side 1 of the original record) was \\"The Revealing Science of God (Dance of the Dawn)\\". On this remastered CD released in 2003, you get a 2 plus minute intro which was not on the original vinyl record (due to time constraints) which serves as a superb mood setter for this classic with collage of guitars and keyboards. Then Anderson, Squire and Howe's voices come in. Then the music comes in and a major epic is what's in store with various different movements that doesn't bore you for 22 minutes and I think the lyrics came from Anderson's desire to silence critics who said \\"Yes would put the Bible to music\\". Mission accomplished! The piece would end like it begin with the chanting in a quiet tone.<br />Track two of this double CD (which was Side Two of the original record) is taken up by the 20 minute epic \\"The Remembering (High the Memory)\\". This epic is about the wealth of knowledge that's available to humanity. Also that knowledge is important. The music on this suite is some of the band's best playing on any Yes album ever made (before and since).<br />The third and final track on CD 1 (which was Side 3 of the original LP and first song of original and 1994 CD remaster) is \\"The Ancient (Giants under the Sun)\\". This epic begins with wild percussion and steel guitar before going into another home run of a suite which tells of some of the forgotten knowledge from civilizations that came before us. While Wakeman and Anderson help make this piece great, Howe's guitar shines here, especially when it comes to the classical guitar solo which he would later utilize in concert solos in later years with Yes.<br />CD 2 of this new remaster (and took up Side 4 of the original album and last song on the original CD and 1994 remastered CD) is the epic \\"Ritual (Nous Sommes Du Soleil)\\". The lyrics describe aspects of the human condition while musically is one of the greatest things I ever heard. By the middle of the song, it gives way to a bass guitar led jam by Squire (who proves why he is one of the greatest bass players in all of rock). Then it stops dead and goes into a tribal drum solo by White, Squire, Anderson (with odd help from Howe) and keyboard effects by Wakeman that sounds like a sacrifice going on and ends majestically with Howe's guitar coming back and ending in a nice relaxed manner.<br />Despite the fact that Rick Wakeman didn't like much of this album (and he would quit the band after the Topographic Tour in Spring 1974 for over two and a half years), Steve Howe (on the other hand) thought the album was some of his best work ever as did Jon Anderson.<br />Also the public agreed (as do I) that Tales From Topographic Oceans was an excellent album. The album reached #1 in the band's native UK and a positive #9 here in the States and going Gold almost immediately.<br />In late 2003, the album was re-released as a 2-CD remaster (Sides 1, 2 and 3 on CD 1 and CD 2 is Side 4 with bonus tracks). The bonus tracks here are of early versions of \\"The Revealing Science of God\\" and \\"The Ancient\\" which is great to hear work-in-progress versions of two epics that would make key parts of this album. Plus you get a booklet which comes with story on how the album was made plus photos, lyrics and credits.<br />RECOMMENDED!te, Squire, Anderson (with odd help from Howe) and keyboard effects by Wakeman that sounds like a sacrifice going on and ends majestically with Howe's guitar coming back and ending in a nice relaxed manner.

B005DI9HPI|5.0|Every woman's library needs to contain some light, fluffy bit of escapism, and the I Heart series are just that. I Heart New York has so much going for it - a likeable main character, her highly entertaining friend, and enough of a plot line to keep the story going. Kelk's descriptions of New York made me feel like I was back in the city for a day, and I didn't want the book to end.

0553801473|3.0|George R.R. Martin says this book was three bitches and a bastard to write.  Well, it was three bitches and a bastard to read, too.  I have come to the conclusion that you can read either the first or last page of every chapter until you reach the last 300 pages, then read it completely.  The first 700 pages are a waste of time.  I'm 70 years old, and I didn't think I was going to live to finish this piece.  It's a drag.  Wish I'd never started with the series.
B000002G89|5.0|This is easily one of the coolest, most chill classic rock cds you can find.  Its an all-around classic, period.  The songs Clapton covers are timeless songs in their own right, and Clapton's covers are brilliant.  He couldn't have found any other songs to cover to create the mood so precisely and as rich as he did.    \\"Steady Rollin Man,\\" \\"I Cant Hold Out,\\" and \\"Willie and the Hand Jive,\\" are blues covers from three of the biggest names in blues, Robert Johnson, Elmore James, and Johnny Otis.  To me, these are the stand out tracks, because these old musicians are being lost in american music.  This is considered one of Clapton's 'pop' cds.  But that might be because of the success of \\"I Shot the Sheriff.\\"  To me, covers of these legendary musicians shouldn't be written off as mere pop music.      At any rate, this cd is classic, every song on here is either perfect or nearly perfect.  The more traditional blues and reggae cover songs are interwoven between fresh ballads like \\"Let it Grow,\\" and jams like \\"Mainline Florida.\\"  I would recommend this to any fan of classic rock - no rock cd collection is complete without this.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|If anyone is looking for music to chill out to and just relax, look no further. I, for one, CANNOT get enough of Bon Iver. Even though, I don't understand every single word yet, somehow the lyrics are moving. The soulfulness of his voice, the eeriness (I mean that in a great way) of the instruments, invokes feelings in me like nothing else can. I'd recommend Bon Iver for anyone who digs the folk/indie genre of music.
0439813786|5.0|There's a lovely line in The Invention of Hugo Cabaret that states, \\"If you've ever wondered where your dreams come from when you got o sleep at night, just look around. This is where they are made,\\" (p. 387). While the line is referring to films, in my mind it's also giving credit to Selznick's brilliantly imaginative book. To those young, it brings to life mermaids and spaceman, and to those older, it brings back the idea that hope and imagination do not need to be lost with age.    It's 1931 and 12-year-old Hugo Cabaret lives in the Paris train station. By day he's the clock master, climbing through the walls to ensure all of the clocks run smoothly. By night, he's an inventor, trying to piece together an invention his father found years ago. He believes that once the automation - a machine that creates human-like actions - is complete, he'll find one last message from his father. Of course, his plan is both interrupted and guided along by the nearby toy store owner and his goddaughter, Isabelle. And in time, Hugo learns his invention is connected to more people than just himself, and that it'll unlock more secrets than just that of his father.    The story is told in both text and graphics. It's not a graphic novel - there aren't words for each picture, and a picture for each page, and it's not a flip book. Instead, it's a 526-page book that features nearly 300 pages of beautifully sketched drawings - made my by the author himself - that help guide along the story.    Selznick's book is fantastically imaginative, and an overall wonderful read. The story is may seem simple, but it has many layers with an overall reveal at the end. And the drawings only add to the emotions created. Hugo is a great protagonist, filled with wonder and curiosity and anger, like any other 12-year-old. And Isabelle is an adorable sidekick who has more punch and spark than many other children her age. There's also a decent amount of real history woven in delicately, inspiring future reads.    While it is a children's book, The Invention of Hugo Cabaret is a fantastic book for every age. It's a story full of clockwork and wonder. One of mechanics and dreams.  Of youth and old age. It shows that while magic may, in the end, have an explanation, that doesn't make it less...magical.
0439023491|5.0|Loved these books! Have read the series twice and can't wait for the movie in 2012. Bought Catching Fire (second book) & Mockingjay (third book) ,by Suzanne Collins, from Amazon. Both were hard back books. I bought the first book of The Hunger Games series, paper back, at a department store and got the better deal from Amazon. Would definitely recommend these books from Amazon!!!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|Wow, i just finished and i feel like i read 8 whole books, not 1! i want to keep this review on the short side but i don't even really know what to comment on. i guess i'll just go 'book' by 'book:'<br /><br />1- The book started out pretty good, i really enjoyed the scenes with Kvothe at school, with his friends and hanging out with Denna. 4.5 stars<br />2- without being too spoilery- Kvothe ends up leaving school and going somewhere else to be employed by a very rich and powerful man and ends up meeting Denna there too. 4.5 stars<br />3- Kvothe goes on an adventure with some other people in order to capture some bandits. 4 stars<br />4- Kvothe meets Felurian, an immortal magical sex fairy and they have sex and hang out naked FOR CHAPTERS AND CHAPTERS and we get to hear about how fantastic 16 year old Kvothe is in bed. ZERO STARS.<br />*** i signed up to read a fantasy. i didn't sign up to read THE AUTHORS PERSONAL SEX FANTASY. come onnn!!! where was the editor???<br />5- Kvothe goes to the village of one of his friends and learns about fighting. the author tries his hand at sociology and anthropology by creating a female dominated society where people people believe that women have babies without the aid of men and having sex is about as intimate as having a conversation and blah blah blah. 2.5 stars.<br />*** this entire portion felt so forced and unrealistic. the author was just going out of his way, bending over backwards to make his convoluted little society work. And this portion also contained A LOT of dialogue that was in question and answer form as if Kvothe is interviewing someone or being interviewed. it became reeeeeally tedious to read.<br />6- Kvothe comes back to the real world, rescues 2 girls, massacres a group of bandits. 3 stars<br />*** at this point i'm just going 'Poor chronicler has to write all of this stuff down, word for word!! his poor writing hand!!! none of these little side stories even have anything to do with the overall plot!<br />7- Kvothe goes back to the rich guys house blah blah blah drama blah. 2 stars<br />*** i'm getting really bored by this point and i'm really not enjoying the 'omg people are so racist against the edema ruh' story. WHEN WILL THIS BOOK ENDDDD<br />8- oh, he's finally going back to school.....oh, he found denna again...... Yawnnnnnn 3 stars<br /><br />This book seriously either needed to be chopped in half or edited waaay more thoroughly. it started out great but was a pain to finish. The tiny bits of info we manage to glean about the Chandrian are so few and far between that you can literally skip this book and jump from book 1 to book 3 and not miss anything. I'm just glad book 3 isn't out yet, I CANNOT deal with any more Kvothe anytime soon.<br /><br />And just as a side note, I don't know why the character of Bast annoys me so much but everytime he interjected with his 'OMG RESHIE NOOOOOO!'s i wanted to reach into the book and choke the guy! Does the author realize how obnoxious this character is?<br /><br />So yeah, 3 stars. I really started wanting to give it either a 4 or a 5 but it all went downhill right around #4 and never picked up it's momentum again.<br /><br />Better luck next time.lah blah blah drama blah. 2 stars   *** i'm getting really bored by this point and i'm really not enjoying the 'omg people are so racist against the edema ruh' story.

1442344989|5.0|This little girl was so strong and amazing despite the things that she went through. I couldn't imagine abuse like that and still be in one piece. I was just amazed at her survival. After she was rescued 18 years later with the therapy she had, I think she is going to be fine. I thought the cd's were perhaps better than a book. This guy had mentally abused her also so that she had to depend on him for her thinking too. Phillip had her scared of everything.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a great CPU cooler, as so many other users have attested.  It does a great job keeping my i5 2500K @ around 32 degrees Celsius.  Setup was quite easy, especially with the youtube instructional video on how to do it.  My only issue in setup turned out to be the closeness of the memory to the cpu.  I had to mount the 212's fan about 1/2\\" higher than the very bottom of the unit to avoid making the first memory channel inaccessible.   Otherwise I love it and the price is terrific for such a well-reviewed item.

B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This movie has enforced what I already knew and yet opened my eyes wider too.  We should buy organic foods because as they are scanned at the supermarket we are indeed voting for healthy food.  Read the labels of what you buy and if you can't pronounce the ingredient, don't buy it.<br /><br />The horrors of the way animals are treated caused me to cry. Yet, some farmers encourage their cattle to graze on grass and are producing healthier meat.<br />This is a life changing movie that you should watch.<br /><br />Let the young ones watch too (they're used to violence in the movies) and they will open their eyes to how to live in the future.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Sure, the other reviewers are correct that there aren't so many big events in this book as in the first three.  Frankly, I don't care.  As long as George finishes this story in the next few years, I'll be very happy.  This book focuses mostly on Tyrion, Danny and Jon Snow.  If you find those 3 characters as interesting and complex as I do, then you'll enjoy this book.  To me this book is mostly about further detailing the complications that make decision-making so difficult for those who have power (Jon and Dany) and for those who suddenly have none (Tyrion).  It's a fantastic read which I finished in a very short time period.  After I got about 50% done, I zipped through the last half.<br /><br />I think it goes without saying, if you haven't read the first 4 books in this series, start from the beginning.

B004GCPJDQ|5.0|This is a great little gadget.  I had no problem inserting the battery pack to make it fit smoothly.  The feel and functionality of the mouse remained intact.  The charge lasts for a long time, but when recharging, the charging light never stops blinking to come to a steady green, so you have to guess when it is fully charged.  Small price to pay for having an instant charging option rather than searching for brand new batteries each time it needs recharging.
0142410705|2.0|I did not enjoy this book. I could honestly say, the first three chapters made me laugh out loud, especially as Hassan was first introduced, but after that, there were random moments here and there where I laugh and think \\"good one Green\\", but it's just not up to par with his other books.<br /><br />An Abundance of Katherines is about a child prodigy - Colin - who seems to have dated in one form or another 19 different Katherines (with a K). Not only that, but he's been dumped by most of them. And with his most recent Katherine break up, he is devastated, and thinks very little of himself. In steps the savior best friend, Muslim-Lebanese-American Hassan, who has gotten used to picking up the pieces of his insecure yet unique best friend, Colin. This time's remedy? A road trip!<br /><br />This marks the start of a wonderful, inspiring, self-achieving and self-changing journey for both boys.<br /><br />In Tennessee they meet Lindsey, a loner/turned popular girl who doesn't have many aspirations beyond her little town, and the group of people she knew and grew up with.<br /><br />Colin is obsessed with becoming a \\"genius\\". He is not satisfied with being a child prodigy, but wants to go one step further and become a genius who leaves his mark in the world and is forever known and remembered. In other words, he wants to be famous for his brain. I did not like Colin very much, he is way too self-involved to the point of being really annoying. The maths threw me off a lot of times, and I found it extremely irritating and just skimmed through most of it because I felt like it took away so much from the actual story.<br /><br />Basically, Colin wants to invent a mathematical formula that predicts when relationships will end and who the \\"dumper\\" and \\"dumpee\\" are. His obsession with the whole \\"Katherine\\" thing, and becoming famous, really made me dislike him as a character, which in turn made this story very unattractive.<br /><br />Also, I find this quite funny, because I'm an Arab Muslim myself, but non-Arabs seem to think that the written Arabic is the same as the spoken Arabic. It is not though. We have so many different dialects and accents that we use as our speaking language, and Hassan being Lebanese should have been speaking Lebanese Arabic, and yet he was speaking traditional written Arabic (the language of the Quran, which is very old and not used in speech anymore). It's basically like having a 17 year old American speak medieval English and sound like Shakespeare.<br /><br />All in all, I usually commend John Green for his understanding of teen psyche and drama. And I commend him for creating characters that will always stay with you and who are so memorable and unique in their own way. This time though, I believe the characters were very forgettable - as is this book.think that the written Arabic is the same as the spoken Arabic. It is not though.

B000068FXX|5.0|Most Supertramp fans will say that their best efforts were on Crime of the Century and Breakfast In America. And while I'm inclined to agree that both are good, Even in the Quietest Moments is often slept on. Chances are that unless you're a die hard fan, you probably won't know any other tracks off of this except \\"Give a Little Bit\\". Truly a staple among their discography, and its a favorite of mine, the rest of the album is chock full of good music to vibe with. Following the opening of \\"Give a Little Bit\\", the next track is \\"Loverboy\\". Now its not exactly my favorite song on the album, actually its my least favorite to be honest, it reminds me a little bit of Queen. My comparison might be wrong in some folks' eyes, but the musical style is similar to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Next up is the title track, which is a melancholy song begging for a significant lover not to walk away. Rounding out the first side is \\"Downstream\\". This is where the album starts to pick up steam. Real simple song about spending a lazy day with someone special, not over done musically. \\"Babaji\\" comes next, which was an ode of sorts for Tramp member Roger Hodgson, giving praise to his religion of choice, although I'm not quite sure which one specifically. Regardless, it proceeds to start of the second side with a bang. Following that, we have \\"From Now On\\", which I'm sure most working class folks can relate to. If you're doing your day job and feel in a rut, check out this track. Finally, \\"Fool's Overture\\", which references events revolving around WWII. Not a bad climax clocking in at over 10 minutes. The main downside is that Quietest Moments is very short consisting of just the seven tracks, which by today's standards is more of an EP than an LP. But maybe that's the way they wanted it to be and keep their fans wanting more. Think of it as an appetizer to Breakfast In America. But this is one of those situations where the appetizer has a better flavor than the main course. But both albums aregreat. This particular one stands out for me though. Check it out for yourself if you haven't already done so.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Loved the movie. The Characters were well cast and the things that were made to be creepy or yucky really made you cringe.  The link to the first movie made for a great ending
B000005JFG|5.0|If this hasn't been said before, then I'll say it. STOP REFERENCING THE SCENE FROM AMERICAN PSYCHO! No disrespect to Huey Lewis and the News, but all these repetitive quotes on Fore and Sports is tired and old. If you really want to reference a movie, how about some of Huey's dialogue in the movie Duets, or any TV roles he played. Aside from my rant, Fore is a very good record. It definitely ties with Sports as the group's best work. Notable tracks are pretty much all the singles: \\"Stuck With You\\", \\"Hip To Be Square\\", and \\"Jacob's Ladder\\". Another favorite is \\"I know What I Like\\".
B002QW7ALM|2.0|Good sets, acting and basic plot but no cigar for the slow plodding suspense and cheesy mutants. And, yes it is partially an \\"Aliens\\" clone, and starts looking like a few other quasi-cyber martial arts hybrids and modern TV SF (science fiction) drama. So not bad to fast-forward through thoug, the sets and the space special effects were first rate. Pandorum would have made a good SF short story. This movie was way too repetitive and predictable to be taken seriously, except for ending, which I did like, in more ways than one.

The story was a great fantasy, it was well written and held my attention right from the beginning. I read the entire book in 1 night.<br /> I would definetly suggest this be more of a young adult book. I keep thinking my daughters will love it when they are 14 or so!  Great job!
B00000IL67|5.0|If you love AC like I do this is a must have...There are tunes on there from the 60's...He sounded like the Beatles on Rock!  Truly an amazing artist...He is the pioneer of stage show theatrics and shock rock...Before Bowie...Very smart and talented man.  My idol
B00425S1H8|5.0|I've bought a lot of various RS232 adapters, but none have been as inexpensive and reliable as this one. So many end up not working well with one or another item, but this has been compatible with all the hardware I've thrown at it.     Pros:   -Great hardware compatibility.   -Drivers for all OS's I care about (windows, Linux, OS X)  -Inexpensive.     Cons:  None that I have found yet.

0307272702|3.0|Right after I read this book \\"Why We Get Fat,\\" I was super-enthused. I was able to lose eight pounds over a month cutting sugar, fruit and carbs. Then it's been at a standstill as I've resorted to eating more nuts and so the idea of fat not making us fat is likely untrue. Admittedly, I still consume carbs, but always whole grain, and along with beans lentils and veggies. It is very true that insulin governs fatty deposition, as once diabetics start on insulin they have a time losing weight. However, there's a lot more to weight management than simply saying that eliminating carbs is the answer to being overweight.<br /><br />This book does not give a practical diet for the planet, however: it is unsustainable. We just can't live on meat; most of the earth's residents can't afford it. He ridicules grain, seemingly forgetting that most of the planet is alive because of being sustained in life by grain. He makes a good point about impoverished Native Americans that are obese and yet malnourished, due to being given sugar and bleached flour and subsisting on little else. There was a video I saw about Jillian Michaels helping natives lose weight. In it they showed a community gathering, and deep fried flour cakes was a big part of the eating process. We know that the cheapest food in the USA is also the most fattening.<br /><br />My ancestors in South India were farmers, living healthy on a high carbohydrate vegetarian diet. In the past fifty years, however, with the increasing use of sugar and white flour and white rice, the incidence of disease has gone up. That being realized, simply blasting carbohydrates is not the answer.<br /><br />My diet will consist of whole grains, beans, lentils, vegetables, some fruit, and a serving of fish once or twice a week. Chicken at times, beef even more rarely. Having realized that I have been getting myself unhealthy with too much sugar and refined carbohydrates in the past year (until the last couple of months) I plan to avoid those to my very best. I plan to allow myself a hundred calories of something sweet a day to avoid building up cravings. But right after a meal, not on an empty stomach! And my most favorite indulgence of cappuccino and cake has to be limited to once or twice a month!!<br /><br />And oh, one thing...I'm quite uneasy about Mr. Taubes' assumption that saturated fat is perfectly healthy. I'm just more comfortable with fats that are rich is Omega 3 and mono-unsaturated fat.<br /><br />Raja Bhat, MDlan to allow myself a hundred calories of something sweet a day to avoid building up cravings.

B004HD61KE|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Sigma force novels and could not wait for this book to come out. I thought this was a good book but I did find it lacking in something. Even so, I cannot wait for the next Sigma novel to come out and hope I don't have to wait another two years for it.

So why didn't they just put the headphones on him when he has to read the speech at the end? It was a speech on the radio -  no one would ever know!

1451629184|4.0|A Stolen Life by Jaycee Dugard is probably the most disturbing memoir I've ever read. Jaycee doesn't flinch away from describing her abuse and a lot of the time, I had to stop reading the book to take a breather before I could go back to reading it. What happened to Jaycee is just terrible and no one should have to go through it, especially a child. It really made me angry when I realized that Jaycee had many close calls in which she could have been rescued had probation officers, hospital personnel, and other professionals been more vigilant. Had they paid more attention, Jaycee Dugard's nightmare would have ended earlier. I have to say, that A Stolen Life is not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />However, the whole story is not grim. The fact that Jaycee remained hopeful throughout her capture, the fact that she tried to be the best possible mother to her daughters even in those terrible circumstances, proves just what a wonderful, compassionate human being Jaycee Dugard really is. People like her give me hope. I wish Jaycee Dugard all the best in the world.
B000063V8U|5.0|I am a complete Star Trek TNG fan and have all 7 seasons. The best episode I think is in the 2nd season and is called \\"The Measure of a Man\\". I enjoy also the logs where the actors talk about the series. It was crazy to take Gates McFadden off as the doctor.  Thank goodness she agreed to come back for the third and remaining seasons. The worst episode is the very first episode. I just love the character Data and also like Wes. It was wonderful when Wil came back for the episode, \\"The Game\\". I have watched the episode \\"Data's Day\\" any times.  It is funny.
B004USRKR4|1.0|I purchased this soundtrack album because I liked the movie so much, but I found the CD to be disappointing. I expected it to be a full length album, but it turned out to have only five songs.  That I could have accepted if the songs were great. However, in my opinion, the lyrics were banal and the melodies were simplistic. Alex Turner sounds good but, with the possible exception of \\"It's Hard to Get Around the Wind\\", the material is weak.  But I still love the film.

B004LROMSY|1.0|Than sit through reruns of this show. It's a pathetic excuse of a show and incredible waste of money and talent. The producers totally butchered  the myth and history behind King Arthur and Camelot. The characters had the depth of a paper doll. Eva Green as Morgan only saved the show 1/3 through, beyond that, her character was so unlikeable and the dialogue so predicable and dry, it was better to watch the show on mute and enjoy teh scenery than to sit through the garbage. The only redeeming quality is the title track, lush, haunting, intense, not to be missed!
B000000WHC|5.0|This is a lesson of electric blues! Gary Moore show us how to play a blues like few. Using a Les Paul, every music inside is able to cath you by ears and to take away from earth´s surface. Amazing album.  By the way, Zoverstock was a awesome customer supporter because they were able to resend the second cd because the first one was missed during shipping process. Certainly, during my next time cd shopping they will be my first option to shop indeed.  Thnx to Zoverstock people! I received the cd last saturday (Aug 13 2011).

It was so over-the-top that it was great fun, and I laughed out loud during many of the scenes.  Buy this if you want to indulge in an hour or two of pure pleasure filled with laughs.
0143038419|5.0|so I suppose many readers (some who haven't even read the book even) would assume it to be self-absorbed, judging the book by its 'cover' of memoir. Reading many of the negative reviews I do detect the major green stink of jealousy...    I loved the book and the journey it took me on. All I'll say is that it was surprisingly transformative for me, everything else has been said by those more eloquent than I.
0553801473|2.0|After reading a Dance with Dragons, I've found myself apologizing to the many friends and family members that I've recommended series to over the years.  To echo other reviewers' comments, for those that have already begun I would suggest reading through `a Storm of Swords' while watching the HBO series, then wait to see if Martin actually finishes the series before considering reading 'A Feast for Crows' and 'A Dance with Dragons.'  This installment is just as weak as the previous, primarily for the lack of critical plot development.<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br /><br />The redeeming section of the novel is the segments taking place in Northern Westeros.  The Bran, Jon, Melissandre, Davos, and Theon chapters are all very well-conceived and fascinating.  In fact, imagine if five years ago, Martin reversed his release strategy and published a 500 page book with just the events that occurred in the North from A Dance with Dragons (same prologue from a Feast with Crows explaining delays).  I think many of the long-times fans and readers would say this component in isolation would probably be rated a solid four stars.<br /><br />The problem however is taking the books four and five together with a ten-year release time.  Combined, the two books are exceedingly weak.  As others have commented, Danys and Tyrion have gone from critical plot drivers to uninteresting and nearly irrelevant.  I would even suggest, the constant use of repeat phrases or themes \\"where do whores go,\\" and Dany pondering love for multiple chapters become not only irrelevant, but annoying to read.<br /><br />Beyond the critique of two characters, there are now too many plots lines that never truly advanced.  Moreover, it seems unlikely that these elements are to be resolved in a satisfying fashion if done in just two more books.  To cite a few of the critical plot lines that never advanced- The `Others' movement south, Dany's return East, Tyrion's purpose, Sansa/Arya, the intents of Littlefinger, ora true understanding of Bran's role in the North (\\"To be a tree or not to be\\").<br /><br />Instead, the last two novels have placed a near primacy on a subset of side-stories and mysteries such as Connington/Aegon, a certain woman's identity in White Harbor, Zombie-Cat Jamie & Brienne, Lannister vs. Tyrell intrigue, Dornish characters, Victaron and his horn, identity of \\"cold-hands,\\" Franken-Gregor and Cersei, and others.  While these aspects maybe interesting, they either are too much of a tease with too little information and unsatisfying endings (Brienne, White Harbor), or a complete waste of time (Dorne).<br /><br />As others have noted in their reviews, the strength of the first three novels was the advancing of a great main plot that was interjected with compelling stories such as recalling the Tower of Joy, the Trident, and former knights in the Kingsguard.  Books 4&5 not only inverses that successful formula, but have done so to the point it has really diminished my joy for the entire series.  In summary, I can no longer recommend the books.
0061997811|5.0|This book is a must-have for all Harry Potter fans.  The level of detail, pictures and special features beats anything else out there.  The \\"scrapbook\\" style of the book is amazing.  A copy of the Marauder's Map, invite to the Yule Ball, invite to Hogwarts....it truly is a beautifully done book.  You will not be disappointed in this purchase.
B001PPLKI0|5.0|This collection of Elvis' gospel music has it all!  I checked all of the Elvis gospel music CDs before buying this one.  This CD contains all of his gospel songs in one place.  The only one it does not have is one about the Rosary (Sorry, I can't remember the exact title.).  It's the most expensive but the most complete.  The quality is excellent and Elvis' beautiful voice is clear and moving.  If you are interested in Elvis gospel music this is the set to get.  It was a birthday gift for my husband that we both enjoy.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Definitely the best keyboard I have found for my DInc. The Sense one drove me nuts because I type pretty fast and it always missed the first letter when I tapped two at almost the same time. SwiftKey X has handled that wonderfully with just a few blips. Plus the text prediction is fantastic, which saves a lot of time and effort. The only thing I have found is that it&apos;s not good at figuring out what you mean when you miss the first letter of a word, but that&apos;s a small issue compared with everything it does well. Highly recommended.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|Well, I have been waiting a long time to read this book. I was so excited when I got the book. Well, it was nothing like I thought it was going to be. It was an easy read and over all it told a good story, but it would have been better if there was more dialouge. It was also hard to follow. I'm not saying don't read it. I'm just saying that the book didn't live up to my personal expectations.

B000002KIE|5.0|I've always felt that there has to be some explaination as to what a 14 year old Black kid from Dallas Texas would have to do with 20 something punk pioneers from England.    I stumbled into Never Mind The Bollocks full of anger and an open mind. I find it weird that I even understood what they were singing about, but two new words had entered my vocabulary: Anarchy and Abortion. At the time I first heard this album, the only music that was going around my house was Cameo's Word Up, Two Live Crew and Run DMC's Raising Hell.I also had entered the Pop realm and actually owned a copy of Glass Tiger's Thin Red Line (don't laugh).    I could feel the angst in this album in between Johnny Rotten's snarling, and like I said before, I totally found it weird that I understood what he was saying and I really felt he was preaching the Gospel (of what church, I still don't know), but this album improved my speech abilities. 24 years later I still love this album, because it broke down a barrier for me and made me respect the British (The Thompson Twins or Culture Club were never this heavy).

B0050PYNP8|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 1.5<br /><br />Two sci-fi nerds also obsessed with extraterrestrials, crossing paths with a real-life \\"ET\\", seems like a clever enough premise for a new science fiction comedy. Unfortunately, the new concoction, \\"Paul\\", is completely predictable and features few laughs. This time the bumbling protagonists, Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings, are from Britain and after attending the annual \\"Comic-con convention\\" in San Diego, drive down in their RV to visit all the extraterrestrial sites of critical importance, including the most famous 'ET' site of them all, Roswell, New Mexico. In that vicinity, they run into Paul, a foul-mouthed extraterrestrial, who has a similar appearance to the aliens purportedly seen or captured in Roswell. Paul has been on the run from a shady government agent by the name of Lorenzo Zoil, who answers to a mysterious female superior who doesn't appear until the end of the film. Zoil also conscripts two bumbling FBI agents who have no clue as to Zoil's mission.<br /><br />The main problem with the film is that the 'Paul' character is unpleasant and unlikeable. Instead of the a gentle Spielberg 'ET', Paul is depicted as being crass and the film's scenarists (Pegg and Frost who play the lead characters) think that's funny. There's a scene that's symptomatic of the whole problem with 'Paul'. While driving in the RV, a bird is killed and Paul brings it back to life with his special powers. Graeme and Clive are overjoyed that Paul has been able to resurrect the bird but are suddenly horrified when Paul stuffs the bird down his throat for a tasty meal.<br /><br />There are other distasteful moments in 'Paul' including the elimination of the FBI agents as well as Zoil's superior (played by Sigourney Weaver), crushed by Paul's alien aircraft, which has come to back to earth to save him. In a lightweight comedy such as this, having characters killed off (especially since they're only ineffectual buffoons), spoils the light hearted tone of the plot.<br /><br />Speaking of the plot, there's little to mention here. Paul manages to convert a foul-mouthed Christian Fundamentalist (Ruth) into a mensch by first curing her of blindness in one of her eyes which she's been afflicted since childhood as well as sharing his knowledge of the universe via a kind of mind meld. Paul also seeks out the woman who saved his life when his spacecraft crashed back in 1947. Despite the fact that Paul killed the woman's dog when the spacecraft crashed, she seems genuinely glad to see him, as his presence vindicates her life-long claims that indeed she saw an alien when she was a child. Both Ruth and Tara are such ditsy, over-the-top characters, that one can hardly take either one of them seriously.<br /><br />'Paul' ends with a scene reminiscent of 'Close Encounters', with an alien ship coming to rescue a now more 'sensitive' Paul (his decision to revive Graeme after he's accidentally shot to death by Ruth's father) seems to invigorate his cynical soul. Zoil reveals that he's actually been trying to help Paul, Tara joins Paul in the spacecraft and the Brits end up at the next comic book convention with a new book based on their misadventures with the newly self-actualized extraterrestrial.<br /><br />Alone, the bumbling Brits truly have little to add in terms of 'on the road' comedy adventures. Their decision to depict Paul in their own image (boorish and crude), undermine the film's potential, which could have ended up more in league with Spielberg's charming take on extraterrestrial machinations.arted tone of the plot.

140053271X|5.0|Easy to read, use, great for laying against leg as it does not slip so hands and arms are more relaxed. Two different options for turning pages as one reads is very useful. The changing of the pages (on all ereaders) must be gotten use to, but not a bad negative.    Excellent way to approach a more green world, read old, new books, and enjoy life.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|The first half of the book of Deathly Hallows doesn't have much action, but does have much emotion. Same with the movie. The pacing is leisurely, sometimes TOO leisurely, but the emotion is intense and there's a real sense of danger and crisis. The action sequences are explosive and scary, and some of the \\"on the road\\" scenes are breathlessly beautiful. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson all push their acting envelopes. Best moments: a heartbreaking dance between Harry and Hermione, the Godric's Hollow sequence, and the pursuit by the Snatchers. I wish director Yates had varied the blue-gray palette, but if you bring patience to the viewing, you'll have a rich experience.    The Blu-Ray transfer looks good, and I was relieved to invoke English subtitles so I could comprehend what the characters were saying. Over the past decade, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson have gone from speaking in crystalline British syllables to mumbling unintelligibly.    The extras follow the tradition of all the Potter DVDs--they're crap. Well, except for the Maximum Movie Mode version of the film, with many pop-ups and mini-documentaries. That's interesting. \\"The Seven Harrys,\\" showing how this special effect was accomplished, COULD have been informative but it's so quick and raggedly cut that it's of no help. \\"On the green with Rupert, Tom, Oliver, and James\\" features a quartet of Potter actors playing a round of golf and reminiscing about the series. Not enlightening (and you REALLY need the subtitles for this!). \\"Dan, Rupert, and Emma's running competition\\" is a one or two minute featurette about Dan, Rupert and Emma trying to outrun each other during the Snatchers scene. Useless. No commentary track from director, actors, or anyone else. The Parnassus of DVD docs remains those on the Lord of the Rings packages.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Think of \\"Let's Get Digital\\" as a primer on self publishing in the digital ebook age.  It's a great overview of what the new industry is doing and how authors can take full advantage of it.  It could have very easily been the textbook on digital publishing, but it would have been way too long and cumbersome.  Gaughran did a great job of keeping it down to a readable level and giving the information you'll need to move forward with your self publishing project while still giving resources for finding much more information and details.
B004G600A4|5.0|My youngest son and I just finished watching this movie on Netflix and loved it.  I plan on purchasing this (and Princess and the Frog in the next several weeks).<br /><br />Tangled has is an action packed ride from AND hilarious from start to finish.  The storyline had some familiarity, but just enough new stuff to not confuse us well-seasonded Disney fans. Its not your typical princess movie, so my boys felt as if they could stomach it:0)

B0034JKZ86|5.0|My family and I loved this movie (but then we have been Disney movie fans for a long time).  The music was fun, the energy vibrant and the bad guy was reprehensible and evil - as usual!<br /><br />For the people who didn't like this film, or make an issue about this movie not being family oriented, what the heck?  Cruella Deville - hideous to look at; AND even worse, she wanted to make coats out of those cute little dalmatian puppies.<br /><br />The dark, beautiful, evil and ULTRA vain woman in Sleeping Beauty scared me to death as a child.  That woman wasn't messing around.  The fact that she turned into this deceptively 'sweet' old woman was even scarier because, who would be afraid of a sweet old woman?<br /><br />I'm kind of hoping these negative reviews about this movie isn't what I think it is.  I've already read one ignorant post mentioning color, even going so far to mention the scatter brained white people in the movie.<br /><br />Seriously?  Princess and the Frog was original and typical of Disney films - all of them fun and a joy to watch!

I have 3 pairs in different colors and wear them to work everyday.
B005869U6G|5.0|Come on people-give this album a chance. The first couple of times I listened to it I'll have to agree, I wasn't too impressed. But it has grown on me and now I think it is one of Incubus' best to date, right behind Morning View. It is definitely not as heavy as previous albums but has all the other elements. And \\"In The Company Of Wolves\\" has to be one of the best new songs I've heard in a long time with its Pink Floyd rhythms.
0553801473|4.0|ADWD is a solid GRRM book. Better than many books from other writers, not as good as Martin's best.<br />While reading, one can fully understand why GRRM had such problems to solve \\"the Mereeneese knot\\",as he described it during the last years.<br />I'm not sure, whether his final way to solve it was the best one, but I am quite sure that his writing will get easier for the next books.<br /><br />Tyrion chapters were surprisingly weak for this time, although weak Tyrion chapters are good still.

0064400557|5.0|It was a classic work that I wanted to read as an adult.  I made it a point to do this after I learned a little about EB White's life on NPR.  I plan to give it no my daughter so that she can read it to her children when she starts her own family.  Excellent read!!
0553801473|3.0|I understand that the A Dance with Dragons was supposed to be a book read alongside A Feast For Crows but It seems like Martin has lost control of his characters and this book just does not live up to the lofty standards set by the first three. Even A Feast for Crows was better. Not many things happen in this book and the entire book could be summarized in 3 pages. The characters (especially Cersei) seemed to have evolved pretty fast for such a small amount of time. Not saying that the book is bad, It just needs some good editing.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been using SwiftKey X for about 2 months now.  It has by far the best predictive text I have ever seen or used!  I used the iPhone for about 3 years before I switched to an android, the iPhone's predictions can't touch SwiftKey X.  The best part about it is it predicts your next word with percision.  About 90% of the time I am clicking entire words making for the fastest texting possible.  I was lucky enough to get this as a free daily app, but it is worth the 3 dollars. Buy it, you will love it!!
B004WOS3P4|3.0|I really, really like David but was very disappointed in this CD.  After listening to it more than several times I found that all the songs sounded the same to me.  In my opinion it certainly wasn't the well-balanced effort such as his first CD.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|The CD's title is ironic in that this is the last album David Gilmour and Roger Waters collaborated on. The musical theme is actually the social breakup of Great Britain since World War II with the title acting as a convenient signpost for the breakup of Pink Floyd.   Waters gives full expression to the wartime death of his father, touched on in \\"The Wall,\\" and its seeming pointlessness. The unity produced by war and the social disintegration amid peace runs strongly through the 13 songs.   \\"The Post War Dream\\" is not a slap at Margaret Thatcher. Waters admits his own and the public's guilt - \\"What have WE (caps mine) done Maggie?\\"   \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" is a sigh of regret and an appeal for reassessment - \\"Do you remember me? How we used to be? Do you think we should be closer?\\"   \\"One of the Few\\" is a brilliant distillation on the power of leaders and teachers to create docility and play people and groups off each other - \\"make em me, make em you, make em what you want em to.\\"   \\"When the Tigers Broke Free,\\" \\"The Hero's Return,\\" and \\"The Gunners Dream\\" presents the see-sawing continuum of war and peace, backed handsomely by orchestra. Expanding the community of common responsibility that was the dream of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and others is touched on in \\"The Gunners Dream.\\" The injustice of abortion, which has done so much to unravel Britain and other nations, is brought to mind - \\"And everyone has recourse to the law and no-one kills the children anymore.\\"   \\"Paranoid Eyes\\" is about the descent into personal hopelessness as society falls to pieces. Booze and media stories help imprison the soul - \\"You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory. Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age. The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high.\\"   \\"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\\" is about Britain's war with Argentina over some islands most of us can't remember the name of, an example of needless fighting caused by the need for politicians to look tough. Waters, invoking his father's name, creates a place for adults with a childish fondness for war in \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home.\\" \\"They can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles, and abuse themselves playing games for awhile. Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead.\\"   \\"Southampton Dock\\" is another attempt at reassessment with foreboding that another generation is going down the same bad road - \\"All agreed with hand on heart to sheath the sacrificial knifes...But in the bottom of our hearts we made the final cut.\\"   \\"The Final Cut\\" and \\"Not Now John\\" are about the distractions that take us away from our best intentions. As Rabbi Mayer Schiller writes in \\"The Road Back,\\" modern society's lights and noise almost seem designed to make man lose sight of the permanent things. Waters drops that thought into a man/woman setting - \\"I held the blade in trembling hands. Prepared to make it but then the phone rang. I never had the nerve to make the final cut.\\"   \\"Southampton Dock\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\" contrast the ease with which societies cut loose their soldiers alongside the impotence in cutting free from our bad personal habits.   The division of \\"One of the Few\\" returns in the meditation on economic competition of \\"Not Now John\\" (a memorable chorus backs Gilmour on this track). Virtues, including England's social cohesion (the \\"John\\" is likely national symbol John Bull), go into the trash can, something that's only increased with frequency since the release of \\"The Final Cut\\" in 1983 - \\"F..k all that we've got to get on with these. Gotta compete with the wily Japanese.\\"   The CD's concluding song - \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\"--remind us that we're confronted in every generation and every day with the opportunity to do better. Pink Floyd, the grand rock-and-roll poets of melancholy, isn't optimistic about most choosing the good in time to reverse social meltdown. The best one can hope for is personal salvation in life's final moments - \\"And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate leaving only charcoal to defend. Finally I understand the feelings of the few. Ashes and diamonds. Foe and friend. We were all equal in the end.\\"

B000UD0ESA|5.0|I wish I had this sort of special edition of every one of my favorite movies...my only complaint was that in the documentary portion they show parts of scenes that aren't in the final cut...and i would love to watch those scenes with commentary as well.

0307463745|2.0|Contrarian advice is more fun that regular advice, but not necessarily good advice.  I suggest that you read excerpts of this book before purchasing, as I found them representative.         The book exaggerates to make points.  If you simply adopt their advice verbatim, I would expect failure.  If you pick thru their approach and find what makes sense to you in your niche, then you can get something out of it.  They built a great business, but their timing was at least as good as their service.  If you have read Malcolm Gladwell, this coincidence is not surprising.      Parts of this book seem nuts to me - I wince and put it down.  I will keep trying.  One of my favorite quotes is from a 1950's marketing book I read 25 years ago & is my review title here.  I don't remember the rest of that old book, but that one phrase has been a mantra for me.  You might find a mantra in ReWork too, but I have not... yet.

0439023513|4.0|I am a little flummoxed at the level of disappointment that people are feeling about this book. I think the reason that so many are disappointed has to do with their desire for romance and a happy ending. This is a book about the atrocities that people in power can commit against each other and the way that it effects everyone else. I know there is a lot of disappointment about Katniss and her apathy towards Gale and Peeta, but honestly, would that really be her first priority? I would hardly think that having a boyfriend is first on the agenda. And sadly, people do die in combat, no matter how much you like them. Isn't that the point of the books, to see how people can be affected by a controlling souless government?
B0028RXXE8|5.0|As a history buff I found some of the inaccuracies to be a little frustrating (Caesar's full head of hair comes to mind), but it is a compelling story and it is very well told. The acting and directing are both excellent. Simply outstanding bit of storytelling.
0374158460|3.0|There are parts of this book that I would give 5 stars.  However, the change in tone for the various segments aren't equally well-done.  In particular, I thought that the voice for Patty was okay at first because she was a jock and that was always pointed out over and over.  But, by the end, it was the author trying to be a woman writing her final chapters and though I wanted to see how it finished, he started to lose me.  He gave voice in that same vein for the son, the rocker -- but not for the daughter nor the end love interest.  I was glad, eventually, because he doesn't do the women as well.  It just seemed as if a man were writing as a woman.  The story also got a wee bit too protracted for me...almost like a Grisham novel with just too many involvements and twists.  After the Corrections, I expected another home run........glad I finished it...but it started better (or more well-written) than it finished if that makes any sense.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|Read and pay attention to all the comments on the more extensive reviews for the Zagg shield for Iphone 4. I wish I had, because I regret buying it. This Zagg product offers unlimited replacements if damaged if you register it, and they do this for a reason. My Zagg shield didn't last more than a week. It was peeling off in a lot of places. Now the replacement is having trouble too. Everything sticks to it, but somehow it cannot stick to my phone. The adhesive doesn't seem to work with the Iphone 4. Save yourself the money and try another product to protect your phone.
0765350386|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a good fantasy novel. After becoming disenchanted with Wheel of Time by Book 8 and burning through all of my other favorite authors like Hobb, Bishop, Carey and Martin...and having a baby!...I took a break from the fantasy genre for a while. But just last week, I bought this for my new Kindle and was not disappointed. I truly couldn't put it down for long periods of time. I know some other reviewers said it was a bit slow, but I didn't find it so at all. Perhaps I have been gone so long from the fantasy realm that I was just soaking it all up, but I thought that this book had a great pace. I love the magic system, as others have mentioned. It is original and interesting. I love the characters as well. While I agree that some characters are not as developed as others, I think Sanderson did a good job of developing the important ones for this first novel. I have already bought the second in the trilogy and can't wait to dig in. This was a fun and fast read.

B004A8ZWSS|3.0|If this movie was any kind of success at all, the credit goes to the British actors in the film. It might have been more appealing had Rufus Sewell and Johnny Depp swapped roles. Too much Princess Grace/Sophia Loren melodrama for this viewer's taste. Have to wonder if today's movie goers don't appreciate it as much as the older generations did back in the day.     The movie had too much of an \\"Aren't I the most beautiful woman in the world?\\" vibe from the too thin Angela Jolie, who is an impressive actress usually. (She does nice British accent as does Depp.) But actresses \\"back in the day\\" had curves. Not Jolie. She's apparently dieted them all away. Johnny Depp is a favorite, but not in this role. And definitely not with that hair. However, if the producers were trying to make him look ridiculous, it worked.    Venice is breathtaking, but Rufus Sewell is even more breathtaking. Not nearly enough of him in the movie. Just a few titillating glimpses. Timothy Dalton and Paul Bettany were two more excellent additions to the cast.    It's a shame the lack of chemistry between Jolie and Depp spoiled the movie. Sewell would have been the better choice if they wanted to convey truly simmering and sultry chemistry. Ah well, there goes another missed opportunity.
B000MV90IU|4.0|Corny monotone lines and washed out Technicolor.  Simply beautiful!  Plus the greatest car chase ever!  And I'm talking actual car chase with cars!  Not CGI, fake cars built for the stunts, using nitrous, or any stuff like that. McQueen even does his own driving (for most of it anyway).I only complaint is that the sound track need to be remastered.  It might be in Dolby, but its weak.

B004UXUS64|5.0|A young woman driving intoxicated slams into another car, killing two people. Upon her release from prison, she meets the husband and father of those she killed. This coincides with the appearance of a planet identical to ours in the universe. This is a pretty deep film, despite its low budget and unknown cast. Will the woman tell the man that she killed his family? Is she going to travel to earth 2? The film's unlikely storyline is overshadowed by its powerful narrative, that of a woman seeking forgiveness from someone she has hurt and wanting to know if she has another self in the same predicament. This one is a real gem.
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|I think the historical accuracy of \\"Memphis Belle\\" is very questionable but from an entertainment aspect and film-making quality, it was very good.  The depiction of what it was like to have flown against such an enemy at a time where the outcome of the war was very much in question with such incredible odds against surviving is mind-numbing.
B003Y5H5C4|2.0|A young man working as a pizza delivery guy is forced to rob a bank when a bomb is strapped to his chest. He enlists the help of a friend, and they must attempt to outwit the bad guys. This is another modern-day comedy, loud, vulgar, and a brand of humor aimed at a young audience. This film appears to have either been poorly scripted, or just filmed from an outline of an idea, with the cast filling in with ad-lib lines. Whichever it may be, the movie does not have enough solid comedic moments. If this had combined a theme of dark humor with clever comedy, it would have been unique, but you have a film with some good moments, but just not enough of them.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|Thank God I watched this on Netflix, because I wouldn't ever waste money on this. What a horrible way to advertise New Orleans with Voodoo. And why do most of the characters reference Creole food and how you should eat it? Who cares! I guess this was Disneys finger to their first African American Princess movie. The Art is half-assed and Sloppy. The Character design is not even creative the princess looks like Belle from Beauty and the Beast, and the rest of the characters were drawn by an artist who had a hangover. I mean c'mon if you wanted to make a movie to piss off the African American community just make one about Hurricane Katrina.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|The packaging for the 3 disc is for me the most convenient packaging I have seen so far, I like all the content of the blu ray, its not as detailed as I would like and they could have put more footage on it, maybe a 4 disc blu ray set, however I am satisfied with the content of this 3 disc set.<br /><br />The only thing really good about AVATAR movie itself is the creative world of pandora and the navi, and THE PHOTO-REALISTIC VISUALS, WHICH IS WHY I BOUGHT THE MOVIE.<br /><br />What I hate about this movie is 1. The story is one of colonialism and prince princess fantasy, white man colonises native americans, one white man fall in love with native princess and fight for her people against the white man, POCAHONTAS has this exact story.<br />IN SHORT THIS STORY IS A PATHETIC CHILDISH FAIRY TALE FANTASY AND A DISGRACE TO SCIENCE FICTION!!<br /><br />2. I HATE SPIRITUAL ELEMENTS TO FICTION, WHICH ADDS TO THIS CHILDISH FANTASY, the idea of a REAL DEITY of any kind in a SCI FI is a DISGRACE to science fiction and insults my intelligence. DEITY both in fiction, and deities worshiped by real people are a form OF CONTROL AND DICTATOR SHIP, EVEN IF THAT DEITY IS A PEACEFUL ONE like eywa.<br /><br />I could think of better stories, like tribal warfare on pandora with creative advanced tech that is primitive by our standards. The story of young navi finding a place on pandora, currupt tribal leaders ect. all FAR better stories than that fantasy.<br /><br />OVER ALL THIS IS A GOOD BLU RAY SET FOR ALL FANS WHO LIKE THE MOVIE FOR THE GREAT HIGH QUALITY VISUALS and sexy humanoid aliens.<br /><br />[EDIT] Correct spelling errors and deleted the email address I no longer use!
B001KU4P6Y|5.0|this album is one of my favorites. the modern production sound really sets Gotan Project apart from other tango music.    5 stars.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|First: worth the price (for Kindle).  Dave Mustaine (DM) comes off as a decent guy overall, if a little self absorbed and more than a little neurotic.  GOOD:  Kudos to him for not doing the typical' I screwed this many groupies' thing that is very typical of the genre. Indeed, this is what I expected, and somewhat hoped for. (hey, like the Don Henley song says, we all love dirty laundry, right?)  Instead, we get an honest look behind the scene. Sometime there are gaps between the times mentioned, but that can be written off to either nothing to mention, or drug induced blackout for those times. Also, he's brutally honest about his shortcomings, and his mistakes. He admits when he messes up, and tries to make up for it in later years.  Also, this book goes into his head past the music, so the reader gets to see his political beliefs, his thoughts, etc. Truly a look at the man who leads one of the biggest thrash bands ever.  BAD:  Again, the guy seems somewhat self absorbed, but for the purposes of this book, I'll write that off to, in fact, being 'the guy' in the band, the one who had to oversee everything and maintain his own shortcomings, while being a defacto 'daddy' to his band members. Also, he needs to let Metallica go, he's a star in his own right.  OVERALL:  Like his career w/ Megadeth, this is not a 'must have', but is you like his music, this makes a good companion to it, and is very enjoyable, if somewhat dry and boring at times. Just like his music, come to think of it.

B0012GMV58|5.0|During the recording period of CARAVANSERAI, Carlos had become close friends with both Alice Coltrane, the widow of his hero John Coltrane, a recently deceased pioneer in fusion jazz, and with John McLaughlin, fusion jazz guitarist extraordinaire.  He had met and married wife and spiritual partner Deborah King-Santana.  Carlos, his drummer Michael Shrieve, Alice Coltrane, and John McLaughlin had all become members of the Self Realization Fellowship led by guru Sri Chinmoy.  The \\"fusion\\" of this new spirituality with the music of these new devotees became a new force in both jazz circles and among the musical followers of Santana.  CARAVANSERAI propped a window open for Santana fans, and WELCOME held a door wide open.  Most fans were so wowed by this new album, if they had not given a listen to his collaboration with McLaughlin, LOVE DEVOTION SURRENDER, they soon did.  LDS was a tough listen and a hard sell.  If you did not take to it right away, chances were you would not ever.  However some fans did come back and give it a second and third go, especially after the follow-up to WELCOME, the mostly soothing and new-agey ILLUMINATIONS by Carlos and Alice Coltrane with some of the New Santana band members, a string orchestra and Indian percussionists.  These brackets, or parentheses, LOVE DEVOTION SURRENDER and ILLUMINATIONS are two of the most unique albums in both the rock and jazz worlds and are highly worthwhile to the open-minded listener.  They were \\"remixed\\" by Bill Laswell into one package that is fluid and dynamic with some connecting tissue; look for my review of that album here:<br />[[ASIN:B00005MKE4 Divine Light: Reconstructions & Mix Translation - Bill Laswell]]<br /><br />WELCOME refines the \\"new\\" Santana band even more and refines the sound of CARAVANSERAI into a synthesis of beautiful Latin fusion jazz, Latino salsa rock and African rhythms.  Holdovers from CARAVANSERAI who make notable appearances here are Wendy Haas (piano player and backing vocals on CARAVANSERAI) who shares leads vocals on one song, and backing on another; Jules Broussard, saxophonist, lays down haunting leads on Herbie Mann's Mother Africa, rearranged here by Carlos and keyboardist/arranger Tom Koster with some of Shrieve's best drumming ever, Jules will become a prominent fixture in ILLUMINATIONS and in the next Santana album BORBOLETTA; Alice Coltrane lends a beautiful hand at arrangements and some piano; Flora Purim, Brazilian jazz vocalist and wife of jazz percussionist Airto (who will also become prominent in BORBOLETTA); John McLaughlin himself on a fusion guitar duel with Carlos; and finally Leon Thomas on vocals.  Richard Kermode rounds out the new troupe with additional keys and percussion adding an even deeper layer to the Santana Band feel.<br /><br />Love Devotion & Surrender, the second track actually finds Carlos, Wendy, and Leon each taking a hand at lead vocals on a smooth jazz inspired by the recent work with McLaughlin.  The keys are bright and uplifting with sonic highlights by Michael Shrieve and the percussion team.  Samba De Sausalito carries LD&S over by way of some beautiful Brazilian percussion and keys by Areas and company.  When I Look Into Your Eyes, a composition by keyboardist band co-leader Koster and Michael Shrieve brings the jazz elements and brightness even further into the ears, and Yours Is The Light carries it all the way to Rio with gorgeous scatty vocals by Flora, and with a coda of backing vocals by Wendy and Leon's trademark jazz-yodels.  This would once upon a time have ended the first glorious side of a smash treasure.<br /><br />\\"Side Two\\" would open up with cosmic Mother Africa, one of the bands best ever tunes in keeping with their often Africanized stylings.  I will not cover all the beautiful music on this album, but note that the new remaster has an extra track worthy of placement on any feature album:  Mantra by Carlos, Michael, and Tom Koster.  My only complaint, it should have been wedgedin between \\"side one\\" and \\"side two\\" so as not to interfere with the \\"natural ending\\" given us by the original beautiful piano closer, the title track.<br /><br />If you like or love jazz music, if you are a fan of Santana and have not explored the 1972-75 period of the band, if you had these on vinyl and have not yet grabbed these up, if you liked the direction that CARAVANSERAI took but did not take it any further, then this is one splendid work of art for you!  Critics considered this one of Santana's best albums ever.  It is overall uplifting, joyous music, a beautiful noise.<br />Surrender to this music and you will be free!<br /><br />Check out:<br />[[ASIN:B000006ZUV Illuminations]]<br />[[ASIN:B0012GMW34 Love Devotion Surrender]]ide two\\" so as not to interfere with the \\"natural ending\\" given us by the original beautiful piano closer, the title track.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The Help is the best film I have seen this year.  This film is about the examples of accepted racism in the early sixties, but it is also about the friendship between women. I like the way director Tate Taylor deals with both subjects equally well.<br /><br />There is a very beautiful song included in the movie. It is entitled \\"The Living Proof\\". It is performed by R and B singer Mary J. Blige.  This is such a moving song about enduring hard times but still having a sense of dignity about life.  The soundtrack also includes classic songs by Chubby Checker and Frankie Valli, but the new Blige song is definitely the highlight in regards to the music.<br /><br />  The performances by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are excellent.  They are two black maids who both work for white families.  They cook, clean and raise other people's children.  These maids do their jobs do their jobs with such dignity.  I admire these fictional characters.  They seem like real people to me.  These actresses bring the characters of a novel to life on screen.  Emma Stone plays an aspiring writer who documents the experiences of these two women in a book entitled The Help.  Bryce Dallas Howard plays a racist white woman.  Jessica Chastain plays another white female character with a much softer heart. Sissy Spacek gives the movie a humorous element with her performance.  I laughed and cried watching The Help.  The Help is an excellent film.
B0012GMXYM|5.0|As with SANTANA, ABRAXAS, and SANTANA (III), Carlos Santana and Santana Band seemed to group musical styling into threes.  The next three band albums following the aforementioned were CARAVANSERAI, WELCOME, and lastly in the fusion jazz Santana era was this incredible gem BORBOLETTA.  Not counting the Carlos projects LOVE DEVOTION SURRENDER with John McLaughlin, and ILLUMINATIONS with Alice Coltrane (each of which featured some key Santana Band members), these next three albums, numbers four, five, and six chronologically, in their history set a remarkable standard in contemporary music of the time.  They neither offered nor charted any singles, they were fusion-jazz driven without losing the core \\"sound\\" of Santana, they were fully album-oriented works, and they demonstrated the apex of musical genius and talent so early in the careers of all members, not just Carlos.  The music on all three of these albums is beautiful, moving, expressive, complex, and yet simply enjoyable!<br /><br />Very \\"Brazilian\\" in musical orientation, BORBOLETTA is easily understood as a jazz-funk-fusion work.  WELCOME began it and BORBOLETTA continued a melting pot where Carlos' lead guitar left a lot of room for his percussion, saxophone, and keyboards to set the moods.  Don't think for a second however that Carlos takes a back seat for this trip, his scathing leads on the Dorival Caymmi masterpiece Promise Of A Fisherman, Practice What You Preach, as well as One With The Sun, and the funk-filled Give And Take.  Although top-heavy with Brazilian incantations, BORBOLETTA incorporates some Arabian influenced melodies in Mirage and Here & Now, full of syncopation and haunting melody.  Brazilian songstress Flora Purim is back with vocals for the record as well as assisting her husband, renowned percussionist Airto in opening and closing the album with jungle rhythm and percussion.  The opening Spring Manifestations, with its birdsong and whistles mutates into the beautiful pathways of Canto Del Los Flores and the Michael Shrieve tympanic Life Is Anew, which eventually lead to the ultimate fusion-heavy Aspirations featuring Jules Broussard's wailing sax.  By the time you are nestled back down in the jungle world finale (Borboletta) The Promise Of A Fisherman has whirled you across the globe in a guitar kaleidoscope of never-ending proportions.<br /><br />The original vinyl album cover was a beautiful silvery-metallic blue and was Carlos' homage to Flora and Airto's breakthrough album Butterfly Dreams, a magnificent jazz album in its own right and a perfect companion piece to BORBOLETTA.  [[ASIN:B000PY30JO Butterfly Dreams: Keepnews Collection]]  Leon Patillo, an R&B funk vocalist, brings a new synergistic twist to the vocal sounds of Santana and with Flora in the background it is a most impressive blend.<br /><br />Saxophonist Jules Broussard dominates this record when Carlos is not, his addition to the group being wholly immeasurable!  This is not a Santana album to miss or deny access to your collection.  If you don't have it, it is a true Must-Have!  Let's drop one more name, shall we?  Original Santana bassist Dave Brown marks his return to the band here after rehabilitation, but for about 50% of the album, bass duties go to none less than the master himself: Stanley Clarke!

B0055D3EOG|4.0|The general consensus among Amazon reviewers of Insidious is that the first half of the movie is awesome, and the second half is not so good. Sadly, I could not agree more.<br /><br />It begins as one of the most effectively creepy haunted house movies I've ever seen. I was positively giddy about it. Then somewhere around the halfway mark, it very suddenly devolves into something that looks like it was made for television. The scenes in \\"The Further\\" look like they were filmed on location at Spooky World. The general tone, the acting, and the dialog all take an unexpected turn for the worse.<br /><br />There are a few great moments in the second half that still make it worth watching. I especially liked the bit about the father's childhood photographs.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I'd give a lower score for such a let down, but I give this movie 4 stars on the strength of its first half alone.  It's that good. If the whole movie had been that good I would have given it 5 stars easily.<br /><br />If you like haunted house movies, don't let the disappointing second half of this movie deter you from watching it. You'll be missing out.
B005EJNAK4|4.0|In a futuristic society a brilliant differently abled scientist creates a way for people with no or limited mobility to be able to do anything their hearts desire... from a dentist chair in their own homes through use of a synaptic uplink to a Surrogate, a Cyborg built to their specifications and based on their ability to pay for baseline models that only see, move, and talk to top of the line models able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Naturally there is a group of humans who refuse to embrace this new way of life and this is the driving force of the movie... which group is right? Unfortunately, someone has developed a weapon that shuts down the Surrogate and scrambles the brain of their owner. Who is behind it? Can Bruce Willis find out in time? I personally give the movie 4 stars because I liked it, but found the premise creepy on several different levels. My biggest problem with it was: Why pay all that money for some Cyborg if you are strapped to a chair the entire time they are at work doing your job for you running them so they can do your job? Otherwise, it is a great premise and does deliver a lot of twists and turns that make it worth the rental. I avoided going to see this at theaters because of all the bad press and reviews it got so please let me assure you that YES, I would have felt I had gotten my money's worth if I had seen it in a theater so do not let bad reviews and negative hype keep you from an enjoyable experience.

B004EJUMT2|3.0|A very 70's sounding vibe on display here.  The music is very gripping & surely does not sound anything at all like outta 2011.  This really sounds like a cross of King Diamond, Mercyful Fate, Blue Oyster Cult & Venom all wrapped up in one big basket.  I can't offer a higher rating due to the lack of originality (sorta) but it is still a good listen from time to time.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Fans of the acclaimed series Neon Genesis Evangelion should add this to their Anime collection.    At this price, it is pretty much impossible to pass up.
B004WOJ9E8|4.0|After listening to this album for the past 2 weeks, I love it alot although it is not as balanced as Paradise Lost.  There is a certain \\"sameness\\" feel to several of the songs.  Even though I dont think they all sound the same,  there just isn't the mix of sounds that normally makes up a Symphony X album.  I believe the issue is the fact that every song opens with a fairly heavy Michael Romeo riff (not always a bad thing!), but not until the closer does one song open with keyboards or piano.  That song in particular, When All is Lost, sounds more like the typical Symphony X sound to these ears & the song would probably have been better placed right in the middle of the album to break up the overall sound structure of the album.  I'm not complaining at all, the songwriting is excellent however & songs like Dehumanized, Children of a Faceless God & Electric Messiah just sing as album highlights.  Iconoclast is really very good, is more guitar driven song after song, so in the end, I dont think it's album of the year like some are chiming.  It is one of the better albums i've heard so far this year & certainly will make the year end list even with the batch of late year releases still coming.

Filled with laughs and excitement...you and your children will be on the edge of your seat or falling off with laughter!!

The acting is over the top, the plot is so full of holes you could market it as a new kind of swiss cheese, the special effects are laughable.

0553579908|1.0|Ok, so I am disappointed that the author feels he must use so much twisted rage against women to sell his books.  I get the fact that he is trying to convey.  These are brutal times and brutal people.  I just feel that the books are very well written and don't need these cheep tricks to sell them.  Women are of 3 categories; 1st and foremost, whores. 2nd are young stupid woman to be raped and not just once but repeatedly and then brutally killed.  3rd are the manipulative scheming women who will certainly come to the same end as the young stupid women.  Basically women are inferior and don't deserve to live unless they are worth raping and then you kill them and go on to the next.  I am halfway through the second book and I fear I will probably not finish it.  If you are a fifteen year old boy or a woman hater that doesn't have the money for any new porn, this is the series of books for you.  BTW, don't get attached to any of the characters especially the heroes or heroines (especially a heroine) because they never have good fortune and most likely will be killed off.  If I wanted to read about raping and pillaging basically extremely sorrowful subjects, I have plenty of current events to choose from.  I read to escape, not to depress myself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B004LWZW4M|4.0|\\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" takes as its inspiration the fourth film of the original film series but goes in a very different direction all its own.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />James Franco plays Will Rodman who invents a genetically engineered virus that treats the brain growing synaptic tissue. He's losing his race against the disease as it claims his own father Charles(John Lithgow). Forced to adopt the baby chimp of one of his chimp test subjects, Rodman finds that the \\"cure\\" has been genetically passed along to Caesar (Andy Serkis in a motion capture performance). Caesar demonstrates the intelligence of a human.<br /><br />When Caesar defends Charles from a neighbor, he finds himself condemned to a primate sanctuary with other chimps, gorillas and orangutans. Although he's initially rejected by his own kind, Caesar later begins to identify with the other primates and determines to make them like him and rise up against humanity.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Director Rubert Wyatt (\\"The Escapist\\")does a nice job of keeping the action moving while allowing the characters to develop within the context of what is, essentially, a science fiction thriller. The script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (\\"The Relic\\" and \\"An Eye for an Eye\\")cleverly incorporates many of the themes from the original \\"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\\" as well as bits of dialogue and even characters named after the people that worked on the original \\"Planet of the Apes\\" (\\"Franklin\\" after original film director Franklin J. Schaffner, \\"Jacobs\\" after producer Arthur P. Jacobs, \\"Dodge\\" after one of the characters in the original film, \\"Maurice\\" after actor Maurice Evans, etc.). All of those tributes would be meaningless if the film wasn't entertaining but, luckily, it is and without being heavy handed does raise some issues without derailing the film.<br /><br />Although the film is flawed (there are some plot holes and bits of illogical action that occurs in the film that can be overlooked if you buy into the premise of the film), \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" is an exceptional attempt to revitalize the franchise. The writers cleverly set up a number of sequels including one for a \\"Planet of the Apes\\" reboot involving a very minor subplot mentioned about a mission to Mars that mysterious vanishes.<br /><br />\\"Rise\\" will entertain you and won't leave the bad taste in your mouth that Tim Burton's poorly thought out and directed remake did (and you can pretend it doesn't exist--it doesn't tie in to THAT film at all thankfully!).<br /><br />Recommended.be overlooked if you buy into the premise of the film), \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" is an exceptional attempt to revitalize the franchise.

0062515675|4.0|In \\"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,\\" Robin S. Sharma clothes sound advice for spiritual and personal growth in a thin mantle of fiction that delivers much instruction but minimal entertainment. However, Sharma's fictional approach makes for an easy read and good retention of his key principles.<br /><br />Spiritual/metaphysical content: The narrator spends one revelation-filled night with Julian Mantle learning the fundamentals of spiritual growth. Julian imparts everything he has learned from his time with the Sivana monks, cramming a lifetime of wisdom into their short time together. Sharma structures the lessons into seven chapters based on a short fable full of symbols. Each symbol represents a key idea from the Seven Basic Principles for Enlightened Living. Each chapter ends with an action page that summarizes the symbol, what you need to remember, and techniques to try, such as the Ten Rituals for Radiant Living.<br /><br />My take: Sharma calls his book a \\"fable\\" in the subtitle, but it is both more and less than that. The fable part takes place in the opening chapters of the book, in which we discover that the hard-driven attorney has moved to India, become a monk, and after three years has returned to pass on his wisdom to his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. That's the extent of the story, and character development fares little better. As a work of fiction, the book leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />However, as a collection of easy-to-digest life strategies and pearls of wisdom, the book is quite satisfying. Sharma has organized the book around a short fable about a garden full of symbols (a fable within a fable), which makes it easy to understand and follow his 30-day plan to enlightened living. The give-and-take of dialog between Julian Mantle and his student rescues the story from the tedium of an instructional guide. If your primary goal as a reader is to quickly absorb the core of Sharma's life improvement teaching, then this book is a great place to start.

B00007L4MJ|4.0|I recently purchased \\"The Complete Metropolis\\" which has the complete version of the film. It was found in South America but was a 16mm print from an original 35mm print, but they used the wrong gate that facilitates the optical track, and so some of the film (a small portion at the top of the screen) is cut off. The restored SA sections (about forty five minutes!) are sometimes startling in the imagery, but doesn't help the weak plot. But as is often said, it's more an historical issue than artistic. My biggest complaint about the Complete version is the rerecorded soundtrack music. Here ya are watching a restored (they really couldn't do that much with the 16mm print, it looks bad no matter what anyone says, esp when compared to the scenes where they used the 35mm restoration from the camera negative)... silent film with re-recorded soundtrack in pristine stereo, and the soundtrack music is maudlin, really. But, it's a silent picture, you can just turn it down. But having that score and finding the original German title cards (for the censors) in the order they were meant to go enabled them to put the film back together in exact sequence. I'm wondering what this \\"authorized\\" version is, it isn't complete. The complete version was only released last year. Stay away from the colorized cut with pop music for a soundtrack... If you really want to see the full version, you must get the 2 disc \\"Complete Metropolis\\".

0446571415|3.0|. Heard HELL'S CORNER (Hachette Audio), written by David Baldacci and read by Ron McLarty and Orlagh Cassidy.<br /><br />The story is apparently the fifth in a series of what's called the Camel Club . . . I have not read any of the other books, but it wasn't a problem because this book stands on its own.<br /><br />It involves a guy who was once the most skilled assassin his country has ever had . . . he is asked by the president to serve his country on a high-risk, covert mission, but even before it begins, it changes radically as the result of an apparent terrorist attack.<br /><br />The beginning was quite exciting, but about halfway through, it morphed into what I thought was a rather routine story that it seems I've heard many times before--or something very similar.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Any potential reader's first question about a how-to book should be, does the author know what he is talking about? In David Gaughran's case, it might be reasonable to wonder. He's published a few short stories and this book. While that might not seem like much in the way of experience, it also proves one of his contentions, that self-publishing is something that anyone is capable of doing.<br /><br />Gaughran had been writing for years, attempting to follow the traditional route to publication. While he'd had agents that were interested, he had not yet broken through. Then he heard some stories about authors who had found success through self-publishing and others, previously traditionally published, who decided to spurn traditional-publishing to go it on their own. He began researching self-publishing, and shortly after starting blogging about what he had found. His blog quickly became one of the go-to sites on the subject. Many of his popular blog posts were reworked for inclusion in \\"Let's Get Digital.\\"<br /><br />The book has three parts. The first and the last are of potential interest to any reader, even one who knows they'll never want to publish anything.<br /><br />Part I makes the case for self-publishing -the \\"why you should\\" portion of the subtitle. It gives an even-handed view of where the publishing industry is today, where it is going, and makes the case for self-publishing. While acknowledging that everyone has different goals in their writing, Gaughran makes a solid case with ample facts, figures, and research as support for his contentions.<br /><br />Part II covers the details of self-publishing. Along with appendices, this section tells you what you need to know to produce your book. Among other subjects, he explains those things many self-publishers skip, almost guaranteeing failure. Why the cover matters and the reasons you need an editor along with formatting and promotion are among the subjects covered.<br /><br />Part III are a series of short success stories from thirty-three different authors who are happy with their self-publishing experience and tell about their route to success. These serve as inspiration and, if you pay attention to what they say, validation of all the things Gaughran has said previously. I imagine this section could also serve as a great starting point for readers to find new authors that interest them.<br /><br />Lately several books on the subject of self-publishing have hit the virtual bookshelves. While many of them have good ideas, \\"Let's Get Digital\\" is the first I've seen, that I felt was both credible and comprehensive. I'd recommend it to any writer who is considering self-publishing or anyone interested in the current state of publishing.<br /><br />**Originally written for \\"Books and Pals\\" book blog.

It's a sweet little movie with a lot of heart and an intelligent script. Also, can't write a review without mentioning the chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Not just any actors could pull this off but they make it effortless. If you're interested in this movie, you probably know the plot, so 'I won't rehash it here, I'll just say SEE IT.

It started out great and I was very drawn in with the combination of pictures and story, but towards the middle, it started to fade. The story started to take a on a new track I didn't expect and not in a good way. The story became too fantastical and kind of annoying. Towards the end, I was just reading to get it over with. This is definitely a book to be put on a shelf and never touched again. Sad.

0393338827|4.0|When I picked up this book, I expected it to be more along the lines of following Paulson and his 4 billion dollars in profit - the biggest short of the era.  Instead, \\"The Big Short\\" follows the guys who slipped through the cracks in the media and ended up making young fortunes in comparison to the massive fortune made by Paulson.  The characters range from an Autistic doctor who started his own hedge fund to a few renegade employees at Deutsche Bank to the various players who gamed the S&P and Moody's agencies.  It also goes into detail on the fall of AIG and how the mortgage meltdown was started and almost averted by AIG.     The book is entertaining and informative as is typical of Lewis' writing style.  I would recommend that if you are not in high finance yourself, that you read \\"Liar's Poker\\" first.  \\"Liar's Poker\\" goes into great detail about how the mortgage bonds are created with the various \\"trenches.\\"  Although trenches are explained briefly in \\"The Big Short,\\" unless you are really paying attention during the few paragraphs where it is outlined, you might miss the importance of these critical terms.  \\"Liar's Poker,\\" on the other hand, goes into great detail on the definitions and creation of mortgage bonds.  \\"The Big Short\\" focuses more on the trading, insuring and, most importantly, the shorting of these bonds.    \\"The Big Short\\" is definitely worth the read for financial laymen.  I only gave it four stars instead of five because one really needs to read his previous book in order to understand the complex financial terms and structures laid out in \\"The Big Short.\\"

Interesting format, very well done, mixing science with humanity in appropriate and readable mixes....But...    How many times do you have to say virtually the same thing in a different way?  Book begins to feel repetitious about halfway through...But it is a good and worthwhile read.    There is some slight sense from midpoint on that Mrs. Skloot is imposing today's standards of medical privacy and research on a time when such expectations and laws did not exist.     That's a dangerous and judgemental thing to do...it's hinted at, but not overly done.
B001HN6922|3.0|Well, it can. And it did. Not that \\"Cars 2\\" is a terrible film. Visually it is superb with beautiful colors and textures. After all, it is Pixar. But ... where is the story?     The globe-trotting plot of \\"Car 2\\" is not something you find very interesting. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), who has just come back to Radiator Springs from racing, is back on the tracks again, traveling around the world with his pit crew including Mater, but his motive for entering The World Grand Prix, sponsored by one Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), doesn't convince. Why not just stay with Sally and have a good time?    The ineffective 007-like plotline involving two secret agent cars Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) plus Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who unwittingly gets involved with espionage and conspiracy, does not help. What is worse is, the spy action plot almost takes over the main one, with incessantly chatting Mater who gets annoying, and some toilet humor (literally) that is misguided.    Clearly the filmmakers including director team John Lasseter and Brad Lewis do not know the film's target audience. Some part of the \\"Cars 2\\" suggest it was made with younger viewers in mind (besides the toilet humor mentioned above, there are silly jokes and slapstick antics including Mater eating wasabi), while the film includes \\"deaths\\" of characters, which I think is quite unnecessary. Yes, it is not directly shown, but some cars get \\"killed\\" and even \\"tortured.\\"    \\"Cars 2\\" is great to look at, with its detailed background of the streets and towns, and perhaps we need to see them more than once to fully enjoy the beautifully animated images. What is missing is creativity and imagination that have made other Pixar works something special.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|There's a lot here to savor and enjoy. I liked seeing things pick up from AFFC, for example. The Cersei scenes remain my favorite part of this and AFFC, so sweet is the comeuppance. And I found myself remembering that Martin is a fine prose stylist, whose descriptions resonate and whose dialogue snaps.<br /><br />But we are in the doldrums, plotwise, as the various threads become too long to spin together. Tyrion seems to go everywhere and arrive nowhere. Daenerys's thread ends just as she finally does what we've been waiting for her to do for five books. Bran's story remains infinitely less interesting than Martin seems to think. And Jon Snow's thread is massively frustrating.<br /><br />But the biggest problem is the feeling that We Aren't Getting Anywhere. Hopefully Winds of Winter (publication date: August of 20??) will get this thing moving again.

Affleck is in denial and doesn't want to do anything to change their life, i.e. maintain the $600 a month eating out and dry cleaning bill.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones plays Affleck's former boss. He was \\"out of the loop\\" when Affleck got laid off. He feels bad about it, but like everyone else at the company they fear more for their own job than give sympathy. The movie smartly shifts back and forth juxtaposing Tommy Lee's life drinking unblended scotch, and Affleck trying to get a job while telling no one he is unemployed. He breaks all the rules in the book by not networking with friends.<br /><br />Affleck's former company is wanting to lay more people off in order to increase the stock price. They are worried about a takeover all the while they are building a new office building in downtown Boston. Affleck is not doing well with anger management at his job interviews as job offers require relocation and his salary reduced to that of my own...I almost feel bad for the guy who may have to sell his Porsche. Affleck is finding out a lot of people lost their job and those looking for jobs are more qualified than him. He is also too proud to ask his blue collar family for help. Tommy Lee is having an affair with a woman at work, Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello) who provides us with some gratuitous down sized brief nudity.<br /><br />Things go from bad to worse at the company as more people are displaced and Affleck's benefits run out.<br /><br />I really have no pity for Affleck. He has 12 weeks pay and he could have been working during that time for his BIL. His Massachusetts unemployment benefits (which is never mentioned) is more than what most of my neighbors make. He didn't downsize his life in a timely manner. Good acting, but there were no real New England accents in the whole group.<br /><br />The ending was unrealistic, but hey, it's a movie.<br /><br />F-bomb, brief nudity.The ending was unrealistic, but hey, it's a movie.     F-bomb, brief nudity.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|Kathryn Stockett's bestselling novel about a young white woman enlisting the aid of maids in her hometown of Jackson, Mississippi to write a tell-all book of about life as domestic servants in well-to-do white households has been turned into an appealing, safe movie. Stockett's book can be justly criticized for its use of dialect, its melodramatic excesses of plot and its untidy narrative structure; but in smoothing out the rough edges and turning it into a polished-looking film screenwriter and first-time director Taylor Tate has largely drained whatever truth the original had. At least Stockett included suggestions of the real horror blacks faced in the segregationist South: a maid's teenage son is badly beaten and blinded for accidentally using the wrong bathroom at a business establishment, and there is an extended and chilling description of what might befall a domestic and her family if she crosses her white employer. Little of this context remains in the filmed \\"Help,\\" save for a harrowing scene where the maid Aibileen (Viola Davis) and a male companion are ordered off a segregated bus and forced into the dangerous night (civil rights activist Medgar Evers has just been murdered in front of his family).<br /><br />Instead, the film's focus is on spunky Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone), who has graduated from college with a new awareness of her world's injustices and a yearning to be a writer. Her beloved housekeeper Constantine, who raised her, has recently left under mysterious circumstances. Skeeter presses her friend Elizabeth's maid Aibileen, and Aibileen's sharp-tongued best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer) into the aforementioned book-writing project, all the while keeping a wary eye on the unashamedly bigoted local Junior League president Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is pushing a \\"Home Sanitation Initiative\\" designed to guarantee that white employers and their domestics never, ever have to use the same toilet. Bathrooms and bodily functions in fact play pivotal roles in \\"The Help's\\" plot, which makes for easy laughs but also tends to keep real, wounding emotion at a manageable distance. The actors, led by Davis in a heartrending performance, do their best to put it back (it is especially good to see the great Cicely Tyson in a small but important role), and to its credit the film keeps the ambiguous conclusion of the novel. It's not enough to negate the overall impression that a wrenching era in recent American history has been tamed into palatable entertainment.pivotal roles in \\"The Help's\\" plot, which makes for easy laughs but also tends to keep real, wounding emotion at a manageable distance.

B004I9CXHW|5.0|Just to make those feel a little better since the Golf didn't show up on the list of vehicles it works for; charges phone and reads media (video files as well, just plays audio) from phone. I cannot figure out how to tell it which memory to read from (phone internal memory vs memory card) but I got it primarily to charge since my radar detector occupies the front plug and I had to snake a cable to reach the rear plug to charge my phone/devices prior.<br /><br />MUCH cheaper than buying it from the dealership. Packaging was in appropriate size (padded envelope) and arrived quickly. Would buy from this store again.

1589795474|3.0|The underlying concepts in this book are great.  Frugality is an absolute must if you want to have significant wealth one day.  That is the basics of this book.  It focused almost exclusively on spending habits of the wealthy.  I think it would have been a much better book if there would have been some insight into the different means of saving money.  I would have liked to get some insight in the performance and reliability of different types of savings mechanisms.  Perhaps some historic rates on savings bonds, money market accounts, IRAs, etc would have been more beneficial.  This book doesn't really seem to offer any advice or hard facts outside of simply 'quit spending so much money on tangible items and save.'  There was really nothing that suggests when to invest in what types of accounts or anything like that.<br /><br />If I was looking for a book to highlight some areas that I may be spending more than I should then this would be a 5 star book.  Since that is not what I was looking for, I am a little dissapointed in it.

B0052VUNHC|2.0|I am rarely completely let down when I read a book from Amazon that has the high ratings that this book has received.  The only reason I did not give this book one star is because I did finish it, not that I wanted to finish it.  I am big on happy endings and far-fetched plots but the actions displayed by all the characters in this book are very immature and so beyond realism that it is ridiculous!  Since when is it romantic to date a guy that is hot-tempered, violent and possessive.  Abby had to skip college classes, stay in a friend's dorm room and could not talk to certain people or date other students for fear of running into Travis and his violent tendencies.  My biggest concern is that young girls are going to read this book and truly believe that men who fight in fight clubs, sleep with hords of women and drink to cope with daily irritations are going to change and become monogamous, husband material for \\"the one\\" girl.

B0051MKNV8|3.0|The problem with making a movie about intelligence, is the lack of intelligence possessed by the people making the movie.    A modern day version of the fairy tale Jack & the Beanstalk, the hero is given some \\"beans\\" by some stranger which he \\"plants\\" unthinkingly. The beans take him to a castle in the sky where unbelievable riches are simply lying around for the taking. Hold on though--there's a giant that wants nothing more than to grind his bones to make his bread!    The parts that aren't inspired by the tale of Jack and his magic beans are the women in his life, and the anti-drug and moralistic themes that somehow lose their way as the film winds to a close. And these are what ruined the film.    Eddie's ex and current girl both try the brain-boosting drug. The ex shows the terrible effects of taking too much brain food, but at the end, conveniently limps out of his life while dispensing words of wisdom on dosage and how now, he has to keep taking the pill \\"or else you'll die!\\" His girlfriend tries the drug, pulls off some running/parkour that would impress Will Smith and Tom Cruise, but feels that, even after having, what I am assuming is superintelligent sex, that the drug is \\"bad.\\" Her reason? Because it's not really you doing these things. Lame.  Why do the women always have to be typecast as voices of reason? Ghosts of Christmas Past rattling chains, yet at the same time, not really giving any actual lessons.    The anti-drug message of the film, which is just that the pills have a downside: Take too much and you'll black out while fighting multiple dudes on a subway--and where all those seemingly wasted hours zoning out on action movies and youtube videos actually pays off, and you just might actually kill a supermodel. None of this hits home as the murder is never resolved, and you're taught that moderation is they key.    The biggest downer, however, is the fact that by the end of the film, the message becomes that the benefits of having full use of your brain, still does not preclude acting like a total tool. Unimaginative writing propagates the already prevalent belief that above-average intelligence is really all about making loads of money quickly and getting a lot of punani. Oh, and becoming a US senator who will screw with people on a global scale.

B004DK5CW4|2.0|Why this movie was made, in an age which has pretty much tossed track racing to the side, is a mystery, except to hopefully cash in on \\"Seabiscuit\\"s success. But that film was made quite a while back at this point, but also had a huge bestselling non-fiction book behind it, and the movie version was fit with a perfect cast. Unfortunately, cast-wise, I think john Malkovich is well past his good-by date, and Ms. Lane doesn't do much here, either.   Sadly, and importantly, this film doesn't capture at all the atmosphere of the early 1970s. TCM recently played \\"Junior Bonner\\", made in 1972; perhaps these filmmakers should have checked out that movie for some reference, as that Sam Peckinpah film perfectly captured the feel and texture of it's own time, at least of it's region (which is the exact same period of \\"Secretariat\\").   Also on the down side, this picture includes that typical post-\\"The Natural\\" brand of corny, poorly composed background music which is supposed to tug at the heart, but which is really just bombastic puffery. In addition, the few pop songs which are added for \\"period\\" flavor, seem to have been chosen for the ears of TODAY's audiences in mind (and what today's youth think we were all listening to), but are completely out of sync with what adults of the day would have commonly been entertained by (even though \\"I'll Take You There\\" indeed was a #1 Billboard hit in 1972; but again this was certainly not the kind of song middle agers would have paid any attention to, or almost anyone over 25 even have been aware of, as shown in the film...this of course smacks of just trying to market the soundtrack to a modern audience, or of youthful ignorance by the movie's producers).  A mediocre effort, of a story which had no real need to be told (and my family spent two weeks every summer at Saratoga back in the days of this story, so it's not that I'm uninterested in the topic).
B0055PMUSU|1.0|This is my first review ever but I needed say this so others are not fooled by the 4.5 rating.    Ok, it was inspirational but the movie had a lame dialogue and the acting was just as watered down. I enjoy \\"good\\" movies.  I don't need a 5 star blockbuster to be entertained.  In fact, I would rather have a good cast and dialogue any day.  This movie was a religious after school special at best!

B004EPYZU8|1.0|Probably the worst movie I've seen in a LONG time. What a waste of $1.<br /><br />The acting wasn't bad, but it seemed like they came up with some action scenes with CGI and then just put filler where a plot should be. I should have read the reviews first. Lesson learned!
B004MARLJ2|4.0|Fantastic little game but &quot;too many of us succumbed to black rage&quot;, really?! I think the fictional ideology is troubling overall, defeating the enemies purges their &apos;corruption&apos; and makes them think like you, but that the corruption is called &apos;black rage&apos; is sloppy at best. Other than that, a high quality game that could have hit five stars easily.
0765365278|5.0|First and foremost - I have not read a book by Brandon Sanderson that was not completely and totally enjoyable!<br /><br />I started with the Mistborn Series ('The Final Empire', 'The Well of Ascension', and 'The Hero of Ages') then to 'Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians'(which is certainly more a children's book.. and series than the others), Elantris, and Warbreaker. Everyone is wonderful - lush rich worlds, perfectly created communities that are vibrant and alive as I read them.<br /><br />'The Way of Kings' follows suit - and contains characters that will likely be favorites of mine for a long time. Something that Sanderson has been able to do in every book, is create new and exciting characters that as I read, I always am wanting to know more about - while feeling that I have known them forever. Such detailed and rich prose - I am SO glad that I was introduced to his wonderful writing.<br /><br />I have one non complaint complaint - and I feel that it must be titled as such because I do not care that he does this. Every book has the same basic structures. A good way to visualize it would be a bride. He has much of the same supporting structure in the creation of his writing.. his 'worlds', nations, characters - but the rest of the bridge can be so different and elaborate that you do not really notice it unless you take the special approach to notice. My need to let it be known that I am perfectly good with this 'problem' is just that ... for example I thoroughly enjoy playing Zelda games - even though they ALL have this same basic structure idea - or Final Fantasy. As long as the new story is fresh and good - I will love it!<br /><br />The character growth and just the basic ideas that are dealt with in this book are wonderful - If you are thinking about getting it - go get it! You will enjoy it. If you worried that this is the first book in a series and you would rather wait until later novels are out - don't wait! Get it as soon as possible - this book DOES NOT LEAVE you high and dry at the end. Granted - at my completion of it I wanted more, but I was completely satisfied with the plot lines and the possible future plot lines that can come from the book's conclusion.<br /><br />Some things I found noteworthy (There were more, but these I 'noted' as I read with my kindle app)<br /><br />Quoting the character Hoid after he told the group a story, and asked what it meant.<br /><br />\\"'The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon. Too often, we forget that.'\\"<br /><br />I think that this is a GREAT way to see a story - as well when I ask questions of others I usually NEVER tell them what I mean by my question - no matter how cryptic it may seem. I want to know YOU and what YOU get from it - NOT what I TOLD you to tell ME. Great line in a book!<br /><br />Kaladin's changes through the story were great - that character was just so wonderful - and I was so glad to see where he came from, and where he is going in the story!<br /><br />A small note on that in a quote from the book - something that Kaladin's father said to him.<br /><br />\\"'Somebody has to start,son. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is right. If nobody starts, then others cannot follow.'\\"<br /><br />Such a GREAT piece of advice - looked at the world through the eyes of hate and malice, and deciding to return the favor - only add to what you saw and did not like - let us be encouraged and move to be world changers... by doing what is right, BECAUSE it is right!<br /><br />A GREAT BEAUTIFUL BOOK - Thank You Brandon Sanderson for it!e end.

0553801473|2.0|Winter came. Everyone died. Nobody came back from the dead. {Insert 750 page list of all the characters who died, what was painted on their shields, what they wore, and what they ate for their last meal.} Every one of them. Dead. Dead. Dead.<br /><br />I could like a good deal more of this book if there were less of it, but I could never like it as well as the epic of the Stark family and the Lannister family that began this series. So many of both families are dead now that Martin must invent a whole new cast of people to populate the story. By now we know not to trust him with our affections, and so we refuse to identify with any of these people and sit back much farther from the text. There is a reason most people don't kill the heroes of their novels. I thought the Red Wedding enthralling and right but the saga should have been closer to an ending after it happened.<br /><br />I turned on the HBO series, the scene where Arya is talking to Ned about chasing cats. I remembered then why I liked the first three books so very much. That family, the Stark family, is something very special in fantasy, insufferable as they often were. The Lannisters are the same. Once the Lannisters have killed and scattered the Starks, the rest of the drama seems much less compelling.
0439023521|4.0|This is an very good science fiction story about a 16 year old - Katniss Everdeen - who is selected to fight in a horrible spectacle of combat where two children from twelve districts must fight to the death.  The premise is intriguing and the author has plenty of built-in plot devices to keep the action and surprises coming at you at very steady pace.  Because it is apparently written for a young adult audience it is a very easy read.  I have to admit that I stayed up very late to finish it (although I'm not really sure if that was because I had to know how it turned out or the Diet Coke I stupidly had with dinner).  I give the book an 8 out of 10.

0307276902|2.0|I thought that knowing this was mostly fictional wouldn't bother me, since this novel did have a great deal of popularity before the scandal.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Most of this book seemed like one long ego-trip to me. The main character is portrayed as a hero, while those who are trying to help him (the people who work at the treatment center, mostly) are portrayed as rigid rule-followers who only care about their program and not the people they are trying to treat. James, however, doesn't need their rules and does just fine without them. He seems to know better than these people even though he's been an addict since about ten years old and hasn't been able to help himself before. A lot of stuff seemed exaggerated, and I kept thinking, \\"Well, that's probably not real\\" throughout the entire thing because of the controversy.<br /><br />However, A Million Little Pieces isn't completely terrible. Many don't like the writing style, but I really liked it and thought it fitting for the subject matter. The format is sloppy and random words are capitalized. I thought this was good, because as a recovering addict and as someone who has proclaimed that he's \\"f*d up\\" most of the time, the format shouldn't be neat and pretty. The words that are capitalized are the ones that are important and the ones that the narrator is focusing on. I think a decent analysis could be done just with the writing rather than the story itself.<br /><br />Overall though, I didn't like this novel. The main character irritated me with all his bravado, self-righteousness, and hypocrisy. Had these aspects been toned down, I might have enjoyed the read.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|There is no one genre for Ms. Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children. It is fantasy, mystery, suspense, adventure, &#34;issues&#34;, and even a touch of horror. We have an insecure teenager dealing with death and a dead grandfather with a mysterious past and an island full of fantastical children and a quest to save everyone. All in one. The book somehow manages to balance it all out into a novel to suit everyone's needs, and the black and white photos are a nice touch. Almost every reader will enjoy this book; it is a great blend of everything everyone wants to read about all in one.
B000002KB8|5.0|It's 1970 and folks like Bangs and Christgau would have you believe that the band formerly known as Earth is yet another in the long line of generic heavy blues rockers.  Sabbath were derided as \\"a worse version of Cream\\", their darker tendencies were looked upon as schlocky and part of an image.<br /><br />Perhaps this POV was symptomatic of living in image-obsessed Hollywood or NYC for too long.  Let's not forget that 1970 saw the world at war and that Birmingham, England was only recently terrorized by an even bigger war. If this environment should invoke images of \\"incense and peppermints\\" or make you want to write cutely whispered Simon & Garfunkle songs, then I guess Iommi and the boys just weren't pretentious enough.<br /><br />Satan was alive and well in 1960, and at the time Black Sabbath weren't getting paid enough to ignore him.  Maybe Cream got a little dreary on tracks like \\"Spoonful\\", but Sabbath immersed themselves in a murkiness that never has been rivaled.  It wasn't about a schtick, it was about reflecting reality without the prosaic optimism of Lennon/McCartney

B004DLPXAO|1.0|Giving you 1 star and nook 5. Wanna know why? Because I was reading an actual book when I got the phone. I decided to switch partway through the book to an ereader. So I got the book, and tried to go to page 324. Turns out all that kindle could do was split the book up by the &quot;virtual pages&quot; in other words, the shortened pages that show up on my phone are each counted individually instead of with the published pages. This gave a book with 800 ish pages over 15000 &quot;pages&quot;. Switched to nook, typed in 324, found my page. Wow. Good job guys.
B003B02OQ4|2.0|Like other reviewers, I was very disappointed with this very predictable \\"formula\\" book from John Grisham, who has certainly lost his edge, teaming up with unknown writers. The book dragged on and on and I found myself unabsorbed and uncaring about the outcome, which I could have predicted from page one. I managed to plow my way through the book, not really caring about the characters or the plot. The first fifty pages were the only ones worth reading and the book finished the way you knew it would all along. I think that this is the last Grisham book I will waste my time reading. Very disappointing!

0679720200|4.0|Meursault is a sociopath with narcissistic traits who is incapable of having feelings for anyone. I read a previous post which stated that Camus wrote this book during Hitlers occupation of France, is it possible that Camus was writing a basic version about Hitler's mental state and how he was negatively impacting Europe and the rest of the World just like Meursault negative impacted Marie, his mom and the rest of the characters in the book? After all Hitler was a sociopath with narcissistic traits.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Seems like I waiting for so long for this book, but it just doesn't have enough substantive story movement.  Other reviewers have invoked Robert Jordan's name and I have to agree.  I hope the next books can make some positive movement to this series.  It seems like George R. R. Martin has gone Hollywood and forgotten his audience in the written story.

The pair of butterflies that hang from one of the corners are attached to the gym using Velcro. My 6 month old daughter pulled these off and started sucking on them. Within a few seconds she shoved these in her mouth and almost choked on them. We were lucky that I was reading a book by her side and was able to pull these out of her mouth before anything terrible had happened. Her eyes were all watery and red when I found her. I will be contacting Fisher Price today and hopefully they will recall the product or notify the consumers of this issue. She likes playing on the gym so we have put away the butterflies. The other toys are larger and are not a chocking hazard.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Just a short review...i read this book in 1 day! Although such a horrible experiance and sad at that i felt i had to read on. I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle the graphic nature of it. I dont' want to say it was a great read due to the subject but it was an interesting heart wrenching read i guess i should say.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I've done level 1 twice.  Both times I've done the workout, I found it is focused on the back and obliques.  I say this because that was the only parts of my body that I felt the burn the next day.  I have a pouchy stomach and have found not many ab dvd's focus on the lower abs.  I know when my middle and lower abs get a workout by the burn the next day.  This did not have that feeling at all.  While the workout is fast, sweaty, and will hurt the next day, it won't work your middle or lower abs.  I will go back to Denise Austin for an ab workout.
B005AUWY2W|1.0|My two young boys (ages 5 and 6) have been Cars fans for years.  Needless to say, we had the opening night of Cars 2 on the calendar for months.  We went opening weekend, and to say we were disappointed is the understatement of the year.  The \\"Mator as a spy\\" premise, if done correctly, could have been great.  But there was no substance, solid moral ending, or true story development -- what the movie did provide were multiple violent and disturbing scenes that scared both of my (normally brave) children.  The whole thing was a heaping mess.  Both of my children made comments about the level of violence, and complicated story.  They may just be 5 and 6, but they know a bad movie when they see it.  So disappointing, because they were both such fans of Lightening and Mator before.    I don't know if Pixar has \\"lost their way\\" as some other reviewers have stated.  But after watching this disaster, I think it's a real possibility.  Our world is filled with enough real-life garbage (torture, bombs, and evil, greedy oil tycoons are frequently tv news topics).  Must we subject our young children to this junk at the movie theatre?
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|Added a 24\\" monitor to my MacBook so I needed an adapter (I still don't understand why Macs don't just have a DVI port). Anyways, it works great and I got it on time!
1400064287|5.0|Amazing book. So much useful information. I'm not related, neither have any financial interest in this editorial work and not, I'm not the cousing or agent of the Heath brothers. I read a review of the book in the Los Angeles Times some time ago and had the good idea of writing the name down for later review. Now that I'm getting into half of its content, I really think this book is a must for anybody who has some interest in growing their business or become a better generator of ideas in the marketing and advertising industry. Easy to read, clever, intelligent, no doubt this item is one of my best books in my library.
B004FEL6GO|4.0|I don't speak for everyone, but to me this Bumblebee is okay. The vehicle mode is very good looking, but they could have added more paint apps for robot mode. It may not be the best Bumblebee Transformer, but it's still good looking in some ways and has great play value in many ways that i'm sure little kids would like alot.
0142419400|5.0|From page one, I was drawn into this story. Anna is the average teen that everyone can relate to, who is crushing on a guy and hating to be separated from him. But indeed she must, because he parents are sending her to Paris for a year. Oh the horror!<br /><br />All the characters are so well written that they come alive on the pages. I really enjoyed Anna's Paris friends, especially Rashmi. She wasn't a large character, but she was fundamental. It felt like I was along on the journey with Anna and her friends. I enjoyed it so much that I want to go back to high school just to be shipped off to boarding school.<br /><br />Etienne is the greatest guy. He struggled a lot with his feelings for Anna and staying true to his girlfriend. That made him all the more endearing that he didn't drop his girlfriend at the first sight of Anna.<br /><br />I had heard so many great things about this novel that I had to give it a try, and I'm so glad that I did. It was a truly amazing read. I so look forward to reading much, much more from Stephanie. This is the kind of fun-loving young adult novels that I enjoy.

B000HF2WWC|5.0|The Complete Sherlock Holmes, Volume 1<br /><br />Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is forever remembered for his fictional creations \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" and \\"John H. Watson M.D.\\" Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories which have been popular around the world. They said \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" was inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell the famous professor at Edinburgh Medical College in the late 19th century (one of the best schools). Bell was famous for drawing inferences from a person's appearance and dress. The use of Dr. Watson provided a dialogue to carry the story and explain events as they happen, or later. These stories were written in the Victorian Era that marked the beginning of modern life. Most sports were created in that era (baseball, soccer, basketball, etc.). Railroads were built and automobiles were invented. The airplane and radio followed. Most people left rural villages to live in cities. The copyright to these stories expired around 1971, many authors have used Doyle's characters in their own literary works. None were as good as the originals.<br /><br />\\"A Study in Scarlet\\" introduced Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson to the world. The use of science to solve unexplained mysteries is still popular entertainment. When the body of a man was found in an empty house Gregson of Scotland Yard asked Holmes for help. Another murder to be solved?<br />\\"The Sign of Four\\" begins when Miss Mary Morstan visits to tell about receiving a valuable pearl every year. This year she received a letter asking to meet her, and she wants companions. Another valuable pearl or the answer to her father's disappearance ten years earlier?<br /><br />\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" has twelve short stories. \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" refers to the romance of a royal prince. \\"The Red-headed League\\" refers to a clever criminal plot to select one individual from a group. The others are \\"A Case of Identity\\"; \\"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\\"; \\"The Five Orange Pips\\"; \\"The Man with the Twisted Lip\\"; the Adventures of the \\"Blue Carbuncle\\", \\"Speckled Band\\", \\"Engineer's Thumb\\", \\"Noble Bachelor\\", \\"Beryl Coronet\\", and \\"Copper Beeches\\".<br /><br />\\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\" has eleven short stories. Many may have read these in high school English courses. Sometimes they are misquoted in popular speech. \\"The curious incident of the dog in the night.\\" \\"The dog did nothing in the night.\\" \\"That was the curious incident.\\" [The absence of an expected event.] The stories are \\"Silver Blaze\\" (about fixing a horse race); \\"The Yellow Face\\"; \\"The Stock-Broker's Clerk\\"; \\"The Gloria Scott\\"; \\"The Musgrave Ritual\\"; \\"The Reigate Puzzle\\"; \\"The Crooked Man\\"; \\"The Resident Patient\\"; \\"The Greek Interpreter\\"; \\"The Naval Treaty\\"; and \\"The Final Problem\\". Note that some deal with personal conflicts.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Easy to read with a fun main character, 'Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes' will take you along on Rose Gardner's journey from mild mannered to independent over the course of just a few days. While there are a couple of plot points in the story that I felt didn't blend very well with the rest, they felt just too separate and like they didn't matter much to the ultimate outcome, this is a well written, engaging and wonderful novel and I cannot wait for another installment
B004Y1USV2|4.0|I have been a yes guy 30+ years. I was not going to get this one since Jon was not around. I am glad I made the purchase because I would have missed out on the best CD since GFTO. The title track is worth the price of the CD. It is 20+ minutes of classic Yes sound but recorded digitally.
B003Y5H5A6|5.0|Man the superhero movies created by marvel are outstanding. First it was The Incredible Hulk which was good, then came Iron man and Iron man 2 which were really good. Then they decided to create a Thor movie which was great and then they decided to create Captain America which was awesome and the best one so far. I cant wait until the Avengers comes out in May next year!!!!!
1442419814|5.0|We work with kiddos who don't fit into a box and highly recommend this book.  The Uglies starts off slowly but as you read it you will find a lot of symbolism throughout that mirrors the fundamental theme of individuality versus conformity.  The content and themes provoke great discussions on the different types of conformity and why individuality is important.  It is the first of a series.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|OH MY GOD!!!! This was by far my favorite movie of the summer, and ive seen at least 10 movies this summer. The apes looked amazing!! I couldnt tell if they were real or computer animated. I would love to meet the director of this movie bc he did such a great job with everything, the story, plot, setting, everything. Normally i can point out a flaw in every movie i see, but this movie stumped me. I could not take my eyes off the screen ever until the movie was over. GREAT JOB DIRECTOR!!!!
007174889X|5.0|This book is awesome! I received mine from amazon and it was great!:D I love the videos (they demo it using real patients!), the images (Tons of it!) and the paper (goodbye highlighter fleck!) itself! =D it was worth the price and worth the wait,, this is really a must for every med student and practitioners alike! If you are aiming to become a great physician one day, by all means, get your copy! =D
6304708521|2.0|On one hand, I'm keeping it as nostalgia; on the other hand, it's barely a notch above crap.<br />The transfer is sad and tired, at times so overexposed there's barely a decipherable image.  From all accounts, Paul McCartney is credited (blamed) for the idea behind this misfire.  It was first shown in black and white in England on the day after Christmas.  (If this was meant as a Christmas present, I'd rather have coal.)<br />For that time period, it wasn't particularly daring, it certainly wasn't avant-garde or psychedelic.  Instead, it runs the gambit from a silly home movie to an amateur production done by a class of grade school students.  The graphics are slapdash, the `story' aimless, noisy, and confused.  Paul poses constantly, John showed up late, George appeared self-conscious, but at least Ringo looked like he was having a good time.  There's an odd sing-a-long on a bus, a stopover at a strip club, a creepy nightmare sequence in a restaurant, and a weird production number for the finale.  The only segment that was halfway decent was I Am The Walrus.  With only a handful of songs represented, it's almost not worth the effort, especially considering they shot almost 10 hours of film to end up with this embarrassing mess.<br />Still, it is The Beatles; reason enough to put in my collection for future viewing (when I'm 64).
B004LWZW24|3.0|I personally like to believe that the expanses of human creativity and ideas are without bound or limit. I feel that this can be seen in many areas of our lives save that of movies (horror in particular, if you need an example take a pick of any of the numerous horror movie remakes that have come out over the past ten years). I wouldn't want anyone to think that by starting with this statement that im giving a bad review, cause im not.     This movie had some REAL and GENUINE SCARES that im telling you made my blood run cold for a few seconds, which kind of makes it worth watching. However, if you consider yourself to be a true horror movie buff (not sure exactly sure what a buff is but nonetheless) you're going to be very disappointed with this movie. Not sure how many of you have seen Poltergeist from the 80's. But all this is, is a remake giving us a bit of insight as to what Carol Ann probably saw on the other side when she was sucked into the T.V. (sorry for the spoiler).    The producers of this movie rely on the belief that today's younger horror viewers probably haven't seen an age old movie like Poltergeist (which by today's horror standards is pretty mild); thus it will probably seem like a fresh idea and concept to them, a cheap Knock off to those of us, who have seen it.    I mean  there were a couple of times while watching Insidious I actually said \\"OH COME ON THIS IS THE EXACT SAME THING AS WHAT THEY DID IN POLTERGIEST\\".    Still for those people who haven't seen Poltergeist, id say check it out. The scares are quality and the ending leaves you wanting more.    P.S. It is kinda slow in the beginning, just give it some time.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Saw this movie yesterday and found it excellent. I did read the \\"bad\\" reviews just to see what the beef was....Certainly alot of blame to go around (republicans, democrats, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae....); bottom, bottom line... plenty of very astute individuals DID try to \\"wave the flag\\" well before the collapse occurred. The people who COULD have stopped it, did not. Many of the individuals who rated this movie 1-star, state there is more to the collapse than just greed. I disagree, it was ALL about greed and continues to be about greed.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|Don't be fooled by the opening narration. '(500) Days of Summer' is very much a love story. Just not the kind we're used to seeing.<br /><br />Come to think of it, the title's also a little misleading. This is really the story of Tom Hanson, and the 500 days he spends being in love with Summer. But while we get to know Tom very well, thanks in large part to a charming and nuanced portrayal by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, by the end of the movie Summer remains something of an enigma, right down to Zooey Deschanel's last sly smile.<br /><br />Since this movie is really about Tom and his experiences with (and without) Summer, that works just fine. Besides, '(500) Days of Tom' just doesn't sound as cool.<br /><br />'(500) Days of Summer' gets a lot of credit, though, for making a real attempt at being honest, both with its audience and its characters. Tom and Summer are not cardboard cutouts fit into a standard romance storyline. They challenge the gender stereotypes we often see in movies, and they feel like real people, with their faults and their hangups and their silliness.<br /><br />Only occasionally does the movie dip into the deep well of the trite situation (i.e. an overplayed scene in a record shop or the drunk buddy who says too much), but these are mostly forgivable in a movie with sudden, unexpected bursts of pure inspired fun, like a scene in which Tom feels on top of the world (guess why) and everything around him is made for his delight. If you haven't seen this already, I won't ruin it by trying to summarize it, but it makes the whole movie worth seeing. In fact, just go watch it now.<br /><br />Ok, you're back? Good. Told you it was awesome.<br /><br />'(500) Days of Summer' unfolds as a series of memories played out of sequence. Don't worry about getting lost, though, as each new memory is labeled so you know at least roughly where it falls, and the movie quickly finds its rhythm so the numbers are almost unnecessary. I love this aspect of the movie, as it feels like someone who is reliving the highs and lows of the relationship as they relate to how he felt about it, at the time and now. There's a subtlety about how the subjectivity of memory is conveyed here that I admire.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sharply honest, delightfully quirky, and mostly original movie about love. It reminds me mostly of one of my favorites: 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' which is even more striking and original in its approach. Both movies, though, share the perspective that love and romance are often messy and complicated, and working through the push and pull of attraction and independence is rarely as simple as we're often led to believe.<br /><br />'(500) Days of Summer' may try to mislead you with its title and its opening lines. It may try to make you think it's not for romantics. But don't be fooled. By being honest, making me laugh unexpectedly, and especially for appreciating the differences that make us unique, it earned its way into my heart.

B004EPYZSK|3.0|Having seen the trailers I was expecting more than I received when I watched it.  With the stars and budget it should have been a better film  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had watched it for free.    Its not without its entertaining moments, there is just not enough of them.    Harrison Ford looks bored every time he is on screen.    My advice is to wait for it to appear on your TV screens and watch it for free.
B0001NBMEE|5.0|TO REALLY APPRECIATE THIS FILM YOU NEED TO HAVE LOVED HAL FOSTER'S STRIP, YOU NEED TO HAVE EXPERIENCED STANDING IN LINE FOR THE SATURDAY AFTERNOON MATINEE AT THE LOCAL THEATER, YOU HAVE TO LOVE THE ACTORS, AND LOVE THE SCENERY AND SETS DEPICTING OLD ENGLAND.  BECAUSE ALL THE ABOVE IS TRUE OF ME, I WAS ABLE TO LOOK PAST SOME OCCASIONAL CORNY LINES CRANKED OUT BY THE SCRIPT WRITERS.  MOVIES OUGHT TO BE ENTERTAINING, AND THIS ONE WAS.
B005AUWY90|2.0|We saw this movie at the theatre and my 4 year old got bored  mid way through.  When all was said and done, we felt it had a real adult theme and when I asked him to tell Grandma about Cars 2, he said, \\"the bad guys were trying to \\"kill\\" Lighting McQueen\\", that definitely isn't the message we want to bringing home on a DVD.  Skip it unless your kids are older and even then I think the older kids will get bored with the theme.
B001G8NW6Y|5.0|Especially during these times of huge government deficits, job-creation talks, balanced budget amendment proposals and debt ceiling debates, the need to listen discerningly to the terms that are constantly throw around by economic pundits, how they are defined and re-defined helps tremendously.<br /><br />In Henry Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson the author brilliantly lays out the fallacies (errors in logical thinking) involved in the public discussion and application of economics.  He address topics such as:<br /><br />  Short term vs. long term view of economic principle and policies<br />  Do public works truly stimulate the economy?<br />  How much taxation is too much?<br />  Does all automation destroy jobs in the long term?<br />  Does full employment always mean full production?<br />  Who's \\"protected\\" by tariffs?<br />  Saving the X Industry (Bailout anyone?)<br />  How does government price fixing work?<br />  Minimum wage laws and what they really do<br />  Do unions really raise wages?<br />  What is the function of profits?  What truly causes Inflation?  What does it truly mean to save and create wealth?<br /><br />Do any of these topics sound interesting or applicable to what you're hearing in today's political talk in the media?  Get this.  Hazlitt wrote this in 1946!  The principles he lays out and the fallacies he exposes could have been written about current events today!  This, to me, gives weight to his school of thought.  If his economic worldview could be applied to virtually every day and age, it bolsters its credibility.  Instead of fly-by-night knee jerk reactionary policies, Haziltt, a member of the Austrian school of economics, gives common sense explanations to what most of the political world would prefer to keep as complicated as possible.  I highly recommend this book, especially if you've never jumped into the topic of economics before.  Or, if you're like me, don't remember squat from high school.

0061726826|5.0|I'm a sucker for Dystopian stories, I can never get enough of them. Ever since Brave New World, and 1984 (#1 on my list). And who could forget The Handmaid's Tale? Delirium reminds me of The Uglies Trilogy by Scott Westerfeld but I could read dozens of these stories with the same formula and be happy as a clam, which I am able to do thanks to the explosion of these types of stories in the YA field. Lauren Oliver is a good writer and brings some interesting ideas to the storyline. The ending is a powerful recommendation for amor deliria nervosa, otherwise known as love. I have to admit I cried a little. (I told you I was a sucker and hopefully that makes it up to Ms. Oliver for saying her story reminded me of The Uglies Trilogy.)    I also love that it's a long book, so that it didn't end too soon and I liked that the story ended at the end of the book yet left it open for a trilogy which I just happily found out is going to happen!

B001SAQVSQ|5.0|I bought this book at the same time as another one of Eric Carle's books - The Very Lonely Firefly, and while I could see the appeal of the latter, I really was not sure why this book would be appealing to my 18-month old. A few weeks down the line, I realized Mr Carle obviously understands children far better than I do.     My son absolutely adores the book, and I have to admit, I quite like it too. The structure is simple, repetitive yet diverse, engaging, and educational. At the beginning, we used to simply read the book cover-to-cover, but then we started using it in another interesting ways - like identifying the animals in the book, or, pointing to and creating the sounds of the animals. Altering the reading approaches has ensured that 3 months down the line, my son's interest, while waning, is still strong enough for him to go through the book attentively (which can be a very helpful to distract him in troubled times!) One particularly nice touch in the book was the spider web, which is embossed onto the pages, and thus creates an added \\"touch\\" sensory experience.     Whole-heartedly recommend the book.
1423113497|5.0|I saw the movie and thought, meh, it was ok, nothing spectacular. So for awhile I didnt have any interest in reading the book. Finally I decided to give it a try because I love mythology and had hopes the book was better than the movie (*cough* Eragon). I'm very very glad I did because this book was great!! It's full of adventure and lore and I really did end up enjoying it. I will definitely be reading more in this series as I have to know how it all turns out now!
B003I7BBZ0|1.0|We got this set for my three-year-old and knew it was trouble from the moment we opened it.     He was away and we wanted to set it up so that he could see it all put together when he came home.  But every time I put one piece together, another fell off.     On the mushroom house itself, there are too few attachment points and those that exist do not attach securely. It's really quite confusing, because instead of a regular grid of pegs like Lego, there is a seemingly haphazard assortment of geometric features on the top of the mushroom house and bottom of the mushroom cap that mate at only a certain angle. Plus, it is -- for who knows what reason -- necessary to put some tiny little intermediary pegs between the house and top. Some of the other pieces are more similarly made to Mega Bloks' far-superior competitor, but the pegs are too short and the plastic is too flimsy to hold together properly.    My son tried to play with it to almost comical results; he would attempt to open the door and the roof would fall off. By the time we had it two days, we had put it together no fewer than 50 times. We finally glued most of the pieces together to make a somewhat enjoyable experience of playing with the thing.     We will most certainly never buy a Mega Bloks product again.    The figures are pretty adorable, though.

It ruins the original movie we all loved. When I first put it in, I thought I had hit something on the main menu to get this new version. I went back to the menu, searched and found out that the original movie is not on here! I now have to reorder it and get my favorite movie.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|I switched from a simple Polar watch/monitor after buying successive replacement transmitters (the batteries were not user accessible).  The Garmin is a significant disappointment.  After only a few light running sessions, the watch band separated at one end and could not be easily attached. I'm waiting for a service RMA from Garmin. I had liked the rechargeable nature of the watch, but I have found that the battery power runs down quickly even when the watch is dormant, requiring me to keep the watch plugged in overnight, between exercise sessions.  Lastly, the bezel feature is far too sensitive and inconsistent.
B0056UHSYK|3.0|I was just dying for this CD to be released someday but then when I finally got it, I heard the first song, after a few seconds I was like; is this really David Cook? None of the songs are catchy and they all sound the same. I AM a DC fan but this album really wasnt worth the wait. Honestly I thought the album was kinda boring. I was listening to it at work one night and I nearly fell asleep. I would hate to see such a musical idol fall apart during their 2nd release. Come on David, alot of bands are letting me down today. Dont be one of them!

I called Samsung, who said this is a *known* issue with this movie and their machines, and that they're working on compatible firmware.<br /><br />So if it won't play, whether you get it from Amazon or not, it's the player, not the disk.<br /><br />The rating I gave is bogus, since I haven't seen it yet, but Amazon insisted on one.
B002JVWR0Y|3.0|I bought these two seasons, 3 and 4, new, as well as seasons 1 and 2. The blue ray is good, relatively speaking, but several of the dvds have flaws on them which make them freeze, and attempting to clean them does not help. As a result, I have to forward to the next portion, and miss some of the content. As much as these blue ray discs cost, Amazon should have better quality control. Trying to send them back for exchange is too much of a hassle.
B0049HWTL8|4.0|This is the first Dan Brown novel I've read. I have seen the movie for the Da Vinci Code which I loved. I read the digital special illustrated version on my iPad.  You should definitely read the illustrated version which has lots of great pictures of the architecture of D.C. , of paintings, and the actual puzzles which Prof. Langdon had to solve.  I don't think he is a great writer especially when it comes to some of the dialogue and character creation and development. I assume the target audience is everyone and their grandmother though so it's acceptable.  His style is excellent in other ways because he captures the essence of wonder.  Like a kid going to a museum for the first time on a school field trip, you are filled with wonder and excitement at the ideas and possibilities Brown brings forth.    I spent some time reading the negative reviews and frankly, I think some of those reviewers are being way over-analytical.  Picking out all kinds of little details about why did the character do this or say that.  While there may be some validity to these points, this alone is not enough to take away the magic Brown makes with his ideas and connections between esoterica, architecture, art, religion, secret societies, symbols, puzzles, philosophy and so on.    When a book can make you interested in subjects and want to learn more it is a good one..period.  It's a brilliant story and I would now perhaps like to visit D.C. and see these places with my own eyes.  Perhaps It will encourage a reader to learn more about Sir Isaac Newton, god, the earliest religions, about the Freemasons, the founding fathers, the Rosicrusians, the pyramids, or countless other things that this book makes you think about.
B0029XZODY|3.0|I bought these two seasons, 3 and 4, new, as well as seasons 1 and 2. The blue ray is good, relatively speaking, but several of the dvds have flaws on them which make them freeze, and attempting to clean them does not help. As a result, I have to forward to the next portion, and miss some of the content. As much as these blue ray discs cost, Amazon should have better quality control. Trying to send them back for exchange is too much of a hassle.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I just came back from the theatre after seeing this incredibly emotional,   humorous, and multi-leveled film performance.   This whole film; from the acting, to the direction,  the writing, EVERYTHING!!---Top of the line all the way!   If this movie doesn't win some Oscars, then I'll know that whole awards thing is BS, pure and simple.  The 9 other reviewers (so far) have all pretty much covered all the bases from every perspective of what  can be said about this film.  All I have to say is that \\"THE HELP\\", will go down as a modern day classic.  \\"The Color Purple\\", \\"The Secret Life Of Bees\\", \\"Divine Secrets Of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\", \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\"...  This film is definitely in that echelon of films for sure.  Kudos to Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain...

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I originally rented this film in the library. Its very long and thats a good thing since its a great film with a surprise element to it. If you enjoy the past, romance,the old ways which were very polite , and you want to be taken back to another time and place , watch this film . Its also very unique, you will see what I mean. I bought it because its a great film and it transports you to another time and place which we all need every now and then . You will not get bored I promise.
1451629184|5.0|Great book, reading it it felt like I was in the room with Jaycee as she was telling me the story. I liked the way it is written. Wasn't expecting graphic description of her terrible sexual abuse, but then again, she said she is telling the story how it happened and that is what happened to her. Besides those difficult to read parts, I found this book very uplifting and motivating. She is a true survivor and I hope for her that her life will be full of happiness now on
0439023521|4.0|I'd give this book 3 stars, at most, for originality of the basic concept (see the title). But then the author does a pretty good job filling in the details. So 4 stars it is.    One thing I can't understand for the life of me, is why everyone keeps referring to this as \\"young adult\\" literature. Think of it this way: any reasonably faithful cinematization of this book would necessarily carry a rating of NC-17, \\"...strong graphic violence with loads of blood and gore ... depraved, abhorrent behavior ... or any other elements which, at present, most parents would consider too strong and therefore off-limits for viewing by their children and teenagers.\\" And NC-17 is the polar opposite of \\"young adult\\". (Hollywood is currently in process of such cinematization, and they are going for PG-13, so I'm curious to see how they are going to make that happen.) The only thing that could possibly explain \\"young adult\\"'ness is the absence of sex in the book.

0307279189|1.0|I don't know if it's fair to review a book that I haven't finished, but it's taken me about 3 months to slog thru to the half way point and I really don't have much motivation to finish it (fortunately I bought it as an inexpensive paperback at Costco). It is so hyperbole laden (bright eyed bushy tailed enthusiasm) about the Tarahumara running exploits (all of which as a long time ultrarunner I've heard before in far less excruciating detail) that I keep wondering when I'll get to the life changing (well, running changing) inspirational info that everyone seems to be talking about.

B001C4AFOY|3.0|I will be the first to acknowledge that period films should not be held to an overly strict standard of accuracy, but when entire historical themes are misrepresented, it's grating. First, this film portrays Prince Albert as some enlightened semi-feminist, who encourages Victoria to choose a husband who will \\"rule with you.\\" It is a well established fact that Albert Coburg was a blatant misogynist who had a shockingly low opinion of women in general. Even his contemporary Englishmen were often thrown by how he shunned female company. A case in point: existing letters show the when Victoria continued to show favor to Lord Melbourne after he lost his Prime Minister seat, Albert excoriated her for being foolish and selfish. Years later, he showed the exact same kind of overt favoritism for Robert Peel, and there was not a hint of reproach from Victoria or himself. I think this movie paints an unbelievably inaccurate portrait of Prince Albert.<br /><br />  This film also portrays Victoria as a harpy, determined to keep her husband as some kind of pet, and only through her own kindness does she agree to give Albert some station. In historical fact, Victoria was emotionally brow beaten at virtually every turn as soon as her marriage began, until eventually Albert was doing almost everything in her name. At times, he issued letters to foreign governments without even consulting her. I highly recommend the book \\"We Two\\". It is a truly honest portrayal of Victoria and Albert's real marriage.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Here's another \\"crossover book\\" that appeals adults as well as teens and some tweens (like Harry Potter does). It's written at the adult level, but the protagonists are kids. So adults can enjoy the read, teens can identify with characters, and those tweens who are good readers will enjoy reading about kids a little older than they are. The photos are sheer genius, in my opinion.    \\"The Help\\" has been the read of the summer for me, but this has been a solid second. While the psychic teens I write about are functioning in the everyday world, this protagonist starts in the everyday world, enters a fantasy world (the frozen past), after which he and the characters from the past shift between past and everyday worlds (as happened in Peter Pan and in Harry Potter). I enjoyed discovering the characters and finding my way through the mystery, and there were plenty of surprises for me. This was an excellent novel, but especially so since it was a first novel (not Riggs' first book, but first novel). A nice mix of mystery/horror/fantasy. I hope to see more from Ransom Riggs.

B003O85W3A|5.0|After listening to this wonderful, perfect album many times, it finally clicked with me and I realized it's genius.<br /><br />The album's suburbs theme is simply an apt context; what 'suburbs' is really about is the feeling one may have of wistful, nostalgic reflection of one's past in a transcendence into maturity.  The album underscores a pining for things in our past that never will be again.<br /><br />It does this quite perfectly both lyrically and musically and emotionally, something akin to magic in my book.  Some key tracks that resonate with this sense of nostalgic reflection, 'we used to wait', 'modern man', 'suburban war', 'sprawl I' and 'sprawl II'.<br /><br />Sprawl I, a track that made me cry once I actually really listened to it, struck a chord in me to which I could relate on a deeply personal level. It is about kids' search to find the house in which they grew up, only discovering that the house and playgrounds are not there anymore- they had been consumed to obscurity by modern development.  The song underscores the search and longing to go back to that place and time and it's very sad.<br /><br />Sprawl II, somewhat reprises this theme and bookends the entire album, with 'Living in the sprawl dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains and there's no end in sight I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights'.  Powerful! and also cathartic.<br /><br />The album weaves a tapestry that sounds strangely familiar and retro.  The sporadic and sometimes silly synth conjures an 80s-era feeling re-imagined. I can't put my finger on it but it makes me think of 'the Cars'  Bruce Springsteen and others of that time.
0553801473|2.0|I was an avid fan of the first 3 George R R Martin books in this series and I anxiously awaited this last one to come out, especially since it took around 6 years to write. I was horribly disappointed by this book and I honestly could not finish it.<br /><br />The sad truth is is that this book could have been about 300 pages and still accomplished the amount of story told in this book. Nothing actually happens. Although a large amount of time passes in this book it seems like none of the main characters actually get anywhere or accomplish anything. In fact, most of the book is about people just sitting around and talking, their is a chapter were a character is sitting in a room talking and only 1 sentence said in the course of 15 pages is relevant and actually forwards the plot any at all. At times I would start a chapter and wonder if I should just skim it because I wondered if it would be relevant or another character simply walking around and talking about his or her day. Their is also very little action in this book, maybe 1 fight that lasts half a chapter, which also hurts this book tremendously as the previous once were a non stop thrill ride.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book, I truly did. The fact that nothing happens and that I don't feel like I have enriched myself or the story ANY makes me realize what a tremendous waste of time it was to read this book. I pray that his last 2 books liven up the story, I would hate to have this book end on such a horrendous note.

0802136834|4.0|A very interesting presentation about the six wives of Henry the Eight. Tends to drag out though. Overall a good read.
0062060554|1.0|When I started hearing about this book, I thought, \\"Wait, isn't that just like Memento? And 50 First Dates?\\"    I gave into the hype that this story was gripping and original and read it anyway.    Well, I'm here to tell you it's neither of those things.    The writing is kind of awful. This is partly because it's told in first-person and the main character (I can't even remember her name - this is how dull both she and the book are) isn't very smart, but it also seems that S.J. Watson is just not a very good writer. The sentences are short and repetitive and exhausting, and since you have to live through her waking up every day and going through the same discoveries, some interesting writing might have taken the edge off.    Now, if you haven't seen Memento or 50 First Dates, the idea of someone who loses their memory every night might seem exciting and new. However, if you have, you're likely going to be turning the pages in irritation that someone who took a great idea and did a mediocre job of it is getting credit for being original.    It's also painfully obvious that S.J. Watson is a man writing as a woman, and I kind of wondered whether any woman had read this book before it was published, because it didn't read like a woman's voice at all, especially when she talks about her body (there's a fun scene where she refers to how aware she is of her breasts because they are moving around separately from her body - huh?).    Do yourself a favor and go watch Memento. You'll be much happier, and your money will be going to someone talented.
1451629184|5.0|Excellent read. It weaves Jaycee's horrific experience with her feelings today and the challenges she faces with her daughters. It's not difficult to read and is truly a wonderful book of courage and faith.
0596007124|2.0|Indeed, repetition and elaboration are the two pillars for memorizing. But distraction is not. Silly, unhelpful graphics, the obsession with pizza and coffee, the pre-teen jokes, and not least all the spelling errors just distract too much.  All I could think of during the first one hundred pages, before I gave up, was \\"GET ON WITH IT!\\" Did the repetition at least help me memorize the first patterns? No. But I now know there is a difference between Chicago and NY pizzas.  Already had the Design Patterns book by the Gang-of-four and was hoping this tome might indeed help call up the necessary patterns during programming, but I'll just go through the GoF book again.  Two stars for trying.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game, can&apos;t wait for a second one (I&apos;ve beat it several times). Not as many modes as other versions, but it&apos;s pretty great for a mobile game. Better looking than the DS version...
B000TGJ80S|3.0|This simply can't be the same director who gave us \\"Apocylapse Now\\", perhaps one of the most successful screen adaptations from a brilliant novel of our time.  Granted, Coppola used the Vietnam War as the background rather than the colonial Africa of \\"Heart of Darkness\\", but the underlying themes were largely unmolested.  In \\"Dracula\\", however, no amount of Nosferatu's blood can bring this corpse back to life.    Now, in contrast with other reviews, I don't mind that Coppola added a romantic twist to the story.  In doing so, he was attempting to portray Dracula as less the one-dimensional killer created by Stoker and more of a true representation of the duality of man, true love vs. carnal lust.  However, the character of Dracula is the only one in which Coppola is successful at pulling it off (kudos to the superb Gary Oldman).  John Harker (Keanu Reeves) is simply pathetic, and Coppola should have known better than to let this knave anywhere higher than assistant costume designer on the cast roll.  Mina (Winona Ryder) drifts clumsily through the project, swaying back and forth in her devotion to her husband, then Dracula, then her husband again, then Dracula again, with no apparent rhyme or reason.    The supporting cast were cardboard cutouts in the book as well, but at least in the book they come across as noble, brave, and decent.  Here they're little more than straw men for those who argue we haven't evolved from apes as much as we once thought.  Dr. Seward is a near-raving, paranoid workaholic, scarcely saner than his patients.  Holmwood is a pompous buffoon.  Lucy is basically a call girl, but with less dignity.      Van Helsing was perhaps the biggest disappointment.  Played by the usually exceptional Anthony Hopkins, Van Helsing was reduced from Stoker's honorable but mysterious point man to Coppola's creepy, annoying, unshaven old pervert who spends a bit too much time stalking out the players of whatever Victorian England's equivalent of \\"Toddlers and Tiaras\\" is.      And yes, Coppola, we grasp the Freudian undertones allegedly woven throughout Stoker's novel without you pretty much holding up a sign on screen announcing it.  Perhaps its not entirely your fault that you direct movies in an age where some audience members (many of whom claim, with a straight face, to be mature adults) can't sit still without gratuitous soft porn, much less grasp big, complicated concepts like plot and character development.  But the scene in the garden with Dracula and Lucy?  Really?      Lastly, the movie wasn't long enough to capture the book.  An hour more would have done, especially during the second half after Van Helsing shows up.      The scenery was decent, the shape-shifting scenes clever, and all in all this film is the closest rendition to date of Stoker's novel, so you get 2.5 stars from me.  Gary Oldman is really the force behind whatever props this gets, however, and the fact that you didn't reduce his character to a Twilight-esque emo sissy.  But next time, put in the time and effort needed for a film worthy of the book.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Few films have the power to make me cry.  There are the rare ones out there that have made me misty, sometimes even managing to encourage a tear or two to roll down my cheek.  There are also few films adapted from books I've read of which I've not been disappointed by the result, however small or great.  A film's impact, however, becomes abundantly clear when the audience remains in their seats in poignant silence nearly ten minutes after the end credits have started rolling, so moved by what they've seen that they take that much time to reflect and/or regain their composure.  This is the point at which film transcends it medium and becomes art.  Laughter, tears, and catharsis - this was my experience seeing \\"The Help\\".<br /><br />Adapted from author Kathryn Stockett's mega best seller of the same name, \\"The Help\\" tells the story of the impenetrable and time-tested bonds between women and the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, setting it against the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement in the sweltering summer temperatures and racially-charged atmosphere of Jackson, Mississippi.  Eugenia \\"Skeeter\\" Phelan (Stone) is the film's central character, an Ole Miss graduate who instead of aspiring to marriage and children like all her friends before her dreams of making a name for herself as a journalist and author.  Brought up in an era where African-American housemaids and field workers were commonplace (she was raised by a black housekeeper herself), Skeeter sets herself apart from the rest of Jackson's residents with her staunchly liberal views.  Confounded and opposed to the treatment that friends and family bear upon the help, she is even more horrified when her best friend Hilly Holbrook (Howard) issues a \\"Household Sanitation Initiative\\", a proposal which strongly recommends that a separate bathroom for blacks be a requirement in every white home.<br /><br />Fed up with the unrelenting bias of nearly everyone around her, Skeeter embarks on a radical and risky project - to document the stories of black housemaids and share their viewpoints in the effort to open people's minds.  Starting first with veteran housemaid Aibileen (Davis) and growing to more than 30 different women over time, Skeeter's book attempts to rip the blindfold of ignorance from everyone's eyes and spur a collapse in Jackson's longstanding racial divide.<br /><br />Written and directed for the screen by Tate Taylor, \\"The Help\\" serves as his directorial debut and considering the actors with whom he worked he had an easy time about it.  The cast is superior - Emma Stone is golden as Skeeter, a less than stellar beauty who shines nonetheless with ambition and integrity, a woman who stubbornly pursues the truth while battling quietly with uncertainty.  Octavia Spencer is uproarious as the feisty Minnie; Bryce Dallas Howard manages to incur all the intended hatred for the character of Hilly, her high nose and icy stare masterful; Jessica Chastain is delightful as the ditzy and buxom Celia Foote, her squeaky giggles, flirtatious prancing, and high, timid speech seeming to spring directly from Stockett's pages.  It should serve as no surprise that Academy Award nominee Viola Davis gives the film's most arresting performance, able to detain a viewer's heart with one raw and penetrating look, one succinctly delivered line.  The film's final scene is the most heartrending, Aibileen bidding both fond and hard-edged farewells alike as she walks down a long suburban road, one that serves as a symbol to the long road that many African-Americans have walked in their pursuit for equality.<br /><br />Bottom line: Though a few things have been changed for dramatic effect (a commonality for adaptations), \\"The Help\\" is a movie of which readers of Stockett's novel should be proud.  Despite its obvious invitation to controversy, the film packs an emotional punch with its historical backdrop, stirring story and bravado performances.  To all the women in the audience: be it a tissue or a shirt sleeve, you will find yourself at a loss for words and wiping away tears when all is said and done.sleeve, you will find yourself at a loss for words and wiping away tears when all is said and done.
B0052KJ5TK|5.0|Finally, after around 3 years, we get this long anticipated, new release of brand new material, from this \\"World Class\\" Rock Band, from the little town of Escatawpa, Mississippi. This is truly one of the greatest bands to come out of the deep South, in many years. I love this band, and I love this great new album, especially the deluxe edition. I've been through their home town many times through the years, and I've seen their documentary dvd. I can definitely relate to this band, because I came from a very similiar background as these guys. They were the opening act, at the Grand Opening of the Hard Rock Casino, in Biloxi, Mississippi, back on July 7, 2007 (7/7/07) after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  This great new album proves they can still rock just as good as ever, my friend. They are currently on their \\"Time of My Life\\" Tour, promoting this new album. I plan to see at least two of their concerts on this tour. If you get a chance to see this band perform live, I highly recommend it. You can see their tour schedule, on their website.  As far as this album goes, the deluxe edtion, with the 4 bonus tracks is by far the best option available for this great new release, my friend. The liner notes include the lyrics to all the songs. The cover art is fantastic. These are all good solid \\"Real Rock\\" songs. They have matured greatly as an \\"alternative &/or Classic\\", \\"Hard\\" Rock Band. They are definitely a \\"World Class\\" band and this deluxe edition album, certainly proves it, my friend. Thanks and God Bless You, My Friend!!!!!

B004EPZ08Y|4.0|Yes, Final Destination 5 is pretty much the same movie as the last four, but hey, I didn't expect a fifth film in a series to be one of the strongest entries.<br /><br />A bridge collapse is the event that eight kids manage to escape thanks to a vision from one of the passengers, and then one by one the unseen force, Death, kills them off in the most grotesque ways imaginable. The writing and acting are borderline terrible at times, but that's not the reason why this series has been successful. The really inventive and often complex death scenes are some of the best in the entire franchise. You think one thing is going to happen, then another, until finally the suspense builds to a crescendo of gory goodness. The ending was also a pleasant surprise. Oh, and how awesome was it to hear AC/DC blaring while a recap of deaths from all the FD films plays before the end credits.<br /><br />The 3-D was well worth the extra $4.00. You could tell this was shot with the format in mind. The opening title sequence alone has more stuff flying at you than the majority of 3-D films I've seen.<br /><br />I'm rating this four stars based on this franchise alone. It is so much more satisfying than the last wreck of a film and it might even be the best of the sequels, as the majority of the critics also seem to agree with.
0316044695|2.0|I started reading this book hoping to read about a realistic account of a battle involving the highly regarded SEALS.  What I ended up actually getting was a book that was half SEAL training, and the other half an opininated, and likely fairy-tale description of a real event.       The long-winded SEAL training part of the book was an often day-to-day account of their grueling workout, getting wet and sandy (x 200), and folks intermittently dropping out except, of course, for the author.  I particularly remember how the author said it would not be like a SEAL to garnish personal attention on themselves, then immediately implying that it was him that got voted \\"best\\" on the sniper range.   Throughout the book, he probably implied at least 20 times how great he and his men were, but we are supposed to believe, according to him, that they don't look for praise.  Ultimately, this puts the reader in a position to either judge by the author's words, or by the author's actions.   Or is by his words, or his words?  I digress.    By the author's account, the eventual battle that led to the demise of several SEALS, including the 3 in his group, were a series of mistakes, not one of which was his decision not to murder the goat herders.  By his own account, they knowingly went into an operation and battlefield that provided little to no cover, despite cover being essential for an operation that would include long-term surveillence.  By his own account, they were also spotted by common goat herders despite having the training to avoid detection by even a highly trained enemy.   Then after taking the goat herders into custody, the \\"debate\\" they considered was whether to murder them or not (admittedly, they did not consider killing innocents murder, but ignorance doesn't change what it is).  After deciding to let them go and knowing that their position was compromised, all they did was relocated to a nearby area instead of immediately contacting their superiors for an extractionfrom a compromised mission.  They had, by their own account, 45 minutes to do this which is an eternity in the military.  With regards to Mikey, I couldn't help but later realize that when you wait to call for support while being shot in the chest instead of doing it beforehand, that puts you in the proper position to receive the medal of honor.           Much of the following battle seemed fabricated.   Luttrell has been quoted in the book and in interviews as saying they fought 100+ men, but written accounts put the numbers at about 35-40.  The survivability of the men in his party that died seemed fabricated.  Apparently, if you are a SEAL, you can take multiple AK 47 rounds and still function like you haven't been shot.  I also didin't find the supposed face-to-face confrontation with his nemesis near the end of the book believeable.    The author wants you to believe the taliban and its supporters are evil to the core, and that their evil can be identify by merely looking into their eyes.  Yet, at least a 3rd of the book discuss how the Pashtuns (taliban supporters, according to him) were willing to risk their lives right down to the last men to protect him while he was injured.  He tries to make an exception for their compassion by implying they only do it because it is their custom, as if to imply that cultural customs don't count in morality considerations of a people.    And let me not forget the politics.  According to Littrell, it was the liberals that killed his buddies, not the Taliban.  Littrell is also afraid of liberals and lawyers by his own admission and, thus, made a convincing argument that SEALs aren't as fearless as they claim to be.  If you choose to believe Littrell's account, you'd be obligated to believe that it was ultimately his fear that cost the lives of all the SEALs that fateful day since he was too afraid to kill (murder) the goat herders who alledgly ratted he and his men out.    Littrell also thinks 20-something year old soilders in the battlefield should decide who lives or dies instead of his superiors or our elected leaders.  Littrell thinks the only consideration in a military decision is the one that would keep most of his men alive, even if it means murder.   As an intelliect who's probably not near as strong as Littrell, I'm glad it is the thinkers doing the thinking and decision making, and the killers killing who our leaders ask them to kill.    Littrell = John Rambo; a man who not only excells at killing, but also supposedly knows what to do better than anyone else.
0385472951|2.0|The Partner is initially entertaining and action packed - I was unable to put it down for the first half of the book. But soon, I got tired of the protagonist's unbelievable, superhuman feats of foresight, planning and executing everything flawlessly, down to his own faked death and then (almost fatal) real torture. Then, I thought the ending to the book was remarkably lazy - it was as if Grisham realized that the pattern of Patrick's superhuman-ness had pretty much guaranteed a certain ending for the last 100 or so pages, and so he was determined to thrown in an unexpected twist in the end. A twist that had no basis, based on his development of characters etc. I found that irritating and lazy.
0763619795|5.0|This is the familiar story we all know and love in a small paperback format. I bought this for the bear... so when they find the bear in the cave, he \\"jumps out\\" and runs after the family.

1594202710|4.0|When I first picked up this book, I expected it to be a typical political memoir where the author presented the facts and events in a manner to put himself in the best light possible, and used it to advocate his own views on political events.  This book is so much more than that!  Kissinger starts off with a quick description of China's history from early imperial times, through its encounters with the colonial ambitions of the West in the 1800's, and into the Chinese civil war.  In addition to his description of the historical facts, Kissinger explains the nature and the rationale behind Chinese foreign policy through these years.  Kissinger then moves into the United States' encounters with China after the communists took over.  I expected Kissinger to start inserting his own opinions at this point, but he largely stuck to an objective statement of the facts.  When he got to the opening of China in the Nixon years, he presented his thoughts about China and the United States' policy toward it in a very matter of fact manner.  He then continued to give a description of the personalities and the events that led to China's remarkable economic rise.  Throughout the book, Kissinger limited himself to an objective statement of the facts and issues regarding the United States' relationship with China.  While he certainly favors continued engagement with China, he presents the arguments of people who wish for a more confrontational policy with China in an even-handed manner.  I found this book to be remarkably informative and very enjoyable to read.  It is an excellent primer on Chinese history and a must read for anyone who is interested in US/China relations.
B002ZG98UA|1.0|Nothing can better sum up how I feel than that simple phrase - I just hate this movie - I hate everything about it.  I hate that it came at this point after EXTINCTION gave the franchise a surprisingly strong boost.     The movie is a travesty from the get-go. Well, that's not quite true - actually, the opening credits sequence is pretty cool, ending with the crash zoom out to the heavens.  But, it's when we come back down, and we have this overblown action opening that the problems begin.  After the poorly edited opening action sequence, we are shown how Wekser (ah, Albert...was there ever a more annoying villain in film OR video game!?) uses an injection to remove Alice's T-Virus, and hence, her \\"abilities\\" - you know, the filmic excuse for her to be able to pull off all her Matrix Rip-Off moves.  This seemed like a very promising concept - and it made sense, for a moment.  Open with the crazy action so fans get their fix, then strip our heroine of her advantage and put her back into the danger zone.    Well, this proves to be short-lived, for IMMEDIATELY following this scene, Alice survives a head-on airplane collision.  Not just survives, but walks out of the wreckage unscathed.  Indeed, the entire duration of the film, you'd have no idea she was fully human again, aside from a knife injury near the end.  Why they introduced this plot point, then never explored it is beyond me.    The film is rife with these kinds of \\"go nowhere\\" plot points.  In the second act, we are introduced to Wentworth Miller (from FOX's PRISON BREAK- someone must have thought it hilarious to introduce him incarcerated in a prison cell) who insists he knows the way out.  After the characters finally trust him to let him out, he promptly leads them to a door with an ATV inside ... a door anyone of the characters could have found at any time.  And, this proves to lead nowhere anyway - the ATV is non-operational.  So, again, a pointless plot element.    Furthermore - this is a Zombie movie,right?  I ask only because the zombies are barely in the movie.  Other than a final influx in the final act, they only pop up here and there for a quick shoot out, and that's about it.    Ali Larter, who brought a fresh element to EXTINCTION, is relegated to the sidelines for the bulk of the film with a convenient \\"memory loss\\" theme.  She only comes back in the end for a quick \\"look how bad-as$ I am\\" fight scene.      Well, it all boils down to a final battle with Wesker, who is apparently 100% indestructible - which means one more boring element added to his already boring character.  And, after the obligatory final action scene, we are left with the threat of yet ANOTHER sequel to come, as our characters are literally left facing an all-out assault (again, not by zombies, but by humans).    My problem with this film is that it just highlights the overall weakness of the entire franchise.  It was based on a series of games that were themselves based on a genre of b-movies.  Yet, none of these films really plays into the zombie-horror mythos - rather, these are thinly veiled Matrix-wannabe action flicks.  Constant slow-motion, humans displaying inexplicable kung-fu powers and imperviousness to injury, and plots that don't even measure up to video game \\"standards\\" - that's what this franchise has come to represent - and while EXTINCTION gave us a brief glimmer of hope, AFTERLIFE plunges us back into reality - this is just a weak franchise that needs to be put down. Sadly, it makes money - and that's all that matters to the producers - and really, who can blame them?    Poor Milla, meanwhile ... I imagine her at night sitting on the floor in the corner of the room, hugging her knees to her chest and rocking slowly as she contemplates the state of her career, muttering over and over to herself \\"I still have THE FIFTH ELEMENT ... I still have THE FIFTH ELEMENT...\\" until she finally falls into a restless sleep.
0553801473|4.0|I enjoyed Dance, but was upset that one of the my favorite characters did not make it to the next novel, if there is one.  There were no endings, only opening for the next series of books.  I don't know if I will live long enough to read the next series.  It was good, but a lot of characters were introduced that really had nothing to do w/ the story line.  When I heard that the long awaited \\"final\\" book was going to be released, I re-read all of the others so that I that I wouldn't be lost in the new book. I enjoyed them all (again). No matter what else I say, the book is good. I am hooked. I will buy the next book, if there is one, when it first hits Amazon's site.  Frustrated, waiting for the next chapter.
0375842209|5.0|I was hesitant at first to read a book written from the view point of Death but it turns out he is an insightful if definitely odd bed fellow (I do most of my reading in bed).  I guess if he were not those things he would be something else entirely, and I would imagine something much less pleasant. I am so glad the author made him likeable, and not evil.  I hesitate to use the word pleasant to describe such a character, but really, I get the feeling that is what Death was trying very, very hard to be. He went about his work in as matter of fact and pleasant manner as possible while all around him atrocities made him wonder about the human race. Death struggles with the extremes of human beings, he knows there is great good, but he also knows there is great evil, and there is never any end to his work.<br /><br />Death tells us about Liesel, a little girl in Nazi Germany, one of the more extreme times in history. She was one of his experiences of great good, a girl with huge compassion and heart.  Death \\"saves\\" stories like Liesel's in order to comfort himself so he can endure his task, so he can look at humans as worthwhile. Death experiences the world in colors. Colors serve as a comforting distraction in some situations and as a foreboding presence at other times.  The first few chapters were rather unusual to me, I had not become used to Death and his style, and did not understand the significance of the colors (basically I wondered what on EARTH Death was rambling on about) and I began to wonder if the book was going to be for me. Death seemed way more odd than he seemed insightful. I am SO glad I stuck with it.  After I was half way through the book I went back and reread the first few (very short) chapters and they not only made perfect sense they were haunting and beautiful.<br /><br />The Book Thief is a beautiful book altogether. That may sound strange, as to call it a sad book is an understatement, but mainly I think of it as beautiful. Liesel (and all those in her world) experience devastating heartbreak but still there is such tenderness and compassion and yes, humour, at times and there is definitely resilience and courage, huge amounts of courage.  The characters find a way to live and experience joy and love in the midst of shocking injustices and fear. The small cast of characters is quite amazing, I felt I knew each and every one of them. They are all a product of their environment to one extent or the other, they all had choices to make at some point (to whom do they align themselves) but the book made it clear to me that it was not always a clear cut decision, not for all of them. Some choices, either good or bad had to be made in order to survive.  And then of course, there were the purely evil characters, the ones who enjoyed the bad choices, the ones who were meant for their time.<br /><br />A quote from the book, Death is telling us about two grave diggers: \\"When it came down to it one of them called the shots. The other did what he was told. The question is, what if the \\"other\\" is a lot more than one?\\"<br /><br />Clearly, Death isn't just talking about two grave diggers in Nazi Germany. So many times in this book so much (SO MUCH) is summed up in a couple of sentences.  I think Marcus Zusak is a genius, I really do.<br /><br />There are descriptive sentences all over The Book Thief that made me shake my head with their ability to cause instant and indelible visions. At one point Death is described as being very busy and having to carry off souls by picking them up like suitcases  As I read that a picture of a male and more grim Mary Poppins floating off (with no hands free for an umbrella) seared my brain. Another sentence describes the eye color of an old lady.  Blue as a vein. My goodness haven't we all seen that very deep, dark and watery blue eye color with a tinge of red in the elderly or sick people, and doesn't \\"the color of a vein\\" SUM IT UP. Never in a million years would I have thought to callit the color of a vein though. Yep, I am quite in awe of this author.<br /><br />The Book Thief is perfect to me, such descriptive writing, but so much more than that. It might be a little ironic that a book narrated by Death of all \\"people\\" has such incredible soul. When I finished reading the book I slowly closed it and had to just sit and be quiet for a while.  I had to mourn. I had grown to LOVE Liesel and Rudy and Max and Papa, and even the lady shaped like a wardrobe with a foul tongue.  I have never cared more about characters in a book. Never.  I won't ever forget The Book Thief.  I can't give it high enough praise.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|This not one of those &quot;draw a line through all matching boxes &quot; games, rather is a strategy game, excellent animation, not a second of loading on my EVO 3d. RECOMMEND
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This was a very interesting read. I felt nervous and anxious and couldn't wait to see where the book would go next. Very emotional. Makes you really think about the way you treat people. My oldest is 11 and I think I will have her read this book, although probably not for a couple more years. Should be required reading for 8th or 9th graders.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I live near a library where I am certain to be able to get this on loan before having to buy it, so for now, I will put that off.  As to the 4k transfer...this doesn't mean necessarily this is a bad transfer.  First of all, if the information is there in the original for a good transfer, less than 8k may be a waste of money.  Second, depending on the TV size, blu-ray player, and other factors, most sets might not even take advantage the full transfer size.  If there is more information retained in the original elements, that large of a transfer is a waste of money.  If the original digital elements of the first trilogy in it's native format is less than 8k, then it is a waste of money since there isn't that amount in the original elements and \\"enlarging\\" it, so to speak, to a higher resolution is like enlarging a bad photo, all of the difficiencies are still there, only larger.  What really counts....how it looks when you watch it.  A larger resolution won't restore what isn't there in the orginal negatives of the trilogy set, and it won't restore all of the lacking digital info of a lower resolution original prequel either. Whether or not the earlier scans in 2004 are insufficient for blu-ray, who knows, got to look at the blu-ray when it comes out. How does it look and how does it sound?  That's all that matters.    Yes, George Lucas is a savey business man, and yes he has held back before. I suspect most of us would do the same if we could make money like he does.  Yes, he does do some things backwards like offer his newer versions instead of the original which could have been offered as alternate endings.  However, there are many movies I have been disappointed with that have made their way to blu-ray and could have used all of the nice treatments like \\"The Ten Commandments,\\" or \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" which show what can be done.  If you want to see what can be done, get a copy of Criterion's \\"The Red Shoes.\\"  The problem comes down to money, and it's always money.  Theonly studio to have the forsight to do the higher definition transfers is \\"Disney\\" who was envolved in copying all of their films digitally and cleaning them up since their first transfer of \\"Snow White\\" using Kodak back in 1987. This is because Disney films don't loose their attraction with age, and the company wanted to preserve it's heritage, evident by it's keeping almost all information about each film in their libraries. Most companies either don't feel it is worth the trouble since interest with their films dissipates with each generation who becomes only interested in newer films.    I personally believe every film ever made should be restored to the best it possibly can be by chemically cleaning up where possible, creating new film transfers, and then digitally scanning them with at least twice the 35mm resolution.  This should be done to preserve every film for future generations, and so the quality will be there should better techniques arise in the future to better improve the digital copies.  This desire will probably never happen because of money issues.    I have been disappointed by even transfers of more recent films to blu-ray.  Probably, as blu-ray becomes more popular, and costs of transfers become lower, this might change.    I suggest you wait if you are unsure.  Rent a copy  when it comes out or borrow one from a friend and see how you like it before you complaining.  You might be surprised at how good it looks or you might want to just stick with the same old dvd you own than buying a blu-ray that is going to disappoint you.    Along with this, there is an excellent article about the hows and whys of film preservations, the use of above 2k transfers, etc.,  and the decisions made at this link:    [...]    [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]]]

1439177783|5.0|I love this book.  I'm reading it for my second time now.  About 5-6 years ago I struggled with exercise bulima/anorexia. It started out healthy and became overwhelming and I was unable to stop.  Reading this book was like opening a door for me.  The first time I read it I had to stop a few times because it related so well to what I had also gone through and it was difficult for me to deal with. When I finally was able to finish it I felt hopeful; that I could get help and that recovery was possible. Any time I seem to have difficulty with food or exercising, I read this book and it sets me straight.
0792164903|5.0|It's sad to say, and the line feels cliche, and yet it's true. They just don't make them like this anymore.<br /><br />  This is a true Gothic horror movie, the first of it's kind to come along in years and the last of it's kind for years to come afterward.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow is a spooky and atmospheric Gothic horror story in the vein of Hammer Horror.  The use of color and shadow with the bombastic and heavily haunting scoring of Danny Elfman certainly give it the feel of a Hammer horror period piece like Horror of Dracula or Frankenstein Created Woman. It's both refreshing and nostalgic at the same time.  Every scene is full of sublime, surreal visuals.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film that is part supernatural thriller and part murder mystery.  It has a complexity to be appreciated.  Unlike most recent horror films it does not condescend to the audience or make the viewer feel like a child or a half-wit.  I was seventeen-years-old when Sleepy Hollow came out and I saw it in the theatre twice.<br /><br />A part of the story involving the ancient symbol of the pentacle caught me by surprise. Originally It seems the symbol is being used for evil.  This bothered me because the symbol is, in reality, a symbol of ancient faith and protection representing the five elements of nature.  Earth, air, fire, water, and spirit.  Later though our protagonist is made to realize that the symbol was being used as a protection ward and this greatly relieved me and my fear of misuse of the symbol.<br /><br />Though this is not a faithful adaptation of Washington Irving's short story (which would be difficult to make into a full length feature) I actually feel this story is an improvement on the original incarnation.  Ichabod Crane is a lot more relatable and likable in this version of the story.  He is shy, geeky, awkward, and faints at least three times during the course of the movie.  He is like a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Roddy McDowall's character from Hell House.  Our nerdish hero is masterfully played by Johnny Depp.  And the ending of the film is very satisfying.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this for anyone who loves Gothic Horror.

B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Dexter is an interesting watch. We get the outside looking in as a monster tries to live camouflaged among its unwitting prey. Along the way, we see many layers of psychosis and neurosis flayed away. Maybe there's more to Dexter than is immediately seen.<br /><br />The story for the first season bares only the most simplistic resemblance to the first novel in the series. Though I've read the book and watched the show quite a few times, I would be hard-pressed to pick one over the other. The cast is amazing, and the intro sequence tells you everything you need to know about the series.<br /><br />The special features for the DVD set falls to the abysmal side. Slim pickings for commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, but we get a handful of other Showtime series episodes. I don't know about you, but I bought Dexter to watch Dexter, not to watch episodes of the Tudors or whatever else they threw into the DVD set. And they did all this sans English subtitles (which matters to a guy like me, being partially deaf).<br /><br />The only thing worth while about this set are the 12 episodes of Dexter. If that's all you are shopping for, go at it. Me, I'm looking at getting the series on BD and hoping for better material. But the show alone is so good, I can't rate this lower than 4 stars.
0553381695|5.0|A worthy sequel to A Game of Thrones. This is a wonderful book, and follows old and new characters through the land of Westeros. Arya continues to be the unsung hero of the story, while Tyrion Lannister comes into his own on this one. Also, trouble is brewing up north, and the men of the watch must venture past the wall. I am most of the way through and heartily recommend this to all Martin fans and fans of a good book in general.

1400052181|4.0|Very interesting and informative book.  When I mentioned it to my daughter who has a biology degree, she was, of course very aware of HeLa cells and their importance in research.  Educational and heartbreaking.
1400052181|4.0|Offers a lot of insight into cell and genetic research...might well be considered a history of that research told against the backdrop of an unknowing donor, her family and the effect the study of her \\"immortal\\" cells had on their lives over the years...    Interesting format, very well done, nicely mixing science and human interest...But...    How many times do you have to say virtually the same thing in a different way? The book begins to feel repetitious about halfway through---but it is a good and  worthwhile read.    And there is a sense from midpoint on, that Ms. Skloot may be imposing today's standards of medical privacy and research on a time when those expectations did not exist and were not considered.      That's dangerous and judgemental thing to do.  To her credit, she doesn't overdo it, but the sense, the feel, is still there.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|While not having very much experience using this type of product, I did find it was not easy to use.<br />Once you get the hang ofthe different options it did get easier, but found myself frustrated on a few runs because the milage disappeared and when I completed a lap it didnt always beep at me like I had set it to. I think I could have bought a lesser model and got the same type of information I am looking for. I will know better next time to do more research before spending that kind of money. Top of the line doesnt always mean better. I would not recommend this product for the casual runner but only for serious runners. Some of the information it gathers and things it can do doesnt get used.
B0041B4H1M|4.0|First off, I love sharks. So I'm pretty picky when it comes to collecting films on these prehistoric beasts. I have two, yes, two shark flicks, both on BD. Everything else is documentary.    Deep Blue Sea is one of the movies I own.    I'm not going to rehash the plot; plenty of folk have done that already. The acting is decent on all fronts; but the actors we're here to watch don't have any lines of dialogue. There are quite a few 'Whoa!\\" moments, knocking you back in your seat not because of gore, but just because you didn't expect THAT to happen. But the gore is good too, not over-powering though. There is a lot of situational/ironic comedy (The anti-smoking ad and the chef's special are my favourites). And there are a few cases of 'That would never happen'. But my brain shut off the switch that follows the logic stream and I enjoyed it for what it was: a B-Grade monster flick.    The special features are nothing to scream about; what they have here is pretty much just the expected fare - a commentary track, a few deleted scenes, and a behind the scenes featurette. They could have done better. The soundtrack is decent, but again, nothing to prompt a need to own; it has passable 2-channel and 5.1. The digital transfer is awesome though, and for me that more than makes up for the lackluster technical and special features.    There are a LOT of bad shark movies, even or especially from the Jaws franchise. But Deep Blue Sea somehow manages to swim above the rest. It's a good addition to a BD collection if you want to watch monster sharks outsmart the human cast.

0812550706|1.0|A more tiresome, tautological and uneventful novel could not be imagined. All the other 1-star reviews pretty much cover the massive deficiencies of this laughable piece of dreck. I'm stunned that it came to me with such high recommendation. I decided to branch out from literary fiction and read some genre work and I started with Ender's Game on my sci-fi quest. Big mistake. I didn't give up on the genre but I lost more than a little bit of respect for fan's of the genre. This was an award winner? Wow.

B004SUDPWI|2.0|I am a big fan of David Lean's films, and the idea of having The Bridge on the River Kwai on a fully realized Blu Ray thrilled me. And then I got this disc.<br /><br />The movie, of course, is wonderful. The picture, while more than okay was less than startlingly lovely. But the BIG disappointment was the sound -- here remixed into 5.1 channels of compression-free Dolby Digital.<br /><br />General sound quality, too, was okay. Until, about 20 minutes in, when my speakers started to spit out occasional (say every five minutes) ear-splitting 'cracks\\" -- the type that long experience tells me can blow a tweeter.<br /><br />My system has the sound decoded by the Blu Ray Player - a Pioneer BDP-320 -- which then goes to an Onkyo 606 receiver.<br /><br />Never before (not since)has my system reacted this way to a visually perfect disc.<br /><br />Anyhow, back the disc went to Amazon. The disappointment remains.

B005DI65L2|2.0|As someone who owns a dog and loves dogs, I was looking forward to gaining some new insight into a dog's world - per the promise of the book's title.  What you end up getting with this book is a very, very thin summary of old animal research which she rarely bothers to weave into any kind of theory or conclusion.    What do dogs experience? Do dogs sense time? Why do we connect with dogs?  Her answers to these questions go no further than what you and I can intuitively assume just by owning a dog.  How do we know that dogs get bored?  They chew up your shoes when you go to work.  That kind of thing.    Every chapter begins with a sometimes irritating anecote from her own dog.  From there she moves to a couple of research studies using dogs and other animals - many of the studies not terribly relevant to the point that she is making.  Then, without fail, she ends the chapter by going back to her own experieces living with a dog to tell you that, essentially, no one knows what it is like to be a dog.    I give it two stars because the book wasn't terribly written, and because the part on what colors dogs see was interesting.  Though truth be told, the dog color thing was the only new thing I learned by reading this book.  Everything else I pretty much knew just by owning and observing my own canine.

I only learned about Brand X later on, and at first had a hard time believing that this music was performed by the same guy who is also resonsible for \\"You'll Be In My Heart.\\" Yet so it is, and it's a tribute to Mr. Collins's versatility and overall musicality.  There are few musicians today who could bridge the gap between almost-jazz-prog-fusion and mega-hits so the existence of this disc is much to Mr. Collins's credit.<br /><br />As for the recording at hand, it's wanky music nerd material in the first degree.  Collins was performing in a then-semi-popular style known as jazz-rock fusion, which was probably officially started by Miles Davis in the late 60s when electric instruments and a more aggressive, rockish beat were incorporated into jazz performances. The style spread to other bands often comprised of Davis alums, such as Chick Corea's Return to Forever, the Joe Zawinul/Wayne Shorter vehicle Weather Report, John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra, Herbie Hancock's Headhunters, Tony Williams's Lifetime, and so forth.  Stacked up against these other fusion bands, Collins and crew really hold their own. The music here is full of interesting twists and turns as well as complex interplay, furious drumwork and lightning guitar runs that shine with technical prowess. It sounds a bit dated as does any jazz-fusion of that era, with a distinctive \\"70s\\" sound to it. However it also feels very much like a predecessor to today's \\"math rock\\" which occupies a niche in the alternative rock or metal world. As stunning as it sometimes can be, it also is likely to be almost impenetrable to many people, pop fans especially. Those who know the Collins that most of us do would probably have a hard time getting their heads around the idea that this is the same guy who created all the hits.<br /><br />This isn't for everyone and is worth a listen before you buy if possible.  But for those interested in the genre or in understanding why Mr. Collins is recognized as one of the great drummers of the rock era, this is a good place to start.one and is worth a listen before you buy if possible.

0486281523|5.0|This book was recommended to me I was looking at other books on Amazon and it looked very interesting.  I ordered it that night based on the other reviews.    I've always had a love of brain teasers and this is like a book of brain teasers for math majors, which is great.  There are several levels of questions, going from kinda hard to very hard.    This book is a good diversion when I have a few minutes to spare at work.    Recommended.
B004QSQML8|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, Not a lot of people know it, but to have it on Blu-Ray is awesome considering every thing's going to blu ray these days anyway. Great Movie, Great quality, Great Product to add to the collection. Not to mention fairly decently priced. I'm so glad I found it! :) I'm not much one for \\"extras\\" but theres a few interesting extra's on this disk too. and both versions of the movie! (Though I prefer the theatrical version)
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|I really do like this \\"complete\\" version however the change in the musical score at times really bites. The end however is quite better than the original.
B004KABHEY|1.0|This book is disappointing. The attempt to build drama is not well done, the writing is tedious, the resolution not at all clever.  At the end of the book, one can only say 'yeah, yeah, I have read this before'.<br /><br />If plot doesn't work, then character development would have been interesting - but the main character  is not developed.  Others have done w better look into the paranoid psychotic character.  A touch more research would have suited the effort - there are masters out there that the suthor could have learned from.<br /><br />The setting could have saved this book, setting as personality, but the author did not go down that route - there are islands in Boston harbor that have interesting histories, but one gets the feeling the author never visited a single one.<br /><br />Maybe the publisher was demanding a book, and time had run short, so something had to be churned out.
032147404X|5.0|I was somewhat surprised when I got this book and saw how physically small it was.  Don't be fooled by it's size, though, this book is fully of useful information.    It goes through some basics, talks about gear, then gets into how to take good pictures.  The most useful part is near the end of the book where he shows an example picture, then goes into what camera settings and method is required to shoot a picture like this.  I found this particularly useful as it puts a picture to all the photography theory and really brings it home.    This book, along with [[ASIN:B004ULEER0 Complete Digital Photography, 6th Edition]] should be required reading for anyone new to photography.
0553801473|5.0|George R. R. Martin is a mezmerizing story teller.  He has taken us into the lives and times of his characters.  Though the books are lengthy, I was always sad when I reached the end of each.I was lucky enough to read the first four installments of Song of Fire and Ice one after the other, and a bit of a wait for A Dance With Dragons.  They are so captivating!  I think it's time to wrap some of the characters up, because the wait for the next book will be agonizing.  Ok, some are wrapped up because they are dead, I'll give you that, but Mr. Martin has a penchant for making you think a character is dead, but OMG, they're not.  Please don't tell me I have to wait 4 years for the next book....please!
0321344758|5.0|I hadn't heard of usability as a specialty before and I learned a lot about it in this book.  The author was witty, knowledgeable, and entertaining.  His presentation followed his own principles, thereby showing the effectiveness of them.  After I kept telling my husband bits of it, he decided to read it for himself.
B004K4AVAG|2.0|I love Lady Gaga she is very much a female Elton John. Her earlier two albums were fresh except for the titles were uniquie and fun. however this current CD sounds very Madonna esq.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I was looking for a more useful flash than the one built into my Nikon d5100.  I didn't need anything too intense, just something that could bounce off a ceiling and had a quick recharge without reducing the battery life of my camera.    I was considering one of the more expensive Nikon flash's but aside from costing 2-3x, they were also much larger and more intimidating to have on a camera walking around.    This flash is small enough to fit in my camera bag and always have on hand and does a wonderful job of providing some fill light.  It is a must if youre doing macro photography or portraits if the lighting isn't 100% perfect.  Coupled with the [[ASIN:B000PH1DL8 Stofen OM400 Omnibounce Flash Bouncer for Nikon SB400]], you have a great little system that travels very easily.    Highly recommended
B004FJJGBG|4.0|I received the DVD quickly.  It was in perfect condition.  It is excellent quality.  But, it isn't my favorite movie to watch in 3D.   Animation doesn't quite capture the 3D effects as well as regular film.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The Hunger Games trilogy, at a glance, takes a seat next to Harry Potter and Artemus Fowl. However...these books pale in comparison to those. Catching Fire is good, however, these books are clearly written for a young audience; the voice is so young. Katniss just doesn't come off as a three-dimensional character. For example, in spite of the fact  that Katniss isn't vain and shallow, you still get five page descriptions of her clothing. Truly, if Katniss didn't care about what she wears neither should we. Or does she? The author never really investigates things like these.<br /><br />Anyway, a decent set of books, certainly good enough page-turners, but bear in mind: these are children's books first. It does boggle the mind a bit and make one think that the author is riding the coattails of Rowling and Colfer...

B00008WJBU|4.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, the similarities between this movie and \\"13 Tzameti\\" are inescapable. Not only in the general outline concerning questions of fate/luck but in that there are some specific items, namely in a particular game played (albeit with some differences) in both movies, but also the reference to the number 13.    In this movie you have a small handful of people that have fallen on the lucky side (sometimes very lucky) of a given situation but usually at a cost. One (Max Von Sydow) is so lucky he can play a game of Russian Roulette once a year and know he will survive. He also lives in a casino and can direct one of his minions to take away the luck of someone (by merely touching them) who is winning too much in said casino. Some of the lucky people seek out others to play various games and make money. There is more but why spoil?    This is an odd one. The plot is very complex in the way the various people and their stories (or their part in the story) intertwine with each other. I didn't quite understand some of the more subtle aspects (one involving photographs) but a second viewing should take care of that. All the characters are interesting and it has a good steady look and feel to it. The writer/director had a solid handle on what he was trying to convey. I can't say there is any deep emotion necessitating  any gut-wrenching performances here but the actors all do a professional job. What I found very intriguing is that much of the plot involves people looking for, and recruiting, other people who are inherently lucky. As though it were something quantifiable as opposed to fleeting. The ending is good. Too often you get into a really good flick only to have them drop the ball on the one yard line. Not the case here. I found it very fitting.     This is a movie you have to wrap your head around. It won't come to you. You have to go to it. If you're into this sort of head trip, this should satisfy your cravings.
B004QK5N5W|2.0|This device is \\"not ready for prime time.\\"  OK, it doesn't mirror to an iPhone 4. If it would just play video, that would be fine. So far, on both iPhone 4 and iPad 2, the sounds works but no video with HBO, CNBC, TWC, Uverse, or Flixter.    It does work with YouTube and I'm guessing it would work with videos purchased from Apple.  Shame on Apple.
0553801473|3.0|The title just about says it all for me: Martin is falling victim to Robert Jordan Syndrome.  Dance is not a complete book (or even the second half of a complete book).  The book gives us absolutely no resolution and leaves us with even more questions.  I didn't wait five years to be handed an in depth character profile of Jon, Dany, and Tyrion.<br /><br />Mr. Martin, please remember that good books have a beginning, middle, and end.  This book strikes me as all middle. I felt tossed right into the middle of this book without any introduction, and I finished the book deeply disappointed with its nearly complete lack of resolution.  If I had picked up Dance without having read the earlier books, I would consider it unpolished, babbling nonsense.<br /><br />That said, the book's prose is well written, and Martin does introduce several interesting plot devices.  I especially enjoyed seeing Bran's story arc pushed along.  The creative plot twists combine to elevate this book to a 3 star rating.  But that's only within the context of the greater series.
B005BZQTGS|2.0|ALERT: SOME VAGUE REVEALS!    I had very high hopes for this film based on the previews and trailers. As a die-hard rennie, this looked like my sort of romp.    But the fact is that crude humor needs more than mere crudeness to be funny. And most of the time, all that one got here was mere crudeness. The timing of the film was consistently off, so that what should have been fast delivery often dragged. The repartee and banter that should have been at machine-gun pace instead waited for someone to crank the crossbow back for another shot. (Best metaphor I could squeeze out on short notice; sorry ... ) The action sequences were long in coming and, often times short on the delivery. And, dear lord, the musical scene made me want to put an ice-pick in my ears. It too went on far longer than it should have.    There were some good moments, though, and they deserve mention as well. The direct interactions between the brothers was often good, and sometimes even touching. The pacing improved as the film went on, especially after the abduction, although that improvement was slow in coming.    Still, at the end of the day, this is not a film I'll want to own on disk. And given the nature of its theme and my tastes (or lack thereof) that is really disappointing.
B003ZFCBJ0|3.0|Note: I was interested in tthis film since it came out, but didn't get a chance to see it in theaters, and saw it On Demand.<br /><br />This was an interesting film, and I thought it would have ben much better than it was. Ms. Cyrus was excellent. But my main beef with this film is that Veronica seemed to hate her brother throughout the movie, though there were some tender moments between them. However, those moments were too brief, focusing more on the brat (ie. Jonah's) relationship with their dad, which I think is gay. Could have been much better. But the song \\"When I Look At You\\" is very heart-warming.

B004WMKSH2|4.0|ALERT! SOME REVEALS HERE!    Anyone coming to this film w/o having seen the previous movies in the franchise has no grounds for complaint. However, as a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the books -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the stories as they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, as the movies *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative.    Fundamental story matters are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it was explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the \\"unnamed eighth\\" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.)    I've a fair eye for such details, so when major details like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film was almost unintelligible to me. That takes some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort.    That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line makes more sense, and the gaps and flaws of part I are much less distracting so that the OTHER details of the story-telling can now shine through.     Those other details really are very well done. But the flaws in the film make those finer moments difficult, if not impossible, to fully appreciate on the first viewing.

As she progresses, she begins to remember bits and pieces of her life and her doctor suggests  for her to keep a journal. One morning, she discovers a \\"don't trust Ben\\" (her husband) on the cover and so she tries to figure out what that means.<br />  For me, this was a really good suspenseful read. The only thing that bothered me was that I wish there was more of a followup with Christine at the end.

0307473708|4.0|Can I really describe a book about a murderous sociopath as fun? Yes!<br /><br />Dexter is a 30-ish forensics specialist with the Miami police department, who happens to have a Dark Passenger. Some disturbing incident in his early childhood left him different. Only his adopted father Harry can take credit for his seemingly normal appearance. Harry taught him to blend in and use his dark side for the good - to take out those that escape the law. Now that Harry is gone, Dexter only has his sister Deb, a police officer. Together they will chase down a serial killer on the loose in Miami. Who this killer is will surprise you.<br /><br />I admit upfront that I've watched the TV series (thru season 4) and love it. The books are escapist reading with creative language when it comes to the thoughts of Dexter. For instance, his take on the Miami traffic - he feels at peace with the homicidal maniacs driving the freeways.<br /><br />This first book stayed pretty true to the TV series (or the other way around) until about halfway through. Stick it out and see which you prefer.

B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I can't call myself 'addicted' to Angry Birds but I did enjoy playing the game and I did play it for a few hours once it became available on Chrome. It's a good game and, because it's so well designed around touch controls it's even better and more fun on a tablet or phone.<br /><br />These being said, I threw Angry Birds off my XOOM after I noticed that, after at least 2 weeks of not playing the game and numerous tablet reboots Angry Birds was still active, using 3% of my battery resources - on Honeycomb go Settings/Applications/Manage Applications/Battery Use. On XOOM's expected 10-hour life on a full charge, 3% adds up to 18 minutes per charge, used up by a game that I'm not playing. I understand that 'free' usually comes with a price and I have no problem with a little pushed advertising while I'm actually playing the game. I don't understand and I will not allow some third party app to take over my tablet resources without my knowledge while I'm not using it.<br /><br />As for what Angry Birds is doing inside my tablet without my knowledge, I simply don't know. Is it collecting my passwords? Compiling stats on my activity and report them to the mothership? I simply don't know but it IS doing something or it would not drain my battery. By comparison, Android OS, Wi-Fi and Tablet Idle all use 2% and they're actually performing something that benefits me.<br /><br />So, since I don't know how to stop you from lurking inside my tablet... it's got to be 'goodbye Angry Birds' because you're making me nervous.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;
B00280LYIC|5.0|The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 1) -- My son LOVES this book.  The movie is also great!
B003R0LBVW|2.0|I downloaded a preview of this book for the Kindle and I am glad I did so before purchasing the book. Some of my family have raved about it, but the preview was enough to tell me that this book was far too simple and clunky to be worth my money. To be fair, I did read about 3/4 of the preview, so the author clearly has the ability to hook me for that long. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one. I suppose if you don't mind slogging through some extremely dull bits, there might be other juicy hooks further in.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I've had a PS3 for years, but have never actually played an XBox 360. So this controller shape is new for me. I have to say that it feels pretty good. The shape fits my hands nicely, and the textured sides have good grip without being uncomfortable, even during long play sessions. I also like that the USB RF dongle has a USB jack on the front for recharging, although when I tried to plug a USB microphone into it, the mic didn't work.    This controller works just fine for games that don't require high precision, like Lego Star Wars and Toy Story 3. However, first-person shooters are another story. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a noticeable dead zone to the analog sticks. It's not unplayable, but aiming is definitely tougher than with my original Dualshock. Forget trying to play against experts online. Also, the D-pad is very flaky. When playing the hacking minigame in Bioshock, quick movements of the D-pad often register the wrong direction or don't register at all. It's very annoying.    A number of reviewers claim that the sticks on this controller don't have any dead zones, while others write that they're so bad as to be unusable. Opinions on the D-pad seem to vary as well. This leads me to wonder whether there might be QC issues here -- the problem may vary from unit to unit. Give the Pro Elite a try, but be sure to buy it from a store that allows returns.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Disney has a very specific formula that they've stuck to. They would release a film and then years later rerelease it in theaters to a new audience of children that hadn't been around for the previous release to rake in additional revenue. Now they continue this release pattern, and have been doing so, on the home video market. There were the VHS, then came the DVD, the special edition DVD's and now we move on to Blu-ray. So most of us already own this film, and unlike the switch from VHS to DVD there is no major benefit or format difference between DVD and Blu-ray as far as playing the film for children goes. That means that currently the Disney releases are being, or at least should be, aimed at the older Disney fans. The ones who appreciate the story and animation enough to shell out cash to buy a film we already have because it means HD quality, hopefully new special features to sweeten the deal and to be honest for the desire of having it in our collections.     So many parents won't see the point in rebuying this film for the kids while others probably will who didn't have children upon the last release and some new age parents actually like the digital copy for their kids to watch during travel, etc. I think everyone has a grasp on the story of Dumbo, even those who haven't seen it yet have heard enough about it. So then, the real question is whether or not older Disney fans are getting anything new from this purchase if they already own the last release (either the 60th anniversary or the Big Top Edition). Here are the contents of this release for those not in the know to possibly help them better decide:     First and foremost, Dumbo here recieves an HD transfer. From online reviews, and having seen the Mexican import clips, I can say that the upgrade is noticeable. In comparison Bambi for example looked like brand new animation despite its age, Alice in Wonderland also looked better than ever, all the transfers of the older classics so far have had simplymagnificent image quality, Dumbo on Blu is no different than these earler releases. There are some video issues but all seem to be from the original animation, those aside, it looks great, much, much nicer than the DVD versions.     Special Features: These are how I justify my new format purchases, I like there to be some new behind the scenes content to help me justify buying a title I can already watch at my leisure. For example I found it difficult to buy Fox and the Hound on Blu because there were no new special features of any kind, I did buy it but it left a bitter aftertaste.     On a side note, I enjoy how Disney has been labelling its special features on Blu-ray. Classic DVD bonus features are clearly labelled so that I know what I've already seen and can easily find what's new. I'll attempt to do the same here (correct me if I'm wrong).     CLASSIC/HOLD OVER CONTENT     - Celebrating 'Dumbo'   - Original Walt Disney TV Introduction   - Sound Design Excerpt from 'The Reluctant Dragon'   - Trailers for the original release and the later rerelease   - Bonus Shorts (Now in HD) - Bonus cartoons, The Flying Mouse and Elmer Elephant   - Art Gallery     NEW CONTENT   - The Magic of 'Dumbo': A Ride of Passage - a short featurette exploring the theme park ride   - Deleted Scenes (HD) - Two deleted scenes with introductions explaining them and why they were removed   - Taking Flight: The Making of 'Dumbo' (HD) a 28 minute documentary about the Disney studio and Dumbo   - Cine-Explore - Similarly found on the Bambi and Alice in Wonderland Blu releases. This picture-in-picture audio commentary features Pete Docter, Paula Sigman, and Andreas Deja. Meanwhile concept art, clips from other Disney films, vintage photos, interviews with surviving contributors and more are shown or played.   - DisneyView Presentation - gives the viewer the option of replacing the black space on each side of the screen with colorful designs   - About James Coleman (HD, 1 min) - A short featurette about the artist who designed the Disneyview panels for this release     So I hope all that info helps buyers make a more informed decision on whether or not the upgrade to HD is worth it. I will certainly be upgrading, I enjoy the improved image quality but the cine-explore feature and new documentary alone help me justify this purchase. Cine-explore, as I said, is the same feature found on Alice in Wonderland and Bambi that creates a new more interactive form of audio commentary.     On another note I wish Amazon would only include reviews of the actual release being sold on the product page. Too many of these reviews are carried over from the DVD releases and the page will become further cluttered upon release of the blu-ray. Oh well, at least this September I'll finally be able to own Dumbo on Blu after it being delayed months and months. Now lets hope Disney speeds up their releases, so far I've only heard of Lion King and Lady and the Tramp being planned for release in the near future.     **Just to confirm, having now watched it and working on the special features I am very happy with this release and my purchase. This is how all Disney films should be released, new informative special features, beautiful transfer. Magical. Odd though that the Lady and the Tramp and Beauty and the Beast Enchanted Christmas Blu-ray's were not in the main/automatic previews, only in sneak peeks selection, yet Spook Buddies was.

Don't miss the much less famous but equally rewarding and hilarious sequel from the same writer-illustrator team: Hide and Seek with Lovable, Furry Old Grover, published in 1976.

B002HWBS96|4.0|The production is a mix of modern and old, it can confuse and I don't think it adds too much, but it doesn't disturb either. The mirrors probably are very effective on stage. For the screen it can confuse at some times. The most notable effect is having reflections that are out of focus, an effect that doesn't exist when you see it life. Fleming is a great Marschallin, acting and singing. That, by itself, makes this DVD worth it. Hawlata is great in his character as Ochs although musically leaves room for a better voice. The rest of the cast is good and makes the production an enjoyable one. Strauss music talks by itself and the conductor and the orchestra seem to fully understand the composer's intentions and creation. The sound is very good, although at some points the orchestra seems too loud masking the singers. Overall enjoyable, interesting and rewarding. Strongly recommended.

B003ZHVJFA|3.0|It seemed that in the 90's tons of video games that were popular in the 80's were being turned into movies. It was a logical extension as there was tons of action taking place in each game and players were putting themselves into the middle of it. That is as long as the movies were based on first person action games and not things like Tetris. Most of those movies were popular enough with MORTAL KOMBAT going so far as to have a sequel, but the fad died off for a time. It's come back with a vengeance in the past few years and now yields TEKKEN based on the fighting game.<br /><br />The year is 2039 and the world is ruled by corporations rather than governments. The old world fell some years back and the corporations filled the voice, taking over and controlling the masses. What was once the United States is now ruled by the largest corporation of them all, Tekken.<br /><br />But things haven't changed with the exception of walls that divide one social class from another. Outside is a life of poverty and trying to survive, inside a world of luxury and technology. Protecting this way of life are the armed soldiers who rain down on the lower class should they try and move upward.<br /><br />Jin Kazama (Jon Foo) is a young man who works the streets doing everything from stealing for the resistance movement to finding whatever it takes to survive. His mother Jun (Tamilyn Tomita) has done her best with him, training him in martial arts to learn the beauty of it more so than the power. But Jin still has much to learn.<br /><br />When the Tekken soldiers raid the resistance and connect Jin to the latest tech theft, they set out to catch him. Their leader Kazuya (Ian Anthony Dale) makes the decision not to capture anyone in Jin's home but to blow it up instead with Jun and a few soldiers still inside. Jin watches as his mother dies and blames the leader of Tekken, Heihachi Mishima (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) for her death.<br /><br />A chance to get back at Heihachi arrives in a competition known as the King of the Iron Fist. Combatants have been involved for years but there is always a people's choice involved, someone who bests the competitor Marshall Law if they can. Jin enters this street tournament and wins, giving him a chance to go into the city and to become involved in the competition locating him one step closer to Heihachi.<br /><br />The man in charge of the street competition is Steve Fox (Luke Goss) and he joins Jin as his manager. Fox knows the ins and outs of the game, knows the weaknesses of the other fighters and helps Jin to learn his own limitations and how to do better. Their first fight results in a win for Jin and earns him the inquisitive eye of Kazuya.<br /><br />Backstage fighting goes on not just among the fighters but in the house of Tekken as well. Heihachi doesn't believe that Kazuya is ready to take over as the ruler of the house, but Kazuya has no patience to wait for his time. Instead he plots a take over and sets out to follow through with the Iron Fist competition in the background.<br /><br />But wait there's more! Jin has a connection to the Tekken clan that no one is aware of with the exception of Kazuya. And it's one that he doesn't plan on letting anyone else learn about so he sends someone to kill Jin before he can compete again. When that fails, he ousts Heihachi as ruler, takes over and changes the rules of the game. It is now a competition where each fighter can win only with the death of the other.<br /><br />All will be revealed before the final reel and a one on one match between Jin and Kazuya takes place. Who wins? Oh come on, I won't spoil it but you have to know already.<br /><br />The film has a well shot look to it but falls back on the stereotypical \\"end of the world\\" look, a set design that involves combining bits and pieces of scrap metal into homes covered with dirt and grime. It's a set design that's been used since the first Mad Max film and ever since. And inside the city? More gleaming glass and high rises like most films of this kind.<br /><br />The best thing in the film is the fight choreography, set up by Cyril Raffaelli. If you've seen DISTRICT B13 or the sequel then you've seen Raffaelli in action. He does a great job here and will be someone to keep an eye on in the future.<br /><br />The movie itself reminded me of those old game to movie films made in the 90's and if you were a fan of those movies you'll get a kick (no pun intended) out of this one. It's pure escapist action and if that's what you're looking for you'll find it here.the film is the fight choreography, set up by Cyril Raffaelli.

B003B7OUL4|5.0|Clutch's seventh studio album Robot Hive/Exodus was released in 2005 and had the impossible task of following up the band's astounding 2004 album Blast Tyrant. Despite the pressure, Robot Hive' nails it from the attitude filled open to its dreamy close.<br /><br />Neil Fallon impresses as usual with his utterly unique and spectacular vocals and lyrics, which help make Clutch one of the most fun and interesting bands out there. Complex political theory and obscure historical references sit beside bizarre surrealist imagery and odd juxtapositions; all delivered in amazing croons, growls and soulful shouts.<br /><br />The band; now augmented with keyboards, are on top form musically delivering their usual standard of impressive virtuosic moments mixed with the subtle and restrained styles that define them. Big riffs, noodley jams and extremely tight rock beats all sit seamlessly together from an astounding collective of brilliant musicians.<br /><br />The album is one of strong highlights, such as the bluesy slow number `Gravel Road,' which erupts into a gigantic riff after its slide guitar intro, or the heavy and intense `Burning Beard,' which has a furious impact with its dramatically urgent verses. In addition to `10001110101,' which makes amazing use of the band's talents.<br /><br />The album is solid all the way through however, and tracks like `Never Be Moved,' and `Subtle Hustle,' that don't have a definitive handle to instantly identify them by, like `the slow one,' or `the heavy one,' are still a brilliant set of top quality enjoyable rock music, that get better on every listen.<br /><br />In summary; the album is just so masterfully crafted and the arrangements, performances and production are all marvelous making Robot Hive/Exodus an utter joy to listen to. If you like Clutch, get this album.

B0051MKNV8|3.0|There are movies made with fantastic premises that you just want to see. The previews make them out to be something new and original and thrilling. And then you see them and think wow...that was...okay. Unfortunately most movies just don't live up to the hype. Such was the case with LIMITLESS, a good movie but one that just wasn't great.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper stars as Eddie Morra, a down on his luck writer with one mediocre novel published and a case of writer's block. Just when he thinks things can't get worse, his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) dumps him. Walking down the street after she turns him lose, he comes across an old \\"friend\\", the brother of his ex-wife (of one day) Vernon (Johnny Whitworth).<br /><br />Back in the day Vernon was a dealer and Eddie wants nothing to do with him. But he seems cleaned up, cleanly dressed and doing well for himself. During lunch he passes a new drug to Eddie, tells him that it's about to be FDA approved and that it will help him. The drug helps the person taking it use their entire brain potential. While its said human's only use perhaps 20% of their brain, this one kicks in the entire 100%.<br /><br />On his way to his apartment Eddie takes the drug thinking he has nothing to lose and runs into his landlord's girlfriend on the steps. As she berates him for not having the rent, the drug kicks in and he not only talks his way out of the chastising but beds the girlfriend as well. The drug actually works. So much so that Eddie changes his lifestyle, writes the book he was working on in 2 days and it turns out to be perhaps one of the greatest books ever written.<br /><br />Then he comes down off the drug. He finds Vernon to get more and Vernon now has Eddie where he wants him, doing his bidding. Eddie sets out to get Vernon's dry cleaning only to return and find Vernon with a hole in his head and the apartment trashed. Whoever showed didn't get what they came for, Vernon's stash of the drug. But Eddie figures out where it is and becomes a regular user.<br /><br />He gets his life back on track, learns languages in less than a day, wins back his old girlfriend and starts a new life for himself, all with this limited supply of pills. He cashes in on financing, goes to work for his broker and is introduced to one of the top moneymen in the country, Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro). This leads to a job with Van Loon and the chance to turn what he's learned into millions if not billions for the company and himself. It also gives him access to possibly having someone make more of the drug.<br /><br />But it all comes at a cost. The loan shark who gave him the money to invest originally now is taking the drug and wants more. And whoever it was that killed Vernon is trying to find him as well. Eddie has risen from the worst position possible to the highest and yet still has problems, just different ones, ones that could cost him his life.<br /><br />The movie has a terrific look to it, clean and sleek and fast. When the drug kicks in we look through the eyes of Eddie as well as from the outside, seeing that things move so much faster in his mind that the world seems to be in slow motion. And while Eddie's brain increases in capability, he doesn't seek to do harm to anyone but rather intends to do nothing more than take care of himself and those that matter to him. But as they say the best intentions...<br /><br />Cooper does a great job, shifting in acting modes as well as appearances from the down and out Eddie to the more successful one. He carries off the performance well and is completely believable. Cornish feels as if she's just there and DeNiro makes the most of what is essentially a supporting role.<br /><br />For all the great story that is found here it just comes off as a decent flick that doesn't completely fulfill it's potential. Perhaps that's just my expectations not being met, but I just felt that the movie was nothing more than another in a long line of films that are entertaining but not memorable. And honestly, there don't seem to be that many being made any longer.<br /><br />Most will find the movie is an enjoyable film that will keep you guessing until the end. And the ending itself was one of the best I've seen in some time. So if you're looking for a solid movie to rent this week then by all means give this one a try. It may not stick in your mind forever but it will give you a pleasant night watching a movie.y being made any longer.

B004LWZW24|5.0|As most readers by now realize I love horror movies. The problem is that over the past few years there have been so few that I've enjoyed. It seems like these days almost all horror films are remakes or sequels. If they are original they turn out to be more along the lines of horror porn than horror film. Then on occasion you find someone who loves horror movies as well and makes them for that audience. Director James Wan is one of those directors.<br /><br />Wan's career took off with the first SAW film. While many might think this was the first in the horror porn genre (so named because films in that category dwell more on gory realistic effects than anything else like a story) it actually had more story to it than many movies being released at the time. He then made DEAD SILENCE, a creepy film that featured a ventriloquist dummy in the most terrifying manner. And now Wan has turned lose INSIDIOUS.<br /><br />The film opens with a family moving into a new house. Mom Renai (Rose Byrne) writes music in her spare time while juggling taking care of three kids. Father Josh (Patrick Wilson) is a teacher. Both are trying to turn this new home into something special. Instead they find something terrifying.<br /><br />Shortly after moving in their oldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) is lured to the attic by a mysterious force and then falls from a ladder. The next morning Dalton is in a comatose state and the doctors are clueless as to why. Three months later there is no change in Dalton but there is in the house. Something evil lurks there, creeping along in the shadows and seen only by Renai. The visitations increase until she convinces Josh that they need to move, which they do.<br /><br />At their new house things seem brighter and more modern. But the visitations continue, increasing in strength and length. It is at this time that Josh' mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) suggests that a friend of hers come over. Elise (Lin Shaye) is a psychic of sorts who sends her crew in first to check the place out and see if it's legit or not. Sort of a bumbling duo that seems like a spoof of the numerous ghost hunting shows these days, the two find evidence and call Elise in.<br /><br />After a quick examination of the house, Elise confirms that they do indeed have a problem. But she also points out that it isn't the house or the previous house that are haunted. It's their son, Dalton. Now before someone accuses me of dropping a spoiler on them know that this was seen in the film's trailer.<br /><br />What happens next, the visions that are seen and the attempt to rescue Dalton make for a visually frightening film. Add to it a twist that most won't see coming (I didn't) and you have a story on hand that should offer a few nightmares to some and a reason to check the windows at night to others.<br /><br />Wan occasionally uses the old bag of tricks with jump scenes where something pops up out of nowhere. Once in a while the music suddenly blares to let the audience know to pop up out of their seats. But he doesn't rely solely on these tricks to make us scared. He leads us along with an actual story that draws us in, makes us care and eventually has us rooting for this family. Telling a story that scares us, using visuals and not just jump scenes takes an accomplished director and I see that in Wan.<br /><br />The acting turned in here is great. It wasn't until after I sat for a while when the movie was over that I realized we had so little background info on some of these characters. But it didn't matter. They were all played so well that they became believable and you worry more about them than whether or not the actor is doing a good job.<br /><br />Visually this movie is as clean as you can get. Starting with shots in an older home with an attic to a newer more suburban home, both offer some scary shots and scenes that will stick with you. Most horror films shot at night or in the dark tend to go overboard and you can't see what you're supposed to be looking at. Not so with this film, one that hides what needs hidden and yet lets you feel like you're there.<br /><br />As I said, I love horror films. I actually can't recall the last time one made me lose sleep though and this one probably won't do that as well. But it did give me a few scares. And it is one I'll gladly watch again. I never once found myself looking at the clock wondering when it would end. Instead I enjoyed it for the thrill it provided and my guess is you will as well.s hidden and yet lets you feel like you're there.    As I said, I love horror films.

B003Y5H54W|3.0|I didn't know what to expect from this film. I'd read so many bad reviews before seeing it that I knew it couldn't live up to the bad press. I knew that it was directed by Catherine Hardwicke who made the first TWILIGHT movie, a film my wife loves and I find okay. This would be her first film since and her chance to show that her contributions were part of what made that film such a hit. Unfortunately I think it was more of a hit due to the popularity of the books and the hormones of young girls and older women who long for romance that made the film popular.<br /><br />The film takes place in a small medieval village in Europe. Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) is the second daughter of woodcutter Cesaire (Billy Burke) and his wife Suzette (Virginia Madsen). Even though she is the second child, she has been betrothed to Henry (Max Irons), the son of the village blacksmith. Unfortunately for her she's in love with Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), an orphaned young man she's known since childhood who is a woodcutter like her father. But her mother wants her to marry up so Henry it is.<br /><br />Problems begin when Valerie's sister is killed by a werewolf. The town is in an uproar and sets out to take matters into their own hands. They've fed the wolf for years with the best of their flocks and now the truce has been broken. While Father Auguste (Lukas Haas) sends word to the church to send help, the rest of the men head to the caves.<br /><br />Henry's father is killed by the werewolf but they still find their prey. Taking home the head of the wolf, they plan a big party to celebrate. But beforehand help arrives in the form of Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), a famous werewolf hunter whose own wife was killed by one of the beasts. Father Solomon advises them to refrain from the celebration since he claims the head on a stick is that of a wolf and not the werewolf. Of course they ignore him and sure as the full moon rises, the werewolf strikes.<br /><br />Warned that a bite from the werewolf during the blood moon will result in someone becoming a werewolf themselves, when one of Solomon's men is bitten Solomon must kill him in front of his brother. Is it just me or is this pretty obvious set up for something to come down the line?<br /><br />The hunt for the werewolf continues through the film and the list of suspects range from both of the young men Valerie is in love with to quite possibly her grandmother (Julie Christie). When all is finally revealed it is somewhat of a surprise but not a great revelation based on clues we saw earlier. Instead it's just tah dah, here is who the werewolf is and why and why the werewolf has done what it has done.<br /><br />The film looks pretty, I'll give it that, but there are just a few things that feel wrong about it. The first thing I noticed is that the costumes seemed more in line with an Uwe Boll film than a realistic depiction. Everyone seemed to be wearing new clean clothes. Kind of odd for a small village. Unless the village is named Fruit de Loom. The whole set up of the romance reeked of the TWILIGHT experience with two young men in love with the same woman and vying for her hand. When you toss in the term werewolf and it feels even more like that film.<br /><br />As with another film I wrote about this week, THE LINCOLN LAWYER, this film isn't quite terrible. It is a pleasant diversion from everyday life but it isn't a great movie and won't be one that I feel most people will want to watch again and again. It's just light entertainment that some will enjoy and others will tolerate. Horror fans will just be disappointed. But if you're looking for something to pass the time, this one isn't all that bad.ill result in someone becoming a werewolf themselves, when one of Solomon's men is bitten Solomon must kill him in front of his brother.

B004EPYZP8|3.0|Have you ever watched a movie thinking before hand it would be a good movie only to discover that it was just so so once it finished? A movie that just leaves you feeling a bit bland, as if had you not watched it you wouldn't notice it but that you thought was entertaining enough anyway? Such is the case with THE LINCOLN LAWYER.<br /><br />Based on the best seller by Michael Connelly it tells the tale of slick lawyer Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a stereotypical lawyer who will do most anything to get his client off be he guilty or not. Mick is also likely to take his client for as much as he can get while the getting is good. Not the most loveable character you'll find in a movie.<br /><br />Things get odd when Mick takes on a case for bail bondsmen/friend named Val Valenzuela (John Leguizamo). He has a client in need of an attorney, a young and wealthy guy named Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillipe) accused of attempting to rape and beat a young woman. Roulet claims innocence from the start and Mick is willing to take him at his word. Refusing money from his mother to differentiate the client from the witness base, Mick sets out to discover all he can about the case and all involved.<br /><br />Using his best friend and investigator Frank Levin (William H. Macy), he sets out building an alibi for his client. But when he has Frank look into something different, Frank ends up dead and the most likely suspect in Mick's eye is Roulet. The problem is being his attorney Roulet is protected by the lawyer/client privilege. And when ties to a case that didn't set well with Mick years ago start to form, he begins to wonder just who this young man really is.<br /><br />Along the way we meet an assortment of characters to round out the film. Marisa Tomei stars as Maggie McPherson, Mick's ex-wife who works in the D.A.'s office. There are several policemen who don't care for Mick's way of doing things, especially helping criminals evade justice headed by Bryan Cranston. And then there's Earl (Laurence Mason), Mick's chauffer, the man who drives the Lincoln town car that connects to the movie's title. Mick doesn't use an office you see, he spends most of his time in his car.<br /><br />The mystery involved doesn't offer an incredibly difficult plot to follow nor puzzle to solve. Who did what to whom becomes pretty evident early on. The best part of the film deals with Mick's trying to find a way to not break the law by turning in his client and at the same time finding a way to get him convicted of the crime.<br /><br />The performances here are for the most part pretty standard. There is no break out performance to be seen but everyone does a fine job. The cinematography is well done with a few hand held shots that aren't so obnoxious as to get in the way. The direction feels more by the book than anything. As I said, this movie offers a decent mystery but for the most part feels sort of bland. Still, when it comes to a rental its better than a number of movies out there and you just might enjoy it.k's chauffer, the man who drives the Lincoln town car that connects to the movie's title.

0765322889|4.0|I want to start out by saying that, of the 7 books of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series that I've read, I think the Gardens of the Moon is by far the worst.  Now don't stop reading, because this statement becomes meaningful when you realize that Gardens of the Moon is a truly great book...and it just gets better from there.  I intend to review every book in the series, eventually, but...that could take some time after I review number six...and a lot more reading, for now, however, on to the review.    Overall: 7.5-8/10    Gardens of the Moon is probably the easiest read in the Malazan Book of the Fallen.  The TOR version of the book (it was published by both Bantam and TOR, but I have only read the TOR edition) weighs in at a mere 496 pages, that's right, I said mere 496 pages.  I know that this is average length for the majority of fantasy novels (although it is short for `fat' fantasy), but when the average length of a book in a series is 1000 pages, well...you get my point.  Gardens of the Moon is also easier to read because it does not have the same level of social commentary as the rest of the series.    However, the latter is also one of the reasons it gets a lower rating.  In a series that is generally saturated with social commentary, this lack stands out in Gardens of the Moon.  The book also has some issues of compatibility with the rest of the series (it was written in '91, but not published until '99).  While not significant, some of these stand out.    Writing: 7/10    Let me first say that Stephen Erikson's writing is generally excellent.  While his sentence level writing runs the verge between excellent and merely good, his paragraph structure more than makes up for this lack.  This being said, Gardens of the Moon was written long before it was published, and this shows to a certain degree.  While the writing in this book is very good, it could be better (and gets better in his later novels).    Characters: 10/10    Erikson's characterization is far beyond par for your average fantasy novel.  His characters are interesting, believable, detailed, and deep.  Even characters that could be shallow without drawing significantly from the novel (such as Hairlock or Tattersail) are well developed, and pique the readers interest.  Several of the characters in this book are mainstays for the series as a whole (Croaker, Quick Ben, and Kalam in particular), and most of my favorite characters are introduced in this book.    World: 7/10    Again, I wind up comparing Gardens of the Moon to the rest of the series here.  Though Erikson does a great job of presenting Darujhistan, and small portions of Genabackis, in this book, its limited scope significantly impacts the depth of the world that he can present.  While his later books often present large portions of one or more continents, along with the myriad of cultures found in them, Gardens of the Moon is generally limited to a single city and some of the surrounding lands.  While this city is very well presented, the world of this book pales in comparison to the world presented in the rest of the Malazan Book of the Fallen.      Plot: 8.5/10    The plot of Gardens of the Moon is interesting, and draws the reader into the book.  However, it is distinctly separate from the overall plot of the rest of the series and, again, this stands out.  While the Malazan Book of the Fallen series has a generally epic scope into which every novel weaves a significant theme, Gardens of the Moon feels more like a bad prologue to the rest of the series.  While the impact of the book on specific characters is apparent, and significant, throughout the series, the plot of the book itself is very different - and much smaller in scope.  That being said, when taken as a stand alone novel, the plot is interesting, effective, and well-developed throughout the book.  However, with the exception of introduction to certain characters, Gardens of the Moon is not necessary to the larger Malazan Book of the Fallen series.    Pacing: 10/10    The pacing in Gardens of the Moon is excellent.  There was no point at which I felt bored, or questioned why I was still reading the book.  The plot and characters develop well and the reader does not feel rushed into events either.    Commentary: 4/10    As I said above, social commentary is important to me in my fiction and this is one area in which I think Gardens of the Moon is significantly lacking.  While it is obvious throughout the rest of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series that Erikson has a lot to say, about a lot of subjects, this is not evident in Gardens of the Moon.  However, I think that this likely reflects more on the editors and publisher than on Erikson himself (just a guess really).    Conclusion:    Gardens of the Moon is a great book that you will enjoy reading (as long as you like Swords and Sorcery style fantasy anyway), but lacks the deeper value of the rest of Erikson's series.  If you plan to read the entire series, then you should read Gardens of the Moon because it is a necessary introduction to certain characters in the rest of the series, even though the plot of the book is quite seperate.

4770031246|5.0|As a previous reviewer wrote, this is a \\"book for grown ups.\\" It's not kitschy or full of cutesy bunnies and your food won't have a face. But for those of us who prefer single-people lunches that taste good, and allow you to eat a variety without breaking the bank, this is the book to have. Plus you won't have to search for obscure specialty store ingredients; many of these recipes can be completed with stuff you already have on hand. Highly recommended.
1451629184|5.0|I love the book.  However, it broke my heart reading it.  I don't think I had the courage to read it again.  What happened to Jaycee, to me I think it's one of most tragic incident everyone in the world can ever encounter. Hardly no one can ever complain his or her life being not fair.  In my opinion, if Jaycee can survive from this kind of tragety, everyone in the world can survive whatever difficuty in his/her life.  I felt like having more bounding with my kids now.  I love my life more and appreciate all I have.  I highly recommend the book.

1932100660|5.0|This book was a startling wake up call. The findings that a whole food, plant based diet prevents virtually ALL chronic diseases was enlightening.  I always knew that processed foods caused obesity and it's related diseases but I didn't know that this plant based diet also helped prevent cancer by reducing protein content in the diet.  Who would have guessed?    After this book and the work of Dr. Joel Fuhrman who uses it's findings, I have changed my diet dramatically and have cut down on protein drastically.  I already lost some weight after 3 weeks on the diet.    A very interesting read for anyone concerned with their health.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Truly awesome series.  I've shared it with my entire family and they all love it.  Can't wait to get Season 2 in the mail.
B0050PYNOY|1.0|I just saw this movie the other night and I was hoping for something funny.  I liked Pineapple Express enough for what it was, but holy crap this thing is bad.  There wasn't a single part of it that was funny.  Had potential but blew it.  Pass

0553801473|4.0|This is a great book, don't get me wrong. Comparisons to Tolkein are not apt- George Martin is way more entertaining and flexible. But this book is not quite up to the Song of Fire and Ice standard. This almost feels like a spaceholder- there are some riveting spots, but it doesn't have the front to back intensity of Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings and Storm of Swords.

B004EPYZUI|1.0|I like Zack Snyder, I really do. But it appears he's only good at adapting other material into films. When it comes to his original ideas, they don't translate well into film. I adored his director's cut of \\"Watchmen\\" and his vision for \\"300\\" but \\"Sucker Punch\\" is a film I wish to forget.    I saw his panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic Con and was excited for the film. I should've known better. I was told by moviegoers to not have any expectations going into this film because they would be crushed. I waited until the home video release and was so glad I only paid $1.50 at Redbox instead of $10 at the theater (even at $1.50, I feel cheated).     First off, the story is incoherent and not interesting at all. You don't connect with the characters nor care about them. The plot is a bore and most of the movie I was rolling my eyes and would rather stick my head between my legs than continue watching. The only good parts are the \\"dance\\" sequences where there's action and that's not saying a lot. There's not a lot to be said about the film other than it's cinematic garbage and one of the worst things to come out of Hollywood. Name any movie and it's probably better than this.     I hate to say these things about Zack Snyder's movie but I just can't justify why anyone should watch this film. I haven't found one person who liked this movie and don't ever expect to (unless you're insane).
0553801473|5.0|I was pleased to go on with the series which I started during the first HBO season. This book was harder to read with new characters and such a distance in events from the fourth book in the series. Now that I am two thirds through the book \\"abandoned\\" plot lines are re-entering the tale. The read is getting quicker, more interesting and leading to the inevitable unfinished ending. Now I will have to wait years until the tale has some resolution. I have been able to read this series uninterrupted for several months but must face the inevitable HARRY POTTER yearly limbo. Come on George R.R. chain yourself to the desk like a proper maester!
0670022411|5.0|I'm very relieved I didn't read ANY reviews before I decided to purchase this book. It's always fascinating how the same words can be read completely differently by diferrent people.     I wanted it solely because it was something to do with witches, and I needed a good witch drama. I was a little wary at the mention of a vampire, as I'm seriously vampired out, but I liked 'em here! I didn't find the book a slow start at all- lots and lots of details that I knew needed to be understood for the context of the story. In fact, I had intense difficulty putting the book down. I didn't find it to be rambling or randomly knit together as some have stated. All details are cohesive and have an early explainable reason. Glory about reading on a kindle is that you can search for the first mention of something and go, oh yes, it was already explained. I happen to prefer a powerful and smarter-than-me story that makes me think and causes me to look deeper into things, and because this book is so huge and is packed with so much information and references to things most of us have never even heard of, I used 'Search', dictionaries, and wikipedia quite a bit. As well as a French-English dictionary. And I liked it! :P     Don't pay too much attention to reviews. I picked up the book at a store simply due to its alarming weight and intriguing title and figured it had to be good, forgot what its premise was supposed to be about but bought it on kindle anyway, and was not at all dissappointed.
0802130208|3.0|Worthy of a Pultizer? Not in my opinion. But I have read much worse. Over all, mildly amusing and kind of sad with one or two laugh-out-loud moments. A fair read, but I would only suggest it for those who have an interest in reading modern works that lean toward the literary.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|It took me hours to finally pick a cover for my new Verizon white Iphone! There are THOUSANDS to choose from. I had seen the metallic looking ones and thought they looked cool and sleek, but then reviewers said the color chips off. Otter boxes are just too bulky. I wanted something that was hard, but not hard plastic that could break or came in two pieces. I didn't want silicone or anything that would catch fur/hair/lint or obstruct from a quick insert into my pocket. I guess what I really wanted was a cover that would protect from drops, but not add bulk to my phone, and yet have a nice design that showed off the design of the phone.    This case fits the bill! It is a clear firm rubber, that is very transparent. The lip that comes up over the top of the phone gives a great amount of protection to the front. The circular design on the back is nice. It is not paint, it is actually carved on the inside of the cover. It has openings for the volume, mute and on/off switch. I like that personally. I have heard other cases can push down on the buttons if they are snug. This avoids that issue. This rubber will not end up stretchy like some of the silicone cases.     The screen protector was a joke. The little plastic piece they send along for removing bubbles actually scratched it all up. Do yourself a favor and get a Zagg. They can be pricey, but they are indestructible, don't cause glare and resist smudging. Sign up for their mailing list and you'll end up with a 50% off coupon at some point. I am not even basing my rating on this dinky after-thought of a screen protector. It is solely based on the case only. LOVE IT!
1451629184|5.0|This heart wrenching memoir is a true statement of human strength, Jaycee came through such a hard ordeal and had the guts to write about and live again the terror that she faced at the hands of two selfish and heartless beings. Although her writing can sometimes seem juvenile, keep in mind that her education stopped at age eleven and she was pretty much self taught from that moment out. The story is full on and doesn't skip a beat or flinch over details. She tells it raw and how it happened to the best of her ability. From the moment she was captured to the moment she was finally discovered. Her journey was one of pain and struggling, having to come to decide between escaping and the fate in which her daughters could possibly face. She suffered years and has emerged a loving, beautiful young woman and mother. Pick it up, if only to support this strong woman, it is well worth the read. This gut wrenching memoir will have you turning the page right up until the last one. Delve into this with an open mind, understand that she is telling it how it was, and this was not manipulated in any way by editors. She shows her true courage through replaying this chapter of her life, and I hope she can move on and that she and her family can enjoy the rest of their lives together.
B00002DEGZ|1.0|This looked like it would be a terrific collection, but since receiving it: It's disappointing.<br /><br />The orchestra is lush. The forte piano sounds like a toy piano occasionally breaking into the lush, orchestra sound. So, let's say you are in the spa with the pump running and the spa stereo going. The orchestra sounds great. Suddenly you realize you can BARELY hear it anymore. You have to turn the volume up and there, softly, is the tink-tink-tink of the forte piano, which is massively overwhelmed whenever the orchestra kicks in.<br /><br />Now imagine NINE CDs with that going on. I can barely stand listening. If this sounds plausible, I highly recommend a recording set with a normal, modern piano. It might not be \\"authentic,\\" but at least it won't be massively disconcerting.<br /><br />UPDATE: After 3 years, I finally couldn't stand it anymore. I did a web search for \\"best recordings of Mozart complete piano concertos.\\" I found a number of reviewers who said the same thing I did. Example: \\"There are several outstanding recordings of Mozart's piano concertos and you can't go wrong with any of them (except the ridiculous toy-piano Bilson recording.\\" 'Nuff said.<br /><br />I traded my \\"like new\\" Bilson collection to amazon yesterday and bought an Alfred Brendel recording of them with Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. My long Mozart nightmare is over. A real, lush piano recording.
0071762345|5.0|In the spirit of transparency and full disclosure I would like to start out saying I work for Likeable Media. However, this does not change how I would review this book anyway. Apart from being clear and well written, the best word to describe this book is inspirational. When you read it, it makes you feel like you want to immediately go home, open up your computer, and explore for yourself all of the great things that book introduces you to. Also, I love that it is accessible to many different target audiences. I work in social media and live and breathe Facebook/Twitter/Foursquare/etc. every day working at Likeable Media, yet I learned so much about marketing and client relations. In the same vein, my mom read the book (she doesn't even have a Facebook) and she called to tell me she finally \\"got it\\"- she understood at last what I meant when I said I worked in social media. Lastly, my favorite aspect, is that author Dave Kerpen really is a social media fanatic and always open to conversation on Facebook, Twitter, email, anything!
B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|I prefer artist that take risk. the same kind of sounds over and over again does not make me happy. I saw a lot of bad reviews saying bad things about this album because they have changed. I got it regardless. the point is this they have changed and they are still good. I feel Keane is not meant for superficial people. If you are interested in that kind of music there is plenty to chose from.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|This story made me experience every emotion possible.  I laughed. I cried. I was mad. I was frustrated. I was nervous. I was devastated.  A great group of characters that were all well developed and the story was amazing written.  Would highly recommend.
B000SSPL2Q|5.0|The recording is beautiful. The Gothenburg orchestra is magnificent, metals shine (resemble those of the Chicago Symphony and the Orchestra of the Concertgebouw).   BUT WHERE IS THE BOOKLET? An edition of DG 50th anniversary of Sibelius, without comment on his works, with no indication of when and where the recordings were made? And those beautiful pictures of who and where are they? As a consumer I can only classify this fault as unforgivable.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|This book strays quite a bit from the typical Reacher formula, so it is understandable that is is getting lower reviews.  Overall I thought it was a good book, and it appeared to be the authors attempt to not have a slavish adherence to the Reacher formula.  Don't worry, he still head-butts some fools and engages in his usual cavemanish proclivities, but the story is more nuanced and has less overall tension.  At this point nobody who reaches Reacher novels ever worries for Reacher's safety (dude is bulletproof, after all), but generally there is someone else in the story we care about and we aren't sure whether they will make it.  This book kind of lacks that element.<br /><br />I didn't think it was overly political.  It was more topical than the prior books, but with Reacher's background I thought his behavior was consistent with his character.<br /><br />I've gotten enough mileage out of the Reacher novels that I figure I am going to read them all, even if a few are are bit slow.
B004LROMSO|5.0|I watched the entire series and loved every minute of it.  It provided a Dark Side to the Arthur story instead of just having everything be peaches and cream which honestly is the way it was in medieval times which is again why i am a fan of it.    This series is extremely good, well thought out, and the cinematics of it all are well worth a watch with the bonus of the story.
B001P9KR94|4.0|I just got around to watching this.  It was very good, although only worth watching once.  This was a clear attempt to explore the Indians and their culture.  Years ago, they attempted a \\"latin fever\\" in order to sell people on that.  However, that was just a forced-fed fad that only lasted a year.    East Indians are a very private and somewhat mysterious group.  They tend to keep to themselves, are usually highly educated (via books only), amass great wealth (which they keep on the low) and their numbers and wealth continues to increase, at least in the US.  Like all groups who were not known - seen, but not heard, Indians want to finally become visible.  So-called \\"latin\\" culture like East Indian cultures can never become an attractive sell to western audiences.  While you can take a little of this and a little of that, most of it is unattractive in many ways.      With films like this and many Indians doing film and TV, it appears as if they would like to come out of their shells.  This happens when groups gain wealth and status within another society.  At first you just want to live, then you want to live well, then after you live well you want to be credited with living well!  This is good and I cannot knock the Indian commitment to education (on the books) and plans to gain and KEEP wealth, as it has more than worked.  They need to share some plans with African-Americans instead of being so secretive.    So now, films like this and other TV and films help to shine light on East Indians - albeit in a European light, as opposed to an untouched version of Indians, which brings me to my next observation about the film.  First, it is no shocker that India started out black and then was invaded by white or white-like peoples referred to as Aryans and now called Hindus.  These people imposed an apartheid system in India thus keeping the blacks on the bottom and the white-like people at the top.  It has been that way it is still that way, although the more mixed onesmove up since the top is getting darker.  Then you had the British and their racist ways which follows the Indian until this day.    So, now my observations...  There are two brothers.  One is darker and one is lighter.  One (the darker one, Salim) has African type facial features and curly hair and the other has a narrower nose with straight hair.  From the start, Salim is more aggressive, heartless, greedy, selfish and not concerned with education.  The other brother is calm, caring, selfless, loving and cares about people.  It COULD be a coincidence that the lighter one is essentially \\"good\\" while the darker one is essentially \\"bad,\\" but I am sure someone will argue against it.    As the film progresses, Salim becomes more embroiled in \\"thug life\\" and gangsta life while the other is always calm and loving and cares about the world around him.  Salim is ALWAYS thinking about crime, sex and drugs.  His hair also becomes more curled as the film goes on too!  Of course, Salim had to rape Latika while the other brother wanted love!  So, you throw in drugs, aggression, rape, crime, dark skin, African features AND curled hair - I am left with no choice but to think that this character was designed to emulate or give the audience thoughts about an African-American stereotype of criminality as opposed to an Indian.  The other brother (lighter with STRAIGHT hair) is shown to embody the righteousness in Indians.      I could be wrong (I doubt it), but if they are brothers, how both of their hair was not curled of straight?  How come the brothers features were not consistent?  I just thought I'd point this out as this is another trick in Hollywood and Indian films.  I have noticed in Indian themed films, they seem to do what they can to separate themselves from the black family and unite with the whites.  Let's see...  There was \\"Bend it Like Beckham\\" where light-brown Indians were cast to contrast the very dark African or Jamaican in the film.  Of course they had to mention that \\"those\\" people are black while not mentioning their own blackness.  Instead, they act is if the whites are their people!  That casting was done on purpose.  Then you had Mississippi Masala with Denzel Washington.  He was darker than the Indians although they get much darker than he does.  It was to make the people \\"called\\" blacks appear to be black and separate from others in the black family.  In fact, I cannot think of any film where there are Indians and African type blacks where the Indians are shown as darker than the \\"blacks.\\"  This is clear propaganda.    Aside from that social commentary, it was a good film.  I just do not understand why the light brother stayed in love with the girl all of those years.  You mean to tell me that he did not have sex since she first left?  If he had, he would not have kept thinking about her.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|I wanted to buy good quality microphone for my 6 years old daughter for her singing performance. Didn't want to go with expensive \\"Shure\\" brand.

You won't go wrong.

B000S0GYRU|4.0|Yes, I am prejudiced.  I like the movies of Dario Argento, most them at least, and Suspiria is at the top of the list.  The movie is no holds barred and probably shocking to those who have never seen it.  The traditional garish colors are there bringing us into his world of horror.  The deaths are violent and the movie gave Argento a reputation for being a misogynist.  The music is jarring (soundtrack by Goblin).<br />The plot centers around the magical forces threatening an American student Susie Banyon at a school of dance.  Mystery piles upon mystery.  Curious friends are murdered.  In the end, it is up to Susie to challenge and destroy the evil overshadowing the tall, imposing school of dance.<br />The directing is first rate.  The plot leads nicely to the conclusion.  And Jessica Harper does a wonderful job of not overacting and showing the pluck she will need to overcome the magic.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand By Me is based on the Stephen King Novella, \\"The Body,\\" where a group of 4 boys venture out to find the remains of a dead kid named Ray Brower. Despite the morbid plot, don't let it discourage you from seeing this film (Even if you're squeamish of such themes). More importantly, the boys are venturing out to discover themselves. This film explores the friendships that kids have at the age of 12-13, and the transition they make from innocence to loss of innocence. The best way I can describe this movie is haunting. Although I was 2 when this movie was out in theaters, I can imagine that the audience walked out quietly at the end of this film. Although one of my absolute favorite films of all time, I can only watch it occasionally as it stirs up many emotions about my childhood.     This film also has incredible scenery of Oregon, an awesome soundtrack, and contains some of the most talented young actors. River Phoenix is an incredible actor, and I think it's his best performance. Yes, there is some foul language, but I don't think it takes away from the movie at all.     Highly recommended
0553801473|4.0|I have been reading some discussion forums concerning the quality of the higher rating from this book, so I'm going to try and walk the fine line between answering the complaints about the book, telling you why I liked it and not giving away every freakin' detail in the book. Its long, can't be helped, try to keep up.<br /><br />1. \\"The book it too long and isn't fast enough paced\\": what did you expect? Its about a major war covering an entire continent. For those who compared it to the length of the Lord of the Rings, that story involved like nine people and Tolkien could get pretty wordy. This book involves HUNDREDS of people, even when you aren't hearing their voices. And wars take time, especially in medieval Europe. Most battles in this type of setting ended one of two ways, either you killed the leader, in which case everyone gave up (hence the importance of banners so people knew when to quit), or they were incredibly long sieges which usually only ended once one side or the other had been starved into submission. In which case, most of the war was waiting.<br /><br />2. \\"Are we there yet?\\": Again, what do you expect? In order to get to point B from point A, you have to journey. These journeys often don't do smoothly and there are often side trips. Like the Tom Bombadil story (again for those who like to compare GRRM to Tolkien). These journeys should NOT be skipped however, because it is in these moments that characters stop, reflect, think and GROW. Yes, battles are more interesting and energizing, but how many deep thoughts can a character have while in battle? For that matter, how many battles can they have before it just gets foolish? It is this \\"I want it NOW\\" action-crazed audience that led \\"7 Samurai\\" from being a fabulous, 208 minute movie into \\"The Magnificent 7\\" which was a tacky western of half the length and then onto a bad TV show that didn't make three seasons. Most people couldn't sit through the team actually getting put together and journeying together because they thought it should have been done in a musical montage or something<br /><br />3. \\"He should have/his editor should have/if he'd only cut...\\": Oh shut up. If you don't like it because its too long, tell us you thought it was too long and don't read the next one. Even better, get out of the backseat yourself and prove you can drive. Go write 5k words and listen to everyone tell YOU that you took too long, they didn't like how you took the story and they could have done better.<br /><br />So why DID I like it? I'll be honest, in places I didn't. Daenerys annoys me. There are too many bleeping characters and I have trouble with names. My geography is too bad to keep track of where everyone is even with the maps. Hence, four stars, not five. HOWEVER, Daenerys annoys me, despite the fact that she is supposed to be one we are rooting for. WOW! A book where I don't have to like the good guy! More like \\"Thomas Covenant\\" than the Hobbit! Reek was horrible but...ooo...now I kinda feel bad for him.  Still wish he'd die, but now out of pity. The Dwarf is the BOMB! He's witty, boinks hot chicks, runs circles around his siblings, tamed wild men and has great taste in wine.  But hey, now he's kinda useless for everything but pig riding. Which bring us to the end point. This is the ONLY series I have ever read where ALL the characters are imperfect, three dimensional, subject to change and prone to sudden death syndrome. And wasn't that what grabbed us in the first book? Ned's death? The sudden DIFFERENCE of it all? Not every book can have that \\"reach out and grab you by the throat\\" attitude. Like the battles, its gotta calm down sometime. In this case, the difference, and the growth are slower and more subtle. To expect everyone to change overnight in a flash of inspiration is ridiculous.<br /><br />And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he is a \\"paid by the word\\" guy. Maybe he's just lost it. Who knows. The answer is I DON'T. If you don't like the book, fine. I do. But don't act like you have a clue where the series is going or what the author is thinking, because you don't. And neither do I, so I'm gonna keep reading.<br /><br />For those who want to judge the quality of my review, have at.  I am NOT a writer and don't pretend to know how to write prose. If I did I'd be too busy spending the next five years trying to come up with a story to top my LAST book, all the while knowing that if I have a slow spot in the tale I'm gonna be crucified. Why is it taking so long for GRRM to write these books? Probably because the stress to stay perfect is giving him writer's block!t don't act like you have a clue where the series is going or what the author is thinking, because you don't.

055357342X|5.0|The crazy plot twists never end with George R.R. Martin's writings. This is by far my favorite out of the series and was extremely entertaining. Don't let the size of this novel fool you; it will go by very quickly and anyone that has read the previous books will know from experience will know Martin's style of writing makes reading easy. Can't wait to see HBO produce this as the third season!

He ends up getting expelled and sent to a camp where he finds out he is the son of Persidon (which would be a shock all on it's own),then he's accussed of stealing Zues' Lightning bolt and ends up facing furies & other monsters in his quest to find it and return it back to Zues.<br />If all that wasn't enough for a 12 year old to go threw he has to try and rescue his mother Hades who has her in the firey depts of Hell.<br />If your looking for a fun,exciting adventure story to read this is the one for you.I recommend to to everyone, it's an absolutely brilliant piece of work by Rick Riordan.

Over the last 2 years I had picked it up so many times in book stores but I always put it back on the shelf, Then I found out it was being made into a movie I raced to my library and borrowed a copy, came home and jump right in.<br /><br />I have only one thing to say WOW!!<br /><br />This book has you sitting on the edge of your seat right from the first page, it grabs you and won't let go, it's that good. It has a bit of everything in it from action to romance even comedy. I was so hooked that I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />After I finished reading it I went straight on Amazon and bought the next 2 books, which should be arriving in the next week or two.<br /><br />Suzanne has written one hell of a novel and I'm excited to read the second and third parts.<br /><br />AN INCREDIBLE READ!!

0920668372|1.0|I got this book as a gift.  It starts out really sweetly with a mother rocking her baby and singing to him how she'll love him forever.  Although the baby grew to be a toddler who sometimes drove her crazy, she would still rock him and sing the song.  It continues through his life phases.  Eventually her son is a grown man living across town. The mom sometimes sneaks over in the night (with a ladder tied to her car), crawls through his window, and still rocks him.  It wasn't a big shock that there was no mention of a spouse for either the mom or her son.  This book could be subtitled...how to create an Oedipal Complex.
B003Y8YXGM|5.0|I was a huge Beatles fan, and still am. I followed the Beatles into their solo careers. When I first listened to Walls And Bridges I felt it was probably around a B grade for Lennon, with Plastic Ono Band and Imagine being the A grade albums and Mind Games and Double Fantasy being B grades along with Walls and Bridges.     Fast forward 20/30 years later, and I bought Walls and Bridges mostly so my kids, who have become avid Beatles fans, could hear another example of a solo album by a former Beatle. John's albums have actually withstood the test of time very well. As you can see I've decided to give Walls and Bridges 5 stars.     Walls and Bridges came out at a time in Lennon's life sometime AFTER his lost period in California. The musicianship is of a very high caliber, and there is his only number one single in Whatever Gets You Through The Night. That song--partly due to Elton John's input and vocals--is one of Lennon's most loved tunes. But what surprised me is how much the rest of this album has withstood the test of time. There are so many gems in this album, like Bless You, #9 Dream (one of my all-time favorite Lennon songs), and Steel And Glass.     This album has more of a contemporary feel than any of Lennons other solo albums. That's saying a lot, but needless to say, John Lennon was a genius at times musically. His solo albums almost inevitably make me wonder how great the Beatles may have been had they stayed together. But this album was created from some pain Lennon was going through in California. The backing musicians are stellar. Jim Keltner's drumming is some of his best and almost all of his drumming is incredible.     I feel Walls and Bridges is as good as any of John Lennon's albums as a first solo album to buy for a listener new to John Lennon's solo music. Highly recommended.
B001TAFCBC|5.0|I watched this for free via my Amazon Prime Membership and I absolutely loved it!  In fact, I liked it so much that I immediately bought the 2-disc DVD set.  It is a wonderful movie with many twists and turns.  On top of all that, it mentions my hometown (Rockville Centre).  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.  However, I would give one word of caution: this is not your typical Jim Carey slap-stick type comdey.  So, if you like (or are expecting) that sort of thing, you may be disappointed.
1451629184|5.0|This is a remarkable book about an optimistic and brave woman, who lived a nightmare for 18 years.  The book is riveting, and hard to put down. The abuse she endured is  gut-wrenching, but knowing the positive outcome, I was able to read through.  Today, she is a free woman, going forward with her life, and protecting her own daughters.  She is truly a survivor.
B000784WMW|5.0|This version was amazing and the acting and cast was GREAT and it was as close to the book as I have seen. I was surprised at how close they followed it to the book. Timothy Dalton was way too goodlooking to play Rochester but I am glad he was picked because he really did a great. But I still liked the 2006/2007 masterpiece theatre version with Toby Stephens the best. This Timothy Dalton version kind of made me feel like I was watching a soap opera, or has that soap opera feel to it. I think. But I really did enjoy it and I am getting the dvd after watching it on netflix.
0062060554|4.0|This story will have you scared to go to sleep at night! I thought about the plot for several days after I finished. This book will definitely hold you to the pages, ignoring your life until you are done with it. The only down side to the writing is the use of profanity, specifically the \\"mother of all bad words\\", and it is used a lot. I do not think the story was enhanced in any way because of it. But, that is my personal peeve in books. However, it was a very clever story line that threw in a great twist at the end.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|George Clooney, once again, redefines the thriller genre with The American. If you are looking for a typical Hollywood thriller with chase scenes and the obligatory love triangle, this movie is not for you. The American throws all the cliches out the window. The best way I can describe this movie is to use analogies borrowed from the field of painting. If you are familiar with the portrait painter John Singer Sargent you will have an upper leg on understanding this review. The American is the equivalent to cinematic impressionism. The Sargent of filmmaking, bordering on minimalism. This movie appears, on its surface, to be very simple. And that's its intent. It's simplicity is its beauty. The story is filmed and told with incredible economy of means. Each stroke is a drawing stroke and has a purpose. The movie simplifies every detail. No shot is overdone. Each line of dialogue has a purpose. There are no overdone and cliche chase scenes. Its simplistic nature is its charm. This is a very intelligent thriller. Thematically perhaps not original but this movie's beauty is its construction. The priest tells Clooney's character that Americans believe they can escape their past. This in a nutshell is what the movie is about. Clooney attempts to escape his past and his history - for love. But he cannot do this. It's impossible to escape the sins of his past. Great movie. Film programs will love this movie. It is rare indeed to see movies like this. European in style. It's a good thing The American doesn't have the feel of an American film.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|I would say \\"you get what you pay for\\" however a sharpening stone is just as cheap but will last far longer and do a better job overall. There are some good points though:<br /><br />Sharpens smaller blades nicely, like pocketknives and multitools.<br />Carbide sharpener is very good for  extremely dull blades.<br />Diamond coated sharpener is pretty good- for serrations, hook cutters, scissors.<br />Compact & light, ideal for packs and emergency kits.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Useless for large knives.<br />Ceramic sharpeners wear down very quickly.<br /><br />Overall, it's only good in a pinch for small thin blades and serrations, and obviously better than no sharpener at all. Best to invest $60 in a ceramic rod sharpening system to maintain your valuable tools most effeciently. I'm seriously considering returning it.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|A very pleasing and intelligent program. I watched the first season in two days and wanted more.  I will be purchasing the second and third seasons soon.
B0051MKNV8|3.0|The plot of this movie is simple. A man takes pills that unlocks 80% of his brain that regular humans don't use. To me, it's a very catchy plot, because who doesn't want that? The story picks up right off the bat, and for the first 30 minutes or so, it moves quite nicely. However, it fall into a slump for about 40 minutes, where, to tell the truth, I was bored out of my mind, and was thinking about shutting it off. However, it redeems itself with an entertaining chase through the park, and a house robbery. All in all, it was \\"OK\\". 3 stars is good enough for this film
B00095NX9G|5.0|I'd say this is the best bellydance instructional video I've seen. I have always been one for drills, and this has 'em. The instructions are clear and concise, and charmingly given with little smiles and encouraging dialogue.    Not only is La Brice a fabulous dancer, but she's an excellent teacher.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|The music of John Williams is truly inspirational and moving. His music adds another dimension to movies, giving it that background of soul and heart. During ET, as the spaceship lifts from the ground at the end, we hear that swell of instruments and the final chords, and it never fails to bring a tear to my eye. In others such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones, we hear the adventure. In Close Encounters we hear the mystery. In Schindler's List we hear the pain and suffering of the Jews. If you haven't caught on, I'll just simply state that his music is amazing. This CD comprises his best, and in my opinion, he is the best there ever is, and ever will be. As someone once said to me, \\"Hans Zimmer is a musician. John Williams is a musical genius!\\" Truer words were never said.
B0051OZ564|1.0|This film asks a very important question - does a movie really need a plot?  After pondering upon the matter for two hours, during which I was subjected to a noncohesive sequence of CGI scenes, I think I can safely conclude that, indeed, it does.  Further inquiry would reveal that some presence of acting aptitude might have a distinct impact on one's viewing experience.  The title is clearly a cruel pun directed at the viewer and the dialogue appears to have been written by a trained monkey using an Etch a Sketch while she was actively participating in a feces fight. I recommend that instead of watching this video game you just play one or rent a decent film. Either one.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is about a little boy and his encounters with a small alien who is accidentally left on Earth. From there, the plot may sound kiddish and a bit boring, but that is the most ridiculous thing anyone could ever say about this movie. As a 15 year old boy, there are very few movies that bring out raw emotions in me, and by that I mean make me cry. E.T. stands as one of those movies that make me cry every time. There's so much I could say about this movie, but I would just be rambling. I tip my hat to Spielberg, but also to John Williams, whose music really lifts the picture that extra mile. At the end *SPOILER* when ET's ship lifts off the ground and we see the kids for one last time, those last chords that are played are what get my tears flowing. It's just a beautiful movie, with beautiful music. An all around classic and terrific movie!

B003UYV08E|3.0|Plenty of action. Plenty of drama, partying, flirting. But it lacked the heart of the first film (pardon the pun) and felt more choppy and predictable. There was one very satisfying relational moment, but other than that, I felt pretty indifferent and glad I didn't hand over the moulah to see it in the theater. I'd suggest trying before buying.

B002CAWNEM|2.0|Not that you didn't know it based on the title and the cover art, but it's an updated version of Fatal Attraction.  Save for some major holes in the plot, it was an ok movie.  The problem is that it was done before and they did it better the first time because there weren't so many holes in the plot.    Derek has everything - a good job, nice home, a beautiful wife (Beyonce Knowles, no less!), good friends, and a baby.  One day he gets a new temp in his office, Lisa.  She was blue one day because she was having some man troubles, Derek comforts her, and she becomes obsessed with him - showing up places where he is and then living in a fantasy world that they are having an imaginary affair.  His wife Sharon, however, does not remain living in ignorant bliss, but will confront Derek and kick him out of their house for months when she learns that he and this woman may have had an affair.  And in the end, as in Fatal Attraction before, there will be confrontation between the wife and the mistress.    If he had actually had an affair with the obsessed woman, it would have made a bit more sense.  If Lisa had a past history of behavior (even by something as lame as finding a box full of newspaper clippings), one would have realized that she was very unstable, then perhaps debate \\"So he made a mistake\\".  But Derek never makes a mistake, he rejects her outright and every other attempt she makes towards him.  Sharon (his wife) naturally thinks that something is amiss and becomes furious.  Understandable, but she does not really grapple with things when she realizes that her husband did not, in fact, cheat.      It's an ok movie, not horrible by any means.  But don't hold your breath that this is a new innovation.
0307887960|5.0|I'm 51 years old and I lost 5 lbs the first week.  I look like I've lost more. The Dukan Plan has helped me to realize what foods I need to either delete from my meals or what I need to hold back on. I'm one of those individuals that can get away with eating perhaps one meal a day and yes I couldn't understand why I couldn't lose weight.  Yes I know what I would read about skipping meals, but I also was exercising regularly. I don't feel hungry at all!  I'm still in the Cruise phase and will continue until I've reached my goal. I'm glad I bought the book and it was at a fantistic price.
B002ZG9968|4.0|Alex O'Loughlin makes this movie...totally. It is hard to believe him with JLo. It is an odd pairing. I have never been impressed with Jennifer Lopez as an actress and she seems totally out of place in this movie. I can see why she wanted to make it to appear with Alex, but it was a let down after watching his chemistry with other actresses. It is 4 star just to watch him, but otherwise a let down.
B000002IAS|3.0|I'm always been a fan of Delaney & Bonnie. I must be to love them like I do without ever having any of their music that was recorded really well. I generally prefer studio recordings because the energy & spontaneity possible from live recordings usually (to me)just comes across as the band just jamming as fast and loud as they can which is a hoot if you're there, but is rarely captured in a recording.    Truly gifted muscicans (such as E. Clapton & Bonnie B.) and vocalists (such as D. Bramlett)can really get it across more effectively when they can take their time to fully develop every note, tone & chord. These are capable of much more than I hear on this cd.    That being said, if I lost my copy, I'd get another.
B00005JPO1|5.0|This Movie really divides people, mainly due to peoples expectations of it.  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a good movie. I love the movie. seeing as how this film is set in the late 1950s Indiana Jones is also in his late 50's. Good news he still kicks butt like Indiana Jones but the great irony lost on the people who are divided on this film is the fact that Indiana Jones has also transformed into his father. If you watched Young Indiana Jones or read into the conversations in The Last Crusade you know Indy really detested his father nearly his whole life. The fact he transforms into the professor is highly symbolic of the son becoming the father. The movie is sort of an homage to the 50's sci-fi era of Hollywood while still being an Indiana Jones adventure flick, hence the title of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's really nice that they made another Indiana Jones movie for the fans and as one of those fans I hope they make at least one more before Harrison Ford becomes too old to do this type of stuff. if I gave this movie a rating it would be 10 out of 10 because it delivers on the promise of it's title. It is a good movie just like the originals. just because it is not the greatest of the four theatrical movies does not mean it is not among the greatest movies ever made. The title Indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull is iconic, just like Raiders of the Lost Ark. If you watch the movie you will see that the filmmakers were having a ball. Fans of Uncle scrooge will notice a couple of homages in the story. Perhaps the newer generation will regard this movie a masterpiece like I regard the Temple of Doom a masterpiece, who knows?
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This movie is a classic - a no holds barred, brilliantly funny film that also has amazing production values.  I won't even attempt to describe the plot, because the more you don't know the better.  The way Ben Stiller skewers the film industry is absolutely a bullseye, and all of the performances by the principles are phenomenal.  Just watch it - if you don't think this is hilarious then seek professional help or start smoking weed (unless you're under 18, in which case you won't need to).
B003VYAX2W|5.0|If you haven't heard of Volbeat this is a good starting point. Their mix of all sorts of styles of music makes them truly unique and refreshing in a world of watered down and boring music. Some key tracks to check out are \\"Fallen\\" the first single, \\"Heaven nor Hell\\", \\"A Better Believer\\", and if you like slap bass \\"16 Dollars\\". Once you hear these guys you will want more, the other albums are great as well. And if they happen to be in a town near you check them out 'cuz they really bring it live. Great band.

B004A8ZX2S|5.0|Terrence Malick has filled his career with films that are simply gorgeous to look at but have been fairly light on actual plot.  Films like The Thin Red Line were great, but they were not everyone's cup of tea.  With 2011's The Tree of Life will not win over any mainstream praise, but it is however without a doubt the best film of Malick's entire career, and will easily come to be regarded as one of the greatest films in the history of cinema!<br /><br />Perhaps Malick's most well-known work prior The Tree of Life for younger viewers is the masterfully well-executed WWII drama The Thin Red Line (1998).  For those who've seen The Thin Red Line you may have a general idea of how Malick likes to structure things.  That is, plenty of monologues delivered by his characters intercut with symbolic imagery of nature, and human interactions.  The big difference between The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life however is the one most likely to frighten off the casual filmgoer: The Tree of Life doesn't in any way have what could be considered in any meaning of the term \\"traditional narrative.\\"  In fact, the film has such little narrative its hard even applying the word to it.  Don't believe me?  Do dinosaurs appear in what you consider a \\"traditional narrative\\"?  (Oh yeah: there's dinosaurs that pop up in this film and it is glorious).<br /><br />What one must know going into The Tree of Life is that it is not a traditional drama starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn.  The acting is good (especially Pitt) but the actors have little to nothing to do with the overall quality, or appeal of the film.  This is writer/director Terrence Malick's show.  This is a film of beauty and art.  One cannot view this film as a story, but as a work of art that one would find in a museum.<br /><br />This film is not everyone's cup of tea, as I've tried to make abundantly clear in my review.  If you're someone who couldn't stand Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey you will most certainly not enjoy Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life.  Yes, there is a loose plot, just like2001: A Space Odyssey, but the plot is not the primary purpose of the film, which is to dig into the mysteries of life, and existence through the use of surrealist imagery and situations.  2001: A Space Odyssey had the side plot of HAL9000 and the crew of the Discovery.  The Tree of Life's plot within its imagery primarily focuses on the life of a 1950s family living in Waco, Texas (naturally reflecting Malick's actual childhood no doubt).  The acting in the 1950s portion is superb, and Brad Pitt gives a pitch perfect performance as the father.<br /><br />I would like to tell you more about the plot, but there really isn't much to tell.  If you're honestly expecting to go and see a movie primarily focusing on the life of a Texas family during the 1950s all I can say is: you'll be confused, and sorely disappointed (just like those who honestly thought 2001: A Space Odyssey was just about a computer that goes rogue and starts killing the crew of a spaceship).  The only way to enjoy Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life is if you go in with an open mind, and have the understanding that you're not going to be watching a traditional drama- in fact, don't even go in thinking of this film as a drama.  You must look at this film as a piece of art, which it is.  I attended the film with a group of ten acquaintances who represented several age groups and ethnicities and we all loved this film.<br /><br />The imagery is beautiful and if cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki doesn't see an Oscar nomination next year I'll consider it a crime against the industry!  I would like to see The Tree of Life be nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards (especially with the category being expanded to ten nominees) but I doubt it would have any chance of actually winning because it goes so far against mainstream cinema.  It is a film for enthusiasts of cinema and for those who want the medium to transcend traditional narrative and become an art form all its own.  If you're part of the crowd that enjoys those kinds of movies you should not miss The Tree of Life if it comes through your town.<br /><br />As a piece of art I feel Malick has created a film that will be remembered and studied by film critics and students for decades to come.d become an art form all its own.  If you're part of the crowd that enjoys those kinds of movies you should not miss The Tree of Life if it comes through your town.

B004EPZ07K|3.0|Green Lantern seems doomed to be perhaps the biggest box office disappointment of 2011.  I know during the months leading up to it I was incredibly excited to see where it went, and the trailers did not disappoint.  So, where did the film go wrong exactly?  An estimated budget of roughly $200 million, a lot of hype leading up to it, a cast of likable actors, the talent of proven action director Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, Casino Royale, The Mask of Zorro), a superhero whose universe is rich with mythology of its own creation - what could possibly go wrong?  Well, a lot actually, as the box office returns, and harsh critical response has proven.<br /><br />Once the movie started I quickly cought onto the first strike against Green Lantern.  The script of Green Lantern is founded on conventional superhero movies clich&eacute;s and offers very little variation.  If you've seen any superhero films of the last thirty years you've already seen Green Lantern.  Green Lantern as a comic-adaptation has one thing that could possibly help it from being just another superhero movie and that's the mythology.  Aliens, an intergalactic peace corps- this is good stuff that could have made a far superior movie.  What we do see of the Green Lantern Corps and the world of Oa really is the best the movie offers, and sadly are likely only 10% of the actual running time.  From the trailers I was really expecting this film to explore this intergalactic, multi-species group of heroes, with Hal Jordan being the audience's guide and voice through the experience.  One scene where all the different races are shown united together is one of the most striking, visually spectacular moments of the film!<br /><br />Sadly, that is not the case.  Hal goes to Oa, is briefly trained for all of five minutes, decides he isn't good enough, and then sails back to Earth for the duration of the film (except for a brief period at the end).  What I wanted to see the most from the movie the filmmakers ultimately failed to deliver.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds is likable enough as Hal Jordan, but is burdened by a forced romance between him and Blake Lively's character.  To be fair, Lively's acting isn't as bad by most action movie standards, but her character is just poorly written.  I know I'll sound repetitive, but once again the best comes from Oa and the Lantern Corps with Mark Strong as Sinestro, Geoffrey Rush as Tomar-Re, and Michael Clarke Duncan as Kilowag who steal the movie during all their scenes.  Their characters aren't complex, but they wind up leaving a far greater impact on the audience and make one wish they could have gotten far more than the minimal screen time they ultimately received in the film.<br /><br />But what is a superhero film without a super villain?  Well, here comes another disappointment.  The antagonists of the film are Parallax, a giant octopus-like entity that consumes fear in individuals and can decimate entire worlds, and a human intellectual with daddy issues named Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), who is corrupted by Parallax's yellow energy.  Aside from the issue of trying to cram two super villains into a movie where the hero's origin story is the primary focus, both of these antagonists have huge problems.<br /><br />Let's start with our primary antagonist, Parallax; the giant head/space-octopus who is responsible for the extinction of many worlds and the death of Green Lantern Abin Sur.  Many have criticized the film stating that Parallax simply looks silly, but that honestly isn't my primary complaint with the character.  My complaint is that in a fictional universe with thousands of Green Lanterns they have to have the giant, planet consuming villain be the one to fight one-on-one with new Lantern Hal Jordan.  Wouldn't this villain have been far more effective if they'd saved him for a sequel where the entire Corps could ban together?  It just doesn't seem fitting for a single member to be fighting something like this, not to mention it isn't as exciting to look at one film because there's really no way to coordinate an action sequence between a giant, planet sized yellow smoke-octopus and a single man.<br /><br />Oh, and then there's Peter Sarsgaard.  I love Sarsgaard in this movie, but not at all for the reason the movie would like.  It seems unlikely that the script intended this, but Sarsgaard has created one of the most hilarious characters to appear in a superhero movie I've ever seen- and he's supposed to be the antagonist.  The script clearly wants him to be a fleshed out villain acting out of his feelings of inadequacy, but Sarsgaard is so over-the-top and downright goofy he comes across as a cartoon character who would be more at home in \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\" than an action movie.  Every scene he awkwardly speaks his lines in a silly manner that leaves the audience snickering and during the action scenes he screams in ways that would no doubt make Sam Raimi proud if he were to cast Sarsgaard in an Evil Dead film.<br /><br />On top of all other issues the film is dreadfully edited and cut down from what was obviously intended to be a much longer film.  Rumor has it that 20 to 40 minutes of Martin Campbell's initial cut were removed to achieve a runtime of less than two hours.  This is just a painfully obvious fact that the film constantly reminds you of!  Characters appear in random places without any explanation!  Clearly the character and dialogue scenes have been cut to make most of the film action scenes, but without any context the audience doesn't care.  The blatantly cut out transitions and exposition above all else are what really kills Green Lantern.<br /><br />In the end, I am going to give the extended cut of this film a watch when it comes out on Blu-Ray/DVD.  Many of the problems will likely remain, such as cheesy dialogue, the fairly generic superhero plot, and of course Sarsgaard's off-key performance, but there's no doubt that some actual transitions and character development would be a vast improvement - or, so I hope.<br /><br />Green Lantern isn't as bad as some other summer blockbusters you could go see (I'd much rather sit through Green Lantern over any of Michael Bay's Transformers films) but as it is the film is bland, and brings nothing new to the table.  Whether they make a sequel or a reboot I do hope they choose to concentrate more on the mythology and the actual Green Lantern Corps, because that really is the more interesting aspect of this character.film because there's really no way to coordinate an action sequence between a giant, planet sized yellow smoke-octopus and a single man.      Oh, and then there's Peter Sarsgaard.  I love Sarsgaard in this movie, but not at all for the reason the movie would like.  It seems unlikely that the script intended this, but Sarsgaard has created one of the most hilarious characters to appear in a superhero movie I've ever seen- and he's supposed to be the antagonist.  The script clearly wants him to be a fleshed out villain acting out of his feelings of inadequacy, but Sarsgaard is so over-the-top and downright goofy he comes across as a cartoon character who would be more at home in \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\" than an action movie.  Every scene he awkwardly speaks his lines in a silly manner that leaves the audience snickering and during the action scenes he screams in ways that would no doubt make Sam Raimi proud if he were to cast Sarsgaard in an Evil Dead film.      On top of all other issues the film is dreadfully edited and cut down from what was obviously intended to be a much longer film.  Rumor has it that 20 to 40 minutes of Martin Campbell's initial cut were removed to achieve a runtime of less than two hours.  This is just a painfully obvious fact that the film constantly reminds you of!  Characters appear in random places without any explanation!  Clearly the character and dialogue scenes have been cut to make most of the film action scenes, but without any context the audience doesn't care.  The blatantly cut out transitions and exposition above all else are what really kills Green Lantern.      In the end, I am going to give the extended cut of this film a watch when it comes out on Blu-Ray/DVD.  Many of the problems will likely remain, such as cheesy dialogue, the fairly generic superhero plot, and of course Sarsgaard's off-key performance, but there's no doubt that some actual transitions and character development would be a vast improvement - or, so I hope.      Green Lantern isn't as bad as some other summer blockbusters you could go see (I'd much rather sit through Green Lantern over any of Michael Bay's Transformers films) but as it is the film is bland, and brings nothing new to the table.  Whether they make a sequel or a reboot I do hope they choose to concentrate more on the mythology and the actual Green Lantern Corps, because that really is the more interesting aspect of this character.

B003M8NG94|3.0|I truly do love this movie and upgraded to Blu-ray. My only pet-peeve is why cant they get the speaking-sound right? The music is great, but I have to crank up  the volume to hear anything when someone speaks.  I know they are using Dolby, but honestly.    As for the picture -- it's a GREAT transfer. Looks wonderful on Blu-Ray.
B004YXE438|5.0|I hate puzzles...the little cardboard jigsaws my entire family obsesses over for days puzzles... But I love this app! I finally figured out why people like puzzles. The pictures in this app are interesting with vibrant colors, the music is just lovely, and the pieces slip and slide easily responding immediately to my touch. I like the interactive feedback it gives me. This is a well designed and executed app. Lots of nice touches, pun intended.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I prefer the shape of the 360 controller so was happy an aftermarket version was offered for the PS3.  The rubber texture gives better grip than the Microsoft controller and has additional texture on the handles.  Triggers have a little more resistance but work fine.  The analog sticks do have a wider dead zone and higher sensitivity, but I reduced the controller sensitivity settings in game and it works great.  Awesome design and value.<br /><br />Updated Dec 2012: the rubber on the analog sticks wore away down to the plastic underneath after about a year.  Unfortunately that makes the controller uncomfortable to use and I've gone back to the regular PS3 controller.  I still prefer the shape of this one but would prefer replaceable pad covers.

1423389387|5.0|It takes a *long* time to listen to this audiobook in its entirety [43+ hours on 36 discs] but it's a pleasant journey and one which I continually looked forward to. I only just finished it and I've been stringing along for weeks -- I listen to it as I wash dishes.<br /><br />The story details the trials, travels, and tribulations of an edudite young man in yet another otherworld of sorts, but most of which we've encountered before as fantasy enthusiasts. The hero, Kvothe, is both magical and scientific, a refreshing change to find a protagonist with both interests. There's nothing too weird in here and this yarn is entirely palatable.<br /><br />The story stands on its own -- one doesn't have to have read or heard any previous works to get this one from start to finish. While it's not *The Lord of the Rings* it's still pretty darn good. The drama isn't overdone and the reader [Nick Podehl] is terrific.<br /><br />I'll undoubtedly listen to this story again and I can definitely recommend it to others.
B00393SFU2|5.0|It's difficult to review a film like M. Fritz Lang masterpiece about social paranoia and society's moral codes offer difficult question where there are no easy answers. When a small city is terrorized by a child murderer, all police efforts are directed to find the culprit with no success. People are demanding results and the police is monitoring everything and everyone in a desperate atempt to find the criminal. This actions not only brings distrust between individuals but also typical criminals are being constantly raided by the police and cannot \\"work\\" in peace.<br />Finally, the criminals are the ones that catch Hans Beckert, and they perform a kangaroo trial where they want to perform justice in their hands. This scene is one of the many highlights of this wonderful film.<br /><br />M satirizes society values by questioning the authority of the criminals to judge the murderer. Also he makes a critique of the overly mood of society in which everyone lives in constant terror and fear, distrusting everybody. M is not a pretty film to watch but it's an important one. Peter Lorre gives an amazing performance as the murderer \\"forced to commit the crimes\\", he truly shines especially at the end in the trial. We even can feel pity for fim and this makes the audience experiment confusing feelings of repulsion and hatred with pitty and understanding. Lang created a timeless classic that still resounds eighty years after its premiere. M is still as fresh and contemporary as it was in 1931.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />Criterion has done an splendid job with M. I never thought that a film this age could look so good but it does. Detail is marvelous and contrast is sharp. Film grain is consistent and most of the damage has been corrected. Of course there are scenes that look more grainy or appear with slight damage but Criterion has put an exceptional transfer for this Blu-ray.<br /><br />The German uncompressed monoaural sound is also impressive. M was Lang's first sound film but in here is used just for experimenting. The film is filled with long silences but when sound does appear is crisp and dialogue is always clear.<br /><br />Bonus Material:<br />M comes with a great quantity of bonus features. First you have an audio commentary with german scholars Anton Kaes and Eric Rentschler. Also you have the english version of the film recenty discovered. The original german is far better is nice to see the inclusion of this version as a curiosity. Then you have \\"A conversation with Fritz Lang\\" that was done in 1975 by William Friedkin in which Lang discusses his origins, how he enter the movie bussiness, his films especially Metropolis and M and more. It's a great interview but I wish it had subtitles because Lang is difficult to understand at some points.<br />You also have Claude Chabrol's M le maudit, a short film inspired by M and then you have an interview with Chabrol discussing Lang's film techniques. Also you have a video interview with Harold Nebenzal recorded in 2004 in which he discusses the films produced by his father (Sedymour Nebenzal) with his production company Nero Films in which M was produced. A very enlightening material is the class adiotapes that M editor Paul Falkenberg recorded while watching the film with students. \\"A Physical History of M\\" discusses the film release, subsequent edits and later restoration efforts. Rounding up the disc is a gallery with production pictures, sketches and posters.<br /><br />A booklet is also included with an essay by film critic Stanley Kauffman, the script of a missing scene, three contemporary newspaper articles (one of which harshly criticizes the film) and a 1963 interview with Lang.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br />M is a picture that questions our own codes of behavior and judgement. Is a criticism towards society dissintegration and it's requiring viewing for everyone. It's astounding how the film can easily fit our times. As usual, Criterion has put together a spectacular packcage that comes highly recommended.

0393339882|5.0|Manjit Kumar's review of quantum physics is the best I have seen in a single volume.  I have been teaching introductory courses in modern physics for two decades, and I have always had to resort to assigning several different works in order to cover the material.  Kumar's new book dispells that necessity.  As each new topic is introduced, Kumar gives a cogent history of the relevant theories and experiments leading up to its specific role in quantum theory, and how quantum theory used those topics to deepen the theory and extend its range.<br /><br />Kumar surpasses most other works especially in his discussion of the Bohr-Einstein debates on the interpretation of the meaning of quantum theory.  Very few other writers focus on the key issue for Einstein - which was not the abandonment of causality (\\"God does not play dice\\") - but on the nature of reality itself.  For many years, physicists disparaged Einstein's critique; Kumar highlights at the end of his book how Einstein's views have come back into play.<br /><br />If there is any criticism I would offer it is that I could have wished for a bit more on recent developments, like the many-worlds interpretation, but that is a minor quibble.  Kumar is to be congratulated for a very nice job and for the service he has done for an old teacher like me.

0553801473|1.0|This Book is afraid to do anything.  Characters move from place to place with minimal amount of growth or resolution.  Major story lines feel like they're in a holding pattern.  And most annoyingly, Martin's descriptions and dialogue have gotten stale and repetitive; half the women in the book are 'thick waisted and large breasted'.  While he can usually craft a better sentence than Robert Jordan, he's not at the top of his game in this book.  I think that's because he's been overwhelmed by the task he's set for himself.  Too bad.
B004YXE438|5.0|I love these little jigsaw puzzles. I especially love the tune it plays while on menu. I also like that the music doesn&apos;t play during the puzzle.

My only request would be for different shapes for the pieces.
B004132HZS|5.0|Although I wouldn't consider myself a Sherlock Holmes connoisseur, I have enormous appreciation for exceptional writing and acting. All three episodes--I must admit I enjoyed 1 and 3 a bit more than the 2nd--are wonderfully written and executed. Benedict Cumberbatch's decision to play Sherlock as the obsessed, slightly sociopathic, manipulative yet loveable Sherlock that was portrayed in the books was a fantastic one, and it surpasses any RECENT portrayal of Sherlock that I have seen. He manages to completely convince you of his insatiable--and perhaps a bit destructive--passion for solving problems. I always respect an actor that manages to keep his own personality traits out of the character he plays. Apparently, it's a fairly rare talent among actors.<br /><br />Martin Freeman was a wonderful casting choice as Watson. He's a fine actor, and he's also quite funny. Both of the actors provide a very intelligent, witty humor to the series. The on screen chemistry between Benedict and Martin is fantastic. They compliment each other well, and by the end of it, you end up admiring their relationship. As far as this season shows, Sherlock cares for ABSOLUTELY nothing but solving puzzles, and perhaps, maybe a little, Dr. John Watson.<br /><br />For anyone that's worried about the fact that the series takes places in a contemporary London--have no fear. You quickly forget about any reservations you might've had. The show is centered around and the creators care DEEPLY for Sherlock's impossibly fast thought process, the murder mysteries, and the relationship between him and John. All the important things.<br /><br />Long story short, Sherlock is a fantastic buy. Benedict is fantastic. Martin is fantastic. The writing is fantastic.<br /><br />&lt;3
0312243022|1.0|Did I completely miss the boat on this? UGH. What a load of drek. I got half way through, realized I didn't care about any of the characters, didn't enjoy reading a ridiculous unnecessary cluster of words over and over when it should have been written just freaking straightforwardly. I am in the minority in saying this, I know, but s-k-i-p this book!
B00000K31V|1.0|Big waste of time watching this movie.  Even the acting from the stars was below par. I kept waiting for the story to get interesting and it just got grosser. I bought it used for about $4.  Maybe I can get $2 for it at my garage sale, from someone who hasn't seen it.
1451629184|5.0|Amazing book. A must read for everyone. An incredible young girl who would not let her spirit and love for life be taken away. She endured the unimaginable but survived without bitterness. She rose above this horrendous ordeal and still has her spirit and love for life. This should make everyone reading this book ashamed for not counting ones blessings. The world would be a much better place if people would have the love and compassion and spirit that Jaycee has.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Reading is a passion. I have stumbled into many glorious worlds and met many unforgettable characters in the pages of so many books. Some tattered, some crisp, but all worth reading again. So it is with George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. Each book takes you deeper into his world and binds you tighter to its characters. I hope Mr. Martin is already working on the next chapter...

0553381695|4.0|Warning, possible spoilers if you haven't read Game of Thrones.    A Clash of Kings is a follow-up to Game of Thrones and the second book in the series A Song of Fire and Ice.  In it George R. R. Martin continues the tale of the struggles for the throne of Westeros and all the chaos that accompanies it.  While GoT had very little magic or sorcery in it that starts to change in this book.  At the end of GoT dragons have been reborn in to the realm and it seems they might be the controlling force concerning magic as after their birth the users of magic have discovered their powers increasing.  Add in the fact that the realm of the Seven Kingdoms is falling apart as everyone uses the death of King Robert to either make a grab for power or to settle old scores in the resulting chaos and it ain't safe out there.  Robert left a young son to inherit but it's been discovered, or at least insinuated that the heir is not really the heir, that he is a bastard born of incest between the queen and her brother.  This leads Robert's eldest brother, Stannis, to declare himself king, supported by Robert's most loyal follower, Ned Stark.  Unfortunately Stannis is stuck on his own island stronghold while the heir, supported by his mother's family, holds the capital.  Not everyone is buying the incest tale and so view Stannis as a traitor.  This leads to the capture and death of Ned Stark.  In the meantime Stannis' younger brother makes a bid for the throne himself figuring Stannis isn't well liked giving him an opportunity.  Up in the north Ned's eldest son has been fighting House Lannister, the heir's supporters, because they were behind an attempt on his brother's life and the death of his father.  Somewhere along the line his supporters say to hell with the kingdom that is and declare him King of the North, a title dating back centuries to a time before one of his forefathers bent the knee and joined the united kingdom rather than continue a war with it.  Also in the north Balon Greyjoy, who once lead an uprising against the dead king, Robert Baratheon, has declared himself King of the Iron Islands and has moved against Robb Stark's holdings in the north while he is occupied further south against the Lannisters.  To round out the potential contenders for a throne, across the sea, Daenarys Targarayan, last survivor of the dynasty that Robert unseated, has found a way to revive the dragons her family used in conquering Westeros in the first place and is making plans to retake the throne she considers rightfully hers.  On top of all the human turmoil a threat deemed vacant for thousands of years is rising in the North of the continent, beyond the great wall built to contain it.  In addition to the supernatural threat itself the denizens of that territory are gathering, looking to invade the southlands in order to flee the threat.    Got all that.  Good, because that is just the major lineup going in to A Clash of Kings.  Underneath all that are all the lesser lords jousting for position, supporting whichever claimant they feel is going to allow them to get what the want whether it has to do with ambition, greed, revenge, love or any other human motivation.  That's what Martin is writing here and what he is damned good at, human motivation.  Unlike most fantasies Song of Fire and Ice is not a battle of good vs. evil just because almost no one is totally one or the other here.  They're all human with all the foibles that entails and all the baggage that goes with it.  Some are loyal to a cause but most have a personal ax to grind.  Even those whose motivation isn't viewed as evil may perform wrongful actions because they are too unyielding in their own personal code, seeing things in black and white with no shades of grey.  All in all in makes for an epic tale of struggles, between the characters and within themselves.  If you make it through this book better plan on buying the supposed 5 books to follow, and hope that the last 2 make it to marketand we aren't left hanging, as the tale is gripping, probably more so than any other fantasy epic I've read and that includes LotR.  How Mr. Martin can keep track of all the twists and turns he is taking us through and even more pressing, can he keep it up, are a couple of questions you will be asking yourself.  Again the book is written from the viewpoint of some of the major players, some dropping out as they are killed and others taking their place.  Oh yes, Mr. Martin is not shy about shedding blood and not just that of sideline players, anyone is fair game for the ax, or sword, in this story.  Considering the all the betrayals, killings and characters that are involved in this story it seems that bringing everything to a satisfactory close by the end of the series, satisfactory meaning there aren't any loose ends not that the guys you are rooting for win out, but I plan to stick with it to the end and feel you should to.  If you enjoyed GoT I think you will find Clash of Kings just as good if not better and fitting second volume to the story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I stumbled into this book after having a friend of mine comment about it on her Facebook page. I googled the book and was quickly intrigued into reading it. In less than a week I finished this book, along with the two sequel books. You won't want to put it down!<br /><br />Be sure you read it before the movie comes out in 2012!
0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones is not a new book; in fact it is about 15 years old.  So why you may ask, am I writing a review now?  First, although this book has been around for awhile and I, as a serious reader of sf/fantasy have heard of it and lots of good about it, I never got around to reading it until just now.  Why I didn't I don't know but I do know why I'm reading it now.  HBO has produced a series based on the book and after two episodes I was hooked and had to start reading.  The series is that good and so far fairly true to the book although there are discrepancies between the two, something to be expected whenever the written word is converted to other medium.  Be that as it may, if you have HBO and On Demand, use it and watch the show, it's that good.  As good as the series is the book is better, so much so that I am acquiring the other books in the series as A Game of Thrones is the first volume in the fantasy series A Song of Fire and Ice.  A proposed 3-4 volume epic when started it has grown to at least 7 planned volumes, 4 of which are published, the 5th due out this July.  Which brings me to the second reason I'm writing a review of so old a book.  I plan to, hopefully, read and review the first 4 volumes in time for the release of the 5th which I hope to review as a new book.  Already have it on pre-order.<br /><br />The Song of Fire and Ice is supposedly high fantasy though little of the hallmarks of fantasy are apparent in the first volume.  It is set in a world other than Earth and there are mention of magical creatures such as dragons and giants but supposedly they were lost centuries, or even millennia, before the story begins and most mention of sorcery and witchcraft are pooh-poohed by the inhabitants of the world.  In fact the only current fantastic things are that the seasons are not consistent and can last many years each and the existence of a gigantic ice wall raised by magic millennia ago that divides the Western continent and protects men from the supposed demons on the northern side of it.  Other than that Game of Thrones reads mostly like a historical fiction rather than true fantasy though as the book progress small bits of the fantastic start to appear.  Martin uses medieval history as the basis for his work, knights in armor, castles, sieges, etc.  He is very good at it too.<br /><br />If you are expecting easy reading on the order of Star Wars books or typical good vs. evil fantasy on the order of Tolkein's Hobbit or even LOTR forget it, this book is not for you.  If you like a good plot, lots of character development and having to think to be able to understand what is going on then dive in.  If I would compare it to anything it would be Tolkien's Silmarillion in scope and complexity though I think GoT reads much better.  Martin writes a complicated tale of not only warfare but political intrigue and human failings.  Very few of his characters are simple or even straightforward and both his characters and his plots have more twists than a mountain road.  House Stark is probably the closest thing to the heroes of the book but while not truly evil they are willing to do things they don't really agree with for the sake of what they consider honor and in some cases, expediency.  However knowing what they think must be done however distasteful they always take it upon themselves to do it rather than shift the deed to a lackey.  Their honor however sometimes makes them pigheaded or stupid if you will, and causes them no end of problems among the more devious.  OTOH House Lannister could be conceived as the villains of the piece yet while they seem to have more failings than most with the Queen Regent and her spoiled bastard son, the eventual king, seeming to have no redeeming values at all other members of the House show a strange, sometimes compassionate side to them making you wonder wtf Martin is doing here.  Most of the rest of the characters fall between the Queen and Lord Stark, in other words, human with everything that means in terms of potential greatness and failings.  It's a very grey world Martin has devised, at least in this book with very few deliberate lines of black or white.<br /><br />While GoT does have some battles in it, not to mention a few beheadings and such also, it is more a stage setter for the following novels.  Rather than action it is more characterization and plot building with political intrigue taking center stage.  Again Martin does a great job because while basic battle lines are developing he keeps you guessing as to who is doing what for whom?  Is this guy working for king, country or himself?  Except for a few characters it is usually hard to tell and he does it so well that there are very few slow places in the book.  Let's face it, at around 700 pages there are going to be a few that make you a bit drowsy but luckily they are few and far between.<br /><br />Another thing that he does that makes you think is that he develops his chapters around certain characters and what they are experiencing and usually leaves of each chapter at a pivotal moment, sort of a mini cliff hanger.  What he doesn't do is come back to that exact moment when he returns to that character.  Rather than micro manage each characters role in the story he adds to their tale in the succeeding chapters involving other characters through descriptions of what effect their developing situations have on the lives of the characters in the chapter being written so that when he returns to a character he has gone past that pivotal moment and moved on with his life, giving you enough knowledge to understand what happened without adding too much extraneous detail.  Considering the length of the book it's a good thing as adding tons of detail could have doubled or trebled the page count.  The irony in it is that for some reason Martin goes in to glorious detail when describing meals.  He will describe feasts by courses and side dishes and spend a couple of paragraphs describing meals rather than just saying that they had a feast.  Why, I haven't a clue but it doesn't detract from the story, in fact given some of the stuff he has them eating it is kind of interesting.  It could be he was enamored of what people considered high cuisine back in the day and wants us to get the idea.  Personally some of it makes me want to retch but it is still interesting.<br /><br />So, GoT is not a quick night's read or even two.  I, with not a whole lot I absolutely have to get done so having a lot of available time on my hand, reading a book I found interesting as hell still took almost a week to get through it.  There will be times you don't want to put it down and times when you'll have no problem doing so but the former are much more numerous than the latter so you may lack for sleep and nap at your job but on the whole I recommend Game of Thrones as one to read as long as you are looking for something on an adult level.ing that means in terms of potential greatness and failings.

0316010669|5.0|I'm not someone who reads a whole lot, and I hadn't read but one book book cover to cover in over two years until I heard about Blink. The book focuses on how people unconsciously know much more than they give their brain credit for, and that the unconscious is qutie good at picking up on subtle signals and processing them very quickly. The key to harnessing the unconscious is not only know when to use it, but also recognize when ingrained yet unjustified biases interfere with our otherwise sound snap judgment. I read it at my leisure in only a couple weeks and really enjoyed it. I had read Gladwell's The Tipping Point and it really made me think. That prompted me to investigate further into Gladwell's writing. Blink made me excited about reading again, which is something I never thought I'd say. As soon as I finished this book, I went out immediately and bought Gladwell's What The Dog Saw and can't wait to start reading that. This book is definitely worth your time. Gave me insight into areas ranging from the power of \\"thin-slicing\\" in order to predict the overall longevity of marriages all the way to examining how the perceptions from the autistic person's point of view can give us better insight into our own minds.
0553801473|3.0|Yes, it's overly long and descriptive and doesn't look like it can possibly wrapped any time soon. But I saw those flaws in the first three books as well, and it already seemed to me in Sword of Storms that Martin was just piling up events but not actually heading toward fixing or resolving some of the events (even though that book was better written in general). So I had lowered expectations for this book. I liked several of the storylines (Jon, Theon, Bran, Asha) even though I agree with the general sentiment that half of it could have been chopped off.
0307477479|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, read it over a few days while on vacation.  It is that rare combo of book that is easy to read but isn't a fluff piece.  The concept has been stated in many reviews so I won't repeat that.  I did think of it as a series of stories with characters that were woven in and out, kind of like life itself.   It wasn't linear, but memories rarely are.  I thought her take on the future was brilliant, the power point chapter inspired, and she crafted a story I wanted to follow with characters that I cared about.   I found it fun to see what era the next chapter would be in and who would populate it.  Made each chapter a surprise which kept it fresh.   I am giving it to several friends as gifts and would highly recommend it.  It is a disruptive format so I can see why some people don't like it. If you are very linear and like everything in order then this might not be for you.  However, I didn't find it confusing, but just went along for the ride - which is what I suggest if you read this.  Consider you are in a car and not sure what the destination is going to be or what time zone you'll be in - just settle in and enjoy yourself.   Kudos to Jennifer Egan for shaking up the format a bit and creating such an engaging book.
B0007LGCB8|5.0|I have worn Keen sandals in the past and the first pair I owned was for hiking and kayaking in the Western States.  They are very durable and comfortable in most every situation.  I purchased this pair to have a \\"dress\\" pair of sandals that could be worn to outdoor get togethers in the heat of the summer.  The lining for your foot is very comfortable and the leather and construction seem to be top notch.  You spend more for these on the front end but will have years of enjoyment in wearing them.
1451629184|5.0|As a general rule, I not a big consumer of biographies and memoirs.  Still, I've read more than a few over the years - famous and successful people, of course.  Given my teenage infatuation with Melissa Gilbert, when A Prairie Tale was released, I felt a certain pull to understand the back story to her otherwise public life.  Boy was that an eye opener.  Still, while they were all interesting and well written, none were compelling stories, except perhaps Ms. Gilbert's.    However, with A Stolen Life, I was compelled to read Ms. Dugard's story for its uniqueness and the bravery required to tell it.  I had to hear her story and from her.  Half-way through the book, I'm thinking that I'm reading a modern day exorcism as told through the victim's eyes and through the victim's voice.  The analogy is flawed and someone - perhaps many - will likely correct me.  Still, it is the closes term that I could grasp in describing what I was reading.  In her eighteen years of captivity, Ms. Dugard wasn't possessed of evil so much as she was imprisoned by it.  But, like a victim of possession she was not responsible for what was happening, yet she was delivered from evil as much through her own strengths as those of others who reached out and helped lift her up.    Ms. Dugard's story is as horrific and compelling as anything Stephen King or Dean Koontz could ever pen. Still, should you find yourself compelled to read A Stolen Life, you'll find her prose as raw as it is real.  It takes the collective efforts of a lot of talented people to see a manuscript birthed into a published book.  Still, if there was a copy editor or ghost writer engaged in finishing the manuscript, then their touch was light, if at all.  And that's the way it should be.  What you see instead, as you follow her journey is the evolution of a novice writer, finding both her voice and identify.  Each reflection reads like of prayer of deliverance.  At the conclusion of A Stolen Life, you start to see the promise of a innate story teller. A writer's nebulous voice growing into conviction.    If I had Ms. Dugard's ear, I would offer her this thought, \\"Jaycee, I believe as you that we cannot give away our souls.  A soul is an inextricable part of the whole, as inseparable as the beating heart in the chest.  However, we can each choose to share a part of our souls with others.  Thank you for sharing yours with us.\\"    My only regret in purchasing A Stolen Life, is that my e-reader was not up to the task of properly rendering the pictures that Ms. Dugard graciously shared with her readers.  I'm still uncertain what is written on Page 2 and may be compelled to buy the printed version of the book.    However, if the writer's message is clear, A Stolen Life is not a final chapter. Rather, it's an introduction to a life that was take off its true course, but has once again found good seas, good wind, and a star by which to steer.  There's an expression bantered about, \\"Writing is good for the soul.\\"  I know not from where it comes, but I believe that perhaps it's a boiled down, twenty-first century paraphrase from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, \\"If any man wishes to write in a clear style, let him be first clear in his thoughts; and if any would write in a noble style, let him first possess a noble soul.\\"  Should she never touch this subject again, it is my hope that we will hear from Ms. Dugard again, for there is a good soul here, which is destined for writing.

B0051MKMNC|1.0|Nowhere did I see in the product description that this BD would only play (forced) on region code A bluedisc players, so it will not play on a region code B player (like e.g. in Europe). This is the very first overseas BD which I could not play, BTW. The digital copy with DRM just for the PC is not a real compensation, since it lacks a) BD quality and b) BD goodies. And due to DRM it will only play in Windows Media Player or iTunes.    In the meantime, I know from various forums that FOX is one of pretty few studios forcing this customer unfriendly BD regional code.     So, customers from overseas: refrain from buying FOX media in the US if your player does not support the BD region code A.     It will certainly influence my buying habits. No more FOX. Pity.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Rango, not at all what I expected it to be.  First off the animation is beautiful, and feels a little Ralph Steadmen like.  On that note, I really appreciated the cameo persona of Hunter S. Thompson \\"I knew it!  Another One!\\".  The story is setup in a very unique way, nothing else quite like it.  I enjoyed how they mixed the adult story line with the quirky animation style, bringing it to a new level.  Although not entirely what I would call a children's story it is still viewable by children as long as you don't mind a little violence (nothing extreme).  Currently holds as my son's favorite movie, he insists on watching it almost daily.  The characters are fairly well developed especially the star \\"Rango\\" you really get a feel for the type of \\"person\\" he is and see him evolve through the story.  The writers I have to give a tip of the hat, brilliant story laced with quick wit and dry adult style humour.  Strangely despite seeing the movie dozens of times already, I don't really mind it and infact from time to time find myself laughing at something I've already laughed at too many times to count.  Even my father who is 68 enjoyed the movie so much after watching it with his grandson, he had to go out and purchase a copy for himself.  Overall I would probably give the movie 4.5 out of 5 stars but due to the fact they threw the cameo for Hunter S. Thompson I had to tack on another half star.  Brilliantly done, far and beyond exceeded my expectations, sure to thrill any western lover or those that enjoy a good CGI film.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|The Help is a maid for Oscar story of Mississippi maids set in 1963.  The book, [[ASIN:B002YKOXB6 The Help]] has become a literary phenomenon.  There is no black president.  There is no daughter and granddaughter of a maid who has had a talk show for 25 years.  Now, as we go deeper into the deep south, we peer through the bent back tulips, to see how the other half lives,  to explore the life of the black maid against the burgeoning backdrop of the civil rights movement.<br /><br />As we go to Jackson 1963, a microcosmic experience unfolds.  Don't imagine the elephant in the room. Imagine invisible maids under a microscope. Life through a female lens.  Life is not fair if you are a black maid. Some people say foul is fair.  Some will not just say it, but prove it.<br /><br />Eugenia aka Skeeter personifies the progressive educated female. Well traveled, broad minded, she hopes to become a writer in New York. Returning to Jackson she discovers that her maid from childhood has mysteriously disappeared.<br /><br />Hilly Holbrook, the antagonist, alpha female housewife personifying the status quo, with her bouffed up sprayed in place hair, and a WITCH (Woman In Total Control of Herself) glint in her eye, campaigns for a law requiring people with home help to build an additional toilet for the help only.<br /><br />She is not racist enough not to hire a black maid, and she will kiss her small child before passing it to the outstretched arms of the hovering maid.  She is racist enough to pay below minimum wage. She will find a suitable match for her friend Skeeter.  She proclaims that she promotes 'separate but equal,' and warns her friend Skeeter that there are 'real racists' in this town.<br /><br />Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play long suffering maids Aibileen and mouthy Minny respectively.  One embittered, tragic, looks Oprahesque, the other sassy.<br /><br />The toilet becomes a recurring symbol, metaphor, inciting incident, turning point.  Other symbols include the maid uniform, the bus, pies, the ring, Crisco, and grits.<br /><br />Now is the sweltering summer of our discontent maid  glorious Autumn by this story of suffering maids and their condition may be made better by writing a tell all book.  It may also be maide worse.<br /><br />The dilemma of peeing.  A sassy maid caught short during a storm insistently asks to use the house bathroom and gets refused.  She goes.  The WITCH, boiling with anger, bangs on the door.  The maid without peeing insolently flushes the toilet to get under her bosses skin. 18 people died in that storm, 10 white, 8 black. A maid risks not only getting fired but also life and death, and having to pee in a storm on the way home.<br /><br />When Aibileen tells her tragic story I could feel the emotion welling in my chest and while remaining in the moment I was transported to Oscar night, where they show the scene from the movie. When Skeeter (Emma Stone)did her monologue, I had a similar somewhat intense experience. It takes great talent to evoke that kind of response.<br /><br />Rarely do you get such a strong ensemble with a mostly female cast, with such well written acting roles.  The movie [[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]] also starring Viola Davis, got four Oscar nominations for acting, and I expect this movie will get several acting nominations including a second nomination for her, and probably victory this time.<br /><br />While outstanding in the acting, and pathos, with many of the most memorable scenes you will experience this year, it has weaknesses in the story.  Specifically, the lack of a strong inciting incident. The story could have been strengthened by having Medgar Evers as a character.  As he lived in Jackson at the time,  how difficult would it be to have one or two scenes with him in it, and then the storyteller would have us much more emotionally involved in the real life event of his assassination by a  'real' racist.<br /><br />While other movies such as [[ASIN:B000059TFO Mississippi Burning]], set around the same time, [[ASIN:B000XJD34I In the Heat of  the Night (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)]], or[[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)]], explore the racial tension and explicit racism through a masculine lens, The Help explores a more shaded implicit racism of denial. The covert racism of going along to get along, bowing to peer pressure, not daring to risk punishment by social exclusion, and using moral justification without compassion as with Hilly.  It's racism without the demeaning word, the more punishing racism of the workplace and the pocketbook, not the racism of the thug.<br /><br />Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly could win an Oscar.  When she is good she is very very good.  When she is bad she is better.  Her gleeful wicked witch of the West meets Cruella De Ville performance, at first deceptively inconsequential builds throughout the movie, reaching an impressive crescendo. I hope the nominater is smart enough to nominate her in a different category from Viola Davis, so both can win.<br /><br />Minny wants equality, yet when Celia Foote sits at her table, and treats her like an equal, her conditioning kicks in and she asks her to sit elsewhere.  I liked that her character was more active.<br /><br />Emma Stone could get an Oscar nom. She is a crusader, and does battle adversity but she is not the subject of adversity, and does not have a dog in the fight.  The stakes are less serious for her.<br /><br />I liked Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain, as poor white trash married into money.  She has no understanding of the social norms, and status, because she apparently was raised on Mars. She has a Jayne Mansfield body.<br /><br />I feel pretty certain that The Help will be nominated for best picture, and the issue of race relations has been well favored in the past for example, the movie Crash, won with a similar theme.<br /><br />Each year Oscars get awarded for  mostly two types of roles:<br /><br />1. A person battling adversity, mental illness, social discrimination, physical or mental handicap of some kind, the underdog. A crusader. A stuttering king, as in Colin Firth, a mentally ill ballerina as in Natalie Portman, a crusader as in Sandra Bullock, or Hilary Swank, or Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich. Hattie McDaniel won playing a maid and a slave in Gone with the wind set in 1863.<br /><br />2. The psychopath sociopath.  Anthony Hopkins Silence of the Lambs,  Javier Bardem No Country for old men,  Kate Winslet in The Reader. Angelina Jolie as a sociopathic mental in Life interrupted. Charlize Theron as serial killer.<br /><br />If you like The Help, I recommend you also see The Debt, a brilliant suspense thriller also starring Jessica Chastain, with Helen Mirren.  I wonder which one you will like best.  If you are like me, I think you will be amazed at how talented JC is in a leading role. It's the best movie of the 60 or so I have seen this year. She also plays the lead actress  in [[ASIN:B005HV6Y5W The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]]] which I recommend somewhat cautiously.

It's amazing what mind-control can make a person believe, especially with a child.  My heart ached as I read her story, but it isn't just a story about the terribly horrible things she went through, but it's really a story about overcoming such a mess!  She's a hero...

Anybody in any kind of relationship will find Chapman's insights revolutionary. It will help you better understand yourself and your partner and the ways you express affection. It's written in an accessible, engaging manner. There is one part about a very abusive husband that I found questionable, but it can be overlooked for the most part. For further research, I highly recommend that you take the online \\"Love Language\\" quiz at the author's website. As an aside, the Kindle edition is formatted very nicely.

The production doesn't get in the way of the songs or the performances as is so prevalent on recordings these days.<br /><br />This isn't music for kids looking for the crap the music industry is pushing these days.

B00386EZJU|5.0|I knew of a couple of tracks I had to have to add to my epic-film soundtrack playlist.  Turns out that there are about 7 that are off the charts.    PROS: There's an ominous theme for dragons, there's the main theme, there's of course Forbidden Friendship, and the very first track has non-stop sing-ability. You will not punch yourself for buying the hard copy of this track. This is coming from a John Williams/James Newton Howard/Michael Giacchino/Danny Elfman fan, not so much a Hans Zimmer fan.    CONS: There's a track by a random artist as the next to last track that I always skip. Yeah, it played in the credits of the movie, but it's still lame that I have to skip it to get to the last orchestral track.  Also, there's no stellar credits track where the composer pulled out all the stops like \\"The Incredibles,\\" \\"A New Hope,\\" or \\"Pirates of the Caribbean.\\"  The final track is actually one of the less interesting ones, but still a good track.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Started off with interesting premise, quickly devolved into too many sub-plots wrapped around a Harlequin like romance. The dialogue is full of cliches, thin and sometimes just silly. The characters are one dimensional and well, the ending makes no sense at all except as a transition to sequel that is no doubt on it's way. I've never written a review before, but this book was so awful wanted to warn people. Don't spend a dime, if you want this book check it out from the library.

It is basically a flawless record, pure jazz saxophone, piano, bass and drums.  So easy to listen to, so pure in musical quality and musicianship, this music is just way out there.  Supposedly this record was Dexter's favorite of his own music--easy to see why.  Easy to hear why, that is.

I got this as a library book because of my book club. So dissapointed! Glad I did not pay for this piece of junk!<br />This book is NOT FUNNY.<br />Hate Hate Hate Ignatius! Such a loser! I got a headache halfway through chapter 2.<br />I tried and tried to keep reading out of repect for the Pulitzer Prize rating(and my sister who picked this book). Hoping beyond hope that the books characters would redeem themselves. Never happened.<br />I personally like to read books that are interesting. I cannot stay interested in a book where I absolutely cannot stand the main character. It's like Catcher in the Rye all over again. Ick!
B004H3WWU2|5.0|I just got this bag in and I could not be more pleased.  I had previously been carrying my stuff in one of those Swiss laptop backpacks which are nice but it was much bigger than what I needed.  I have to keep my laptop on me at all times for work so lugging around a big heavy bag was getting to be annoying.  The items that I keep in this bag are as follows: laptop, laptop power adapter and cord, Ipad, ipad adapter and cord, ethernet cable, wireless mouse (kind of a big one cause I use a trackball), two thumb drives, pens, pencils, a leatherman, extra stack of business cards, backup apple connector cable and headphones, 1 poly-pocket folder which I keep with my laptop in the pocket to transport any documents that I would need to stay wrinkle/ fold free.  I especially like how my ipad fits in the sleeve connected to the front of the laptop pocket.  The Ipad in the apple case + a protective padded sleeve are a perfect snug fit.  Not much else will fit in this backpack but you have room for a magazine or a small notebook in the main pocket if you need.  The bag is super high quality and I think the build quality is great.  It's light and small and will easily fit under the seat on an airplane  so no cramming your stuff into the overhead compartment where you cant get to it.  I also like how my stuff stands out against the read and white interior of the bag so its easy to find.  This is my first Booq product and the bag is small and would not have worked for me while in school (dont think I could get one text book in there) but it fits my needs perfectly and based on the quality of this bag I wouldn't hesitate to buy more Booq products if I had a need.
B00001U0E1|5.0|This is a very fun movie, one of my favorites.  There are several things going on at the same time, interwoven in a fast-paced and continually hilarious narrative.  The young Shakespeare is experiencing his first creative draught.  He seethes with life, energy, and ambition, a beautiful young man who will become the greatest writer in ENglish of all time.  He must find his muse.  Fiennes is absolutely brilliant in this starring debut.<br /><br />Then there is the social portrait of an historical era, splendidly brought to life.  He is of a low social status, below that even of artisans, yet their work is anticipated by Queen Elizabeth herself.  Though women are forbidden from acting, an extraordinarily beautiful young lady wants to act.  This is doubly forbidden, as she is of the merchant class and her father is arranging a marriage to an aristocrat, for title.<br /><br />Of course, they fall in love, in a comedy of errors with the amazing characters that hang about the theatre.  It brings the whole thing together, with Shakespeare finding his inspiration, to write Romeo and Juliet as his doomed affair continues, adding bits from real life and odd considerations like including a producer in the play.  It is a creative journey unlike anything I have ever seen, doesn't pretend to be accurate, but works.<br /><br />As an American, there were many things I responded to for a full film experience. But my wife, a Brit, saw a completely different level to it in the word play and witticisms.  There was so much that I didn't get, which added to the delight of the film.  It is one of our favorites.<br /><br />REcommended with the greatest enthusiasm.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|While this isn't a suspense novel at all, I couldn't put it down--I couldn't wait to find out where Emma and Dex were in their lives one year later. I was also very impressed at how the author smoothly wove in the events of the previous year. This is one of the best-written books that I've ever read--I enjoyed every bit of it. I'm actually a little nervous about the movie, because I loved this book so much!

1904633447|5.0|This is a very convenient edition to carry around--small, and with multiple page markers (2 flaps on the dust jacket, plus a ribbon marker)--I've been taking it with me to work, reading bits & pieces on my lunch hour.  The print size is okay on the eyes, though I'm not sure kids wouldn't find it a little small.  Don't be fooled by the miniaturized (and colorized!) illustration on the jacket--there are 17 handsome black-&-white pen and ink illustrations by the excellent HM Brock, all very well reproduced, depicting iconic moments from the narrative with near-cinematic eyes.  My personal favorite is Jim and Mrs. Hawkins' terrified faces, stopping their rifling of the sea chest as they hear the arrival of Blind Pew.    On to the story--I've only just finished the book, taking it with me to read over my lunch hour at work.  What a pleasure!  Piracy, hidden treasure, a boy becoming a (young) man before our eyes, a shipload of adults (some of whom can't be trusted), and one of the more complex central figures--Long John Silver himself.  Father figure?  Villain?  Your call, reader!  And to think this complexity is brought forth in a children's adventure yarn...

0345529057|5.0|I had never read George R.R. Martin, and took a chance on my order.  So far I have read one and a half of the books, and love it.  He proves well defined and interesting characters, as well as telling the story from the different characters' point of view.  By the time you made it half way through the first book you fine yourself cheering for your favorite characters and deciding who the enemies are, and the clever way it's written any of the characters could be a hero or villian.  Once you get started it is very hard to put down, as you get sweeped into the Seven Kingdoms. I would recommand this set of books to anyone wanting an excellent read and to be sweep away to another time and place.

Most of all I like the gently increasing volume setting, makes it harder to get irritated!!
B003INBOE2|4.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE FROM START TO FINISH. DONNIE YEN REALLY SHOWS OFF HIS TALENT IN THIS FIRST PART OF IP MAN. WELL DONE!!!!   HERB SIMON.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Truthfully, there has been a lot of disdain, complaining and moaning about this movie, but personally, I though it was pretty good, was exceptionally entertaining and was visually stunning.  Additionally, the movie soundtrack was great as the fight scenes were perfectly choreographed to the music and the music was perfectly picked for the fight scenes.  The story line for this movie was pretty good, was intriguing and was very fast paced.  The action and fight scenes were fast, were exciting and kept you wanting more and more.  The ending to this movie was great; it added a nice twist and was not blatantly obvious.  I do have one particular complaint about this movie; basically, the characters were not developed enough.  Even the main character was not developed.  All we know about the main character is that she was sexually abused by her stepfather and that she tried to kill him.. end of story, and even worse we know less about the other girls... Yes, the character development absolutely sucked!  I do wish that the director would have expanded on this more than he did.  I notice a lot of people complaining about the \\"misogyny\\" and the sexualization of the women... get a grip on reality! Sex and violence sells.. Attractive girls blasting and chopping through hoards of goblins, undead, dragons or anything for that matter will sell and ultimately film is a business and is about what sells most.  Lastly, the addition scenes in the uncut version are great.  Many of the fight scenes were expanded and were made even more stunning, the final scene with the \\"High Roller\\" was expanded and elaborated, and contained a phenomenal juxtaposition of human sexuality, freedom and human emotionality.    The main plot of the movie follows a girl who is abused by her step father and whom she tries to kill.  She is brought to a 1950s era insane asylum.  Throughout the movie the girl disassociates herself from reality by creating intricate fantasies and by ultimately dulling the pain ofher reality through visions and fantasies of self empowerment.  In essence the girls who she is locked up with, plan an escape from the asylum but they need to obtain 5 hard to get items to do it.  The end provides a real twist and adds a third layer to the ultimate plot.  I dont want to expand any further than this in risk of ruining the charm of the movie.      Many of the persons who underrated this movie complained about plot holes and the like, and how shallow the movie was.. I think that there was quite a bit going on, and that ultimately the movie was more than a comic book movie, but instead was a post-modern expansion of how the human mind deals with pain and psychological stressors by disassociating themselves from them and by creating fantasy worlds to live in.. Truthfully, this is not farfetched; I would say it was a pretty accurate portrayal of this type of behavior.      I think that you should definitely check this movie out as it was very well thought out and was very well done.  The CGI was great, the action was intense and the movie was visually stunning.  Ultimately the movie was a blend of elements of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", \\"Shutter Island\\", \\"Kill Bill\\", \\"Charlie's Angels\\" and \\"300\\" all in one movie.  I think it is definitely worth seeing, and for me it was an enjoyable guilty pleasure.

030726999X|5.0|Having read the first two books in the trilogy, I thought I had this one figured out. It did not go that way at all. It was very well written and kept me guessing as to what would occur next. It did not end the way I thought it would either.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I finished the game in 1 sitting, in less than a couple of hours. Don't get me wrong, it is challenging, I just play these types of games a lot so I've gotten good at it. It's like those escape games, which I love.  It is so short though! Then after you finish the game, that's it. It should at least tell you how long you took to solve it, then enter your name so that your friends can beat your time or something. Anyway, it's fun but needs to be lengthier, especially since its a paid app.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|How subversive is RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES that it convinces you to root for the intelligent apes as they run amok in San Francisco, as their unnatural rebellion heralds the demise of man? Raise your digits if you were less than enthused when you first heard they were making a prequel to the PLANET OF THE APES franchise? Yeah, mine right up there with you. Except that this film, gripping and full of humanity and exceedingly well told, proves us to be a bunch of judgmental asshats. Continuity-wise, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES folds nicely into the canon.<br /><br />James Franco plays the opposite bookend to Prometheus. Prometheus delivered onto man the gift of fire. Set in present-day San Francisco, Franco's character is Will Rodman, a scientist mucking about in the field of neurogenesis. Will, whose father is stricken with Alzheimer's, believes that he's discovered the cure to the disease with his ALZ-112 strain. When his project is discontinued, he sneaks from his lab and takes into his home an infant chimpanzee whose mother had been genetically experimented on with ALZ-112. It's readily apparent that the baby had inherited his mother's late surging self-awareness. His intellect expanding in leaps and bounds, the baby chimp, Caesar, comes to regard Will Rodman as his surrogate father and Will's ailing father (an excellent John Lithgow) as family. Caesar wins you over with the care and concern he demonstrates towards Lithgow. Except that true happiness and acceptance continue to elude Caesar in man's world. Caesar knows he is different, not human, not fully ape. In his attempts to fit in and find his rightful place, it's ironic that Caesar is human enough that he eventually decides to play god. If you've seen the trailer, then you can ignore this tardy SPOILER alert. This movie, after all, is a prequel. We know what happens next. Unwittingly, scientist Will Rodman has pretty much effed us.<br /><br />Yay, the downfall of human civilization. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, in my eyes, is a must-see picture. Unlike most other summer blockbusters, this comes with an intelligent script and a narrative that stays on focus. For what it accomplishes in the realm of CG effects, Weta Digital deserves massive propers. Count Andy Serkis and Alan Rickman as two fantastic artists who probably won't get Oscar nods. Rickman, because he wasn't near enough in the Harry Potter movie. Serkis, because who are we kidding? Maybe if there's a category for best motion capture performer. In Weta Digital and Serkis' hands, Caesar is an utterly compelling character. Caesar is so believably brought to life that, moments into the film, I completely stopped regarding him as a CG fabrication but simply as another character in the movie. It's fascinating to track Caesar's progression from infancy to maturity. The storytelling is so well executed and makes so much sense that you don't question Caesar's choices, up to that moment in which he decides to rise up. And he's so sympathetic that, odds are, you'll be rooting against the humans who go up against him and his band of simians. My most favorite bits take place during his time spent in captivity in the primate sanctuary. It's where we observe him truly become a leader by dint of his will and intellect. By the way, I will mention that this movie isn't necessarily about ape versus man. When Caesar stages his uprising, it's not necessarily directed against humanity. And if you stick around after the closing credits, there's a coda which brings home even more what actually will bring about the decline of man.<br /><br />The apes seem to have a foot already on the threshold even in the acting department. Even more than the relationship between Caesar and Will, we get truly invested in Caesar's interactions with his fellow primates, my two favorites being the caged gorilla and Maurice the circus orangutan who can sign. Note the sudden joy on Caesar's face when he learns that Maurice can communicate withhim, that he's not exactly alone. That moment may've been when that revolutionary germ of an idea struck Caesar.<br /><br />It's a bit amusing that the shoddy performances can be laid at humans' feet. Tom Felton is rubbish; his American accent is suspect and is it me or is he just regurgitating lines that he'd already said as Draco Malfoy? Freida Pinto plays a primatologist named Caroline, and other than her one foreshadowing remark - \\"I love chimpanzees, but I'm also afraid of them. It's appropriate to be afraid of them.\\" - she is wasted here. Brian Cox also just twiddles his thumbs as the director of the primate sanctuary, and - here, have a SPOILER alert, because I have to air this out - how much of a fail is it when Cox's character happens to catch Caesar teaching all the other apes to sign and he just goes \\"Huh,\\" and walks away as if you see that everyday?<br /><br />One mild nitpick I do have is that I'm left wondering where Caesar recruited so many apes to the cause. I don't buy that San Francisco has that many apes. Maybe I'm wrong.<br /><br />But go see this movie. Quit monkeying around. (Sorry.)him, that he's not exactly alone.

B002ZG976U|3.0|I was so thrilled to get this, I gave a good review BEFORE I watched the movie.  It sticks, stops, whatever, ceases to run.  One has to hit FF then play really quickly as so not to miss too much of the one section.  I can live with it, not all that thrilled about it, but in the scheme of things, it's only a small inconvienence.....
0439023521|5.0|Spectacular book (and series)!!!  It reminded me of books like 1984, animal farm, and others like it. The story line is very easy to follow and it is an action packed series that made me want to sit and read until I could finish ALL 3 Books!!!
B004WR125O|1.0|I still do not have this adapter functioning either reliably or consistantly, in my home theater setup.  The implementation of this network adapter is odd at best and completely non-intuitive at worst.  Once added to the Onkyo AVR, you must select the appropriate USB interface to configure the the Wifi network settings, NOTE: this NOT the same network settings that are done through the setup menu! I don't know why either. Once configured, the adapter could not maintain a reliable connection to my WiFi access point 25 ft away! Every time I attempted to check on the status of the signal it would show it as less than the previous time. I also noticed that my AVR would become unresponsive in the setup menu or on the USB selection section.  I had to pull the power cord twice, on the AVR. I recommended that you stick with the built in Ethernet interface, until Onkyo can come with a better integrated and reliable solution.
B004OBC7TS|5.0|Let's get this straight.<br />This film is not a porno,<br />nor does it overtly critique the porn industry.<br />It accuses multinationals, and mainstream news media, for its part in creating and<br />then covering-up war crimes, and if you do not know what this means see one of the greatest books of the century, \\"NEWSPEAK in the 21st Century\\", by MediaLens and David Cromwell (the US Amazon site blocks my attempt to put a product link to this book, though they do sell it. The Canadian and British Amazon sites allow the link ... they all sell this. Well worth a read!)<br /><br />Every day we see images that are much much more shocking - because they are real images of real people suffering, on TV news - than anything in this film. Turn off mainstream corporate TV news if you want to censor something that is really sick, but do not censor this film. Whether or not you can face watching a film that, to all intents and purposes is less shocking than \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" was in its day, do not let the hype put you off, nor the frenzied hatred that has been invoked in those who utter such bile in their rabid attempts to stop you from seeing this.<br /><br />This film points a finger at the war-mad corporate machine that drives governments, and that is backed-up by its own (well-controlled and out on a leash) mainstream media, that lives off the endless death, carnage and suffering perpetrated on millions of innocents (e.g. to date over 1 million dead in Iraq since 2003) to feed the hunger that brings back the viewer, time and time. for more so-called 'news', filtered information that is propagandized by TV corporate cartels who decide what is and what is not the news that you will see. You don't believe that?<br />Then check out<br />\\"Censored 2010 (Censored: The News That Didn't Make the News -- The Year's Top 25 Censored Stories)\\"<br />or any of the other books by that title, one of which is issued every year, and has been for the last 30 years. Every year you will find would-be block-buster news stories that were simply 'blocked' by mainstream news, the few with all the broadcasting power (again, the US Amazon site blocks my attempts to put a product link to this book, though they do sell it, and all the others)<br /><br />If you think that sounds crazy please see this website for<br />MUST-SEE films, really great flix of our age,<br />that are quietly \\"banned\\"<br />by corporate media<br />and blanked by the multinational news cartel: [...]<br /><br />\\"A Serbian Film\\" plays with an extreme, yet an imagined part of the world of porn, the so-called 'snuff' movie, a mythical & invisible pillar in the darkest heart of the temple of pornography (where, supposedly, some unfortunate porn stars have been lured to meet their fate ... for the 'exquisite' delectation of a select few super-addicts who can no longer get satisfaction from plain old sex on the screen. No snuff movie has ever been proved to have existed but it is a useful and scary tool in showing how state-sponsored terror often ignores the rule of International law(let alone common decency) and bombs or attacks countries to preempt ... \\"a smoking gun in the shape of a mushroom cloud\\" (as war criminal C.Rice put it); or to 'protect' the poor and defenseless natives (by killing other poor and defenseless natives) and then lets its news cameras in to film the aftermath, the shoe in the rubble, the bloodbath in the sand, the severed bits'n'pieces under makeshift blankets; and the real pain and anguish or survivors and loved ones, all for a strange visual pleasure, for the consumption of 'news' over dinner, or on the move - watch it on the way to work on BBCiplayer - and reassurance of the public that protection is available, at a price.<br /><br />This film is not a film that abuses minors; nor does it espouse child abuse - no more than Stanley Kubrick did in \\"The Shining\\". No one in their right mind would say \\"The Shining\\" was abusive to minors, though it places youngsters like the twin girls aside gushing torrents of blood; and it puts Danny (and 'Tony', 'the little boy who lives in his mouth') in stark view of the blood that gushes when the axe-wielding maniac protagonist chops-up chef Halloran, and threatens to do the same to his son, as he chases Danny from the bathroom to the snow-covered maze.<br />\\"A Serbian Film\\" is attacked by censors because it shows a child - dressed and doing absolutely nothing to do with sex - on a television screen, whilst unsavory acts are happening in the room where the TV is situated! The denouement and other scenes involving children are not explicit, and certainly not abusive, however, they are shocking to the viewer, as they are meant to be. Compared to what Danny went through in \\"The Shining\\", nearly 40 years ago, the kids who act in this film are surly guaranteed to come out of it with less mental scarring than the poor lad who played \\"Danny\\" did. They are seen acting upset and shocked, yes, that much is true, though they are not subject to sexual abuse or used in scenes where difficult scenes are acted out. Remember that thing called editing? Editing often gives us a different impression but that's all it is. Editing can associate a sea-horse with \\"The Grand National\\" horse-race but it does not mean the little marine creature actually raced there.<br /><br />This film attacks the pornographic pointing of mainstream news lenses; the invasion of places and lives where those cameras were not welcome, where they should not be; places where, because they are present, propaganda and manipulation become possible.<br /><br />Serbia - and Yugoslavia before it - was one of the first, modern-day, European victims of a neo-fascism that has been on the rise in governments in the west since the days of Presidential-usurper L.B.J. (upon whom Jackie Kennedy recently was heard to lay blame, for the assassination of JFK - fact : her tapes were just released, mid-August 2011).<br />The end of Yugoslavia and what happened between the warring parts (no sides taken by this reviewer) and the other people there (the majority, i.e. the non-combatants), is at the cutting edge of this film's visor; seen through the lens that spies-out a family that had thought it had managed to 'retire' from the dangers of the world. It reminded me of the protagonist's family in Michael Mann's Manhunter [DVD] [1989]: a man, his wife and their child; he is trying to get over his past occupation and infamy - as a John Holmesesque porn star - for the sake of the unity of his family. His wife is fully understanding, intelligent and loving; and they have a dream kid.<br />The family has just about survived being 'bought and sold' by the sex industry; dad has chewed-up and spat out just about every porn starlet on video, and his shelf-top collection of his old porn movies demonstrates so. He is soon lured, once more, by the hard cash of the porn set, but this time he is contracted, unknown to him, by a snuff movie cartel that reaches to the highest (and lowest levels). This cryptocracy of snuff-movie producers, played by darkly attired, heavily 'weaponized' \\"Blackwater\\" lookalikes (that post-war lot, now called \\"Xe\\", who work for neo-conservative governments in the west) who employ a legion of 'terminators', young, fit and muscle-bound dudes in black with big ... movie cameras! These Steven Segal types look like NSA Black Opz boys from the darkest of CIA lists (like that one from c.1997, known simply as \\"Al Qaeda\\" ... when that name represented little more than a list of CIA-backed fanatics carrying guns into mercenary arenas of slaughter) from where Sarah Palin might have liked to have drawn her front-line fodder; the kind of dudes she wanted to use to execute Julian Assange, for example. Terminators set loose, in the pay of very high echelons within the global corporate cartel.<br /><br />Without plot-spoiling, at the start think ... \\"Resident Evil\\", the above ground scenes at Umbrella Corp., at the momentof the shut-down; think ... \\"Memento\\", think waking-up and wondering where all the blood came from, the back-tracking, re-tracing your steps, this time with the aid of discarded video camcorders and tapes - which show you shocking and graphic depictions of you, yourself, over the last three days; a time you cannot remember...a time you do not want to remember!<br /><br />In the opinion of this reviewer, \\"A Serbian Film\\" is a lot less shocking than some current offerings that have gone unscathed by the reactionary fury that has hammered this film. For example, there is the recent French horror film, \\"Martyrs\\". It is a lot harder to watch. It's about inflicting as much pain as possible on a person, whilst keeping them alive, so as to achieve a modern martyrdom, after a year or more of intense suffering, to briefly 'see' what lies beyond death, and to impart that news to the corporate-like cult that has induced the endless agonies - before the poor victims are finally, thankfully dying. \\"A Serbian Film\\" is not easy viewing but it is not showing pain for pleasure's sake. It does not show the skinning of a a living girl by religious fanatics, as \\"Martyrs\\" does.

I haven't yet figured out how to build playlists on the phone yet, or to build/open them on the server yet either.  So better playlist support would be nice.    Also, I know Google TV isn't a supported device, however it would be awesome to be able to use Plex on my Logitech Revue!  That way I will be able to actually play my videos from my server without messing with Windows Media Player and UPNP only to find out that the codecs I use (ogg & mpv) primarily aren't compatible with the device.    XBMC on my Revue would be awesome, please help make Plex work over Ethernet & use the x86 acceleration when Google releases a NDK for Google TV!  I'd even be willing to buy the app again to be able to play my files, bonus points for being able to playback 1080p video files without needing to re-encode them on the Media Server.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I enjoy the Flashback cover the best, it's looks good and is more reflective of the film. The movie is great, same as you'll ever see it. Simplicity meets Deepth meets truth!
B00001ODHL|1.0|This two-disc limited edition, featuring the director's cut, audio commentary, a couple of excellent extra features and the original theatrical version as well, is the version of the movie to get. Too bad it's out of print. I prefer the DC, as so many hilarious moments were cut from the theatrical release, and it makes a lot more sense.    Highly recommended, if you can find one at a reasonable price, get it, and avoid the crappy Universal blu-ray and other barebones DVDs.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you like Tina Fey and are male then you may not like this book.  I've come away a little less in love with her.  It's still an interesting read, and Tina's a great writer, but it left a bad taste in my mouth some how.
0525951652|5.0|Ken Follett is a great storyteller who pulls you in from page one and keeps you interested and involved with the story from beginning to end. I like historical fiction such as this because there is a background of real envents which happened historically. The author weaves in the sotries of very realistic characters throughout the story. This gives the reader a more personal viewpoit and makes the story more real. Through this kind of story one can actually learn about historical periods and happenings, in this case World War I and the events leading up to it. Although the book was long, once you get involved with it you feel almost a part of it, and you can't put it down! It was very well written, with an interesting cast of characters. I would highly recomment this book!
B00004Z3AV|4.0|I would have given this five stars but there is no where on the cds or the back or front covers that state that this is an import. The item is in good shape,delivery was fast, slight scratches on one or 2 discs. I will update my review after i listen to all 3 discs.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|great item
B0057KXXFM|2.0|I don't know what happen with the great 90's groups today: korn,linkin park & bizkit this cd sucks!!! so the last korn & linkin park previous record
B004856SQ8|5.0|didn't think we'd like it because of growing up with the original a-team but was proved wrong with this one. loved it and have watched it over and over again since it was purchased earlier this year. bought it for my fiance as an anniversary/valentine's present combined.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|Movie was very well done. Acting was great and plot and themes held you in suspense throughout. Was sorry when I missed this when it first came out. Would definitely recommend.
B004EPYZQM|5.0|this movie is awesome. bought it for my fiance so he will be surprised at christmas this year. went to the theatre to see this and was wowed by the best fight scene between The Rock and Vin. definately a double thumbs up for this one. can't wait till part 6 is released.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|This is the first DVD I've had in ages that won't let you start watching the movie until you've watched a commercial for Sony, followed by a string of previews for Sony DVD releases.  I must have pressed every menu and skip button on the remote a dozen times to no effect.  The irony is that it I was playing it on a Sony Blu-Ray player that advertised a special feature button to \\"bypass those annoying previews\\" that Sony seems to have disabled for their own DVD products.  I don't count this against the movie, but it's going to make me think twice about rewatching the movie, and I probably won't recommend that other people buy it.
1423101472|5.0|bought it for my son as a christmas present of 2010. he loves these types of books and reading materials. has percy jackson and the last olympian to go along with it. bought him all of the books that's in this series. he has read them over and over since purchasing them nearly a year ago. would like to see more for this set to come out but might end up purchasing the kane chronicles to go along with these.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I was worried after reading reviews and even having a friend tell me she returned hers (she has extremely short and WIDE legs).  I had no problem installing it onto a bike while my toddler was moving the bike around.  4 bolts and installing the seat.  He LOVED!!!  it.  I pushed him around in it for a bit and he went crazy calling out and bouncing.  He's 26 pounds and it held up really well. Limit of 40 lbs.    He really liked being up front, I am totally scared to death to have him trailing at ground level in  one of those trailers, eeeppp!  No way!  this is the way to go, I can see his little body and tell how he's reacting the whole time, plus he's secure in his seat with a full frontal view.    To solve the mystery on how to ride the bike with this, it's just like riding a bike normally.  I have long and sort of wide legs.  I may have been holding my knees a little furhter apart than I normally do but it was NOT noticable.    I go for short errands around town or bike on trails.  So Much Fun.!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|movie was awesome. can't wait till part two next year. love jason statham and the rest. awesome funny moments and fight scenes. all around a good movie. watched it in the theatre on opening weekend to a packed viewing room. got it for my fiance again as a gift for our anniversary and valentine's gift combined for this year.
B00000K3D4|5.0|until somebody f'ed it up for me by telling me it was about sexuality and growing up. i watched this movie as an escape,a fantasy movie that was more than just a movie for me. i dont like it when people ruin movies for me by telling me that they are about growing up and teenage coming of age crap. somehow its not the same anymore from when i used to watch it and now after somebody told me that. how about justing letting it be what it was suppose to be, a fantasy movie.
B004KO803G|5.0|I can only say good things about purchasing this RED FANG's vinyl. The vinyl itself is kind of psychedelic-green, if I can say that. It truly hypnotizes you into watching it turn and turn, while the music produces some sort of profound, but raw, stoner soundtrack. The package came really fast, remembering that I'm from Brazil. It even came first than the Ghost - Opus Eponymous' vinyl I bought [first] - maybe I should e-mail Amazon.com about this.  Nevertheless, the safety aspect of the packaging amazed me, 'cause I'm used to order internationally, but the items never come 100% intact. If you ever ordered something, anywhere, anytime, in your whole life, you know what I'm talking about. Amazon.com, contrary to the ordinary, sent a TRUE safe package where my vinyl, certainly, chilled and had a nice trip.  So, the product itself is great. Red Fang is growing each day and, I believe, they totally deserve it! I just can't get enough of it... Will Red Fang come to Brazil? Not sure, but hope so.  Amazon.com's fast delivery and heavy safety couldn't get any better.    Buy it.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|This fits my JVC Everio perfectly. It holds 2 SDHC cards and an extra battery. It is well padded and my husband really likes that he can attach it to his belt to carry it. Would highly recommend this bag
B0042U2HLY|5.0|Excellent recording by a major Bruckner interpreter. I especially was intrigued by the way Wand took the 4th symphony at a pretty good clip, making the horn passages lighter and more nimble as a result. Each disc contains revelations.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|Minus 1 star for BluRay playback problems!    Thanks Sony. A wonderful movie that we enjoyed in the theaters and a somehow you have found a way to spoil the enjoyment at home (or at least take the luster off the shine).     The DVD playback is great if you don't need the HD version, but Sony's own BluRay format playing on a new and SW updated Sony PS3 Slim (the ideal combination right?) has playback problems! I've read other players have playback problems too, so check the Internet if you haven't checked your system first to see.    On the PS3 it hangs and stutters at random times on the video playback. Audio is always fine and uninterrupted. A query on Google shows me that many others are having the same problem. Luckily there seems to be some solutions. If you have this issue, you need to delete the Rio data (Under Video>BD Data Utility menu on PS3) *and* disable the internet for playback, very convenient (not!). I hope Sony will figure out why their own stuff is broken.     This doesn't seem limited to a certain batch of discs, the bluray .com forum seems to believe it's player specific, so some folks will enjoy the movie in HD without having to bother, most likely if you're not using a Sony player.    This review reflects the problems I've experienced on 8/14 as we watched it together as a family on BluRay. This is for the 3 pack (BluRay,DVD and Digital copy). Save your money and get this on DVD or wait for it streaming.
B002ZG99QS|2.0|Tron Legacy (to me) was a squel that came out of no where.Perhaps I just wasn't aware of it, but when it came and went in the theater this past Christmas,I shrugged it off after word of mouth which were not very supportive opinions of the film.Well,I can honestly say that I was happy to have waited for it to arrived on video. There was not a great deal of emphisis put into the screenplay.It basically plays off as somewhat of a carbon copy of the original. Sam Flynn gets zapped back into the grid and put into a collossium/gladiator type competition while looking for his father and evading the evil \\"CLUE\\". What you have here is a film that obviously the larger portion of the budget was put into the CG and the aethestic overall look of the film.I've said this before in a number of film reviews and \\"incredible FX\\" while impressive to see on screen don't make for a good film.It gets boring(really boring) when all there is to see is the CG. Tron Legacy is plagued with a thin plot and uninteresting characters and nothing more.Tron Legecy offers little to nothing to the viewer and those who hold interest in the original Tron film.It had the potential to be a promising continuation of the original story, but quickly deflates after you are introduced to the digital world.While there may have been good intentions in the pre-production to develope a good story and script, it obviously got lost somewhere along the way and the \\"secondary\\" rough draft(which is how this film plays) was chosen over putting more time into developing a better screen play.Not even the tallents of Jeff Bridges could save this film.I wouldn't waste my money buying this DVD and I have serious doubts the 3d version  will play as well as it did in the theater.\\"The Matrix\\" is a far better film in terms of alternate universe plots.In this reviewer's opinion, Disney should have put more tallent into the writing rather than the fancy sets,costumes and CG.What a waste of money.
0765318741|5.0|Purchased as a replacement for a damaged library book. Found by searching ISBN number and got the exact edition that the library wanted.
B000002J1U|5.0|Received the CD quickly  - purchased through Movie Mars.  They have some of the best prices and a hugh selection.  Have ordered other CDs from them through Amazon.  Service is always quick and product always comes as described.    Happy CD customer in Sugar Land, TX
1576754227|5.0|Eat That Frog! is a book that a few of my favorite authors have recommended, but I never picked up a copy until last week. Very glad that I did, it is an excellent time management/productivity book that gets right to the point. Even if you just pick three concepts to implement, any three concepts, I predict your productivity will double. Is there some obvious information in it? Sure there is, but like the author says in the introduction, this book brings the concepts to the forefront of our minds.<br /><br />* Pros:<br /><br />Very short book - can read in a couple of hours. Makes it easy to recommend.<br /><br />Information is solid and practical. Almost like a Cliff's Notes of productivity techniques.<br /><br />Some great questions to ask of yourself and to ask of those you are mentoring.<br /><br />Practical steps to implement the techniques are given at the end of each chapter, making it easy to put into practice.<br /><br />* Cons:<br /><br />Not much new information . . . not necessarily a con, but it is what it is.<br /><br />Further reading suggestions for any given topic would have made this an outstanding work.<br /><br />In short, this is one of the best and probably the first I would recommend to others. Getting started on projects/businesses/writing books and getting more done in less time is a skill that all of us need, and this book will help you get there. Will definitely be buying more copies to give away to others. Highly Recommended.
B001B7CNXI|4.0|I don't hold any slavish devotion to the original \\"Miami Vice\\" series. I watched it as a kid with my parents in the '80s and I enjoyed it for what it was: a cool and colorful cop show, no more, no less. So I guess I was the perfect audience for this new version, in that I was aware of the older version without being entrenched in it (i.e., I wasn't going to start a petition if Colin Farrell wasn't wearing rolled-up sleeves, pastels and sockless loafers). I thought the movie was good, if not as great as it could have been. Jamie Foxx brings some surprising intensity in the role of Tubbs (even getting to imitate his former co-star Tom Cruise's moves from \\"Collateral\\" in an early club scene); Farrell was adequate, if a little wooden, as Crockett. They didn't have the chemistry that Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas had, which is underscored by the fact that Foxx and Farrell don't have many one-on-one scenes together. (Also, it was hard to keep from snickering at Crockett's goofy-looking mustache.) At the very least, \\"Miami Vice\\" goes well beyond the usual lazy, nostalgia-laden updated of most films based on old TV shows, and Michael Mann still has a unique eye for realistic action sequences that would baffle any other director.    Leaving aside my thoughts on the film itself, this Blu-Ray is visually and aurally stunning. Furthermore, it perfectly represents the director's intent. Some people have said that this Blu-Ray release is subpar or lacking compared to the DVD. These people are wrong. For those complaining about excessive grain: the night scenes are always going to be grainy, because Mann shot most of the night scenes on HD video with low and/or natural light. The daylight scenes are razor-sharp. Again, I cannot stress this enough: Mann MEANT the film to look like this. You may not like the technique, but it's not the fault of Universal or whatever company that authored the Blu-Ray. If you're saying that you'd actually prefer to have digital noise reduction applied where it wasn't meant to be applied (and counter to the director's intent) then I don't know what to say to that one.    Take it from someone who saw the movie in the theater, on DVD and on Blu-Ray: on home video, this is the way to watch Miami Vice.
1416905014|5.0|Beautifully done...a great addition to my pop up collection...enjoy many hours of reading fun with my granddaughter...just love these books
0756656230|1.0|It's a lovely book, but not a construction manual as I expected - its the history of particular bits of lego, not how to build different things.
B000068FXR|3.0|CD was only in fair condition and it was not disclosed the cd came from a library so it was heavily used. CD did work ok.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|I really like this product. I like the neon keyboard the best, but feel that it doesn&apos;t capture my words the best. I would say that this 85% of the time spells my stuff right but sometimes the auto correction after hitting space is annoying. Also wish the keys looked a little separated on all the styles not just the light.. overall good product. only can get better.
B004M20YDU|5.0|I bought this Tron music CD thinking it will give me chance to listen to music that is modern and different from the rest of music you hear and it indeed was the case. I really enjoyed this music compilation and I listen to it once in a while, the track Grid is really nice. There are few other good tracks on the CD that made me put my speaking to max ... if you understand the passion behind Tron and if you want to be there at times while listening to it this compilation is for you.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|Most of the discs played but there were a couple that had certain episodes that wouldn't play or wouldn't play the whole thing just the beginning. That's awful especially if you are watching Sex and the City for the first time and when doing a Marathon. I really wish I could have watched all of them but I still love the series!!!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I listened to this CD for the first time and thought wow music is at times sad and at times inspiring how did this really mix these two together it is really an impossible task to bring sadness and encouragement at the same time in same record. And if you want to know how it is possible listen to this compilation and you will really enjoy and find a reason to attach yourself to the music.<br /><br />I read somewhere the movie (I haven't watched the movie yet) is about a man who goes to Japan to fight against them and then at the end devotes himself to the cause and I can see that from music how music is sad at times and inspiring at times and it lets you hear the story from the sounds of music. I really love this compilation.
0091940737|5.0|This book pulls no punches, gives great hope, makes one sad, makes one laugh, makes one squirm, makes one think. In other words, it does what Caitlin's writing always does, but more so. If you are a woman you have to read it. If you are a man you really ought to. The rest of you, stand down.

B0015DROBO|4.0|Hard to grade this one- where as most of it was totally amazing, there is the beginning and the end that pulls it down for me because really, the best part of the story is when the protags were chasing down a killer- which only happens in the middle of the story, oddly enough. (The beginning and ending is almost another story all together!)<br /><br />Bestselling The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo begins with investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist being hung out to dry for a piece he wrote that went horribly wrong. Through much of the beginning and to a lesser extent, the ending when Blomkvist gets his revenge for the happenings in the beginning, my eyes began to cross at the seemingly pointless blahdy blah blah of Larsson explaining how Blomkvist got into his current predicament.<br /><br />But really it was Blomkvist's desire to hide away from his circumstances that made him accept a job offer from eccentric former captain of industry, Henrik Vanger- a frail old man haunted by the disappearance of a long gone relative- that brings us to the exciting part. So I guess I can make the bridge as to why it began the way it did.<br /><br />Meanwhile we get to meet Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but socially awkward researcher for a private investigator, who just happens to be assigned the task of investigating Blomkvist for the Vanger family. She's secretive, sullen, punked out, and- of course- tatooed , but she does superb work. However, she finds herself distracted from her assignment when her guardianship is changed and taken over by a loathsome individual. (An individual on whom she exacts some spectacular revenge! At this point in the novel, I literally sat up, bug-eyed then dug in and didn't look up till my eyelids refused to stay open late into the night!)<br /><br />Indeed it was this insight into her character that ignites the novel and doesn't let up until the ending, especially when she eventually joins Blomkvist covertly reinvestigating the mystery surrounding Vanger's beloved niece's death under the guise of chronicling his familys' checkered history. (Btw, this part of the story totally reminded me of a Criminal Minds episode, one of my favorite tv shows!)<br /><br />Murder, intrigue, sex and violence- what more can you ask for in a mystery-thriller? It's no surprise this little beauty's been hitting the must read/bestseller lists for forever now.<br /><br />Through his body of work, Larsson ruthlessly exposes perhaps some purveying attitudes of violence toward women and anti-semitim... attitudes he must have felt were being swept under the carpet of Swedish society. I love how he boldly empowers Lisabeth in a way few women would have the intelligence and courage to pull off, yet wraps her in a vulnerability that many woman can relate to. The second protag, Blomkvist, is a man-ho to be sure, but something about his innate nobility makes him extremely likeable too.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the slooooooow beginning I would have totally given this a 5 star. But I more than really liked it- so lets split the difference with 4.5 out of 5! :)under the guise of chronicling his familys' checkered history.

B004LWZW4M|4.0|There's good reason for caution when anyone revisits a classic like 1968's \\"Planet of the Apes.\\" (Does anyone remember the 2001 remake? No? That's what I mean.) For once, the classic is safe. This movie stays safely away from the original. At the same time, though, they provide not only reason for several species of intelligent apes to arise, but also reason for humankind to make way for them. And, if you remember the original, it gave reason to think that succession took place in a relatively short time, not the millions of years evolutionary dawdling you might have expected. This movie covers that, too.<br /><br />If you look at the pieces that make this up, they seem well-worn. There's the scientist working with iconically scary bio-thingie of the day. (Ditto lots of great storied from Mary Shelley's, through the atomic mutants of the 1950s, on up to genetically engineered viruses of today.)There's the dire warning about forces that can not (and ought not) be controlled. There's the big, bad corporate profit motive, when all the scientist wants to do is help people. The hubristic attempt to quell the uprising seriously underestimates the opponent, as might be expected. And, through it all, Caesar maintains some veneer of non-violence. Tom Felton, doing another \\"I want to slap him\\" role with his usual skill, really counts as self-inflicted. Outside of that (and leading the bloody escape), Caesar either avoids or actively deters most other violence.<br /><br />Think of a chef, though, who can take ordinary ingredients and blend them into a masterful dish. That kind of skill, with the help of a beefy CGI budget, displays itself here. Each of the apes appears as unique and largely convincing, but more impoortantly projects a unique personality. By itself or in as an addition to the \\"Apes\\" tradition, \\"Rise\\" stands out as one of the better popcorn movies so far this year.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The fiction and myth contained in the bible is well presented in the app. It&apos;s hard to believe that millions of people actually think this stuff is truth. Everyone knows Jesus was just a dude who could tell an awesome story. Now, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the one true god.
0307279189|5.0|Fantastic book.  Not only does it inspire you, but the research is very informative on human behavior and physiology.  And the storyline compells you to the very finish.  One of the best books I've read in years.
B001HN6922|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this movie!  I LOVED IT!  My husband loved it, as did our 2 year old.    The first movie was super cute with a great message.  This movie stepped it up a notch and turned the storyline into action and fun.  I also love that Mater is the main character.  My son is obsessed with Mater.  I can honestly say he is our favorite character too.    I am not sure why others did not like this movie, other than everyone having their own opinions and taste.
B00005JNQA|2.0|The cast is good, but the story is very weak, a teenager could have written it. Often cheesy as well. Moreover, it's hard to believe DSS will retain such an employee who is going through serious personal issues. One can't blame the technicians if the design itself is crappy. This is a crappy movie, despite the top tier cast, simply because the story was not properly set.

B003LQMZS0|3.0|First of all, my son LOVES this toy!  The feet have fun, interactive objects.  The colors are bright.  He holds it by the neck and flips it around and around.  He's liked it since he was 2 months old.  He's 6 months old now.<br /><br />Here's the problem... one of the feet has a mirror on it... the black and white circle foot.  This MIRROR insert came loose and presents a choking hazard if the child can pull it off... mine started too.<br /><br />I contacted KIDS II... the customer person (no clue btw!) suggested I needed to remove the plastic covering on the mirror and that the packaging states to remove film covers, etc.  Well, that was NOT the problem and she clearly does not understand.  I KNOW that you need to remove plastic films from toys...duh!  The actual MIRROR can come loose and come off in the child's mouth and choke them.<br /><br />I have removed the mirror insert now and given the toy back to my son, but POO POO on KIDS II for having no clue on this issue and not even attempting to correct it.<br /><br />Parents, just be aware and remove the mirror.  Feel free to contact KIDS II also and tell them what you think if you feel the same way.<br /><br />UPDATE (3-2012):  Kids II discussed this item with me and sent a replacement.  This one is slightly better, but my son doesn't have an interest in it anymore.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I saw the trailer for the movie and decided that I wanted to read the book.  It was a twist (to me) on the movie Same Time Next Year.<br /><br />The book was a bit difficult to get into, I though, but after you settle in, it becomes compelling.  It centers around Em and Dex, who meet on their graduation day from university.  Over the next 20 years, they continue to meet on this same day.<br /><br />Their lives take different twists and turns through jobs, relationships and even parenthood.  But their connection remains the same, even when they think that they might really hate each other.<br /><br />I won't spoil the book with more details. I will simply say that I was moved by it, at different times sad, angry, and happy.  It was very well-written.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|Rush is just amazing and this CD is a must have for any fan.  They keep getting better and better.
B004R96TN2|5.0|This is a beautiful collaboration between Wendy and Brian Froud.  Wendy's interpretation of each Fae card is gorgeous.  The cards resonate intuitively and \\"work\\" every time.  No smoke and mirrors. No special training needed to do the readings. Just sit quietly and focus. The needed faeries will come to you.    This makes a lovely gift for anyone needing some comfort in their lives.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|fun app after you play the tutorial. difficult without knowing how to play, haha. why does this review have to be 20 words?
B0054TK99E|5.0|Really into the series, it's fun, funny, romantic, and has enough horror to satisfy the Wolf in anybody, I know it's aimed at a young audience, I'm not (72 male body builder) so I guess that's the reason for the downloads only, sure it's convenient, but the quality isn't there, nowhere near BR, so why not do both? I don't do downloads because of quality concerns, so unless they do it on disc, I guess I'm out of luck, I wonder? am I the only one?
B004YXE438|5.0|I got this when it was free. This app is so great I just had to write a review (my first review!). It is so addicting. Options available to make it easy or challenging. Definitely worth the $1.49!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Honestly engaging labyrinth type puzzles gradually increase in challenge and complexity; beginning levels are tutorial and quite easy, and solving them in the minimum number of moves earns hints to spend if you get stuck later. This game kept me fully involved, yet completely without frustration. Lovely smooth graphics, good music, and intuitive interface all contribute to a really excellent game experience - I was hooked as soon as I picked it up, and played nearly half an hour when I only meant to try it for a few minutes. There's a short \\"coming soon\\" popup shown in the game for another version; I can't wait.
B004WJREMW|4.0|Disappointed with the extra tracks. Very thin and probably won't be listened to much. No extra liner notes. Good sound quality. I know that the super-deluxe hardback set has better extras, but come on, it is too expensive, and the original Beatles albums didn't get such lavish attention; does McCartney's solo efforts warrant it?<br />This double disc set should have had more extras included. If only so the common fan could afford it.<br /><br />Update: I have to say that the bonus tracks grow on you. All You Horse Riders, while seeming insipid by its title, is actually a very catchy tune, and it is partnered with Blue Sway (one of 2 versions on this set). I actually love McCartney's spoken/sung ring-master vocals on Horse Riders. It is innocent and a bit haunting. Sounds a bit like Duke Ellington speaking.<br /><br />I forgot just how great an album this is, and I am changing my 3 starts to 4.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Please do yourself a favor and buy this album. The songs are so addicting and catchy that it makes you want to dance like crazy. I don't know where this band came from it seems like they came out of nowhere but their music is worth listening to. Every track is perfect and the lyrics are fun to sing along....these guys define Indie music at it's finest....
B003Y5H53S|4.0|I am a lover of all movies that entertain or speak to me.  I found this movie quite hilarious but with phrases like \\"I'll shoot the ugly off your face\\" and the amount of smoking,drinking,and dishonesty it is NOT for the younger ones.  It is unfortunate that most parents will say it's animated, what harm could it be.  Please heed my warning and watch it BEFORE showing your kids!!!
B0006GVJEE|5.0|This movie shaped my taste in movies for my entire life. Of course, back then no one had any idea that we were watching an edited flick. The simple premise explores some very complex characters: an assassin with a conscience (played brilliantly by Jean Reno) and a streetwise girl too tough for her age (a beautiful and tragic Natalie Portman). The two characters are drawn together by violence and violence becomes their emotional tether.<br /><br />The unedited version we get here is very, very dark. The assassin agrees to teach the young girl the skills of the hitman. Soon, he is taking the girl on jobs and she becomes a tool of the trade and she quickly decides for herself when she is 'ready'.<br /><br />There is a wonderful complexity in the main protagonist's life: Gary Oldman. He plays a drug-addicted DEA officer with a very explosive personality. He's as crooked as they come, and Oldman is probably scarier than he normally is. And this portrayal cemented his strengths as an actor. None of this overshadows the Professional and his young sidekick, both dancing a razor's edge and never really appropriate behavior. This is not a film for everyone, and do keep in mind this is an unrated version of the film. If you can stomach the morality, or lack thereof, then you are in for a treat. Nothing is simple and despite the seriousness of the film, there are a few scenes with comedy gold. But the humour is dark in most cases, so it fits with the film's mood.<br /><br />The special features aren't up to par when compared to the unedited movie. We see a 10 year retrospective, an interview of both protagonists, a running track of trivia, and that's about it. We are given a 5.1 DTS audio track and HD visuals. You're buying the film, not a bunch of bells and whistles. But there is more than enough in the film alone to guarantee a 5-star review. It is simply 'that good'.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This was force-downloaded onto my Droid this morning.  WTF!!!  I will never buy a Kindle because of this, and Amazon is going to hear from me.  I've never requested ANY apps from Amazon, so how they could think I would want this I have no idea.    Verizon says it can't control what 3rd parties can download into my phone if they have my phone number, which Amazon says it needs for deliveries.  I have to install it before I can remove/uninstall it, can't just delete, and I don't want to install it!  This really pisses me off.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Though the season is a lot shorter than most runs, it barely takes a full episode to come to understand the pacing and mood. Fan favourite Nathan Fillion plays Richard Castle, a long time best-selling author with incredible wit and charisma. He dotes on his daughter (played beautifully by Molly Quinn) and adores his mother (Susan Sullivan). There is obviously a great chemistry between this television family.<br /><br />And then comes Detective Kate Beckett (a hard role to do justice, yet performed with subtle grace by Stana Katic), a hard-edged supercop who also happens to be a fan of the titular character. So when a crime scene mimics one that Castle has written into a novel, the detective goes to gain some insight from her literary guilty pleasure.<br /><br />And from there, comedy and crime drama explode like you wouldn't believe.<br /><br />There have been an annoying surge of crime dramas, some better, some worse. It is my opinion Castle ranks among the best. This season features a few commentaries, a few featurettes and a 5.1 digital sound track. I try pretty hard to avoid spoilers if at all possible, so I'll try and sum things up as best as possible: if you enjoy Fillion's other performances (Firefly and Serenity, White Noise 2, Slither) then you must watch this series as it is a more nuanced feel with many subtle layers. And of course, his real-world wit and charisma. He carries the show very well and it is easy to see why the show has been picked up for more seasons.<br /><br />This is one of the better shows currently on television; don't miss out on this one!
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Ben Affleck, not only can you act, you have some serious directorial chops.  Case in point:  THE TOWN, a taunt, tight, violent whirlwind of a movie centering around a gang of robbers in the Charlestown projects of Boston.  Affleck plays Doug MacRay, the leader of the gang; MacRay is a most reluctant robber, tormented and troubled by his violent existence, and when he falls in love with the bank manager of one of his heists (Rebecca Hall, who is stellar in her own right), he realizes it's time to leave his turbulent neighborhood behind--except circumstances won't allow, culminating in a Fenway Park heist that goes tragically awry.<br /><br />Not only is the cast exceptional, but Affleck moves the viewer through the story, the dialogue, the character interactions, and the streets of Beantown with a rugged authenticity that is staggering.  This film gets up and moves, and the action is as intense as it is mesmerizing.  Kudos to the rest of the cast, including Jon Hamm as a tightly wound FBI agent, Chris Cooper in a brief appearance as MacRay's prison-dwelling father, and Pete Postlethwaite as a gum-chewing, almost creepy, mob boss.  Yet Jeremy Renner stands out handsomely as Jem, MacRay's violent, hot-tempered best friend.  Renner is an up-and-coming superstar, and with the look and feel of THE TOWN, Affleck is one impressive director.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is one of those rare film that goes straight to soul and plants a powerfully inspirational message...No one can watch this film without having more faith in themselves, in Life and in the God that most of Hollywood wants us to forget...
B004MARLJ2|4.0|Pretty fun little game. Clean and simple interface and the tutorial explains things pretty well. Would be cool if the animals were animated but then file size would go up. Overall good game. They have some other good games as well.
B000000XB9|5.0|Not everybody likes Southern Rock but, these guys were just excellent, regardless of what you decide to classify them as. Right here, you have clear proof of the influence of the Blues on real Rock n Roll. All, and I do mean all, the songs on this collection are classic hits. The sound quality is really good, considering how old the recordings are. The only thing is, if you're a hardcore CCR fan, you may find the odd fade out in the end of a couple songs, to be annoying. Also, if you're a hardcore CCR fan, you will probably make a list of songs, you wanted on here but, that weren't here. That is precisely why there is a Chronicle volume 2!
0756404738|5.0|I love to read. I have read all of J.R.R Tolkien's works, as well as almost any fantasy novel you can name. This is on par with the quality of written i have only found previously in J.R.R Tolkien's books. I have never given that compliment before and probably never will again. That compliment is solely reserved for the one and only Patrick Rothfuss!
B00006JIA4|5.0|This is a 3 CD collection of music by the Rock band Queen. The first disc has everything the casual listener is likely to know. Songs on disc 1 include: \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"Somebody To Love\\". Disc 2 has lesser known hits but, known to the majority of Queen's fanbase. Songs on disc 2 include: \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"One Vision\\", \\"The Miracle\\". The final disc features odd songs and remixes. Songs on disc 3 include: \\"Princes Of The Universe\\", \\"Thank God, It's Christmas\\", \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\". All in all, this is a great set but, it is missing a few songs, like \\"39\\" and \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\". For the money this is worth it. I only hope this is not the only Queen music, you are ever planning to purchase, as there are a great amount of other hits.

B000JQU4TW|5.0|This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle.
B004HO6HWA|3.0|The 2011 \\"Mechanic\\" is an action thriller starring Jason Statham, with some bloody fistfights and shootouts, plus occasional explosions. The stunts are very good and the leading actors Statham and Ben Foster are not bad, but don't expect originality or surprises. Ignore the film's clichéd storyline and one-dimensional characters. This is an action film with a modest budget, and is enjoyable as such.     Jason Statham is Arthur Bishop, an elite contract killer who believes \\"the best jobs are the ones nobody even knows you were there.\\" And he never disappoints his employer Dean (Tony Goldwyn), whose recent assignment involves assassination in a heavily guarded location. Bishop's presence should not be known by anyone (other than the target, who gets killed anyway).    Things get complicated and messy when Bishop's latest target happens to be someone he least expected. After that, Steve (Ben Foster, excellent), a young and angry son of Bishop's mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland: excellent but too brief), shows up before him. Bishop takes Steve under his wing, training him as a perfect \\"mechanic.\\".     \\"The Mechanic\\" is a remake of a 1972 film starring Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent. Not having seen the original, I have nothing to say about it. The updated version, set in New Orleans, is directed by Simon West, whose CV as director includes \\"Con Air\\" and \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\\" and produced by Millennium Films and Nu Image.     Despite its recycled story and uninspired direction, \\"The Mechanic\\" is a reasonably entertaining action film with some nice stunts.
B000000OAN|5.0|I am well aware of the fact, that just about every sane Rock music fan, knows and loves \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". This entire album, could not even have that song and it would still, be awesome. The reason why, is very simple: Queen were the greatest experimental musicians who ever existed and one of the greatest Rock groups who ever existed. Their legacy will live forever. This is the evidence, right here. From the pre-Hair Metal \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\", to the comedic poetry-style \\"Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon\\". Everything on this album, has a unique sound, that does not match anything else. This has pretty much always been, a classic and it truly deserves all the praise it has received over 35 years. The one problem, is the bonus remixes. They suck and should not be on this album, at all.
0345529057|1.0|I wish I never bought it!    I understand everyone likes different things but I personally haven't read a book this bad in a long time.    No offense to those who loved it, just not my cup of tea.    I could tell you why but just thinking about this book makes me...
B0036S4C6G|1.0|I started to read this book and after finishing a pretty good chunk, I found myself repeatedly saying, &#34;Who cares?&#34; and decided that there were more better books to devote my time to.  I did what I rarely do and just stopped reading.
B004YXE438|5.0|A very well made app that provides you with hours of fun and relaxation. The interface is well designed and the puzzles get harder as you go on.
159420229X|4.0|Memory is the operating software of our brain.  It is a database of our emotional experiences aggregated and converted to a worldview and narrative that permit us to relate to others as well as position ourselves strategically in life.  There are no \\"objective\\" memories because all of our memories must somehow fit int our worldview and self-narrative, and there's a lot of editing and redacting during this process.  With the operating software that is our memory, our brains view the world through the lens of our memory, often at any present moment filling in the majority of what we \\"see\\" with our eyes with memory.      Joshua Foer does not deal with this understanding of memory, and thus his entire book is flawed.  \\"Moonwalking with Einstein\\" is the tricks and strategies people use to prove they have the best \\"memory\\" in the world, but they have a very biased and ignorant understanding of memory.  Memory is not used to memorize decks of cards, but rather to enable us to decipher and decode human relationships and interaction.  Thus, people with the best memories are successful politicians, entrepreneurs, and others who know how to deal intimately with people.  The individuals profiled in this book -- who can memorize pi to the 80,000th digit -- are nothing more than a bunch of social misfits.      If Foer spent more time telling his story of how he finished first in the American competitive memory contest it would have made for a more interesting narrative.  Instead, he tries too hard to understand and decipher the meaning of memory.
0596805888|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It's how I would write a book.  Very personable, fun, intellectual, informational, scientific, holds your attention, and just plain ol' good reading.<br /><br />Totally got my teen and young adult techno kids interested in cooking... they could relate.  For example, converting metric on page 19 (loved this page): 1cm=width of a microSD card, 3cm=length of SD card, 15cm= Bic pen, 2.5m=ceiling, 5kph=walking, 75kph=raptor, 100kph=slow highway...<br /><br />Kids loved it so much they have renamed the kitchen... it's now The Lab and their father is not allowed in there when experiments (cooking) are being conducted<br /><br />HIGHLY recommend this book... it's a real hoot.

1849163847|5.0|The novel is set on the remote island of Lewis far off the coast of northern Scotland. This is an area that the author will know well since he spent several years there producing and filming the Gaelic language TV series, Machair. This gives an authenticity to the very strong descriptions of this remote, rugged, weather-beaten corner of the British Isles. In particular, May's description of the annual guga (gannet) hunt is fascinating both in its detail and in the light it sheds on the island community's strong attachment to its ancient traditions.<br /><br />DS Fin MacLeod is sent back to Lewis to investigate a murder that resembles one that took place earlier in his Edinburgh patch. Returning home after 20 years away, Fin is thrown into remembering and re-assessing his difficult childhood and adolescence. The book alternates between the present day and Fin's past and it gradually emerges that the shadow of that past may be involved in the current investigation.<br /><br />At first, I found the alternation between the present and the past irritating as it seemed to break the flow of the story. However, as the links between the two became clearer, the tension gradually mounted and came finally to an unexpected and dramatic climax. Along the way, May describes a community more inclined to deal with problems internally rather than involving the authorities, a place where the young people are beginning to challenge the traditions and strict religious observances of their elders and where dark secrets can sometimes come back to haunt.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Regardless of the type of literature that you may usually prefer, \\"World War Z\\" is likely a book you will enjoy. Although fiction, it contains aspects of nonfiction, historical literature, biography, sci-fi, and numerous other genres all creatively blended into a single book.    And, \\"creative\\" is unquestionably this book's hallmark. The authors presentation of his story is unique. And this unique presentation is part of what pulls the reader into the book by placing it in an interview format with which we are all familiar and see regularly in our daily lives. Additionally, the variations that the author places on the zombie mythos make the book even more intriguing, especially when he explores aspects of zombies that many of us may never have considered.    Finally, despite this being a book about zombies, it manages to be somewhat horrifying without being the stuff of nightmares. As a result, even those who are squeamish about horror, will find this book very accessible. Because the entire book takes place after the fact, it removes the questions of survival from the equation, eliminating a large amount of the stress normally encountered in zombie literature.
1440503257|5.0|I was on a search for the perfect Butterbeer recipe.  One without ice cream in it.  Anyway, I came across this book and though it didn't have a Butterbeer recipe in it, I thought I'd get it.  It was a good price and I really expected just a flimsy cheesy book, but I didn't really care.  What I got was this beautiful hardback book with aged pages and tons of recipes!  I was so surprised!  The recipes are easy to follow and I love how it includes a little history about the dish and where to find it in the Harry Potter books!  I love this book and when I get my own kitchen I'm going to be cooking up a Harry Potter storm!  The only complaint I have about this book is the lack of a Butterbeer recipe!  It's a wonderful book, I'm very happy with it and I can't wait to make Hagrid's Rock Cakes!... the edible kind of course.  ;)
B000K7VHQE|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever watched from beginning to end.  It was nothing but a bunch of entirely unlikeable characters doing one stupid thing after another.  The only reason it was rated R and not PG was because of the Grandpa character, played by Alan Arkin, whose only accomplishment was seeing how many times he could say the F word in the mercifully small amount of time he was on the screen.  Paul Dano played a teenager who went from being silent (idiotic) to incredibly whiny (even worse).  An then after Grandpa died they continued to a beauty pageant where they all got thrown out after the girl did a striptease act.  Just as well - Grandpa didn't deserve a proper burial anyway.
0810983915|3.0|As a reader, I discovered the adventures of Greg Huffley during a nine month lull between job opportunities. Unlike our \\"hero\\" Greg, I can only play video games for so long before they lose their luster. Call it maturity call it what ever you want, I find it impossible to spend endless hours in front of a TV like I could in my youth, and in all honesty I wouldn't want to. Still, such personal revelations aside, I came across these books when I was looking for something non-video based to stimulate my mind and keep me sane during the aforementioned period. As if the popularity of the series wasn't enough of a clue, I ate the first three books up and quickly asked for seconds. A few months later I had \\"Dog Days\\" in my hands the day of its release. An hour after getting the book, I was more puzzled than entertained and the reason why would remain a mystery for quite a while.    Thankfully, that innocent little devil known as time as revealed to me why \\"Dog Days\\" and it's follow up \\"The Ugly Truth\\" aren't as strong as those in the original trio. In a nutshell, Greg Huffley, is a brat. I can't believe it took me four books to realize this but Greg is the poster child for the everyday American brat who is incapable of appreciating anything. I know this probably isn't a particularly surprising or interesting statement coming from someone who doesn't particularly like children or doesn't really care for reflecting on his own childhood (which is ironically what attracted me to these books in the first place) but it's downright hilarious - a.k.a. sad - that Kinney has made a fortune selling children a dead-on reflection of how fickle and shallow they can be. It's so brilliant it's like selling bottled water.    As nauseating as Greg's behavior has become, I find myself more attracted to Rowley and Mr. Jefferson. While I could never see Rowley headlining a series, it's amazing how Rowley is free of all the negativity that weighs Greg down. Rowley never lets anything get in theway of enjoying the moment (unless he's with Greg who isn't immune to outside pressures) and we all know when the two \\"break up\\" it's Greg who gets the short end of the stick and is miserable, not Rowley. As for Mr. Jefferson, I would get just as aggravated over Greg's antics, and I'd almost go as far as to disallow my *pretend* son to hang out with someone so thoughtless. Okay, so everything in Rowleyland isn't perfect - his parents are a bit too clingy and overprotective - but I think that's a decent trade off when compared to the delusions Greg's mother has about his \\"wonderful\\" summer at the end of the book.    In the end, \\"Dog Days\\" is as intriguing as it is disappointing. The unfortunate part of such an equation is whether or not younger readers really understand the inner machinations of these characters - which ones should really be embraced and which ones should not. Maybe I'm not giving kids enough credit, but given the main character falls in the latter category and is so celebrated I'm somewhat doubtful of the message getting across. Kinney is a clever author so I'm sure this is all part of his plan, but in the end the results aren't always attractive.
1416583432|4.0|This is a great book for anyone who loves their dog(s) and wants to understand them better. This book talks a lot about the science behind dog behavior which was interesting, but at times it lost me a bit. However, I feel like I will better be able to understand my dog and be a better dog owner. If you love your dog then this is a great book for you!
0062060554|2.0|Not the worst book ever, but almost.  The ending was disappointing. Typos and poorly constructed sentences. Characters  undeveloped and 2-dimensional. Lots of going in circles with plot and repetition of feelings without ever getting reader emotionally connected with the main characters.  Figured out the \\"twist\\" at about the middle of the book. Dumb.

B003V4AK8E|4.0|Let me state first and foremost that I am not a huge fan of Playstation's dual shock controller.  I've always thought it was an awkward, fiddly thing especially with games that make good use of both shoulder buttons.  That having been said I found the Pro Elite wireless a breath of fresh air.  I did like the material on the handles which feel quite comfortable during long gaming segments.  The button and analog stick layout is much appreciated as well.  As to criticisms?  Well, the recharge cord is painfully short.  If my battery runs dead I have to scooch right up to the teevee so I can continue playing without having to resort to the carpal tunnel associated with the dual shock controller.  The analog sticks don't feel quite as precise as the 360's do--I don't know if this is an issue as my play style is far more casual and I don't do any competitive online gaming so I can't give any definitive report one way or another.    If you despise the dual shock, or simply want to save a few bucks you could do a heck of a lot worse than the Pro Elite Wireless Controller.

1400052181|5.0|I am amazed at what authors go through sometimes to tell a story that means so much to them.  The last such story I remember reading was the story of sea biscuit.  This story was fascinating not only because of the story itself but also because of the author's efforts to make the book happen. The author herself was a part of the story. It was not easy on her. I acknowledge that.  The family had been so greatly damaged by the whole ordeal. It is awful to lose your mother. We saw the impact on her children's lives very clearly. It was heartbreaking. This is a very deep story.  So in this book we get so much it's surprising.  Henrietta was a fine African American women. The cervical cancer (HPV) swept her away. It just snuffed out her life.  Life is unfair.  But then there was the story of her cells which are a new life form, no longer human that sprang from her. They had her genetic material and more and we also saw in this book the life of these cells and they are really something else. Very hard to fathom just what they are but surely they help us to understand cells which are a part of who we are. So the story of the cells and their evolution since leaving Henrietta's body was fascinating. Life is so powerful and that extends to cell life.  The family was kept in the dark and they had been suffering so much.  It was sad to see how much Henrietta's children suffered.  I tell you I didn't like Henrietta's husband at all. I have no sympathy for him ... just was totally selfish.  Also the ethical issues brought forth in this book are important.  This book also presented a history of medical ethics.  That was very disturbing.  This book is very worth reading.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Non-offensive lyrics and melodically pleasing. I actually find the first three songs that were used as singles to be more catchy than Taylor Swift's songs. The only song I don't like is \\"Lasso\\"--for whatever reason, it just feels way too slow. Anyways, it's the kind of album I can just enjoy while I'm working (and since \\"Lasso\\" is the last song, I just play the album in order and go back to the first song \\"You Lie\\" when I want to start again with the upbeat songs). I can even play it on speakers and not worry about suggestive lyrics (I mostly listen to pop songs).

B000002KIK|5.0|At this point in Ozzy's tenure with Sabbath, he was long gone. However, that left Iommi to experiment. And as a result, taken on its own, you have an excellent album that is just solo-centric. Practically a Jam Band album, really.    And for that, it is beautiful.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What people dont seem to realize is how badly the effects for the original trilogy have aged. Has anyone watched the original trilogy as of late. Does anyone realize how many different versions of the original trilogy exist with different dubbing on the stormtroopers and other minor characters. Lets not forget the versions with different camera angles that have aired in the US and UK. The theatrical and TV versions differed in alot of ways. On Blu Ray the movies would be unwatchable unless they digitized some scenes and that would take a major restoration of the movies which Lucas is unwilling to do. The simple truth is that the effects just would not cut it by todays standards. The only way we will EVER get the original released again would be if the original films went into public domain or if they simply decided to offer it as a premium or exclusive somewhere...but dont expect them to be remastered. Lucas himself is embarrased by the originals so why would he want them released. They were released with the 2 disk editions a few years back with existing masters and everyone still complained. Sure they were non anamoprhic, but the majority of us grew up watching this move in low resolution to begin with. Everybody here is complaining, but they still will buy this set even if they gave it one star. Best advise would be to enjoy these movies the way they are since the creator decided that these are the definitive versions. To be honest the alterations are a major improvement (except for the greedo scene, which I could live with)and only adds to the enjoyment of the films. As for the films being only in 4k instead of 8k makes no difference unless you plan to watch these movies on a 200\\" inch screen. If you have a screen below 100\\", these will do just fine. What everyone should really be complaining about is the packaging. If you love your discs, buy seperate cases to keep them in cause this packaging will destroy your discs.   Also 95% of the public simply doesnt careabout the original trilogy....and lucasfilm wont spend the money to appease the 5%, it would be bad business. Lucas will make money on these films either way. Buy this set and enjoy them for what they are.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was surprisingly good. I'm normally weary-minded when I hear the term \\"teenage-novel\\" but the premise kept peeking my interest. I was happy that I bought it and it lives up to the hype.    I wasn't really sure how a novel about a televised fight-to-the-death competition could somehow constitute teenage reading but the author made a wise choice of not going into long gruesome detail about every death and I guess your mind will allow you to go as far as you'd like. The heart of the novel is definitely Katniss, the protagonist, but what sets her apart from so many other female leads is that she's neither a lovelorn girl nor a cold-hearted person devoid of any emotion. You get the feeling that she's a real human being who has had to adapt to some very serious and extreme circumstances.    Honestly, there isn't a part of the book which I can point to and say I didn't like-something that rarely happens. There were parts where I literally laughed out loud and at some point unbeknownst to me, I actually got emotionally invested in the characters. This is easily a book which I can recommend and the only thing I'm worried about is if the other books in the series can live up to this one.
B005H45INI|5.0|YES! This movie is FINALLY available in the states. I saw it in Uruguay back in '94 right after it was first released. I said it then...\\"This will NEVER be shown in the states.\\" It only took them 17 years...but they've finally proved me wrong. And this country is all the better (or worse, you be the judge) for it. It's quite a shocking film. Interested to know what others think...  The ending is a WHOPPER!

B003V4AK8E|5.0|I love my Playstation 3, it is the perfect gaming console and the only thing I could possibly say that is bad about it is the controller.  It just simply doesn't feel right, it feels like it is about break and I can say that often  it does because I have had to replace my PS3 controllers a number of times.  If you own an XBOX 360 then you will know what I mean, the controller for the 360 is designed for gamers, it is the perfect size, weight and design.  Now if you could put a 360 controller together with a PS3 then you would have the best gaming system ever!<br /><br />In comes the Pro Elite Wireless Controller by Power A.  This great controller nearly reaches video game nirvana.  It has the look and feel of a 360 controller but it is for the Playstation 3.  Add also the extra grip where you hold the controller then you have the near perfect design.  It is also a good looker, it is all black apart from the Menu button.  Performance wise, it feels like a 360 controller and definitely meets the mark.  I play games like Call of Duty and this controller keeps coming back for more.  My only complaint is that the Analogue sticks don't quite work as well as the 360 controller but they are still very good.  I haven't noticed a bad dead zone like other reviewers so maybe they have improved on that issue with the newer version of the controllers.  Last thing to mention is that this is also wireless and rechargeable via a USB charging cable just like your regular Playstation 3 controller.<br /><br />Final Verdict - even with the Analogue sticks not quite reaching the mark, I am still giving this controller 5/5.  I personally haven't found a better controller for the Playstation 3 so far.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|My daughter purchased Toms shoes and after 1 month of wearing, the shoes developed holes.  I emailed customer service with my order number etc and explained my issue.  I have not heard from them yet!  I wonder if anyone else has had an issue with Toms that is unresolved?
B000683VI4|1.0|Maybe because I'm in my mid-40s, but because the stars are younger and maybe more recognizable to the generation after me, this movie may be more appealing to them.  I just did not care for this movie. It's gotten rave reviews here, but it didn't appeal to me at all. I usually tend to see movies with actors and actresses I like not necesarily because of good reviews, critical acclaim or even awards. That may be the reason I didn't like it.  One of my favorite romantic movies of all time is Bridges of Madison County.  The Notebook didn't come close to Bridges.

I watched it (multiple times) on a new LG Infinia 55LW6500 3D LED HDTV, and a LG LHB976 Home Theater 3D system.  I'm new to 3D and the first few movies I watched were not impressive.  This one however blew me away.  It's what I show everyone when I want to show off my new system.  It's really a must have.

0451169514|5.0|Seriously,this book just sucked me in and did not let go. The characters felt like actual kids that I grew up with myself. While it's lengthy, it is worth at least one read through if you're a King fan. I'll admit the ending got a little weird for me, even by King's standards when the kids/adult go up agains the monster, \\"It\\" but it was still satisfying nonetheless.

Every episode is great except for two: The Halloween and Christmas episodes which abandon the \\"believability\\" of the show, but even these have real heartfelt and meaningful moments.
0312330855|3.0|I want to warn all Herriot devotees that in buying the omnibus editions they are NOT getting all the stories! For example in Jim's courtship of Helen, the episode of the Daffodil Ball is omitted. Let me demonstrate. 'In Let Sleeping Vets Lie' chapter twenty three begins:<br /><br />  \\"After the night of the Daffodil Ball I just seemed to drift naturally into the habit of dropping in to see Helen on an occasional evening.\\"<br /><br /> However in the omnibus edition we have:<br /><br />  \\"After the night at the cinema with Helen I just seemed to drift naturally  into the habit of dropping in to see Helen on an occasional evening\\"<br /><br />How dare they do this? I am extremely annoyed to have spent my money on these omnibus editions. I will now have to go to all lengths to get the original books which Amazon will not ship to New Zealand.<br /><br />The American publishers think they know better than James Herriot how his stories should unfold.

There is much nudity both male and female and some very odd \\"sexual\\" appetites.  Many will find this movie depraved but it does show man's inhumanity to man...

But you can tell it was a time when McCartney was either trying to find how to start the 80's. So I guess why not start from the Beginning ( McCartney I ) started well. The only complain i have is the song Coming Up which is heavy on the bass sound. You may have to give it more terrible when listening. In any case McCartney fans will love it. And for the ones that don't care, wait for the Remaster greatest hits. Enjoy

B00499K9E0|5.0|As long as I can remember I have been reading Sherlock Holmes, watching film and television adaptions with a multitude of actors. The BBC perhaps picked a strange time to create yet another version in light of the fact that a huge Blockbuster with R. Downey Jr has only just been released. Maybe they decided to try and ride the wave of publicity the film would create. Regardless of why, they have created a work of genius, of art even. They have managed to combine the Sherlock of the past with the modern society of today and they have picked an absolutely brilliant actor to do that with. I loved it and I was both annoyed and dissapointed that they only made a few episodes (apparently they have commisioned more). Benedict C. is superb and is exactly how I imagine a young Sherlock would be if he actually existed and he is supported by Martin F., who is incredibly subtle yet hilariously funny at the same time. Def. worth buying and watching.[[ASIN:B004132HZS Sherlock: Season One]]

B002JWD6AS|5.0|This is such a beautiful love story. I honestly didn't think I'd enjoy it but with soo many positive reviews I figured, why not? I wasn't disappointed AT ALL. I'm not going to give a synopsis... that's what the synopsis itself is for IMO. But I will tell you the things I did and didn't like.    Did like:  *I loved the love story between Sam & Grace... very believable despite the whole mythical creature thing of course.  *The whole story was very well written & kept my attention, even in the slower parts.   *I loved all the characters... they had depth and meaning.  *I loved loved loved the depth she gave Sam and the love he had for reading and music and how he found hope within it.   *I mostly love this story because I haven't been so drawn into a story in such a long time and this story was such a huge breath of fresh air.     Didn't like:  -I found some of the dialogue between a few of the characters (mostly Isabel) to be a bit juvenile for my taste.   -I didn't much like Isabel & Shelby's character... not that they weren't well written... I just didn't like them as you're bound to in all forms of entertainment.      Other than those few things... I'm completely in love with this story and CANNOT WAIT for #s 2 & 3!!!
B0057A6GA6|4.0|Well worth the cost. Lots of hours of fun. Some of the levels are too hard compared to higher levels that come later but overall very good.
0553801473|1.0|First of all, I want to say I'm one of those who liked A Feast for Crows. I would rate it 4 stars, while I'd give 5 stars to the first three wonderful books. I'd rate Feast one star less basically because the pace of the usually gripping narration slowed down, and most of all because for the first time emerged the use of cliffhangers in the middle of narrative arcs. While I'm fine with cliffhangers at the end of TV series seasons, I always thought them abusive at the end of books. The middle book of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", e.g., provided a satisfactory conclusion for the Isengard-Rohan story arc, and for the alliance of the Two Towers. Just to say, since GRRM has been crowned the \\"American Tolkien\\". A story arc should be completed, even if it ends with potential switches in the plot and in the future of characters, and this didn't happen in AFfC. A pity, I told myself, but probably it depends on the fact that it is only the first half of a bigger, greater book.<br /><br />*spoilers henceforward*<br /><br />Now the second half of this bigger book has come out, and the slowing of the pace and the abuse of cliffhangers have reached alarming levels. What we've got here are two powerful climaxes (the struggle in the North and the siege of Meereen) which, if resolved, could bring to an epic narration, but they are truncated. So we have an entire book bulding two main events that are postponed in the following book, hopefully coming out not six years from now. Not what I would call high quality literature. Again, think of \\"The Two Towers\\" ending before the battle of Helm's Deep. The regret increases when thinking that, probably, no more than a few chapters would have been needed to have a satisfactory denouement. One of the best parts of the book is the Quentyn-Barristan subplot, which is satisfactory also because... it comes to its own denouement.<br /><br />The other big issue of this book is editing. Honestly, I can't remember having seen so much typos, repetitions andinconsistencies in the previous books. What does the Kingswood have to do with the Ironborn? Why the narrow sea is no more a proper noun? How many times must we learn that the Lord Commander's tower is \\"a burned shell\\" or that \\"words are wind\\"? Why a certain character is called \\"prince\\" while his lineage is still to be revealed?<br />The first half of the book, especially, is the most defective one. This is quite curious if you think that we had to wait six years for the book and that, apparently, parts of it were already in the hands of the editors from long time. So, the possibilities are few: (1) the editors waited until the last minute to start the editing process; (2) the editors were unable to see the flaws in the text; (3) the editors became fans and/or GRRM became so bestselling that the editors did not have anymore the courage to change something he wrote. In any case, I strongly suggest to Bantam that someone should be fired, and the whole editing process reorganized. For GRRM own good, first of all give him the advice of someone who actually can help him setting correctly his priorities and fight his self-indulgence.<br /><br />I was also worried by the increasing amount of \\"deus-ex-machina\\" solutions. In this book we meet characters and facts that become prominent while they were not even nominated in the previous books, obviously to fix plot needs and allow the story to go on. While it was still easy to justify the introduction of the prophecy of Maggy the Frog in AFfC, it is quite harder to justify the entry of a new Targaryen character from nowhere in ADwD. I could have accepted him if Illyrio Mopatis hinted at him in his famous conversation with Varys in AGoT, in example, but in this way he really comes from nowhere. We can at least hope he is a \\"mummer's dragon\\".<br /><br />In the end, I'd say this could have been a great book if it wasn't rushed and published incomplete, and if someone would have had some care in the editing process. This is odd to say, since we are waiting for this book from six years (though eleven would be more accurate). It's even odder if you think that in these years the leitmotiv has been \\"art can't be rushed\\". It seems that from a certain point, art has been rushed without too many concerns.
B004LWZW24|4.0|From the writer and director of Saw, and the creators of Paranormal Activity comes Insidious, the scariest film since... well... Paranormal Activity. The film is about a happy family that moves into a house that they suspect later to be haunted. When the son falls into what they think is a coma, they move out of the house into a new one only to find out that it wasn't the house that was haunted.     I won't spoil the rest of it, but it is a very smartly done horror film that relies on traditional values of classic horror instead of false scares like things running off the screen to fast to see. It has in my opinion the creepiest score since the original Psycho, and some of the most down right disturbing images to grace my mind in a long time. All in all, it's a spooky good time, and the best horror film so far this year.
B0012GMVQC|4.0|Jeff Beck's instrumental albums are simply fantastic! He is an outstanding guitarist, but as importantly there is always good songwriting on his albums. \\"Guitar Shop\\" is no exception to this rule and is packed with memorable melodies and some fantastic drumwork. While some might think this CD to be nothing but guitar wizardry, it's hard for me to believe that anyone cannot enjoy the sheer talent of Beck's unique style and undeniable charisma. Add to this the unusual synth sounds and textures and you have one monster instrumental CD. Variety is also the key here. While \\"Guitar Shop\\" opens the CD up with something you might expect from Beck, \\"Savoy\\" moves the band into hard rock territory, while Behind the Veil\\" offers a bit of a reggae groove. Other tracks offer a variety of blues and rock and even an airy ballad title \\"Two Rivers\\". \\"Guitar Shop\\" stands up well against the classics \\"Blow by Blow\\" and \\"Wired\\" and will certainly please fans of instrumental guitar rock.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I ordered a black controller from this page. Amazon (they were the ones responsible for the item shipped, not a third party) sent me a brand new sealed controller - that was counterfeit. Several of the telltale signs were present - raised LEDs on top, lighter weight, stiff and/or unresponsive buttons, slightly different shade of plastic, crooked PS logo, different font for all of the text on the controller, and the sticker on the back was crooked and simply paper, whereas the real thing has a plastic coating and is centered by a machine. I've been a long time customer of Amazon's, so hopefully this is just an oversight on their part. Nonetheless, this is a very serious issue.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|Along with the perceived failure of the Star Trek: Enterprise television series, Star Trek: Nemesis was widely blamed for the apparent \\"end\\" of Star Trek as a franchise when it was released in 2002 to subpar box office sales and mediocre reviews.  However, it is a curious movie in many respects, and much better than its reputation would suggest.<br /><br />First, a quick trivia question, the answer to which may surprise you.  The planet Earth is threatened by a menacing Romulan battleship that is stronger than the Enterprise (or any other Earth/Federation vessel), and which has the ability to destroy all life on the planet.  It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to defeat this threat.  What movie is this?<br /><br />Of course, this is J.J. Abrams' epic 2009 reboot/sequel [[ASIN:B001AVCFJM Star Trek (Two-Disc Digital Copy Edition)]], right?  Well, yes.....and it's also Star Trek: Nemesis.  (The battleship in \\"Nemesis\\" is actually a Reman vessel, but that's a technicality.)<br /><br />The big advantage that Abrams' movie had over its 2002 predecessor is that it was a reboot and a Kirk-Spock origin story, which offered Star Trek neophytes the chance to go into the movie without feeling intimidated by the extensive Trek backstory, and naturally brought fans back after four years of no Star Trek on television or movie screens.<br /><br />To the new Star Trek fans that Abrams' excellent film created, and to the older fans that never saw \\"Nemesis\\" because of its notorious reputation, I say: give it a chance.  It is not a perfect film, but it's a good film with a lot of things going for it.  The following is a brief synopsis of the film's plot (I will avoid major spoilers whenever possible): after years of simmering hostility, the Romulan Empire and its new leader, Shinzon (played by Tom Hardy, from [[ASIN:B002ZG981E Inception (Two-Disc Edition) [Blu-ray]]] and the upcoming Batman movie), have offered to open peace negotiations with the Federation.  Starfleet dispatches the U.S.S. Enterprise under the command of Jean-Luc Picard (played superbly once again by the incomparable Patrick Stewart).  On its way to Romulus to begin negotiations, the crew makes a mysterious discovery: a replica android (named B-4) of Commander Data (Brent Spiner).  Even more mysterious, Picard discovers that Shinzon is a younger clone of himself.  Predictably, the ostensible peace offering reveals itself to be a trip laid by Shinzon to capture Picard and he reveals his true intentions: to destroy Earth using his vessel- the Scimitar (essentially a battleship that doubles as a WMD that can destroy all life on a planet).<br /><br />The script, written by John Logan (of [[ASIN:B00003CXE7 Gladiator (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] fame), offers a good storyline with the underlying theme of duality, as illustrated by B-4 and Data, and Picard and his younger evil doppelganger Shinzon.  As with many good Trek stories, it challenges the viewer to ask himself/herself an important moral question: in this case, what makes you the person you are (and in turn, could certain events make a person otherwise destined to be good not good at all?)?<br /><br />Some have criticized the film because of its similarities to [[ASIN:B0000683DH Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]], a film considered by many fans (myself included) to be the best of all the Trek films.  Admittedly, there are many similarities: a personal connection between the hero and the villain (Kirk-Khan vs. Picard-Shinzon), a potential WMD being wielded by the villain (the Genesis Device vs. the Scimitar), a space battle in a nebula, and a sacrifice by a major character to save the Enterprise (more on this later).  However, it must be said that after 45 years of television shows and movies, it is virtually impossible for any Trek writer to avoid at least partial similarities to a previous movie or television episode.  So, I do not begrudge the fact that screenwriter Logan decided to make several nods to a classic Trek movie.<br /><br />In addition to this intriguing storyline, the movie features excellent visual effects, a masterful score by the late, great Jerry Goldsmith, and solid acting all around (especially by Stewart, Spiner, and Hardy).  So where does the movie lose some points?  I will explain:<br /><br />1.  *An unnecessary death of a major character* To avoid spoilers, I will not mention the major character who dies in the movie.  However, it is clear that screenwriter Logan was going after the emotional impact of Spock's death in Star Trek II.  The sacrifice of the character in Nemesis is not handled as expertly as Spock's sacrifice, however.  Also, it must be said that the handwriting was clearly on the wall when this movie was being made in 2001-2002 that this was to be the last movie featuring the \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" crew, making the killing off of an important character unnecessary.  Director Nicholas Meyer and the writers of [[ASIN:B0000UJL96 Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]] wisely avoided this sort of tempting but gratuitous attempt at emotional poignancy with the send-off for the original cast in that movie.<br /><br />2.  *A slightly disappointing climax*  (Minor spoilers) The climax of the movie is an exciting space battle between the Enterprise and the Scimitar in a nebula.  Clearly overmatched, the Enterprise briefly turns the tables on its adversary thanks to a surprising tactic undertaken by Counselor Troi (an underused character played well by Marina Sirtis).  With the viewer now emotionally invested in seeing the Enterprise stick it to Shinzon and the Scimitar, Screenwriter Logan then inexplicably has the Scimitar disable the Enterprise, so that Picard is forced to ram his ship into the Scimitar.<br /><br />Logan had stated that he always wanted to see the Enterprise ram another ship, and while director Stuart Baird films the scene inan effective manner, it comes across as slightly gratuitous and unnecessary (not unlike the ill-advised, pointless \\"crashing of the Enterprise\\" sequence written by Brannon Braga and Ronald Moore in [[ASIN:B0002HDOB8 Star Trek - Generations (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]).  Logan here makes the mistake that unfortunately many Trek writers make, in failing to understand that the Enterprise is a character too, and the viewer is invested in seeing this character succeed.  Thus, this scene would have been better written if the Enterprise clearly defeated the Scimitar in combat.  This would have in no way rendered impossible the final showdown between Picard and Shinzon on the Scimitar Bridge that unfolded in the movie.<br /><br />3.  *Shinzon's motivation for wanting to destroy Earth is never fully or adequately explained*  To go back to J.J. Abrams' movie for a moment, the Romulan villain Nero (played by Eric Bana) decides that he will destroy Earth and the planet Vulcan out of revenge because the Federation- in his mind- did not help save his planet from destruction.  Nero's motivations- while evil, misguided, and misinformed- were understandable.<br /><br />By contrast, Shinzon's motivations for wanting to destroy Earth are never explained satisfactorily.  The only explanation we are given is by Picard in the lead-up to the final battle.  When asked why he believes Shinzon will go after Earth, he answers: \\"I know how he thinks.\\"  Huh?  If anything, Shinzon, after being enslaved his whole life by Romulans, should want to destroy Romulus.  The fact that he decides inexplicably that he must destroy all life on a planet that has done nothing to him is a huge leap of logic that the movie does not quite pull off, and the climax ultimately suffers for it.<br /><br />In summary, Star Trek: Nemesis is a good movie, and is not the disastrous train wreck that some Trek fans have made it out to be.  Ultimately, I think the movie failed at the box office because of itsrelease date.  Paramount decided to release the movie in December 2002, when it would be up against Harry Potter, James Bond, and Lord of the Rings.  It should have come as no shock that Nemesis got lost in the shuffle.  Had it been released against lesser competition, I think it would have fared a lot better financially.  However, after the box office failure of this movie and the cancellation of [[ASIN:B000AOEMXC Star Trek Enterprise - The Complete Fourth Season]] in 2005 (sadly, when the show was just coming into its prime, but that's another review for another day), when things looked dire indeed for Star Trek, Paramount placed the franchise in the capable hands of J.J. Abrams.  Abrams- along with the superior writing team of Bob Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof- gave us an excellent film in 2009. Hopefully, Abrams will give us another good entry in 2012-13.  As we await the next installment from Abrams-Orci-Kurtzman-Lindelof, I would highly recommend that Star Trek fans new and old check out this underrated and somewhat forgotten diamond in the rough from 2002.

B004MARLJ2|5.0|The design is pretty childish which is why I was so surprised to find a deep and complex game. Good story, excellent gameplay, and challenging opponents had me totally engaged! Great purchase, I would love to see more in the series.
B004MARLJ2|4.0|If it wasn&apos;t for Amazon, I would have never given this game a chance. It looks like a another game which was just mindless matching. Instead, the game is relatively challenging and very addicting. The levels get gradually harder and forces the player to utilize different strategies until the end. The graphics are very cute, but the storyline isn&apos;t very engaging.
B00095NX9G|2.0|I was very disappointed by this video. I had high hopes because it had so many great reviews, but I didn't enjoy either disk. There were several things that I didn't like. One, it feels like being instructed by a robot. During the entire first disk, the instructor is completely silent while voice-over instruction is played, and that instruction is very mechanical and not very personal or adapted to the particular exercise: i.e. same phrases over and over. This is probably my number one complaint: the instruction is cold, especially in the first disk. Second, she uses a lot of terminology that she doesn't explain (i.e. second foot pattern, second arm position, etc). It turns out that these phrases are explained at the very end of the second disk in their own section. Third, the music is seriously heinous, especially the first routine on the second disk. Another reviewer mentioned \\"polka.\\" That is EXACTLY what it sounded like. I don't know about you, but the sound of the tuba does not make me feel like dancing. Fourth, I was under the impression that this dvd set focused primarily on technique, but I did not feel that it contained very good technique instruction. The voice over might say, \\"now undulate\\" or \\"now do a ribcage figure 8.\\" But the dvd offers very little advice for perfecting those moves. It offers a lot of opportunities to practice different moves in the drills section, but if you don't already know how to do these moves correctly, you won't be taught how to do them. This is especially the case in the shimmy drill section because she stops giving instruction half way through. Fifth, I had trouble with the fact that the different moves aren't really explained: she just throws out the name of it, or the name she uses for it, and tells you to do it. I learned several of the moves under different names, so it took me a second to catch onto what she meant. Sixth, there are only two routines. I was hoping for either more routines, or instruction on how to recombine patterns into different choreography. Seventh, the overall feel of the dvd set is not very...fun. To me, dancing should be fun. You should be in a great mood when you're finished and feel awesome, not be annoyed by the music or feel hammered and frustrated by the drills.     On the positive side, her technique really is amazing and she is a great dancer. I think the drills will be good practice, and I think that the yoga sections and the strengthening sections really do help strengthen and tone the belly dancing muscles. I have been doing belly dancing for a while, so I think I'll still be able to get some use out of the drills section. But I would not advise beginners to get this video.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I loved this movie and highly recommend to anyone looking to be thoroughly entertained!  Not an Oscar winner, mind you, but a solid nearly 2 hours of movie excitement and entertainment for all!  Chris Hemsworth nails it as Thor with his charisma and it factor~  Not to be missed - as it already builds the anticipation for Part II - $450mil workld wide theatre box office tells it like it is ! WOW!  enjoy  kal~

B0018QOIXU|4.0|Believe every good thing you hear about this woman, because Adele Adkins's vocals are phenomenal! She ranges from soaring notes and smooth, jazzy tones easily, and each of the songs on this album carry a pretty good punch. In a world where music is being compressed or overworked by synthesizers, Adele is a much welcome addition to a genre of art which is going extinct.<br /><br />There are some catchy tunes, like \\"Daydreamer\\" and the bluesy \\"My Same,\\" which boast tinkling instruments and fun beats from Adele. One song which boasts her vocal range is \\"Chasing Pavements,\\" a touch your soul ballad about questioning love (this is my personal favorite).  Standouts include \\"Make You Feel My Love,\\" a wonderful love song penned by Bob Dylan, and \\"Melt My Heart to Stone,\\" a quite enchanting piece.<br /><br />I believe in Adele's power to make you feel emotions through her voice. You should do. A must for every person who craves \\"real\\" music, to be played for every occasion!
B004MARLJ2|5.0|this game is real cool, the story is for kids, but who cares the game is challenging, I love it
B004MARLJ2|4.0|runs smooth, good graphics, fun to play, gets addicting. i would say its worth the two bucks but i got it free.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Ok to ask I suppose, but to pop up between levels requesting a rating is kind of lame. I like it so far, but would like to do more levels before giving a rating...want 49 cents back for this early rating.  grrrr

0345529057|5.0|I have all of these books through Audible.com. It takes a lot of dedication to the author and the story to listen to these wonderful, but LONG books. I have the hardbacks, too, but all mine are signed and I don't want to reduce their collectible value by reading them. And so, since it had been a while since I'd read/listened to them, and with HBO's Game of Thrones series out, I - the ever-vigilant nerd - found myself wanting to go read them all again to prepare for the release of Dance With Dragons. I ordered this set, and it's quite readable in font and paper-quality. A big concern with such long books, as publishers sometimes want to conserve on paper by making the font miniscule when a book is at or over 1000+ pages each. My 46 year old eyes appreciates that I didn't have to whip out the large magnifying glass.     As for the stories themselves: Simple. If you haven't read them yet - I can't imagine what you are waiting for. These are amazing books and GRRM is an amazing story-teller. There are a couple of places where I thought he could have left out some of the descriptions of the heraldry (insignia, colors and flag/logo descriptions for every player in every scene.) But I am a woman and I know this series is appealing in a broad way to male readers - it's gritty and realistic for a fantasy story, more like history of medieval ages  - and most of the men I know are very into the statistical nature of weapon types and uses, just like baseball cards and player stats. true fans know them all. But strangely enough I, too, am able to tell you which house fought on what side, for which king, and what their sigils meant or looked like. I have no trouble recalling the 3 black dogs on a yellow field for Joffrey's bodyguard the \\"dog\\" known as Sandor Clegane - The Hound. Or the field of golden roses for the Tyrells. I absolutely LOVE the fact that the series is told from many viewpoints of primary characters, but that GRRM doesn't hesitate to kill them if needs be. No simple heroes in white and villains in black here. Everyone in this story has faults and weaknesses and strengths, too, that make each character, even minor players, more alive and incredibly human. All the sins and all the virtues are in this series. Told in intricate detail of plot and sub-plots and surprises that will make you weep on one page and chuckle guiltily at the next. You simply cannot afford to miss the books folks. Yes, HBO did a pretty good job with the series, and like most story-to-script adventures the tale on HBO is not exact, for time and dramatic reasons. I'm just glad that Mr Martin was able to get Dance With Dragons out - finally. I hope it's not another 5 year wait til the next installment. But it says something when 5 years pass between book 4 and book 5 and the story is so vivid in your head for all that time. Great job Mr. Martin. Don't wait - this is the best buy on these 4 books sets here.
B0000C7PRY|3.0|The whole album sounds like a Sunday morning at the church. And that's the same for Testimony #2.

0553386794|4.0|This is usually not the type of genre I would pick to read; however, after seeing that the majority of the two thousand reviews were positive, I decided to pick this book up. I am glad I purchased this book; it is full of adventure, action, and deception.  The only negatives about the book are the times when the novel/writing is rather wordy, and the poor editing. Since it is over 800 pages, I recommend picking up the kindle edition.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|lots of strategy.  nice gfx.  not a system drain.   easy to learn.  hard to master.   one of the best games for people with not so nimble tingled more about thought than reaction time.

1400052181|2.0|This is a compelling subject, and I'm grateful to have been introduced to it.  Two stars for that.  But I'm with the minority of reviewers who wish that someone else had written the story.  I found the science too light and biography too heavy, particularly the focus on Henrietta Lack's daughter Deborah who is, sadly, a damaged, incredulous and insufferably superstitious subject.  The story of Henrietta's family, whose connection to the medical marvel of the HeLa cells is unquestionably tenuous, is a stand-in for the story for which there is insufficient information to tell- the life of Henrietta herself.  If we knew more about the woman behind HeLa, the backstory Skloot ploddingly tells in the last 150 pages of her book would have been relegated to a few pages at most.      The family's situation is pitiable but not compelling. Not the stuff of a great work of non-fiction as many would call this.  The pages and pages dedicated to Deborah's rambling, thrashing distortions of reality, which further expose her pain and ugly desperation were, in my mind, exploitative in the extreme.  The irony of this book, the most widely-read on the HeLa phenomenon, laying bare the skeletons of a family so damaged by years of outsiders' exploitation will not be lost on any mildly critical thinker.      So, despite all the gushing praise, to me this is a disappointing work, a badly missed opportunity, and a further plundering of some badly broken people who have nothing to call their own but their mother's sad legacy.
B004GIR0XC|5.0|I watched this movie via streaming on my pc. I loved it. Best movie I have seen in a long time. If you haven't seen it,I highly recommend it.
B00006JDS4|3.0|Rented this due to the hubbub thinking I would see a suspense filled thriller and got the opposite.  I'm guessing the hubbub stems from the rape scene which takes quite a while.  She is raped by one man then she flees then gets raped by a second one then again runs only to get caught again and thus violated by a third and so on.  After she showers, eats, smokes and changes cothing she sets off to get revenge.  The revenge scenes are not very shocking (except she uses her femine wiles to luree the rapists into set up situation which seems odd considering she was just raped by them) considering some of the flicks I have seen lately; however, I am guessing from the age of the film they were once something controversal.  I don't mean to be nitpicky but I didn't care for the ending....wouldn't the police be looking for the missing guys especially when the wife was looking for one?  Yet, no mention of it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Directed by Tate Taylor in only his second full-length effort, this 2011 period film isn't perfect, but its precarious blend of gravitas, pathos and humor tugs at the heartstrings in a way that makes the story emotionally riveting without veering into the maudlin or being condescending, no small feat considering the ongoing temptations in Tate's fully ripened screenplay. Set in his hometown of Jackson, Mississippi, in 1961 just as the civil rights movement was taking hold of the Deep South, the film benefits immeasurably from its excellent cast, in particular, a gut-wrenching performance from Viola Davis, a brilliant actress who blazed through just eight minutes of screen time as the singularly focused Mrs. Miller in John Patrick Shanley's [[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]]. Showing more nuanced shades of her trademark stoic strength here, she serves as the film's emotional center as Aibileen, a haunted middle-aged maid who has spent most of her life raising white children and just recently lost her only son to racially motivated violence.<br /><br />Based on fellow Jacksonian Kathryn Stockett's popular [[ASIN:B002YKOXB6 2009 novel]], this immensely satisfying adaptation faithfully covers most of the book's major plot points and fluidly shifts viewpoints between Aibileen; her sassy best friend Minny, who can't help but show her contempt for her racist employers; and Skeeter Phelan, a young white woman and recent college graduate who after moving back home, discovers that Constantine, the dedicated maid who helped raise her since childhood has mysteriously disappeared. The three women's stories intertwine seamlessly to explain how life in Jackson revolved around the co-existence of blacks and whites in a state of casual yet hostile intimacy. The symbol of institutionalized segregation is the bathroom, a firebrand issue led by Hilly Holbrook, the town's demonic debutante who is pushing to pass an ordinance to support her belief that all homes should have separate bathroom facilities for the \\"colored\\" help. This revelation makes Skeeter realize how deep the racial divide is in her town. Ambitious to become a serious writer, Skeeter pitches an idea to the publishing house of Harper & Row to write a book that would show her world from the black maids' perspectives, an idea fraught with danger to all who dare to participate. Spurred on by civil rights activist Medgar Evers' assassination in Jackson, the maids unify in their support of the book (a scene that reduced me to tears), and it becomes a big success but not without certain sacrifices.<br /><br />Beyond Davis' sterling turn, there is an embarrassment of acting riches - Octavia Spencer's tart-tongued turn as Minny threatens to steal the picture entirely, especially in a hilariously vengeful chocolate pie scene that almost belongs in a completely different movie; an extravagantly coiffed and costumed Bryce Dallas Howard, surprisingly effective as Hilly, the most venal and unrepentant of racists; Jessica Chastain in full-blown Marilyn mode as the white-trash wife ostracized by the bridge club set; Sissy Spacek easily stealing her brief comic scenes as Hilly's dotty mother fully aware of her daughter's character shortcomings; Allison Janney as Skeeter's acidic, status-conscious mother who proves it's never too late to change your ways; Cicely Tyson lending unforced dignity and an uncanny Jane Pittman countenance to the flashback scenes of Constantine; and smoky-voiced Emma Stone, who officially graduates from comic supporting roles and truly comes into her own as Skeeter. The whole cast deserves to be remembered during awards season. Not by accident, the men are given short shrift here. A more experienced filmmaker than Taylor could have instilled a greater sense of fearlessness in the movie's approach, although at the same time, few would be as generous with such an outstanding cast. Despite some moments that border on being too broad, the film represents superior entertainment about a period of American history that needs to be remembered.an history that needs to be remembered.

B0059F7I24|1.0|i've seen this band live a couple of times. only because they were touring with machine head. and another time i don't remember who else, maybe in flames. they start drawing you in with cool riffs then they start to wimp out with their wanna be hetfield vocals. then their songs just turn to the same old cookie cutter unoriginal riffs. i did start to listen to most of the album but could not get through it. the intro was cool then got long and uneventful, in waves starts out awesome then he starts to sing and the guitars puss out, inception of the end is messy and boring, dusk dismantled is just there nothing cool really happens, watch the world burn - embarrassing, black- sounds like a million other songs except for the bridge was cool, a skyline's severance- very forgettable, ensnare the sun- sounds like something form the game prince of persia, built to fall - 80's sounding fist pumping let down, caustic...-very metallica like, chorus is lame, forsake not the dream- very melodic but his singing oh my god please some producer tell him to stop, the rest of the album sounds like the rest. my favorite song on this album is slave new world. and they did not write it. thank you sepultura.

0439023521|5.0|I got this book based on the recommendation of a friend.  I was skeptical to read it because it appeared to be a book aimed for teens and also sci-fi.  Neither fit my interest but I took my friend's word for it and read it.  I was hooked!  It is simplistic sci-fi but that worked for me.  Both my husband and 10 year old daughter read it with me along with the rest of the trilogy.  Give this book a try.  You will be surprised.
B002ZG974M|4.0|Oh, there is so much to be learned from this film! Thomas Balmes' 'Babies' is a movie to sink our minds into, to conjure our oldest memories and recall the sensations of our earliest experiences and emotions. And all without the enormous distraction of superfluous commentary by any of the Famouser of the Famous And Exceedingly Well Established Celebrities With Voices Which Are Either British Or Deep Or Both. I will also go on record as saying it has the best and most refreshing genetic mix for a cast I've ever seen: Two parts Mongoloid (Bayarjargal of Mongolia and Mari of Japan), one part Marronoid (Ponijao of Namibia) and one part Claroid (Hattie, from the U.S.); Hollywood film-makers, for the love of all that is good and holy, take note of these exquisite proportions!<br /><br />The film moves the way babies experience reality: No scene holds memory or flow from the one which precedes it, nor guesses any portent of its successor. Each scene is happening, then each following scene is happening. Just as each moment, each event, each new object or predicament is the whole of existence for an infant. Now Ponijoa's mother is covering her shaven head in red paint; now Bayarjargal is trying to grab onto those odd things at the ends of his legs; now his older brother of two or three years is accosting him with a small pastry, to his bewilderment and dismay. (This older brother, as we'll see, seems to have rather a tendency towards sadistic trouble-making; P.E.T.A. could go after the little guy if he doesn't mend his ways with cats.) Several such situations we see in the film reminded me of the bloody-mindedness we have in babyhood: 'Yes, I KNOW what I'm doing is making him upset, I KNOW what I'm doing is bad, but I AM going to keep doing it because I HAVE to know what'll happen if I do!' At that age, we have an instinctive need to know how far we can go before the big people interfere with our will.<br /><br />Watching this movie, I have to keep reminding myself that cuteness is an emergent quality, not an absolute one; a thing to be perceived, even if it doesn't strictly exist. We think of babies as silly, adorable, cartoonish, free of reason, and as existing only in relation to those they depend on. When in reality these little people have brains in their heads that are as mercilessly logical as any robot, diligently at work establishing the boundaries, the textures, the possibilities, the behavior, the structure of their environment and all things in it, and the capabilities of these odd forms they control. When a small child retreats fearfully from an advancing duck to cling to its father, it is following strict logic; ducks could very well be the terrors of the earth for all the data the child has on them. When the excellent author and conservationist Douglas Adams visited apes in Africa, he saw two young children in a family dancing wildly on the branch of a tree several feet above the ground. He was sure there was no way they could keep that up for long, and sure enough, they both came tumbling down a moment later, wiser young apes now than they were. One of my very first memories is of the day I learned that if you ran at a glass door, it wouldn't shatter, but if you ran at a glass door HARD, it would. Nor have I forgotten that, even though it seems like sand would be too heavy to be sucked off the ground with a straw, it turns out it's not. We see these four babies learn many things in this film.<br /><br />Ponijao is in the most relaxed environment. She and the people surrounding her spend most of their time lounging in their huts or out on the ground, the women talking casually and easily with each other (I'm reminded that warm climates tend to loosen people up, their personalities relaxing along with their posture and accents, while people usually learn to chat no more than necessary in cold places), shaving their children's heads, painting them, braiding the hair of the older children, surrounded by flies that don't seem to bother them at all. She drinks from a stream just barely above the sand it runs along, in her hut at night she tries valiantly to stay awake for, apparently, the principal of the thing. Yes, her entourage and she are very much at ease, but we don't see her father at all - or any of the men-folk - who are presumably quite busy out providing for them all. For that matter, only very briefly near the beginning do we see a young man who is probably Bayarjargal's father.<br /><br />Roger Ebert, the best film critic, says, 'Two of the babies come from poor parts of the world, and two from rich. They seem equally happy and healthy.' Actually that's not quite right. Again, Ponijao is the most genial, and we almost never see her unhappy. And from the footage we see at least, Bayarjargal is by far the one about whose infancy Heaven lays most, surrounded by his family's cows and other ungulates, free to roam the idyllic and seemingly endless grass-land around his family's yurt, which is reached, of course, by motorcycle or by jeep in this blessed region devoid of roads. (Mongolia, we recall, is officially the Awesomest Country on the Planet. If you'd like to see more of this magnificent life-style, I recommend Sergei Dvortsevoy's excellent deadpan Kazakhstani comedy 'Tulpan', made the same time 'Babies' was.) And the two rural babies are well on their way to being much fitter, healthier and more active than the two city-girls. I also think we see a bit more footage from the two rural areas than we do from Tokyo and San Francisco, and although Tokyo is my favorite place in the universe, I guess it's too bad that the two little citizens don't seem to get into many adventures.<br /><br />We are informed by the consensus at rottentomatoes.com that this film is 'loaded with adorable images, but lacks insight and depth.' I'm at rather a loss to know whether we're to understand from this that people are actually baffled by the behavior of these babies and want it explained to them fully, or whether the people at rottentomatoes.com have a particularly clear idea of what insight and depth would constitute in the case of a film like this. Raw information is beyond insight, wholely apart from depth or shallowness. If we had been told, as Bayarjargal tips over the stroller he's in, that 'Babies have accidents now and then', would the film have been better or worse for it? What words of revelation could possibly be added as we first see the babies stand? Now, Hattie eventually starts using the usual first few English words (especially 'No!'), and I caught Mari beginning to use fragments of Japanese. But if there are any remotely enlightening things to say about this development, they are best kept in lengthy neurological research lectures, not so much in movie theatres. An atrocious critic whom I'll do the immense and undeserved favor of not naming said of 'Babies', 'This isn't a movie. It's a screen[-]saver.' If this film's a screen-saver, then so is the entirety of existence.<br /><br />By now I'm pretty convinced that, in all our lives, we never know joy and contentment as absolute, or terror, misery and sorrow as utter, as we do in our first few years. When we were happy, we had found a thing that we knew would continue making us happy for all eternity, and when we were miserable, we knew the universe had gone horribly wrong and would never, ever be fixed. There's a scene where it dawns on Mari, amid playing with her toys, that they've lost their magic and will never, ever again make her happy, nor will any thing else. She weeps and tosses the useless things away, then commences writhing on the floor in unquenchable despair. She spots a children's book and calms herself briefly, remembering the magic it had before, but as soon as she opens it, she sees the sacred flame has forsaken its pages as well, and throws herself to the floor again, trapped in a world now devoid of any further wonder, and all the universe exists in vain. This is one experience that doesn't quite disappear no matter how old we get. We can have all the things we could ever want, and then still abruptly find our cup quite empty. 'The truth is found to be lies, and all the joy within you dies'.<br /><br />Watching all the shots of the babies nursing their mothers, I'm ever surer of my theory that one of the fundamental reasons we all need some body to love is that we need one whose face and form we can know as intimately as we did our mother's (and our father's, to a lesser degree). One we can embrace and hold as we did our mother, our uttermost home, in whose arms we turned inward from the bewildering outer world and rested, and had all we needed. We knew our mother as a form to hold and take our sustenance from before we knew her as a person. We learned her shape with our arms and hands before we learned it with our eyes. And when we are older and hold one we love, we close our eyes and forget for a moment it is a person we hold, and cling only to that form once again, and speak gently. Again we take refuge from the churning uncertainties that surround us, and have all we need.<br /><br />This film is really as much about these different societies as it is about babies, and our theatres could do with any number of sequels. My suggestions for 'More Babies': Finland, India, Argentina, Egypt.

1554072840|5.0|I had this book for my daughter in 1987 and my daughter loved it. I have purchased 13 books hoping one would be as good and was fortunate enough to come across the same book. My 22 month old grandaughter loves it. Its the only book she'll let me read and actually finish. It's so to her level that she reads it to herself. Amazing book!!! was in 1987 and still is in 2011.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My son was assigned this book as summer reading for school, and when I read the synopsis, I was aghast.  He was 13 at the time, not an enthusiastic reader by any stretch, and yet he TORE through the book.  I bought him the second and third books for his 14th birthday, expecting the obligatory muttered \\"thanks,\\" but he devoured those as well, and nagged me day after day to read the series.  I did, and I can see why he was so mad for these books.      The premise is brutal, but the violence is restrained and never casual.  The heroine, Katniss, is written to be fairly three dimensional; she has her moments when she is not the best person in the world.      The bottom line is, Hunger Games is a really good story and a well written book.  The whole series actually is exciting and very satisfying.  For whatever reason, it hit just the right chord for my son, and for me, because we both enjoyed the trilogy and recommend it whenever someone is looking for a good read.
6305944563|3.0|Oliver Twist was Charles Dicken's second  novel, published in 1938. It was first filmed in 1909 and this was the second version. It was filmed again in 1933, 1948, 1997, and 2005, as a musical in 1968, and was a TV miniseries 3 times (1985, 1999, 2007). This version is notable because Lon Chaney played Fagin and Jackie Coogan played Oliver.<br /><br />Lon Chaney (1883-1930) was one of the biggest stars of the silent era. Known as \\"The man of 1000 faces\\", he was capable of disguising himself completely in service of his roles, which could be as diverse as a hunchback (\\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\"), a legless man (\\"The Penalty\\"), an armless man who throws knives with his feet (\\"The Unknown\\") or a monster (\\"Phantom of the Opera\\"). His life was the subject of the 1957 film \\"Man of 1000 Faces\\" starring James Cagney.<br /><br />By 1922 when he made this film he had already made more than 100 films, although many of his best films (\\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\", \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"The Unknown\\", \\"London After Midnight\\", \\"Unholy Three\\") were still ahead of him. Chaney plays Fagin and it's impossible to detect the actor beneath the makeup.<br /><br />Jackie Coogan (1914-84) was a popular child actor in the silent era who is most famous for \\"The Kid\\" (1921). He's best remembered as Uncle Fester for the TV series \\"The Addams Family\\" (1964-6). Coogan is cute as young Oliver. One might find that there are more comedy scenes in this film than would be expected in Dicken's dour classic, and these were undoubtedly inserted because Coogan was fresh off \\"The Kid\\" (with Chaplin) and audiences were looking to laugh.<br /><br />Director Frank Lloyd (1886-1960) was a major figure in the 20s and 30s, nominated for an Oscar 4 times and winning for \\"The Divine Lady\\" (1929) and \\"Cavalcade\\" (1933). Among his notable films are \\":Mutiny on the Bounty\\" (1935), \\"Blood on the Sun\\" (1945), and  \\"The Last Command\\" (1955).<br /><br />This is a relatively faithful version of the Dickens' classic. The film stock is not the greatest, but more than 75% is perfect and there is only the occasional problem. The intertitles were restored in the 70s.  Performances are uniformly good and the sets are wonderful.re than 75% is perfect and there is only the occasional problem. The intertitles were restored in the 70s.

B004WCTLNY|5.0|Really a taste of something different here. I expected a very serious suspenseful movie with the usual chase and bullets, but this had humor mixed in in such a way that really made it fresh and very enjoyable.<br /><br />The premise of the bureau and what it is remains mostly mysterious, but by the end of the film, we at least have a general idea of what it is and how it works - a tidy balance. It did remind me a bit of the Matrix with all the shuffling through doors, but that was very subtle, and, anyway, I like that movie too.<br /><br />Thanks to all the great reviews here already, I think that's about all I have to say. Very well done IMHO.

B0036S4C6G|3.0|Although the author is quite adept at creating fully-developed characters who stick with you like interesting real-life acquaintances, this book was hard to piece together. Maybe it was because I read just an hour at a time and had to pick up the plot mid-book, but I found it difficult to keep track of how characters were interrelated. The book consists of pieced-together scenes from various peoples' lives. Each scene is well-written and engaging, but the book as a whole is so choppy and disconnected that the theme was nearly lost on me.

I would suggest he find one or more of the engineers that used to produce the Grateful Dead albums with Jerry Garcia.  Joe makes some great music and the recording quality should be better to take full advantage of his playing abilities!
B001I0T92Q|5.0|I bought this in order to have a 32gb PSP memory stick and run my backup games off of it and it is phenomenal. I originally had a sandisk 4gb pro duo card and it worked fine, but the cut scenes were choppy and the load times took a long time. I bought the adapter along with two [[ASIN:B004H8FTCK Patriot Signature 16 GB Class 10 MicroSDHC Flash Memory Card PSF16GMCSDHC10]] and the difference was noticeable on the first cut scene.    For PSP users, it may only read the first card when you plug it in directly to the computer, but if you format it in the psp, it will show the full memory. I had to tinker with that so i was kind of scared it was a bad product, but its totally not. The beginning trial and error is the only complaint I can possibly make.
B004VPAXHU|5.0|Anyone who enjoys Kate Bush's music knows this gem from 1983.<br /><br />If you are stuck with a domestic (U.S.) version of the disc, you also know that this album sounds like it was recorded underwater.  The levels are ridiculously low and you have to crank it to 10 just to hear the disc's loudest moments.  When Kate whispers - which she does often - forget it.  Neither you nor your dog will hear it.<br /><br />Well, the import/remaster I got takes care of all this - allowing \\"Hounds of Love\\" to finally come in from the deep.<br /><br />This, by the way, is an excellent album; whether it's her best or not is to be debated.  Some say \\"The Dreaming\\"; others think her more recent \\"Aerial\\" takes the prize.  Whatever . . . \\"Hounds of Love\\" is certainly one of her best - and deserving of the audio upgrade it received when the remaster I purchased was done.<br /><br />If you're just starting your Kate Bush collection, this is a great place to begin - but please, track down the remaster.  You won't be sorry.

Trust me on this.  The novel opens in 2044.  Things aren't looking too good in the real world.  So much so, that much of the population spends the majority of their time in the OASIS, \\"the massively-multiplayer online game that had gradually evolved into the globally networked virtual reality most of humanity now used on a daily basis.\\"  People hold jobs in the OASIS.  There are marriages that exist only in the OASIS.  It's more real than reality, and certainly preferable.<br /><br />The OASIS had been created by an inventor named James Halliday.  When the reclusive multi-billionaire died without an heir, a challenge was set in motion.  Halliday had hidden an \\"Easter egg\\" somewhere in the OASIS, and had left behind fiendishly difficult clues.  Whoever solved the clues to complete three virtual challenges and find the egg would win his vast estate.  In the five years since the challenge began, much of world has become consumed with the hunt.  It's the ultimate golden ticket.  Many people are professional egg hunters, or \\"gunters,\\" as they are known.  They spend their days and nights immersed in the popular culture that made up James Halliday's formative years--primarily the 1970s and `80s--as it is widely believed that knowing what he knew, loving what he loved, will be the path to winning.<br /><br />The story is told in the first person voice of Wade Watts, an 18-year-old gunter.  Wade was brought up in a world far different from Halliday's idealized youth, yet he too sits around watching re-runs of Family Ties and obsessively playing Atari and Intellevision video games, hoping this knowledge will give him the edge in the hunt for Halliday's egg--and it just might, because after five years with zero progress, Wade Watts is the first person in the world to solve one of the clues.  Readers get to follow Wade on an epic adventure.<br /><br />I'll be honest; I'm not the person I described in the opening of this review.  I'm not a big fan of science fiction.  I don't dress in costumes.  I'm just not that geeky.  I am, however, a mere three years older than the fictional James Halliday, and his formative years were my own.  And I have to tell you that I LOVED this romp through the pop culture that has formed my world!  Ernest Cline's debut is funny, thrilling, adventurous, and more than a little thought-provoking.<br /><br />As I read, I found myself reflecting on Gary Schteyngart's Super Sad True Love Story.  It's not that the two novels are alike exactly, but like Schteyngart, Cline has looked at elements in contemporary culture and extrapolated a disturbingly... I don't want to say \\"plausible,\\" but, yeah, kinda plausible future.  An exaggerated future based on certain trends in our use of technology today.  Cline exaggerated different social elements than Schteyngart did, but the outcome is just as entertaining, disquieting, and funny.  Wade is a tremendous, likable guide through this future/past world and Cline does an amazing job creating a cast of characters that transcend the avatars that represent them.<br /><br />In short, this middle-aged, not-so-geeky girl can't say enough good things about this paean to pop culture.

Shaun of the Dead did it for the zombie genre, Hot Fuzz did it for the cops genre, and now comes Paul tackling the genre of alien films.  Funny, smart, interesting, all in all a great movie, with a great cast.
B004VUP8WK|3.0|I've heard most of the album and read/watched several reviews.  The general opinion on this one seems to be that it's a stinker.  Although there are some highlights, I'm going to have to agree.  However, I would like to point out that in Morbid Angel's 20+ year career they only have one stinker, and that's a darn good track record.  I would also like to say that I think some of you are being a bit unfair with your criticism.  Whatever your reasons for hating this album, the lyrics should not be one of them.  Lyrics have never been Morbid Angel's strong suit.  They've never been death metal's strong suit.  So they sing a few songs about how hard they rock.  Plenty of rock bands have done that before them.  Even Metallica has a couple of songs like that, and nobody's criticised them for it.  Yes, it's silly, but is it really so much sillier than singing about summoning demons and killing priests?  Is it sillier than Cannibal Corpse's over-the-top blood and guts or Deicide's evangelical Satanism?  I'm not saying those lyrics aren't fun, but they're not any more substantive.  Some people have also ripped on the song titles, complaining that titles like \\"Too Extreme!\\" and \\"I Am Morbid\\" are ridiculous, I guess for the use of buzz words.  Well, titles with scary buzz words are a hallmark of death metal.  To me, the title \\"I Am Morbid\\" fits perfectly well with titles like \\"Where the Slime Live\\" and \\"Doomsday Celebration\\".  Morbid Angel's song titles have rarely risen above the B-horror movie level.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  That's something I like.  I liked it then, and I like it now.  So now for my complaints, and I welcome your commentary on them.  I didn't like the song \\"Too Extreme!\\"  I expected something, well, extreme, but what I got was something just plain weird.  There didn't seem to be an artistic reason for switching between Spanish and English, and David Vincent repeating the last words of some lines didn't work for me.  There is kind of something to the song, but it doesn't quite gel.  I wish I could explain it better than that.  \\"Radikult\\" isn't necessarily a bad song, but it doesn't belong on a Morbid Angel album.  For a rap metal band like Limp Bizkit, it would be pretty good.  But for Morbid Angel, it's annoying.  \\"Nevermore\\" is one that a lot of people like.  To me, it sounds like the band is trying too hard.    It's not all bad, though.  Personally, I like \\"I Am Morbid\\".  It's pretty much Morbid Angel's take on the rock anthem--and why shouldn't they do one of those?  I know most people hate it, but I think it's a fun song.  \\"Beauty Meets Beast\\" and \\"Blades for Baal\\" are more traditional Morbid Angel material, as is \\"10 More Dead\\".  I know I'm going to get a lot of \\"not helpful\\" votes for saying this, but I actually like \\"Destructos vs. The Earth\\" (the original, not the Combichrist remix).  Yes, it's a silly comic book idea, but I think it's fun.    So is this a good review or a bad one?  Well, it's both.  I wouldn't recommend buying this album, but there are good songs on it.  If only there were a way to download only the songs you wanted...
B004V2S4SS|4.0|Spoiler free review.    I have been a fan of Medium since the first season. I've always been intrigued by the supernatural, and the show had interesting cases, great acting and the kind of \\"family dynamic\\" that I have not seen in any other show (thanks mainly to Jake Weber and Patricia Arquette). And perhaps with the exception of the fourth season that may have suffered from the writer's strike, Medium has been an amazing ride.    So with season seven, you get more of the same - in a gratifying way - a collection of rather creative dreams and events that are thankfully not followed by an obvious solution. The first episode of the season has all of it, and sets the tone for what's to follow. There are, of course, some similarities to the previous seasons, like the usual arguments between Allison and Joe as well as kind of a temporary falling-out between some characters. As the creators knew that this was going to be the last season, they aim to wrap things up with the other family members, like Allison's brother and Joe's mom. It is kind of a nice touch.    What almost crashed the rating to three stars was the finale. Bluntly put, it breaks every convention and continuity set previously by the series, and is poorly written in general. I can see what they tried to do with it, but it just fails on so many levels. They clearly crammed too much material into one episode, and there was no build-up to the events whatsoever. And yes, I am intentionally not giving any hints. But it's bad.    Should you get the seventh season? For sure! It's worth the ride even if the last bit is disappointing.

6305075492|5.0|\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" fascinated me and gave me chills every step of the way! This is a brilliantly done film that deserves its place on the short list of just about any fan of horror films and especially early silent-era horror films. Indeed, it is considered to be the first true horror film; not a single earlier shocking film could match this one! The acting is flawless in every respect; the use of make-up reflects great forethought. The use of color tinted film, the English intertitles with the original artwork and the musical score by Timothy Brock help set the atmospheric tone for the film as the movie employs both realist and stylized expressionist techniques and settings. The sets, some of which were primarily made of paper, have nightmarish, slanted and distorted views of streets and more to frighten the audience and suggest madness. Near the end of the film there is a horizontal line close to the top of screen; this is probably from the original copy and it is not considered a defect in the DVD copy.<br /><br />We first see two men talking in a courtyard one night; one of them, Francis (Friedrich Feher), tells a shocking tale to the other. Francis speaks of an elderly man, Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), who wandered into the town of Holstenwall where a fair was about to begin. We see Caligari get a permit for his \\"exhibit,\\" a somnambulist named Cesare who responds to his commands--and the questions of others when they ask him their future. While Caligari gets his permit, the town clerk, in a very bad mood, gives him a hard time and Caligari doesn't like that one bit.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two friends Francis and Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) go to the town fair for amusement. But things change quickly; indeed, the rest of their day is anything but fun. Francis and Alan attend Dr. Caligari's exhibition of Cesare the somnambulist; but Alan becomes quite fearful when Cesare predicts that Alan will only live until the dawn of the very next day! Moreover, Alan and Francis are both in love with the beautiful Jane Olsen (Lil Dagover); they agree to let Jane decide which of them she will marry but each one fears a bitter disappointment if she chooses the other.<br /><br />Tragedy comes as things quickly go from bad to worse. First the town clerk is found dead; and then the next day Alan is found dead just as Cesare predicted! Francis suspects that Cesare might have committed the murders although he has no real evidence to go on. A third murder almost takes place although this time a man is apprehended before he can commit the crime--and all of them, including the police, must wonder if this man, Cesare--or perhaps even someone else--is perpetrating and attempting these terrible crimes.<br /><br />Naturally, there's much, much more than this to the plot; but I will leave out the rest so as not to spoil it for you! You'll be glued to the screen as you watch this amazing film. Pay close attention to the ending which has a most shocking, completely unexpected finale.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a short extra entitled \\"Genuine: A Tale of a Vampire.\\" We get a drawing of the Marmorhaus Cinema in Berlin where this picture premiered in late February, 1920; and there is an optional running commentary by Mike Budd.<br /><br />\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" will appeal to anyone interested in well done, classic horror films especially if they are from the silent movie era.

0143113100|5.0|As a licensed cognitive brain trainer, teacher and mom of children with special needs, this book was one of the first books I read when studying about neuroplasticity and the brain's ability to change.  When you are told the brain can change it sounds great, right?  But you want some proof - at least I did.  My daughter suffered from a traumatic brain injury and while studying in the field of cognitive brain training everyone kept telling me don't worry the brain can change.  After reading this book, I was full of hope and very inspired to help not only my daughter but other children as well. I even reached to a few of names mentioned in the book relative to special devices that helped people overcome and retrain the brain.  I usually recommend this book to the parents of the children I work with to provide them with additional stories of hope and encouragement beyond the success stories I have had with my own students.
0375703764|5.0|This book is dense. No doubt. However, a lot can be skipped but you will return to those pages, so I would suggest you just read through. It is well thought out and has several many layers, not to mention the ones you end up adding yourself. I would also suggest listening to the author's sister's album, Haunted. It adds a dimension of creepy that the book alone cannot.

B002VECMAE|2.0|Great premise, great cast but didn't achieve greatness. The premise of many zany govt military conspiracy-plots being illuminated in one film, mated w/ pop culture/ urban legends is worthy of a film and fair game. Why not mix every Area 51-ESP-Astral Projection-Black Ops rumor into a movie then add supernatural comic book ideas? (Dim Mak death touch, walking thru walls etc).<br /><br />The real problem w/ trying to make an intelligent satirical movie is that folks who will understand intelligent satirical movies don't watch movies. Wry, crisp satire can burn a hole thru a book's pages but in a film it can fall flat. Super clever jokes often aren't sight gags and movies are visually dependent. George Clooney is a great actor who tries to make films of value; the intent was there but the vehicle failed. It reminds me of \\"Syriana\\" great premise, a lot of effort but it failed under it's own well intentioned weight.<br />sorry,
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was browsing for some reading from my kindle and downloaded Hunger Games. Four days later I had finished all three books in the series.  Obviously, I had a hard time putting them down.  Suzanne Collins does an excellent job of creating characters you want to care about and keepng the story line moving along.  The end of the third book feels a little forced, but overall the three books will not disappoint.      The books were written for a junior high/highchool audience so the violent scenes aren't overly gory.  Hoever, both adults and younger audiences will enjoy these.

Very thought provoking and shows you that being persistant and steadfast in your beliefs can result in a positive outcome. Thus having a more positive outlook on life in general can also bring you to this same good ending.  Plan to watch this movie again in the near future.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed this trilogy emensely, however, I found the ending a little disappointing.  The plot line felt forced and rushed at the end and lost a bit of the storytelling magic.  It felt like Collins was trying to wrap up the story and was running out of pages in which to do it.  In addition, the deaths of a couple of characters (no spoilers, don't worry) didn't have as much impact as they should have.   All said, I still recommend the triology as a highly enjoyable read.

He's enormous compared to her and his dramatic, but not quite hansome, looks make him \\"beastly\\"  like Mr. Rochester should be.  I think this is the most filled out version too, but it doesn't drag.  Each episode has poigniant moments to look forward to. I also like how there are less cut aways and close-ups like more recent version.  Instead its played in the older style which is more like watching a play.  This can be boring in other movies but works here because the actors are so interesting. You can watch how their interactions unfold without feeling interupted. The result is that it seems very naturalistic and raw.  Timothy Dalton's best role!! (of course, I'm not a James Bond type :S)  P.S. A very different version that I also like is the newest version with Michael Fassbender as Rochester.  It's strengths are more in the tone created by the camera's aristry.  This one also has an interesting dynamic between the two leads.  It is very moving although it comes across very different than in this version.  That version is a little rushed though and suffer's most in the final scene with an all too breif ending  P.P.S. I just wanted to note with curiosity that the picture Amazon posted for this movie is of a woman but it's not Zelah Clarke!  I don't think that woman is even in this!! :P  **EDIT 12/11/11**  They put a picture up from the real show!  Also...I noticed Zelah in another period film, Lady Jane. So your trivia is to comment on what small part she plays in the movie :)
6305076995|5.0|Many of us have waited almost forty years to see what we heard back then. Anyone that doesnt like it shouldnt have bought it because they just must not have liked Yes that much. They dont understand how central to the time in our lives this album was. Thats Ok because they can keep listening to the crap they make today.     Ironic that you can get all the crap you want on video nowadays that was recorded new and digitally but the great stuff like this is just fine for us true fans! So shut up you who put this down, it wasnt meant for you.    As a review for the DVD, just what I thought it would be like. Makes you shake your fist in the air and scream out Yeeeeaaaaahhhhh!!!! at the end. Nuff said.    All that can be said about this is put on the album and imagine what Yes playing their instruments and singing would look like. That is what this is. Audio and video are as good as you could get from then. This is history.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Revelator is the first CD from the Tedeschi Trucks band and I certainly hope it's the first of many. WOW! This ensemble is musically magical. Both Derick Trucks and Susan Tedeschi are great artists in their own right, but together; it's an experience all its own.   With a phenominal band and great performances, Revelator is a special CD. Husband and wife Trucks and Tedeschi's musical marriage is certainly made in heaven. Buy this CD now!
B00001OH80|4.0|I remember buying this on cassette in the 80's i love this Album played it alot at the time,<br /><br />Tonight- with Tina Turner,\\"Don't Look Down\\",\\"Loving The Alien\\",\\"Neighbourhood Threat\\" Dancing with the big boys, A good followup to let's Dance IMO would like to get it on CD.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This was purchased for the song 'Underneath Your Clothes' because it is my song for my husband; but the entire cd is an audio treat. So many songs showing off her vocal talents.  Buying it was a good move & I'm really glad I did.  It won't be my last.
1451629184|5.0|What an ordeal Jaycee faced for all those years by that crazy NUT and for her to come out of it with an appreciation of life and not full of bitterness is inspiring.  I consider myself a very strong and forgiving person but I don't believe I would have the same attitude she does if had endured all those years of suffering like she did.  Always know when you think your life has gotten rough, someone else always has it worse.  I wish her nothing but a long life of happiness and enjoyment and I hope Phillip rots in jail and is abused by inmates the way he abused Jaycee.  He's a freak!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS BOOK FROM THIS SELLER AND ALSO BUYING THE BOOK IN GENERAL AS THE AUTHOR OFFERS A GREAT PERSPECTIVE ON SHOWING UP FOR YOUR MUSE/CREATIVITY/YOURSELF.
030726999X|5.0|So much has been written about this trilogy. Lisbeth is one of the most memorable characters I have ever encounter in literature.  I was feeling bad while reading as she did not have as big a part in this book and also because I knew it was almost over.  I do not want to give away anything but Lisbeth in the court room was alone worth reading the trilogy for. As another review said when you get to page 400 or so lock your door and turn off all electronic equipment but a light and enjoy the read.  Larsson was one of the very best.  He will be missed
B004MARLJ2|5.0|Oh my goodnes .. I looooooove this game. The CPU is very challenging and such a bastard hahahahaha. Im hookt and also get fraustrated alot of times
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I love this movie but the digital sound will cause AV to get out of sync on cheaper blu-ray players, i.e. Insignia (well talked about in several forums too also mentioning LG which is one of the 4 potential manufacturers of Insignia products so that figures). Get a better blu-ray player before you get this or you'll be sorry (it happens in battle scenes and it's terrible to see the impact and then here it 2 seconds later). I bought one used from Family Video and thought it was defective, took it back the next did the same and my brother in-law's new one as well, since upgrading my living room to a Samsung Blu-Ray Player no problems (though still will in the bedroom where the Insignia is now).
B004MARLJ2|5.0|In a market filled with hundreds of bejewelled imitators and bubble poppers, finally something original.\nCute graphics without being too cute, a genuine challenge without being impossible, this game manages an excellent balancing act rarely found these days. I would 100% recommend this game.  Huge thumbs up to the devs on this one.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I was looking for an inexpensive closed ear headset and wanted good sound quality and comfort.  My budget limited me to something under $30.00. The last two headsets I purchased were also inexpensive and were not comfortable, sounded bad and broke in about 6 months.  So this time I did as much research as I could to see if I could get a decent headset within my budget.    I could not be happier with my purchase.  The headset sounds great and the mic also works well.  The headset is very comfortable.  Instead of vinyl around the ears, they have felt that is very comfortable for long periods of time.  The cord is very well made and I believe it should last (every other inexpensive headset always broke at the plug connection).  You can feel the quality in the manufacturing.      Some reviewers complained about the lack of bass.  This headset has plenty of bass and it should satisfy most users.  If you want better bass you should be looking for a headset in the $100-$200 or higher and not in the sub-$50.00 range.  For the price I paid, this headset is a steal.     The only negative might be the over-all size of the headset. They are large but not heavy.  If you use them with a webcam they will be noticeably larger than a the thin kind of headsets.  But my webcam has a mic, so I don't use them for that purpose.

0765357151|5.0|Despite many new caricatures currently being done with vampire lore, Richard Matheson's \\"I am Legend\\" still stands out in the crowd. His novel provides a fascinating, scientific twist on the origin of vampires. One of the most notable trends endemic towards his and other horror novels written in the \\"Cold-War Era,\\" were the constant admonitions given by novelists against nuclear weapons. Since the \\"vampiris bacillus\\" gets spread in the throes of a future nuclear war, atomic weapons shouldn't be used! I personally believe the omens provided by Matheson and other writers during the dawn of our \\"Atomic Age\\" helped, in no small measure, to end the Cold War.

B0037YOMWS|4.0|I needed a solid calculator for MAcc classes that prohibit graphing functions and heavy onboard memory during finals. At first I thought the purchase would be a waste, as I have other calculators that are more fully functioned. I have been pleasantly surprised by the HP and use it on a daily basis. The bond feature has been a dream for amortization tables, the other financial functions have made my work-flows faster and smoother, and now the Black-Scholes function is figuring heavily in my derivatives class. As a package, the HP is great. The only things I would like are a better screen, The LCD looks really dated and ugly, and slightly more bulk/quality in the case. Other calculators feel like they can and will last a lifetime, this one doesn't, and its a shame.
0786182466|5.0|This is quite simply the best audiobook recording I have ever listened to. Working with the amazing source material, Barrett Whitener gives a highly-skilled performance that left me falling over laughing. \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" has long been one of my favorite books of all time, and I'm so happy that I was able to rediscover its charm through this recording. I highly recommend this if only so you can hear Whitener's booming voice cry out, \\"OH MY GOD!\\"
0307266303|4.0|My book never actually came in; however, it wasnt their fault, it just got lost in the mail. So despite never receiving the actual product, i commend these people for AMAZING customer service. When i contacted them about the fact that the shipment never arrived, they responded very promptly and courteously offered a refund. I would not hesitate to order from this company again as they are very professional.
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|The number of positive reviews of this film is astonishing, but if possible I'm even more amazed at how mild the negative reviews generally are. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a truly awful movie. There was not a single believable moment in the whole thing, not the plot, not the acting, not the dialogue, not even the costumes and the props. (Those giant balloon Pottery Barn wine glasses in constant use--really? They expected us to believe that's everyday glassware for Europeans?) And the narration! Criticism of the quality of the narrator's voice is quite beside the point, people. Why was it there at all? It was like having someone read at you a bad first draft of the short story on which the movie was based while it played in the background. The characters were meant to be passionate, but they really seemed to be acting passionate and inventing drama to relieve their excruciating boredom. Unfortunately, none of it relieved ours.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I am a late comer to the firefly fan group, but having watched the movie and season one which is the first and last season of the show; I share in the cast and fans sadness that this show did not continue for many seasons.  The depth of the characters and back stories was exceptional and the \\"moral\\" of the story, if you will, rivaled the star trek series. That should make you a fan as well.
B003Y5H542|4.0|The good thing  audio and video is reference quality however for my personal taste the story could have been better, it,s hard to explane. After seeing the whole movie i had a slight dissapointed feeling because the story could have been better/stronger.

6304698798|5.0|Hands down, the best western ever made! No need to ever watch another. These three electrify the screen. The  suspenseful twists and turns keep you glued to your seat. I watched this for the first time as a kid with my father who wasa cowboy junkie....this movie made an 8 year old black girl a cowboy junkie too. You won't regret taking the time to watch this!!!!
072325804X|5.0|I bought this for our grandson's first birthday and it arrived just in time. It is gift quality, housed in a slip-jacket, and beautifully illustrated. Although, he is too young to appreciate it now, I am hoping he will love it later on as so many other children have throughout the years. It is definitely a keepsake item and would be perfect as a baby shower gift or for a birthday, as we did. I highly recommend this gorgeous book.
1451629184|5.0|I am only half way through the book. I am fighting to put this book down. Her story is so touching, and you feel all her pain. I wouldnt be surprised if i read it again. Im not a big reader, but this book keeps you going.
B004WJRJUE|5.0|So, in the day I had the original vinyl of the Secret records edition, then the later the US remix. Then I bought the original CD, and then i bought the recent Spitfire remaster. Over the years you kind of forget which is which sometimes. So I bought this edition...and all I can say is WOW!!! I have never really ever did a side by side comparison of the original Secret release and the American Atlantic release, but I did an A/B test of this CD with the Spitfire edition, and what a night and day difference. THIS version is by far more twisted than the other. Raw, gutsy, all out power from TS. The other edition is sooooo different, even the guitar tone sounds higher throughout. This one has way more power and anger in it. THIS is true TS music, not that other pale comparison. And the DVD....oh my, could it be any better? Classic, early days concert, pro shot, sounding decent for the time. GREAT addition to this already amazing release. BUT WAIT...on top of all of that, we get the original four tracks from the early Ruff Cutt release, and even THEY sound amazing. I love all things twisted, but by far this album and their second are my absolute favorites. THIS IS THE VERSION YOU HAVE TO BUY, and it sucks that Amazon is displaying the wrong cover, but the right one has been loaded by someone too.
034552554X|4.0|Victoria Jones has spent most of her life in the foster care system. Today is her 18th birthday; she has aged out of the system and is now emancipated. Victoria wants nothing more than to leave the group home she is living in, never to return.<br /><br />Through her social worker, Meridith, Victoria is given some money, a place to live and instructions to find a job. Instead of finding work, she spends her days in the park where she plants and cares for flowers. Flowers are what give her peace and she feels a special relationship with them. Within a few months she is kicked out of her new home for she has no job and no money with which to pay the bills.<br /><br />Victoria is now living in the public park. Days turn into weeks and she is hungry and getting desperate. When she asks a local florist to give her a job she is surprised the woman is willing to take a chance on her and says yes. But Victoria has a gift, she understands the language of flowers which she learned in one of her foster homes, and the florist is impressed with her abilities. Things begin to go well for her, customers adore her and business is booming. But when Victoria encounters a mysterious stranger at the flower market, someone familiar, she knows she must face up to her past.<br /><br />The book alternates between the present and a period about 10 years ago when Victoria was placed in a foster home under the care of Elizabeth, who wanted to adopt her. By all accounts Victoria seems happy. But the adoption never happened; something went wrong.<br /><br />Victoria is a flawed and dysfunctional character but so very likable. Many of the things she does don't make sense on the surface but when viewed through the prism of someone who feels unloved and unwanted, they become more understandable. That she has a painful secret in her past only made me want even more for her to succeed and to be happy. There was one point where she does something so outrageous and so irresponsible that I became disappointed in her. (No spoilers, but if you read the book, you will know). After what she did, the ending tied things up a little too neatly and that was the only thing that kept me from a 5-star rating because I truly loved this book.<br /><br />I could relate to the flowers providing peace and happiness for Victoria. As an avid gardener I spend many hours surrounded by flowers. The Dictionary of Flowers included in the back of the book was a delight. I never knew flowers had a meaning and now I'm looking up their meaning before I give them to anyone.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book, at times painful and heartbreaking and at others redemptive and joyful. It shines a light on the foster care system and the toll it can take on the children living within it and the people who try to help them. The flowers bring bursts of happiness as Victoria is able to help others and bring joy to their lives. Highly recommended.if you read the book, you will know).

I recommended it to all of my friends. I read the whole book in one sitting. I know this book was written for teens, but it is thoroughly enjoyable for an adult audience. I can't say enough about it. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. This is one for the ages. Do yourself a favor. BUY THIS BOOK IMMEDIATELY! You won't regret it.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy Its the best one on the market to go with most strollers.<br />+ Very useful to keep cell phone and small purse - any small items safe.<br />+ It holds my coffee cup / water bottle and my Baby's bottle.<br />+ Attaches very well to the stroller !<br />+ Matches well with the Black or any dark color strollers.<br />+ So worth the price. Not ripoff expensive like branded stroller accessories !<br />+ Just love it ! I am sure you wont regret the purchase at all.
B005HBP75K|5.0|I liked the episode alot... The surprising twist with the 'set-up' on Mike and Jesse's trip was a suspenseful touch, and this episode, like so many others in the series, illustrates what great television does to you; it leaves one hungry for more.  And while the context is important for comprehension of the series, I really feel like Breaking Bad excels at drawing a convincing 'short story' with most episodes; if I knew nothing of the show, I still could have enjoyed this A+ episode.  While nothing was so mesmerizing about any particular scene, by the time we are at the end of the episode, I can do nothing but wonder obsessively about next weeks chapter... Will Hank piece together the evidence, especially now after hearing the alcohol fueled, ego driven, boastful rant made by Walt?  What was Esposito's purpose in making Jesse a 'hero'?  Why can't I fast forward life to next Sunday? (bc I want more Breaking Bad!)
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I am so happy with this app. For a small price I now can fall alseep quickly to different background noises that have been so comforting to me.

B00026WU7I|4.0|This is my favorite Dylan record and so I was happy to buy this CD a second time to check out the remastering.  I was at first shocked by the mangled \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\"  as the mix does not feel true to the original release.  There's too much reverb on Bob's voice, the drum's are up in your face, and the bass is buried.  But the rest of the record recovers nicely and comparing the remastered tracks side by side with my first copy of the CD release shows these songs in far better detail.  It's much louder too without sounding at all compressed.  It's a shame about the first track as that song means the most to me out of Bob's entire catalog.

B00007GZR5|5.0|If you are a hopeless romantic, or simply a fan of love stories, this is a movie for you.  Telling the story of a love which endures even unto death, and traverses the very landscape (or should I say \\"dreamscape\\") of Hell, \\"What Dreams May Come\\" was a wonderful film.<br /><br />The film was stunningly vivid; watching it was like stepping into a dream.  While the creators of the film took much license when filming, \\"What Dreams May Come\\" nonetheless is capable of holding it's own against other films, as well as the book (of the same title) upon which it was based.  If you enjoy this movie, consider purchasing the book--I know that I did.

B000V86OKG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Dexter, and the season is a worthy second installment to the series.  Like most of these series (HBO, Showtime, etc), I didn't think the second season was as good as the first season.  Obviously, since I'm giving it five stars I still enjoyed it immensely and recommend it without hesitation, but there's just something about season 1 that's lacking here.  That doesn't take anything away from the acting/production of the cast and crew; it's still top notch.  I think what people may be surprised about is how much further Dexter (the character) seems to push the line between good and evil towards \\"evil,\\" and how, despite this, we still connect, feel, and pull for him.    Bottom line: Season 1 was one of the best seasons for a TV show ever, and while Season 2 isn't quite on par with it, it's still great TV that you should watch.
030788743X|5.0|Do you know who Gary Gygax is?  Can you quote lines from nearly every John Hughes movie?  Ever wish you could drive a Delorean?    If you answered yes to any of these than run now and buy a copy of Ready Player One because your favorite book of the year has arrived. In fact, buy two so you have one to lend out knowing your collection is still complete. The movie [[ASIN:B003G715JO Fanboys [Blu-ray]]] was Cline's love letter to Star Wars while Ready Player One is his scrawled over notebook to everything he loved about the 70's and 80's and tied into a story just as memorable as all the movies and games he mentions. Even if you don't get all the references the story can most definitely still be enjoyed.    Ready Player One is pure adventure mixing media, a dystopian future, and a virtual world known as OASIS. A virtual treasure hunt for the fortune of the world's richest man and most famous game designer has been announced, but 5 years later no one seems close to solving the puzzle. Everyone wants in, but few have the skills and knowledge until all hell breaks loose as gunter (egg hunter) Wade Watts cracks the first clue.    With lots of humor and pop-culture references that never seem forced Cline has created one of my favorite Sci-Fi novels of the last decade. It isn't hard Sci-Fi by any stretch, but an adventure style quest with pop-culture trappings in a virtual world where everything can be made real. Ready Player One also has heart and lovable characters as believable friendships and relationships develop. There is an evil corporation that you'll love to hate and there is even a bad guy you just pray will get his in the end. All in all Cline has stacked the deck to make this a memorable read that I finished in two days.    Children of the 80's rejoice and get your geek crush on. This is one to savor and fall over in love with again upon each eventual re-read.     Now if we could only transport the Richard Donner of the 80's through time to direct the eventual awesome movie that will be Ready Player One...

0307477479|5.0|Perhaps it's a result of when I read it, just following the death of my mother, but Jennifer Egan's A Visit From the Goon Squad had a profound effect on me.  Few books I've read have encapsulated my hopes and thoughts quite so much as this one.  A Visit From the Goon Squad is about middle age, about growing up and remembering the past -- realizing how fleeting youth is, and how with age you lose track of the scope of time, and the past and present begin to coexist in the same space. It's also about the web of associations we build in life, the influence of people we've never met on people we have met -- and therefore, feel the influence of those connected strangers on our own lives. That if you follow the chain of relationships back everyone is connected with everyone else. Our mentors had mentors who are our mentors, too.  And we just might be the mentors of their children.<br /><br />The book opens on Sasha, a woman working in the New York City music industry who goes on a date with a man she met on an online dating site. From there, the novel spins out, bouncing from character to character as it spreads through a web of associations that begins and ends with Sasha. It crosses space and time, and loops back to that date and in the end you get an incredible sense of lives lived and lost, and the little things that connect us all together. Goon Squad celebrates a generation of young people coming of age in the latter half of the twentieth century -- myself included, back when I was young -- to whom music was everything, the very definition of cool and identity. It puts in perspective the fleeting moments of our lives when we went to shows, did drugs, drank and saw the future as limitless and full of possibility, only to wake up and realize our time as parents of small children greatly eclipsed our oh-so-brief time as punks.<br /><br />In addition, the book is a scathing literary and cultural satire -- at once hilarious and tragic, and un-ironically postmodern, ultimately terminating somewhere in the suburbs of a post-science fiction city built by William Gibson. You've no doubt read about the chapter written as Powerpoint slides -- and as much of a gimmick as it might seem, it works brilliantly in presenting the anxieties of a young girl and her family. Egan closes on  a future where social media alone can create a star, where the connections between people aren't inherent and subtle, but are open and clearly graphed out on the Internet for everyone to see.<br /><br />A variety of editions, including an iOS version, have been released, but don't let the hype fool you -- this is a really great book enhanced, not hindered by the marketing and well-deserving of winning the Pulitzer Prize. Of all the novels I've reviewed in the past two years, this is undoubtedly my favorite.  I am so sad that I've finished it, but can't wait to plunge back in to re-examine the associations I've missed.g somewhere in the suburbs of a post-science fiction city built by William Gibson.

B004YTGRMI|5.0|As written on the Living Rockumentary of the band School for the Dead:[[ASIN:B001D741NG A Telephone Built For Two]]:    This morning, I went down to my cd shelf to get my album-for-the-day. I decided in the shower that I wanted to listen to \\"Fables of the Reconstruction\\" (or \\"Reconstruction of the Fables if you bought the cassette, I think) by R.E.M. It's what I consider the sleeper album by the band.    For me there are two different R.E.M.s, or maybe three. There's the \\"real\\" R.E.M. who put out Chronic Town, Reckoning, and Murmur, then there is the transition R.E.M. who put out Fables of the Reconstruction, Life's Rich Pageant, some of the songs on Document and some of the songs on Green, and even a couple of the songs on Out of Time. (You could even argue that they were responsible for Night Swimming and that Andy Kaufman song) Then there is the new R.E.M. who I don't consider to be R.E.M. at all really, just a band that has some good songs.    Anyway, I always considered \\"Fables\\" to be the sleeper R.E.M. album, it was a step away from the airy free-form earlier albums, it was a bit more tightly wrapped and packaged. It's first three notes, the crazy guitar riff to \\"Feeling Gravity's Pull\\" are a warning that this is something different.    My brother tells the story of one of his trips going to see R.E.M. way back. He was outside the venue while they were doing the sound check and he heard those three screaming dissonant guitar notes and thiought, \\"what is this all about?\\" Little did he know how familiar that riff would become to him and all of us fans.    This morning, though, I accidentally grabbed \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" off of the shelf instead of \\"Fables\\". That's ok. I like this album, too.    So, this is what I realized. \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" is the sleeper album now. When it came out, my friends and I listened to it non-stop. My old band The Shrugs attempted to cover just about every song on there. But since then I have let it slide. I listened to it so manytimes back in the day, that it didn't seem like I needed to listen to it again.    But, I've decided to bring this album back into my life and give it some of the love that it deserves. This was the last R.E.M. album where it felt like the band was still my friends. It's the last personal sounding effort. The last one with earnest good feeling humor.    I don't know what happened on \\"Document\\", their next release, but in comparison to its predecessors it sounds like it came out of a machine rather than a group of friends on the front porch.    \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" is awesome. It's not as a consistent sounding album as their others, each song seems like its own thing rather than all the songs blending together, like they were famous for. When I say that, I mean like they were famous for in my head only.    But man, there are some killer songs on this album.        1. Begin the Begin: R.E.M.s first release with a full rock-distorted chords? Is that right?        2. These Days: What about this song? Who ever thinks of this song? Perfectly portrays the surprising energy of their live performances.        3. Fall On Me: Forget about it. This is the single from the album right? You gotta love the three different vocal parts on the chorus and the lyrics that are just obscured enough that people feel smart when the figure out what it is about.        4. Cuyahoga: Indie kids (college rock kids back then) of 1986, your bass playing career begins with this song. Have fun.        5. Hyena: Bounce around in the gentle nerdy mosh-pit and sing along with another of their most energetic releases.        6. Underneath the Bunker: Oh, I thought this was the coolest thing ever. Now I see why. This sounds like my friends Mike, Michael, Bill, and Peter messing around in the studio.        7. Flowers of Guatemala: Yes! Listen Wendell Gee it's the old R.E.M. back again with another beauty.        8. I Believe: What is that a banjo? This song should have been a bigger hit. I'd like to doa cover of it please. As Phil from the River would say, \\"Yeah! Solid stuff there from R.E.M.\\"        9. What If We Give It Away?: This is the sleeper on the sleeper. Perfect, perfect song. Again, it harkens back to a simpler band with harder to package songs. Wispy and flowing. The band at its best. No, this is the one I want to cover.        10. Just a Touch: It's Hyena again, quick run back to the front of the stage. Ok...they could have left this off of the album.        11. Swan Swan H: Where did this song come from? A sea chantey? Wonderful, I think I'll play it a million times on my guitar yet never learn the lyrics.        12. Superman: A cover song of excellent choosing. One of the easiest songs to play ever. Everybody loves it.    So, yeah, \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" it's not just something Peter Sellars mutters after falling in a fountain. Dig it.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love this show, and this is the best or second best season of the five seasons (no spoilers).  What makes Dexter so compelling is the way it blurs the lines between good and evil, and it does a great job of making you feel for and connect with the \\"good\\" serial killer.  This show is absolutely amazing, and if you're interested in watching then start right here with Season 1.    Do know what you're getting into, however.  Remember it is Showtime, so this is not some network prime-time show watered down because of fears about the FCC or Focus on the Family.  This is raw, challenging, creative television.  You will see people killed, you will see blood (lots of it), you will see dismembered bodies, you will hear cursing (lots of it), you will some sexual acts, etc.  This isn't a horror movie, but you can't feel faint at the sight of blood.    This is great television series, on par for entertainment quality with The Wire (which I think was more groundbreaking, for what it's worth), and Season 1 is the perfect place to start.
1451629184|5.0|It is true.  I don't read....unless you count magazines.  I get easily distracted and find it takes too long to read a book cover to cover.  But this book, I finished in less then a day.  And that's with kids and a husband to distract me.  Amazing read.  Jaycee Dugard is such an amazing person.  This book really made me appreciate the things around me.    I know it sounds crazy but I am actually thrilled to have finished a book cover to cover.  I was probably a child the last time that happened.  Now, on to the next book!
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech charmed me into doing a little research on the facts, and to my delight, the film followed fact very closely. This made it more delightful for me, although learning that the king, a genuinely kind and loving person, did develop lung cancer after having been warned by Logue about smoking, was sad. Hearing that being of royal birth did not in itself protect one from neglect and even cruelty leveled the playing field, creating compassion for this man who ostensibly had every advantage. Mocked by his family, so bereft of actual friends excepting his wife, the king finally succumbed to the kindly-intended invasions of his privacy by Lionel Logue, allowing him to succeed in conquering his stammer at a time of convergence of the dreaded microphone, Hitler's advances, and Edward's abdication of the throne. An elegant film with charming music and great faltering tenderness.
0553801473|4.0|It is probably impossible to judge this book without comparing it to the others, so I'll get that out of the way.  It is not as exciting or as eventful as Storm of Swords or Clash of Kings, but it is more satisfying than Feast for Crows.  Of course, if you've made it through the first four you're going to read this one anyway.  It felt very good after a number of years to be back with the characters you love from the first three books.  Most of the chapters are little snippets the characters' journey or snapshots of their day to day life-in many cases adjusting to a new role.  Most of these serve to embellish and expand upon the world Martin has created, which is fine by me because it is a place I enjoy spending time.  It might seem like a slow build but there are important events happening by the end of the book: more intrigue, conspiracies, deaths and cliffhangers. The worst part of the book will be knowing that, once finished, you have no idea how long to wait until you can return to the events of Westeros.
0194325385|5.0|the amazon service was perfect, as usual! at the beginning I was not so sure about using amazon to buy the books I need, but then it turned out to be my first choice.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|In my opinion the Pro Elite Wireless Controller is a decent replacement for the Sony OEM PS3 controller if the price is right.  Here are some pros and cons of this product in my time using it:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Really like he textured surface.  it feels more comfortable in my hands than the standard PS3 controller.<br />- Lighted buttons are a nice touch, although in practice you really aren't looking at these very much.<br />- Didn't notice any issues with joystick dead zones as noted in other reviews.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Still trying to get used to the changed positions of the direction pad and left joystick.  I guess that they did this to appeal to those coming from the XBox 360, but for those of us who are used to the \\"standard\\" arrangement of the Sony Dualshock controller I would have left well enough alone.<br />- I've had occasional trouble with the direction pad; in some cases I attempt to push in one direction but the response is in another (I push down but the response is left or right).  Perhaps this is because the direction pad is a single control on the Pro Elite where it is four separate buttons on the Sony controller; in either case the Sony design is preferable.<br />- I'm not a fan of a controller that requires a USB dongle; why can't they just use Bluetooth like the Sony controller?<br /><br />In the end this is an OK alternative if it's priced aggressively compared to the Sony PS3 controller and you don't mind the revised layout.  But if the prices are comparable then I'd have to stick with the Sony controller over this one, as there are too many compromises and not enough benefits.
B00005JLEU|5.0|One summer morning, before the rest of my family was up, I went downstairs to watch some TV. I turned on the television and saw that this movie called \\"Spirited Away\\" was playing. It was at the opening credits, and I was about to change the channel when the beautiful score set a mesmerizing and serene atmosphere, and I couldn't help but continue to watch out of the score alone. I soon found out that this movie would hit me again and again with one amazing feature after another. I was never a fan of manga or anime, but this was a HUGE exception. I ended up watching the whole 2 hour movie, and when it had ended, I just sat there amazed at the fact that I had never heard of this movie before. Even though I'm a senior in high school, I will always defend this movie against claims of it being \\"for children\\". In short.....this was the first movie I have ever seen that left me speechless and astounded throughout the movie.
B000VOOLYQ|5.0|THis album is fantastic. I could go on and on about how amazing it is, but I will spare your eyes. :) This review is mainly for the bonus track that you get with this edition of the CD, Any Way the Wind Blows. It is a STUNNING song. Definitely one of my Sara favorites. I'm mad that it wasn't widely released. But truly, if you can get your hands on this album, do.
B001I0T92Q|3.0|I gave this a 3/5 because when using the device, it is super flimsy and fragile. It has a high chance to snap or break if you aren't careful. That being said, it worked as expected with a few setbacks. The one I received didn't seem to work with 2 micro SD cards of differing capacities. Strange. It worked with say 2 1gb cards, but not a 1gb and 512mb card.<br /><br />Consider how careful you are and your intended purpose. If it is a high wear situation (taking it out and putting it back into something often) then this is going to break fast. If you leave it in your camera or psp and use a USB cable instead to connect to a computer, then you are fine.
0375842209|5.0|I read this because being a book lover, I was taken by the title.  I'm not one to be able to point out the writing styles of books, I'm more of a story gal, but the way this was written was excellent.  So beautiful.  I have the kindle edition and I shared SO many quotes from this book from Death's narration.<br /><br />I put this on the list for my book club to vote for and it ended up being August's selection.  I'm rereading this happily and enjoying it all over again.<br /><br />A must read in my opinion.  I was shedding tears through a smile at the end.
0553801473|4.0|As a newcomer to the series, I fortunately was not faced with having to play the waiting game that so many others who have posted their reviews have had to do. I heard about HBO's show being developed about a year ago, and within about six months I had read the first four titles of the series. As such, I waited a mere six months for this book. That being said, I certainly can see what is making everyone else so angry. They waited a while for AFFC and were given an appetizer, then waited even longer and expected ADWD to be the main course. Instead, we are being given more small bits to munch on. However, these bits are tasty, and provided that Martin does not take an exponential amount of time to deliver the next volume, I can say I will fervently look forward to the next book. In the meantime, all of us are left to enjoy all of these wonderful characters being translated to television. So, enjoy the book, but don't expect a ton of answered questions. Then, go back and enjoy the next few years of Game of Thrones on HBO before the new book comes out. Plenty of other series leave cliffhangers as well, so it will just be up to the author to meet our expectations. Keep in mind, this author has not gone crazy or lost his mind. He loves these characters just as much, if not much much more, than any of us. He wants to see them receive the type of treatment they deserve. If you don't like what he feels his characters deserve, then read something else, because they are his books to write. So be patient, and until the next book, enjoy a thrilling look inside the minds of all of these characters with Dance. I guarantee that by the time this book comes to HBO, we will be in awe of what is on the screen, instead of looking at this book as a failure.
B00466HM28|4.0|First let me say that regardless of its appearance, this is NOT A TOY (unless you want it to be...) This is seriously capable for serious musicians.    If you are looking to buy this, then you know it has mini keys. For mini keys, the action is great (low, but expression is still there!) and the feel is fine. I thought they would not be so useful, and got this over the LPD8 because the price difference is so small, but they're great. I will use this with an Oxygen 49 instead of an LPD and Oxygen 61.    Little flourishes are quicker and easier on the mini keys because they're slightly closer together so you can move about more quickly, and take the octave down, and for a slow moving bass line, who needs keys anyway, that's easy enough on a computer keyboard, so it's just bonus at that point!    As for the pads, they are tough, and I'm not sure if they will \\"break in\\" or if I will get used to them, but they require punchy fingers. The LED inside is a great feature because it lets you know when you hit it (sometimes your finger hitting the pad is louder than the sound coming from your speakers) But this is easy and simple to remedy (research LPD pad mod).    The knobs are low, but you can still use two fingers on them, though it's almost nicer to only need one. Smooth action, and white on black is very readable.    Onboard ARP and program changes (which I can't figure out, manual is worthless, and can't find anything online) aren't useful since the arp tempo doesn't sync with the computer (slaves, but doesn't line up beats) and they could have pitch/mod instead of these extra buttons. I know they can be assigned to knobs, but 8 knobs gives 2 sets of 4 for envelope settings, and as for all the program changes and arp features, this is not a performance instrument - it's for writing in bed, or at the park, as an extra desktop controller, etc. There is no MIDI port, so you need a computer, and that's not a problem, but it should imply that pitch/mod would have been more desirable than all the extra features that nobody can figure out. This loses a star. Nice try, AKAI, maybe next time.    This unit is so sturdy, though, that I can bang on the keys almost as hard as I hit the pads and it doesn't have any give or flex. Feels solid straight through to my desk.    Love it, and even though I feel like I don't *need* it so much, I can't bring myself to return it at this price!
0439023521|5.0|I have been trying for months now to find a novel to read that even comes remotely close to the excellence and intensity of the first book in this series.   You must read this book!!!
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|The only thing that saved this movie was Johnny Depp.  Angelina was like a piece of cardboard-stiff and boring.  Same expression on her face LITERALLY the entire movie, her fake eyelashes were so dark and heavy she almost looked drugged.  She contributed a big fat ZERO to this movie.  The story line was intriguing (though a stretch at being believable) but Johnny Depp was humble, sweet and funny.  He played the role perfectly.  But Jolie ruined the film with her 'pursed lip' emotionless acting.  I used to like her, but will not go in a theatre to see her in a movie again.  She has lost her edge and desire to put out a good performance. She gives the impression it is just enough to have her in the movie...she doesn't need to act (ie..DIVA). Please producers, stop putting her in movies...save yourself a few mill...she's not worth it!!!!  ANY ACTRESS would have done a much better job....and it could have been a five star movie.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I&apos;ve been waiting for months for Cut the Rope to be the free app of the day. Yesterday I finally gave in and purchased it. I am not disappointed. It&apos;s a fun and adorable game and well worth 99&#162;.
006113399X|5.0|Exceptionally fine thriller, and historically informative on top of that.  I was fascinated from many angles by this almost unique novel.
B004LWZW24|3.0|This is scary. What's that materializing out of the gloom?     I did find the explanation for the manifestations to be rather silly and reaching - at first. But then as I thought about it, it seemed perhaps this movie provided as good an explanation as any for the existence of serial killers and for evil in general.    If you want a similar, but lower-key, more philosophical rationale for the existence of slow, dampening evil, I suggest you read J. B. Priestley's classic short story \\"The Grey Ones.\\"
0547338023|5.0|Antoine de Saint-Exupery's classic story The Little Prince comes alive in this graphic novel's presentation.  The graphic novel format makes it much easier to read and more enjoyable, as the illustrations enhance the text. Whereas I didn't enjoy reading the original story, I look forward to reading the graphic version again and again.
1439190275|5.0|I am still reading it BUT I am learning so much!! I did the \\"Atkins\\" diet in the \\"90\\"s. I had to stop because of the way the diet was back then. The \\"new\\" Atkins is well done!!
0439023521|5.0|I did not know what to expect when first purchasing this book.  I had read the synopsis but had no idea what I was getting myself into once I started it.  The book is entertaining, unpredictable (at times), and is easy to read.  It is a great book for leisure and I strongly recommending reading it on a vacation BUT you must have all of the books with you because you will fly through them.
B001NXDSLG|5.0|I saw this film in the theaters on its first run in 1970.  I saw the horrible pan and scan VHS tape versions.  I have the 1994 Director's cut DVD and the 2009 40th anniversary DVD.  Now today for the first time I watched the Blu-ray version of the film. I thought it was great.  It's the best looking video of the film I've ever seen and the audio has been remixed from the original multi-tracks as I understand it. The film has been restored as best as possible and it doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The multi-screen format of the original film has been lovingly followed, like the original theatrical release. I'm looking forward to the extras but I just wanted to put mu 2 cents here because previous feedback makes this sound like trash and it's not.  It's a great Blu-ray version of the film all things considered.<br /><br />My only wish is that Warner Brothers would also release the original shorter theatrical version of the film on Blu-ray.  This director's cut is nice with the extra footage but it makes the film rather sluggish.  I just prefer the tighter shorter original film version in retrospect.
0486282112|4.0|I think like almost every American kid, I grew up \\"Frankenstein\\" on the movie screen. And I think I've seen them all: Boris Karloff, the silent version, \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" \\"Bride of Frankenstein,\\" \\"Frankenstein vs The Mummy,\\" etc. I really thought I knew this story - the monster and the creator.<br /><br />Turns out, I didn't know anything. Mary Shelley was very young woman when she wrote this piece, and her immaturity in writing does reflect within the pages. More on that later. This novel is important, as it ushered in a genre never before experienced: science fiction. Although this genre would become more advanced and developed, this novel broke ground, so to speak. What is unfortunate is Mary Shelley had a concept (such as re-animating a corpse), but didn't have the knowledge or understanding of how those concepts might be realized, so there are gaps. For example, the reader goes from A to C and is never truly given an explanation for B.<br /><br />However, that's where imagination comes in, and the greater part of the story is not how certain concepts are realized, but a much larger moral issue. The question is: if humans have the capacity to defy the laws nature and play creator, should humans take on that role or should there be a code of morality to be considered? I do think this moral issue is also addressed in the movies I've seen, but not to such a large degree as it is in the book.<br /><br />The variances between the book and the movies are astounding. If you've seen the myriad movies made of \\"Frankenstein,\\" and believe you know the story, think again. The movie is really nothing like the book. The book offers so much more understanding of the \\"monster\\" - what he thinks, what he feels, and why he does what he does.<br /><br />The writing style is a bit obtuse and outdated, but then, this was written during the gothic period. Also, Mary Shelley was quite young, and was not as seasoned a writer and it shows. Still, the novel is short and fairly easy to read, and the character and personality Mrs. Shelley gives the \\"monster\\" is well worth it.ersonality Mrs. Shelley gives the \\"monster\\" is well worth it.
1936719118|5.0|In this candid account of his experience creating, growing and selling CDBaby, Derek Sivers shows us that success in business has more to do with keeping things simple and being true to yourself than following preconceived notions of success like growing at all costs and obsessing over the financial aspects of the business.  Of all the manifestos published so far by The Domino Project this is the one I've enjoyed the most and found most useful.
1612680003|5.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend. I bought it used but it looks brand spankin new. Beautiful. I am very pleased with it. It came in just a few days too. No waiting around!
1451629184|5.0|I was little girl from South Lake Tahoe like Jaycee. She's just a few years older than me and lived in the neighborhood down the road from mine. Her kidnapping changed my view of the world when I was about 7 years old. I realized the world, even in beautiful Lake Tahoe, wasn't always safe. In some small way, I've always felt connected with Jaycee and reading her story was something I felt I owed to her.    The book itself is honest and revealing. Parts of it were difficult to read. Especially since these horrible events were happening to an 11 year old girl. This book gives a good insight as to what her life was like all those years in captivity. And it symbolizes her strength in making it out a sane person and a loving mother.
0316098337|5.0|amazing true to life and amazingly written.  i'll be reading more by this author.  it was so scary i had to stop again and again because i was afraid of what would be on the next page. i loved Jack and Ma and didn't want anything to happen to them. i knew that since this book was so good, i REALLY cared and i didn't want to be depressed every time i thought of this book.
0307477479|5.0|Yes, the book is a little jarring since every chapter is told from a different POV.  And I didn't believe it either when I heard that one entire chapter was nothing but PowerPoint slides.  But I loved it.  I loved how the character's lives intertwined.  I just imagined the author with a huge wipe board with the characters names and strings sweeping from one to another while she fleshed out their world.  Please read it with an open mind, and I think it'll become a favorite.
B000FC11A6|5.0|This book is amazing - one of my favorites - and I don't have anything to add. Just know that if you're reading the Kindle version, the book ends at the 87% mark, which is much earlier than most books. This totally caught me off guard and kind of took the impact out of the ending because I was expecting another ~100 pages of reading.
B000F3T7RE|4.0|I should probably start this by saying that I love Shostakovich. That being said, I would highly recommend his string quartets to anyone, especially at this price. This set is a great bargain. I have no qualms with the quality of the recording. However, I did not realize when I bought it that this was a LIVE recording. I find the fact that the applause is included to be highly annoying. However, if you do not mind, then go for it!
B004MARLJ2|5.0|This is a great game hands down. Some of the levels are very challenging, and that was exactly what made me enjoy the game, it makes you think ahead like chess. I never used the hints and the longest I got stuck on a level was less than 10 tries. This game is definitely worth $1, $2 is kind of a stretch since it is fairly short, but I think it&apos;s still worth it.
B003062NG0|3.0|I though the unanimous praise found here on Amazon meant that Recordings was a winner. It's not. What the praise says is a lot of diehard Porcupine Tree fans miss the good old days and want them back.     The first number is good, I'll give you that.     From then on, this collection of songs meanders through empty rooms, tasting half-baked ideas along the way. It's hard to stay interested.     Then comes a familiar song, Even Less, from Stupid Dream. What's important about this song is the way it makes you realize how lightweight the preceding songs really are, because Even Less sounds far richer and impressive.    Anyway, I bought this because I believed the reviews here, so I offer this warning to give you pause. You won't get your money's worth.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|Poor construction quality.  The 'head' is poorly designed and will not *securely* hold an iphone4 (and I can't see how it'd be any better with any other phone).   The actual grip area is too small to be secure.  The 'arm' you can see in the picture does virtually nothing, it is not spring loaded.  The tripod works, but is very poorly built.  The legs do extend slightly, but there is no locking mechanism and the friction is minimal.  They start to collapse as soon as you set it down.   The ball joint works, but seems very delicate.      I would avoid this product.

B0051GOB26|4.0|The Big Lebowski (Comedy, Crime)<br />Directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen<br />Starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi<br /><br />Universal Studios   1998   119 min   Rated R   Released Aug 16, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: VC-1<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Digital Copy<br />BD-Live<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />The Big Lebowski is essentially about mistaken identity if you care about the plot. Jeffrey Lebowski is known to his friends as The Dude (Bridges) and a gang of criminals pay him a visit thinking that he's another Lebowski who happens to be a millionaire. After they urinate on his rug, he seeks out the millionaire to claim compensation.<br /><br />The millionaire's wife goes missing and the gang asks for a million dollars in ransom. The Dude is chosen as the courier.<br /><br />That's about it. The plot is incidental; this is a movie about a way of life.<br /><br />The Dude hangs out with two of his bowling buddies, Walter (Goodman) and Donny (Buscemi). Walter is a Vietnam veteran who has anger management issues; Donny hardly says a word and is told to shut up every time he tries to make a comment.<br /><br />The Dude is a mellow kind of a guy. He shops in his robe, gets high, and talks like he's permanently stoned. Walter is a mystery to him because he is so easily annoyed. When a competing team puts a toe over the line during a bowling game, Walter pulls out a gun and insists that it is marked down as a zero. It's a league game after all.<br /><br />The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and can be classed as a comedy more than anything, but the style of comedy may be different to the type you are used to. Many of the jokes are clever and subtle, and it's rare for the humor to be aimed too low.<br /><br />Watching The Big Lebowski is an experience. You're never quite sure what it is or where it is going. The plot elements aren't very important, but everything adds up and provides a reason for the characters to do what they do. It's the sort of movie where nothing happens, but you find yourself thinking about it days later.<br /><br />Fargo and No Country for Old Men are exceptional movies from the Coen Brothers, but many fans would argue that The Big Lebowski is better. I'm not among them, but it amuses me and I'm glad to finally own it on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Video Quality 3.5/5<br />Although the Blu-ray is a vast upgrade over the DVD, I'm a little disappointed with the overall look. Colors are much improved and everything looks brighter and cleaner, but the VC-1 presentation could have been better. Fine detail is present in a few scenes, but is lacking for the most part. Faces in particular seem badly defined. It just about earns a passing grade, but don't expect to be dazzled.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track sounds great.

While not their very best work, it deserves a place in your collection. Bridges and Goodman excel in their roles and hold the whole thing together. The Blu-ray presentation enhances the experience, but not quite as much as I had hoped. The packaging is good and there's plenty of behind the scenes information if The Big Lebowski is your kind of film.<br /><br />Overall score 4/5your collection.

030746363X|4.0|My husband loved this book, and I think it was written more to men - although he does address women's issues in it. My husband just related to it more than I did. The information is very interesting, but mostly too difficult for me to adopt in my life. Some tips are great and I will use, but overall, not for me. I do recommend it tough because the research is very interesting and the information is beneficial. I bought it after watching him on Dr. Oz's show, and Dr. Oz recommended it. I got my husband the audio version.
030788743X|5.0|If you are reading this review, you are likely already familiar with the plot of \\"Ready Player One,\\" an adventure set in a dystopian future where a rag-tag group of misfits obsess over nerd culture (80s films, atari games, D&D, etc...) in the hopes of solving an elaborate mystery set in an alternate reality universe. Got it?<br /><br />But here's what I want you to take away from my review: this book is whip-smart, perfectly-paced, sincere, authentic, heartfelt and genuinely scary & funny -- and sometimes at the same time. Or, to boil it down: this book is so much better than it needs to be.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Ready Player One\\" -- so easy to pitch and so interesting to hear -- would likely be enough to sell the book. But first-time novelist Ernest Cline obviously thrilled at perfecting the execution of the book -- each moment, each reference, each twist, each turn -- and thus reading this book is a pure joy. You feel taken care of from jump one, and every person I've lent my copy to has -- like me -- fallen into the book, unable to put it down until it was (satisfyingly) finished.<br /><br />Having a working knowledge of nerd culture is NOT necessary to enjoy this book! Please don't let that aspect of the book scare you. The characters & world, as well as the plotting & pacing, are all inviting & engaging to people whose working knowledge of that world is utterly anemic. That being said, if you are secret fan of John Hughes movies, or old ATARI games, or check BoingBoing daily, or can't bring yourself to shut off a Star Trek episode if it pops up on your TV, I'm sure you'll find even more to love about this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Ready Player One\\" to just about everyone I know. It is a celebration of a book -- an electrifying & thoughtful story filled with heart & fun, and written with the sly smartness & authentic sincerity that I'm sure will be earmark for all Ernest Cline books to come. Excelsior!

However, there is no way around the facts...This is a great video.It does my heart good to see young people with talent and inthusiasim for what they do. Every cast member is perfect for their role. Often forgotten are the backup crew that did a equally great job. The choreography uses the talents perfectly. I think the only thing that has kept this from being \\"bigger\\" is the name, Lermonade Mouth\\". It doesent draw some people that may have been High School Musical fans. In my opinion, this has better storyline and less of the burst into song gimicry. I'm glad a Lemonade Part 2 is in the making.
0671027344|2.0|I was very excited to read The Perks of Being a Wallflower, considering all the great reviews & the talks of an upcoming movie. I finally decided to purchase it for myself & WHAT A MISTAKE. How could so many people like this book? I find the main character, Charlie, to be so unrealistic & due to the authors use of tone & diction the character was far from relatable. The comments, feelings, actions never seemed to make sense and it diminished the character's ability to develop. The sentence structure was never consistent and the weird tangents he used were more than annoying because I didn't think this helped the character's ethos in the slightest. This book is so soft when it comes to issues of high school, drugs, sex, & other teenage issues that I found myself rolling my eyes after each page. It seemed as though the author never experienced any of these issues and just tried to described each situation like how he thought they would be. Overall, I am very disappointed in this book but luckily it only me a few hours to read. Next time I will know better than to purchase an MTV book.
